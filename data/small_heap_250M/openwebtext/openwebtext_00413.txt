Labour MP Simon Danczuk has been suspended by the party after newspaper allegations about his private life.
The Sun alleged he exchanged explicit messages with a 17-year-old girl.
On Twitter, the Rochdale MP said the story was "not entirely accurate" but referred to "an extremely low point" in his life.
He said he apologised unreservedly for his "inappropriate" behaviour, adding: "I was stupid [and] there's no fool like an old fool."
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The general secretary of the Labour Party has today suspended Simon Danczuk's membership of the party, pending an investigation into allegations published in the media today.
"A full investigation will now take place under the authority of the National Executive Committee, which will be responsible for determining any further action."

Mr Danczuk, who separated from his wife earlier this year, has been the MP for Rochdale since 2010.
The backbencher has been a strong critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his predecessor Ed Miliband, and has carried out a high-profile campaign to expose historical child abuse.
In his statement on Twitter, he added: "I'm more saddened that this episode could overshadow the important work we're doing to help Rochdale [and] that's where my focus lies."
Simon Danczuk profile
The Rochdale MP has a reputation as an outspoken backbencher. He has been a thorn in Jeremy Corbyn's side and has described his predecessor Ed Miliband as "one of the worst Labour Party leaders in history".
The 49-year-old is perhaps best known for his campaigning work on historical child sex abuse, having co-authored a book on alleged abuse by former Rochdale MP Cyril Smith and called for action over a missing 1980s dossier about alleged paedophiles at Westminster.
In July, he said he was stepping back from his child abuse campaigning work to seek help for depression, adding that he was "in no doubt" it had taken its toll on his marriage.
As a consequence of his suspension, Mr Danczuk has had the Labour whip withdrawn, meaning he will sit as an independent MP.
Although the girl featured in The Sun was over the age of consent, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the allegations were particularly embarrassing for an MP who had devoted much of his time in recent years to campaigning about child protection.
In interviews, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell both stressed the independence of the National Executive Committee (NEC) investigation.
Corbyn ally and NEC member Ken Livingstone told the BBC people should not jump to conclusions based on Mr Danczuk's suspension.
"We won't be rushing to any judgement," he said.
The party clearly had to investigate the allegations, he said, adding: "The simple fact is that it might not be illegal but a lot of people are going to disapprove of that sort of age gap and that sort of texting, particularly given this is an MP who made the exposure of child abuse a key part of his political career."
If the UFC finally – finally! – gets to make its debut in New York, what should the first fight card include? How about seven title fights, including a middleweight bout between champion Chris Weidman and Luke Rockhold?
With supporters continuing to fight the state's MMA ban, the UFC is gearing up for a possible show, likely at iconic Madison Square Garden in New York City.
This past week, we asked a handful of UFC on FOX 15 fighters, who competed in nearby Newark, N.J., to envision their dream scenario for the first UFC-New York event, which promises to be a big one. In fact, UFC featherweight Max Holloway had one of the most ambitious plans imaginable. And though a biased party, Rockhold had an idea for a West Coast vs. East Coast title fight.
Check out all their answers in the above video.

Wasps are delighted to announce that Fijian international centre Gabiriele (Gaby) Lovobalavu will join the club ahead of the 2017/18 campaign, the club's 150th Anniversary season.
Lovobalavu, who has won 22 caps for his country and represented Fiji in the last three Rugby World Cups (2007, 2011 and 2015), is currently impressing for Bayonne in the Top 14, having joined them from Toulon in 2012.
Lovobalavu will head to Wasps over the summer, when Samoan international centre Alapati Leiua moves to Bristol Rugby, while Scotland centre Nick De Luca has announced he will retire from professional rugby at the end of the season.
Speaking about Wasps' newest international recruit, Young added:
“We're very pleased to have signed another player of Gaby's quality. Gaby's comfortable playing 12 or 13, which will give us more options, particularly during the international period.
“He's got really explosive power onto the ball, as well as good pace and the agility and footwork to beat defenders. He carries really well and has huge physicality and dynamism in defence. We expect his physicality to really complement the pace we already have in our backline.
Looking ahead to the move next season, Gaby Lovobalavu said:
“I have really enjoyed my time with Bayonne and I am excited about the new challenge in England next season. Wasps are a very ambitious club and I was attracted by the attacking rugby they play, which is a pleasure to watch.
“I am excited by the chance to train in a world class environment, with world class players and I'm looking forward to really challenging myself every day, taking myself out of my comfort zone. It will also be great to experience a new culture, a new environment and a new competition. I look forward to getting to know the coaches, my new teammates and the Wasps' supporters and to settling into the town with my family.”
Wasps have this week launched the club's 150th Anniversary Season Membership. For more information visit wasps.co.uk

Alan Pardew is set for a transfer summit with West Bromwich Albion's hierarchy on Friday after confirming his interest in Danny Ings.
Pardew will meet with technical director Nick Hammond later this week to discuss the club's strategy for the January transfer window.
Ings, the Liverpool striker, is on West Brom's radar as Pardew pursues more firepower to boost his struggling team.
The England international has recently returned from a serious knee injury and Albion will join the race to sign him on loan next month, if Liverpool agree to let him out.
“I'd be foolish not to say I don't like Danny Ings because I quite like him,” he said. “It's a shame about his injury – he's had to battle back and everyone wishes him well.
“I haven't even looked at January this week because of the tight schedule of the games.
“But I have seen Nicky Hammond to pencil in a meeting to talk about that this week so maybe on Friday I can give you a bit more of where we're looking and what we're looking at.”
Pardew has revealed that he has spoken with Poland international Grzegorz Krychowiak over his lack of game time.
Krychowiak, a summer loan signing from Paris St-Germain, has been an unused substitute in both Pardew's games since his appointment.
“I think everyone is knocking on the door at the moment because we aren't winning games,” he said. “So if you aren't knocking on the door now we have got a problem.
“He's been ok, he has responded well in training. That's all I can say at this stage.”
Pardew will take his Albion team to Anfield on Wednesday with only one point from his first two games.
Halifax is getting pumped for a UFC smackdown tonight.
Derrick (The Black Beast) Lewis faces Travis (Hapa) Browne in the main event at Scotiabank Centre.
The last time Halifax hosted the event was UFC Fight Night 54 in October of 2014. That drew a crowd of 10,782. Ticket prices range from $48 for the upper back bowl to $183 for floor seats.
Johny (Bigg Rigg) Hendricks makes his middleweight debut Sunday night after a run of problems making 170 pounds. The former welterweight champion lost the belt in 2014.

A pane of glass overlaid with a simple line drawing brings crumbling ruins to life at one of Austria's most famous historical sites, reanimating the partial building near the Open Air Museum Petronell. When a viewer lines up the illustration with the structure, known as Heidentor (Heathen's Gate), the image completes itself in a compelling yet entirely low-tech fashion.
Located just east of Vienna, Carnuntum dates back to the the 1st Century A.D., when Roman soldiers expanded on an existing town 50,000 people to create a military encampment. Between 354 AD and 361 AD a huge triumphal monument was erected next to the camp and city. Contemporary reports suggest that Emperor Constantius II had it built to commemorate his victories.
“When the remains of Carnuntum disappeared after the Migration Period the monument remained as an isolated building in a natural landscape and led Medieval people to believe it was the tomb of a pagan giant. Hence, they called it Heidentor.”
Preserving ancient historical sites is often a balance between stabilization and restoration; fully restoring can enhance the exterior appearance, but is costly and arguably diminishes the authenticity of a ruin. This approach strikes a balance, much like augmented overlays in digital history apps.
Having cornered the central banker market, with its alumni manning key positions at most central banks, Goldman has decided to tip its cards into its next zone of interest: geopolitics, and has done so by hiring none other than the former head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker's predecessor and one-time Nigel Farage nemesis, Jose Manuel Barroso as an advisor and non-executive chairman of its international business.
Barroso served as president of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, from 2004 to 2014 and was prime minister of Portugal from 2002 to 2004.
According to Reuters, Goldman and other banks "are seen as particularly vulnerable to Brexit since they rely on the EU's "passporting" regime that allows them to offer services across the bloc while basing most of their staff and operations in the UK. Banks have warned that if their British outposts lose their "passports" they will have to move some employees and business units to alternative bases in the EU." Whether this means that Goldman is merely seeking an influential lobbying voice when it comes to getting an exemption from a post-Brexit fallout, or is simply seeking to expand its influence over all of Europe, remains unclear. After all it is not as if Goldman's European ambitions are unknown. As we have shown before, Goldman is already the undisputed "Master of the Eurozone" courtesy of strategy placements in all key decision-making venues.
Goldman Sachs International, which Barroso will chair, is headquartered in London and of its roughly 6,000 staff fewer than 1,000 are based outside Britain.
Barroso is credited with helping the euro zone survive the 2009-13 debt crisis by establishing a financial rescue fund, enacting stricter budget rules and tightening financial regulation. He was also a signatory to the Lisbon Treaty that revamped the bloc's complex institutions after French and Dutch voters rejected a European constitution.
Barroso will help the firm as it advises clients on dealing with the ensuing "challenging and uncertain economic and market environment," Goldman Sachs International co-chiefs Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde said in the statement.
Goldman's full press release is below:
This article is about the Merrie Melodies cartoon. For the video game, see Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck
Duck Amuck is an American surreal animated cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons. The short film was released in early 1953 by The Vitaphone Corporation, the short subject division of Warner Bros., as part of the Merrie Melodies series. It stars Daffy Duck, who is tormented by a seemingly sadistic, initially unseen animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape, much to Daffy's aggravation and rage. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny.
In 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, losing only to What's Opera, Doc?, also made by Chuck Jones and also written by Michael Maltese. It has been inducted into the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
The short was included on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 DVD box set (with optional audio commentary by Michael Barrier), The Essential Daffy Duck DVD box set, and the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1 Blu-ray box set. The short inspired the 2007 Nintendo DS game Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck.
Plot [ edit ]
The cartoon's title sequence and opening scene suggest Daffy Duck is to star as a musketeer, and he appears, boldly engaging in an action scene with a fencing foil. As he thrusts the foil and advances, the background abruptly disappears, leaving a plain white screen. Confused by this, Daffy turns to the animator and asks him to complete the scenery. However, instead of a castle from the original scene, the animator paints a farm scene. Daffy returns and starts to repeat his musketeer opening, but quickly notices the different background. He walks off screen and returns dressed as a farmer, while singing a version of "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", but a few seconds later, the scene segues into an Arctic backdrop; Daffy changes into winter clothes and skies through the snow (to "Jingle Bells") and into a Hawaiian setting. Still dutifully, but impatiently, going through the changes, Daffy returns in Hawaiian garb. After a couple of bars of "Aloha 'Oe (Farewell To Thee)" on ukulele, Daffy ends up back in the plain white background.
While Daffy tries to reason with the animator that cartoons should have scenery, he becomes completely erased and, upon asking where he is, he gets redrawn as a cowboy with a guitar. Daffy tries to play it but there is nothing but silence. Using a sign, he requests sound and is granted various non-guitar sound effects. Daffy also finds himself generating random sound effects when he tries to speak, and finally regains his voice when he becomes enraged and shouts angrily at the animator. ("AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED IN ALL MY LIFE!")
Regaining his composure, Daffy demands some new scenery and is given an amateurish line-art cityscape background in pencil. Daffy asks for color, prompting the animator to slap various colors and patterns all over him ("NOT ME, YOU SLOP ARTIST!!"). All but Daffy's face is erased and, upon asking where the rest of him has gone, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched animal with a "screwball" flag on its tail. As Daffy walks off (wondering to himself if he weren't living up to his contract and if he hasn't been keeping himself trim), he becomes aware of not feeling quite like himself; the animator creates a mirror and, upon seeing his hideous self, Daffy once again bursts out in anger ("EEK! You know better than that!"). Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn this time as a sailor. He begins to sing "The Song of the Marines" as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but draws nothing under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the island. When he requests a closeup, the screen contracts around him, at which he screams, and the camera zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes. He walks away muttering a sarcastic thanks to the animator.
As Daffy tries once again to negotiate with the animator to have an understanding, the screen frame falls on him. After failing to keep the frame up with a stick, Daffy goes ballistic and rips apart the black background. Now at the end of his rope, Daffy demands, "Let's get this picture started", so the camera does an iris-out to black, followed by a "The End" slide, which a frustrated Daffy pushes off camera, screaming, "NO, NO!" as he does so. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and (hoping, against hope, that nothing further will happen) begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on the screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is erased just as the other throws a punch.
The animator then turns Daffy into a pilot and draws him into an airplane. The duck excitedly flies around until a mountain is drawn in his path. The plane crashes off-screen, leaving Daffy with nothing but the plane's steering wheel and windshield. He "bails" out of the plane's remains and floats downward with his parachute which is replaced with an anvil. Crashing to the ground, a disoriented Daffy hammers the anvil while dizzily reciting "The Village Blacksmith".[citation needed] The animator changes the anvil into an artillery shell which explodes after a few hammer strikes. Daffy finally snaps and angrily demands that the animator reveal himself; they do, but not before drawing a door around Daffy and closing it on him. The camera pulls back and reveals the guilty party to be Bugs Bunny at a drawing table, who turns around and says to the audience: "Ain't I a stinker?"

History [ edit ]
Duck Amuck. A scene from
According to director Chuck Jones, this film demonstrated for the first time that animation can create characters with a recognizable personality, independent of their appearance, milieu, or voice. Although Bugs Bunny (who declares "Ain't I a stinker?") is revealed to be the unseen animator, Jones comments that the ending was just for comedic value: Jones (the director) is speaking to the audience directly, asking "Who is Daffy Duck anyway? Would you recognize him if I did this to him? What if he didn't live in the woods? Didn't live anywhere? What if he had no voice? No face? What if he wasn't even a duck anymore?" In all cases, Daffy is still Daffy; not all cartoon characters can claim such distinctive personality.
Duck Amuck is included in the compilation film The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, along with other Chuck Jones cartoons including What's Opera, Doc?
Mel Blanc performed the voices. It was directed by Chuck Jones with a story by Michael Maltese. The film contains many examples of self-referential humor, breaking the fourth wall.
In 1999 the film was deemed "culturally significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. This was the second of three animated shorts by Jones to receive this honor (the others are 1957's What's Opera, Doc? and 1955's One Froggy Evening). Jones has the distinction of being the only director (as of 2006 ) with three animated shorts in the registry.
The cartoon's plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, Rabbit Rampage (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd). A similar plot was also included in the episode "Duck's Reflucks" of Baby Looney Tunes, in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the New Looney Tunes episode "One Carroter in Search of an Artist" (for this reason, this version has garnered the alternative name "Rabbit Rampage II" among series fans) with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen, the victim is Bugs Bunny and the animator is Daffy Duck.
In issue #94 of the Looney Tunes comic, Bugs Bunny gets his back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from Duck Twacy in Who Killed Daffy Duck," a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in Moby Dick (the story's running gag). After this, Bugs comments, "Eh, dis guy needs a new agent."

Under permanent observation
by Rolf Gössner
Since 1970, I have been under uninterrupted observation and investigation for nearly four decades by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (OPC), the domestic secret service, which is difficult to monitor and has an anti-communist character. They watched me as a law student and later throughout my working life, in all my professional and voluntary roles - as a commentator on current affairs, as a lawyer, a parliamentary adviser, a board member of the International League for Human Rights, co-editor of the yearly Report on Constitutional Rights and of the fortnightly Ossietzky, and as a member of the jury awarding the negative prize the 'Big Brother Award'.
In personal files and in written documents, the OPC, from its selective and ideologically motivated perspective, created a picture of my life that was torn from its contemporary context, and constructed abstruse accusations, arguing in a positively inquisitorial manner. This constitutes an exemplary case, presenting German society with the urgent question of what all this signifies for freedom of opinion and of the press, for professional confidentiality and protection of sources, and for openness and readiness for dialogue in this country. This case is of course not unique, but just one of many throughout the history of the Federal Republic, some with grave consequences. After the official end of the Cold War, too, and up to the present, parties, trade unions and political organizations have been spied on and infiltrated.
What does the OPC actually accuse me of? Initially it held both my professional and unpaid, voluntary contacts with groups that were supposedly 'extremist left-wing' or 'under extremist left-wing influence' against me. This includes political parties like the German Communist Party, organizations like the legal assistance group 'Red Assistance' and the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime, but also periodicals such as Demokratie und Recht [Democracy and Law]; Blätter füe deutsche und internationale Politik [Pages for German and International Politics]; Geheim [Secret]; Junge Welt [Young World]; and Neues Deutschland [New Germany], in which (alongside many other media) I have published or been interviewed. The OPC even collected accounts on me and my books and held them against me if they appeared in the above-mentioned incriminated media. They were also interested in remarks I made in lectures or discussions, both at public events and in closed meetings. In doing so, the OPC unjustifiably identified me with the media in which I published, with the organizers of lectures I gave or discussions I took part in, and with my clients whom I advised.
It wasn't what I wrote or said that was decisive for the OPC, but the political milieu in which it took place, imputing to me a sort of 'guilt by contact', from which it deduced a 'sustained support' of such associations and press publications, which, although not banned, are considered to be 'extremist left-wing', and whose status I, as a 'prominent jurist', am alleged to have enhanced, lending them respectability.
Over time, the OPC gradually escalated its accusations against me, alleging, for example, that I was not just a supporter but sometimes also a member of 'extremist left-wing associations', namely the Social Democratic / Socialist Higher Education Association, and the editorial board of the magazine Geheim [Secret], which criticizes the secret services. In their most recent escalation, the OPC suspects what I have written and said of being hostile to the constitution. With my 'defamatory' criticism of German security policy, the security organizations, and especially of the OPC, as well as my criticism of the ban on the German Communist Party and the bans of left-wingers from certain professions (which according to the official version never existed), I wanted -according to the tenor of the OPC - to render the state defenceless and deliver it into the hands of 'extremist left-wing' endeavours and revolutionary upheaval. I am also accused of failing to dissociate myself from the DDR [the former East Germany] and its security service, from the USSR, the gulag and all the crimes of communism, while criticizing the West in a one-sided fashion.
I learnt that I was under surveillance because in 1996 I applied to the OPC for information about the data it had stored about me. In response I received a personal dossier with a list of sins - articles, interviews and speeches in the wrong periodicals or at the wrong events - going back to 1970. I repeated my request about every two years in order to see the latest list of sins, and it was promptly sent to me.
Since the surveillance continued, in 2005 I filed a suit against the German Federal Republic in the Cologne administrative court in order to view the totality of my personal files, as well as to have the surveillance, extending over decades, declared illegal. Five years have passed and an end to the case is not in sight - but some things have happened. The court ordered the OPC to present all my personal files from 1970 up to 2007, and this has been done - but mostly with parts of the text blacked out. Of all of the over 2000 pages of files presented to me, around 1750 are totally or partially illegible or have been manipulated or not presented at all - in other words around 85%; only 15% are openly and completely legible. The keeping secret of entire portions of the files is due to extensive blocking orders by the ministry of the interior as the highest supervisory authority over the OPC. The reason given was that if their content were to become known, that could 'cause disadvantages to the Federal Republic or to a Land [province]'; the OPC's ability to function would be adversely affected if hidden ways of working and operational interests were to become known; while the prime reason for maintaining of secrecy is the protection of sources of information, revealing whose identity could lead to 'endangering the life, health or freedom' of informants or OPC employees.
I brought a legal action in the federal administrative court against this refusal to reveal files, in order that the blocking orders and secrecy be examined in in camera proceedings (secret proceedings which are problematic from the perspective of a state based on the rule of law). These hearings, held without my participation, concluded that these portions of the files should continue to be kept secret.
Despite this, the remaining collection of documents is quite revealing. I was amazed at how many government agencies, other offices and individuals had been denunciatory informants about me to the OPC, and how many informer's reports must have been written about my lectures and other activities.
Around the end of 2008, a few days before the first day set for the hearing of my case by the Cologne administrative court, the OPC surprisingly informed the court that 'after recent examination', surveillance of me by the interior ministry and the OPC had been ended and the data collected about me were ready for deletion and were blocked with immediate effect until the end of the legal proceedings. It remains to be seen whether this declaration can be believed - only a few months previously, the OPC had insisted that continued surveillance of me was necessary, even following the enquiry by the presiding administrative judge as to whether my recent election as deputy judge in the Bremen state court didn't alter this. No, the OPC declared, in certain circumstances even judges had to be kept under surveillance.
One of the reasons given why there was suddenly no longer any need to keep me under surveillance was most interesting: it was said that the threat situation in Germany had changed, and scarce resources now had to be devoted to other priorities. The OPC also claimed that I no longer frequented 'extremist left wing' circles to the same extent. This is in fact untrue, and my writings too have, I hope, not become any more innocuous.
Under surveillance, I have always had to fear that my often delicate researches and my contacts with informants would be spied upon and my informants endangered. Indeed, I have repeatedly found that informants from the police or security services have been investigated and observed. In some cases I have therefore had to avoid or break off contacts. As a lawyer, too, I had to take account of possible investigation by the security services. Since my surveillance by the secret services could no longer be kept secret, I found it necessary to inform my clients of it. Some of them withdrew their cases from me. How many may have never sought contact with me in the first place, I am unable to judge. In any case, professional secrecy and protection of information could not always be guaranteed, and the relationship of trust between lawyer and client, as well as between journalist and informant, which are protected by the constitution, were damaged, and my professional activity seriously affected.
In my view, in this dispute two different political cultures are in collision: on the one hand the culture (or rather lack of culture) of spying, stigmatization and exclusion in the name of security and the wellbeing of the state, and on the other the culture of democratic transparency and of open and critical dialogue in the name of democracy and freedom that I have sought and cultivated in all my professional and voluntary activities, often against the mainstream and without excessively great political fears with respect to establishing contacts, including those with groups and individuals that, while not banned, are also under observation by the OPC and that, for that reason alone, are regarded as outlaws in the eyes of many - for example, particular communist and Kurdish groups, Islamic communities and other immigrants that have become subject to blanket suspicion since the advent of the state war on terror.

Aren't we glad we live in an age where producers understand the value of making-of documentaries? Harry Potter producers David Heyman and David Barron have revealed to MTV News that British filmmaker Morgan Matthews (The Fallen) captured the process of shooting both parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, documenting both the challenges of wrapping the franchise and the toll it took on cast and crew (as well as Daniel Radcliffe's penchant for betting on horses, poorly). A rep for Warner Bros. tells EW no decision has been made on where the documentary, which is not yet finished, will end up.
What are you hoping Matthews' cameras captured? Judging by how strong a reaction I've had to seeing Hogwarts under attack, I'd want to see the cast's reaction to stepping onto a set that looks like a war film for the first time. And, of course, I'd love to see how many of the cast members who weren't involved in Harry's fateful forest walk wanted to be there for the filming of it. In my dreams, it's like my favorite scene from Christopher Guest's A Mighty Wind, when the other folk groups head to the wings of the stage to see how Mitch & Mickey handle the kiss in “The Kiss at the End of the Rainbow.” If it was a closed set, I'd want to see who Radcliffe talked to afterward. Your turn.

This post is excerpted from Jeremy Rifkin's new book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism, published today by Palgrave Macmillan.
The capitalist era is passing... not quickly, but inevitably. A new economic paradigm -- the Collaborative Commons -- is rising in its wake that will transform our way of life. We are already witnessing the emergence of a hybrid economy, part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons. The two economic systems often work in tandem and sometimes compete. They are finding synergies along each other's perimeters, where they can add value to one another, while benefiting themselves. At other times, they are deeply adversarial, each attempting to absorb or replace the other.
Although the indicators of the great transformation to a new economic system are still soft and largely anecdotal, the Collaborative Commons are ascendant and, by 2050, it will likely settle in as the primary arbiter of economic life in most of the world. An increasingly streamlined and savvy capitalist system will continue to soldier on at the edges of the new economy, finding sufficient vulnerabilities to exploit, primarily as an aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to flourish as a powerful niche player in the new economic era, but it will no longer reign.
What's undermining the capitalist system is the dramatic success of the very operating assumptions that govern it. At the heart of capitalism there lies a contradiction in the driving mechanism that has propelled it ever upward to commanding heights, but now is speeding it to its death: the inherent dynamism of competitive markets that drives productivity up and marginal costs down, enabling businesses to reduce the price of their goods and services in order to win over consumers and market share. (Marginal cost is the cost of producing additional units of a good or service, if fixed costs are not counted.) While economists have always welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the possibility of a technological revolution that might bring marginal costs to near zero, making goods and services priceless, nearly free, and abundant, and no longer subject to market forces.
The near zero marginal cost phenomenon has already wreaked havoc on the entertainment, communications, and publishing industries, as more and more information is being made available nearly free to billions of people. Today, more than forty percent of the human race is producing its own music, videos, news, and knowledge on relatively cheap cellphones and computers and sharing it at near zero marginal cost in a collaborative networked world. And now the zero marginal cost revolution is beginning to affect other commercial sectors, including renewable energy, 3D printing in manufacturing, and online higher education. There are already millions of "prosumers" -- consumers who have become their own producers -- generating their own green electricity at near zero marginal cost around the world. It's estimated that around 100,000 hobbyists are using open source software and recycled plastic feedstock to manufacture their own 3D printed goods at nearly zero marginal cost. Meanwhile, six million students are currently enrolled in free Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that operate at near zero marginal cost and are taught by some of the most distinguished professors in the world, and receiving college credits.
The reluctance to come to grips with near zero marginal cost is understandable.
Many, though not all, of the old guard in the commercial arena can't imagine how economic life would proceed in a world where most goods and services are nearly free, profit is defunct, property is meaningless, and the market is superfluous. What then?
A powerful new technology platform is emerging with the potential of reducing marginal costs across large sectors of the capitalist economy, with far reaching implications for society in the first half of the 21st Century. The Communications Internet is converging with the fledgling Energy Internet and Logistics Internet in a seamless twenty-first-century intelligent infrastructure -- the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT will connect every thing with everyone in an integrated global network. People, machines, natural resources, production lines, logistics networks, the electricity grid, consumption habits, recycling flows, and virtually every other aspect of economic and social life will be linked via sensors and software to the IoT platform, continually feeding Big Data to every node -- businesses, homes, vehicles -- moment to moment, in real time. Anyone will be able to access the IoT and use Big Data and analytics to develop predictive algorithms that can dramatically increase productivity and reduce the marginal cost of producing and delivering a full range of physical goods and services to near zero just like we now do with information goods.
Lost in all of the excitement over the prospect of the Internet of Things is that connecting everyone and everything in a global network driven by extreme productivity moves us ever faster toward an era of nearly free goods and services and, with it, the shrinking of capitalism in the next half century. The question is what kind of economic system would we need to organize economic activity that is nearly free and shareable?
We are so used to thinking of the capitalist market and government as the only two means of organizing economic life that we overlook the other organizing model in our midst that we depend on daily to deliver a range of goods and services that neither market nor government provides. The Commons predate both the capitalist market and representative government and is the oldest form of institutionalized, self-managed activity in the world.
The contemporary Commons are where billions of people engage in the deeply social aspects of life. It is made up of literally millions of self-managed, mostly democratically run organizations, including educational institutions, healthcare organizations, charities, religious bodies, arts and cultural groups, amateur sports clubs, producer and consumer cooperatives, credit unions, advocacy groups, and a near endless list of other formal and informal institutions that generate the social capital of society.
Currently, the social Commons are growing faster than the market economy in many countries around the world. Still, because what the social Commons create is largely of social value, not pecuniary value, it is often dismissed by economists. Nonetheless, the social economy is an impressive force. According to a survey of 40 nations, the nonprofit Commons accounts for $2.2 trillion in operating expenditures. In eight countries surveyed--including the United States, Canada, Japan, and France--the nonprofit sector makes up, on average, 5 percent of the GDP. In the US, Canada, and the UK, the nonprofit sector already exceeds 10% of the workforce.
While the capitalist market is based on self-interest and driven by material gain, the social Commons are motivated by collaborative interests and driven by a deep desire to connect with others and share. If the former defends property rights, caveat emptor, and the search for autonomy, the latter promotes open-source innovation, transparency, and the search for community.
What makes the Commons more relevant today than at any other time in its long history is that we are now erecting a high-tech global technology platform whose defining characteristics potentially optimize the very values and operational principles that animate this age-old institution. The IoT is the technological "soul mate" of an emerging Collaborative Common. The new infrastructure is configured to be distributed in nature in order to facilitate collaboration and the search for synergies, making it an ideal technological framework for advancing the social economy. The operating logic of the IoT is to optimize lateral peer production, universal access, and inclusion, the same sensibilities that are critical to the nurturing and creation of social capital in the civil society. The very purpose of the new technology platform is to encourage a sharing culture, which is what the Commons are all about. It is these design features of the IoT that bring
the social Commons out of the shadows, giving it a high-tech platform to become the dominant economic paradigm of the twenty-first century.
The Collaborative Commons is already profoundly impacting economic life. Markets are beginning to give way to networks, ownership is becoming less important than access, and the traditional dream of rags to riches is being supplanted by a new dream of a sustainable quality of life.
Hundreds of millions of people are transferring bits and pieces of their economic life from capitalist markets to the global Collaborative Commons. Prosumers are not only producing and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy and 3D-printed goods at near zero marginal cost and enrolling in massive open online college courses for nearly free, on the Collaborative Commons. They are also sharing cars, homes, clothes, tools, toys, and countless other items with one another via social media sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, and cooperatives, at low or near zero marginal cost. An increasing number of people are collaborating in "patient-driven" health-care networks to improve diagnoses and find new treatments and cures for diseases, again at near zero marginal cost. And young social entrepreneurs are establishing socially responsible businesses, crowdfunding new enterprises, and even creating alternative social currencies in the new economy. The result is that "exchange value" in the marketplace is increasingly being replaced by "shareable value" on the Collaborative Commons.
In the unfolding struggle between the exchange economy and the sharing economy, most economists argue that if everything were nearly free, there would be no incentive to innovate and bring new goods and services to the fore because inventors and entrepreneurs would have no way to recoup their up-front costs. Yet millions of prosumers are freely collaborating in social Commons, creating new IT and software, new forms of entertainment, new learning tools, new media outlets, new green energies, new 3D-printed manufactured products, new peer-to-peer health-research initiatives, and new nonprofit social entrepreneurial business ventures, using open-source legal agreements freed up from intellectual property restraints. The upshot is a surge in creativity that is at least equal to the great innovative thrusts experienced by the capitalist market economy in the twentieth century.
While the capitalist market is not likely to disappear, it will no longer exclusively define the economic agenda for civilization. There will still be goods and services whose marginal costs are high enough to warrant their exchange in markets and sufficient profit to ensure a return on investment. But in a world in which more things are potentially nearly free and shareable, social capital is going to play a far more significant role than financial capital, and economic life is increasingly going to take place on a Collaborative Common.

North Wales Police are quite happy to assert that the law is what a police constable says it is – as opposed to what is written in statute. This is backed up by a polite note from their Press Department, and what appears to be a slightly less polite piece of online blogging from the Police Constable whose public behaviour raised this issue in the first place.
First the official response. Last week, El Reg wrote up the story of how a Motorcycle News (MCN) reporter attempted to take photos of a car identified by one of its occupants as a firearms vehicle. According to the police constable involved, he "would not be happy" with such a photograph being taken – because of its special status.
Steve Farrell, a reporter for MCN, can be heard repeatedly asking the police constable to explain what legal powers he has for preventing him from taking such a photograph - and the police officer can be heard repeatedly ignoring the question. Then, when Farrell takes a photograph, the police constable allegedly snatches the camera from his hands in order to view the picture.
It is very likely that this last action was unlawful, and we have asked North Wales Police to justify this action. Specifically, we asked about its legality. We forwarded a link to some detailed questions last week, and followed up with two key questions on Monday:
These were:
- What legal powers does a police officer have to stop someone taking a photograph in these circumstances?
- Does North Wales believe that grabbing a camera is a lawful act?
The response we received to our original questions came from a Superintendent Shaw, who wrote: "The officer had valid operational concerns about the vehicle being identified via the media and endeavoured to explain his concerns. Given those valid concerns the officer had to be guarded in the explanation he provided at the time. The officer did not object to being photographed and throughout sought the journalist's cooperation."
This appears to be the police equivalent of a public immunity defence, insofar as the Superintendent hints at the police officer having the power to act as he did – but that for reasons of operational concern, he needed to be guarded in any explanation he gave of the law. Again, it is not an answer to any of the key questions in respect of the legality or otherwise of the police officer's actions.
Meanwhile, the saga took a new and possibly career-suicidal turn at the weekend, as an individual purporting to be the police constable in question posted a series of comments on the MCN page containing the original story and let slip a few indelicate observations about attitudes to policing in North Wales.
The individual, posting under the username plasma10, writes: "if someone continues to do something when you've asked them politely not to several times then unfortunately a harder stance has to be taken".
The poster then goes on to add that the entire interaction had been misrepresented by the MCN journalist only making available a part of the recording of the event. He claims to have no axe to grind as far as motorcyclists are concerned, explaining that he himself is an avid biker.
He also adds, very clearly, that he is not a police spokesperson, and has not been asked to post the comments in question by his superiors.
A spokesperson for North Wales Police said: "Irrespective of whether or not the person commenting on the forum is a police officer, they make it clear that the views expressed are their personal views and not those of North Wales Police. "
A spokesman for MCN says they cannot confirm or deny any speculation in this regard. ®
G8 threatens North Korea sanctions BelfastTelegraph.co.uk North Korea has been warned it faces fresh sanctions if it goes ahead with a predicted missile test in the escalating nuclear stand-off with its neighbours and their Western allies. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/g8-threatens-north-korea-sanctions-29188655.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article29188654.ece/56c6c/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_N0095451365645332770A_I1

North Korea has been warned it faces fresh sanctions if it goes ahead with a predicted missile test in the escalating nuclear stand-off with its neighbours and their Western allies.
Following talks in London of foreign ministers from the G8 industrialised nations, Foreign Secretary William Hague said they had committed themselves to "further significant measures" if the test went ahead.
"Clearly what we are talking about is in the field of sanctions. We would discuss such measures at the UN Security Council," said Mr Hague.
In the final communique, the ministers condemned in the "strongest possible terms" Pyongyang's continuing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in defiance of Security Council resolutions.
They warned the regime's "aggressive rhetoric" would only serve to deepen the country's isolation and urged it to join "credible and authentic multilateral talks" on denuclearisation.
Following the talks at Lancaster House, US Secretary of State John Kerry headed off to the region for talks with key allies including South Korea.
In the latest ratcheting up of its rhetoric, North Korea said "powerful striking means" had been put on standby for a missile launch "and the co-ordinates of targets put into the warheads".
Parents called for help after one-year-old girl fell ill hundreds of miles from Mexican coast during round-the-world sailing trip
A US navy vessel has rescued a family with a sick one-year-old child from a damaged boat hundreds of miles off the Mexican coast and is heading to San Diego to take the girl for medical treatment.
The girl, her parents and three-year-old sister were helped on to an inflatable raft and then taken aboard the USS Vandegrift, where the ill toddler was in a stable condition, the US Coast Guard said.
Charlotte and Eric Kaufman were two weeks into their trip to sail the world when their daughter Lyra developed a fever and a rash covering most of her body.
Their 36-foot boat Rebel Heart lost steering and communication abilities about 900 miles off Mexico. They sent a satellite call for help to the coastguard on Thursday.
A California Air National Guard crew parachuted into the water and reached the boat on Thursday night. The crew stabilised the girl and stayed with her until the ship arrived.
Lyra had suffered salmonella poisoning before the family set out, but doctors had given her a clean bill of health to travel, her aunt Sariah Kay English said.
English initially was in daily email contact with the family but realised something was wrong when the communication stopped several days ago. English said she was told the vessel took on water every time the motor was turned on.
When her sister first mentioned plans to sail with two young children, English recalled, "I thought it was nuts."
But English said the couple were always careful. Eric Kaufman is a coastguard-licensed captain who introduced sailing to his future wife during one of their early dates.
"They were not going into this blind. I knew they were doing this wisely," English said. The couple made a network of friends who travelled around the globe with children, and always stocked the boat with more food than they needed.
"They were very overcautious. They're not new at sailing." Unfortunately, she said, "sickness sometimes happens".
O Doctor! my Doctor! you have finally met your end;
River Song has killed our saviour; the astronaut killed our friend;
While Amy weeps, the worlds keeps turning, never caring,
For they know not the price you bought, with death both grim and daring.
But O heart! heart! heart!
O the stunning flash of green,
And then the Doctor lay
Dead, where life had been.
O Doctor! my Doctor! awake to a fiery grave;
Awake - for we cannot leave you - for the world knows not your name;
For Time Lord is but rare and lonely - for your work is not yet done;
For we call to you, your broken friends, as we light your life ablaze;
Here Doctor! dear Time Lord!
This man who was once so keen
To save the world, now
Dead, where life had been.
My Doctor does not answer yet, though in time he will;
Our Time Lord does not know our pain, but he has known his fill;
The TARDIS weeps for her great man, and yet he is alive;
For crossing timelines, there is he, and now we see him thrive.
But we cannot forget his death
Or mourn what we have seen,
And now we wonder how he was
Dead, where life had been.
Esteban Gutierrez says he won't change his approach to interpreting blue flags now he knows the limits of what is and is not allowed when having to let leading cars pass him.
The Haas driver has become 'a punching ball' according to team principal Gunther Steiner after the Mexican has been involved in a number of blue flag incidents which sparked up when Lewis Hamilton gestured angrily at Gutierrez for 'blocking' while he was leading the Hungarian Grand Prix.
Gutierrez was under the spotlight a race later in Germany with Daniel Ricciardo in a similar incident before he was given a grid penalty at the Belgian Grand Prix for touring on the racing line at the top of Eau Rouge which forced Pascal Wehrlein on to the grass, but Haas insists the error was a 'distracted' engineer rather than the driver.
In Singapore Gutierrez came under fire from Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff for impeding Nico Rosberg as he was being caught by Ricciardo in the closing stages of the race.
READ: Steiner dismisses Wolff over latest Gutierrez backlash
The Haas driver refuted the idea he had continually been causing trouble and says in the future he will stick to the limits as tightly as possible in the same way he feels Wolff is pressuring the race stewards on the issue.
"The same way that Toto is trying the list of possible blue flag drivers and trying to put pressure on the FIA to be stricter on that and to lose less time, I'm trying to lose the least time possible within the rules and without affecting anyone," Gutierrez said. "So the same thing that he is doing I am doing it as well.
"In Budapest I went a bit too far, and I know where the limit is, so I'm playing with the line. Obviously every team principal wants their driver to be as quick as possible, so that's what I will do and I want it for myself as well because I was fighting for a position.
"I think it was spot on [in Singapore]. I think I didn't affect anyone, I didn't lose time myself and I finished in front of Felipe, so that was the target I was pushing like you have no idea the whole race.
"When you get a blue flag you want to lose the least time possible. I know that Toto said that I was cruising around, so obviously he hasn't driven a Formula 1 car, because it wasn't the case."

A lawyer representing the family of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook has questioned accounts of the mass shooting Wednesday morning that left 14 people dead, using Sandy Hook trutherism to support his theory.
Attorney David Chesley expressed skepticism at the accuracy of information released by the police and FBI after Farook and his Pakistan-born wife Tashfeen Malik gunned down 14 people at the Inland Regional Center before they were killed in a shootout with police, the Daily Mail reported.
“There were a lot of questions drawn with Sandy Hook and whether or not that was a real incident or not,” Mr. Chesley told reporters alongside family attorney Mohammad Abuershaid.
“Obviously, these things were found there, how they got there we don't know,” Mr. Chesley said of the nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition and a dozen pipe bombs that police said they found at the couple's home.
Wednesday's shooting in San Bernardino is the deadliest in the U.S. since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where Adam Lanza, 20, gunned down 20 children and six teachers before shooting himself to death.
Asked directly if he doubted the events of Sandy Hook, Mr. Chesley said, “There has been a lot speculation about it is all I would say,” the Daily Mail reported.
“There's a lot of people that said it happened but hasn't happened in the way that it was purported to have taken place,” he said. “There's no question that incidents have taken place and evidence was found but we just question some of that.
“There is a lot of motivation at this time to emphasize or create incidents that will cause gun control or prejudice or hatred toward the Muslim community,” he said.

The guy who once wrestled for a living, then blew away the pundits by getting elected governor of Minnesota, has a new gig — on Russian state television.
“I am working for the enemy of mainstream media now,” Jesse Ventura said of “The World According to Jesse,” a commentary show airing Fridays beginning this month on RT America, the Washington, D.C., arm of the international network RT. Formerly known as Russia Today, RT is funded by the Russian government and says it brings “the Russian view on global news.”
A promo for the show features Ventura on a motorcycle, ponytail flapping in the breeze as he cruises down a mountain-lined highway.
“It's called the feeling of freedom,” Ventura's voice echoes. “Welcome to my world; come along for the ride.”
Ventura was elected as an independent and remains so. He says he voted for the Green Party's Jill Stein last year. And he can be expected to use his program to skewer both major political parties, the news media, President Donald Trump and America's military industrial complex.
One thing Ventura is unlikely to do: criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ventura doesn't consider that to be the point of the show, although he said he has assurances from RT that he will not be censored.
The ex-governor says he's not concerned about RT's reputation as a propaganda outlet.
“I have total artistic control and I can talk about anything I want,” he said. “We're more interested in talking about our country. I didn't join RT to report on Russia.”
A review of more than 50 recent headlines that mention Putin on the RT website did not include a single story that appeared to be critical of the Russian leader. Ventura shrugs it off. “Maybe nobody's interested in talking about Putin on RT America,” he says.
Ventura won't be the first U.S. personality on RT. Ed Schultz, a liberal commentator formerly with MSNBC, also hosts a show. But his gravitation to RT is no accident. His son, Ty, has worked for the network for years, as a producer and now co-host of “Watching the Hawks,” a television show that examines media, pop culture and politics.
Many have criticized RT. Columbia Journalism Review called it “an extension of [Putin's] confrontational foreign policy” and “provocative just for the sake of being provocative.” In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea, RT America anchor Liz Wahl resigned on air, saying she cannot be part of a network “that whitewashes the actions of Putin.”
An RT spokesperson did not respond Wednesday afternoon to a request for comment on Ventura's employment.
While RT claims 800 million viewers, most U.S. cable networks don't carry it, so most viewers will have to watch Ventura's show on RT's website.
The former governor had a show, “Off the Grid,” on Ora TV, an online TV network, but he said new managers demanded last year he takes a pay cut. He refused and signed a contract with RT to do 16 shows in 2017 and 16 more in 2018.
Ventura is loyal to the network in part because he and his wife, Terry, lost his union health insurance in 2016 with the Screen Actors Guild-AFTRA because he was doing too little union-related work.
“I was in a panic,” he recalled. He called RT, where he already had a contract, and the network enrolled him in a health insurance plan in 10 days. “Russian Television saved my wife and I,” he said.
During lunch of a grilled cheese sandwich and a side of coleslaw at a White Bear Lake restaurant, Ventura said he continues to pride himself on being in top condition. He spends hours lifting weights and exercising on an elliptical machine. He weighs 220 pounds, he says, less than he did when he finished his tour of duty in the Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War.
Ventura says he was flown to Moscow by RT to attend the 10th anniversary of the network in December 2015. The featured speaker was Putin. This appears to have been the same dinner attended by Michael Flynn, Trump's short-lived national security adviser who was forced to resign after 24 days in part due to his communications with the Russian ambassador. Flynn's resignation is part of growing scrutiny into Russia's influence on the 2016 election.
Ventura said he does not know Flynn and did not see him at the event.
He toured the network station in Moscow, he said, and spoke with five or six Americans employed by RT.
“Every one of them said it's the best job [they'd] ever had in the industry,” he said.
But another reason Ventura has wound up on Russian television is his disdain for mainstream media. Ventura often tangled with reporters who covered him at the Capitol and called them “media jackals.”
He won a defamation suit in federal court in St. Paul in 2014, then saw it overturned by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016, which ruled that a $1.3 million jury award for “unjust enrichment” was an improper application of Minnesota law. Ventura blames the media for the overturning of the verdict, saying the appeals court was swayed by many major news organizations including the New York Times and CNN, which signed an amicus brief that said unjust enrichment would set a dangerous precedent. (The Star Tribune did not sign on to the brief.)
“They control what people think,” he said. “Now they can lie to their hearts' content.”
The appeals court also rejected the St. Paul jury's $500,000 award for defamation, saying improper arguments were used. The case will go to a second trial if settlement negotiations fail.
“You're the ones that caused us to have a second trial,” he told a reporter.
Ventura says he spent $1 million on lawyers and court fees. He says he planned to use that money for retirement, which is why he needs to work for Russian TV.
“I am avoiding our national media,” Ventura says with a grin. “I am going international.”

Denver Chief Judge Michael Martinez on Friday delivered sharp criticism of the District Attorney's Office, but said he did not have grounds to order the prosecution of a Denver Sheriff Department deputy who slammed a shackled inmate into a courthouse wall.
Deputy Brady Lovingier should have been charged with third-degree assault in the 2012 incident, which was captured on courtroom security cameras. However, the statute of limitations on misdemeanors has expired, Martinez said.
“I don't know any human being that can watch that video and not know something wrong is going on here,” Martinez said
Martinez's ruling came after a five-hour emergency hearing that ended after 7 p.m. The courtroom was packed with security, politicians, interested attorneys and civil rights activists, who have long criticized District Attorney Mitch Morrissey for failing to prosecute police and sheriff's deputies in excessive-force cases.
Martinez agreed the force used against inmate Anthony Waller in September 2012 was excessive, but said there was no legal avenue for prosecuting the deputy because misdemeanors must be charged within 18 months of when they happened.
“It's a hollow victory for you,” Martinez told Waller's attorney, Ken Padilla.
Waller was allowed to leave the courtroom before Martinez finished delivering his decision.
Morrissey did not attend the hearing because he had previous plans to attend an out-of-town wedding. His office was represented by Deputy District Attorney Doug Jackson, who made the original decision to not seek charges against the deputy.
After the hearing, Lynn Kimbrough, a spokeswoman for the DA's office, said she disagreed with the judge's opinion that Lovingier should have been charged with a crime. Jackson is an experienced prosecutor who knows what it takes to get a conviction from a Denver jury, she said.
“I suspect Judge Martinez may not have that same familiarity,” Kimbrough said.
Morrissey had been ordered to court to explain his refusal to prosecute after Padilla filed a petition to ask a judge to order prosecution. It's rare for a hearing to be granted in these cases, and Martinez said it was his first in 19 years on the bench.
Padilla had asked the judge to order second-degree assault and felony hate crime charges to be sought against Lovingier by a special prosecutor. The statute of limitations on those felony charges expired Friday.
On Sept. 12, 2012, Waller had appeared in court after being arrested on kidnapping and assault charges. He was addressing Judge Doris Burd when Lovingier touched him on the back.
Waller turned to look at the deputy, and Lovingier grabbed him by chains around his waist and slammed him into a window frame in the courtroom. Waller fell, and deputies dragged him from the courtroom.
An internal investigation into Lovingier was launched after Burd filed a complaint with a higher-ranking judge.
Waller, who is now jailed in Denver on different charges, filed a federal lawsuit over the incident.
Lovingier served a 30-day suspension after the public safety director's office determined he had used inappropriate force and had no justifiable reason to slam Waller into the wall.
In April, Lovingier was granted a one-year, unpaid leave of absence from the sheriff's department.
Padilla and Waller claimed that Lovingier, who is white, called Waller, who is black, “boy” during the incident.
The judge said he did not hear the racially derogatory comment after viewing the video at least a dozen times, but that he thought the DA's office still could have pursued a misdemeanor hate crime against Lovingier.
Waller and his attorney also claimed he suffered broken teeth, a fractured bone near his eye, a gash on his head, a closed head injury and injuries to his back, neck, legs and ankles, according to documents filed in court.
However, the judge sided with district attorney's argument that Waller's injuries were not that severe. A brain scan done hours after the assault did not find any injuries, and the eye fracture was old, medical records showed.
At the hearing's beginning, Jackson had argued that the minor injuries did not elevate the assault to a felony charge.
Jackson added there was more to the incident than what had been shown publicly on the video.
Earlier that day, Waller had refused to leave his cell to go to court. That played into Lovingier's thinking as he grabbed him by the chains, Jackson said.
Four other deputies also wrote statements supporting Lovingier's actions in the courtroom because Waller had made an aggressive move, Jackson said.
And, Waller's extensive criminal history would have been aired before a jury, damaging his credibility with a jury, Jackson said.
“The video, I know, is difficult to look at. The video is alarming,” Jackson said. “But it would be irresponsible to make a decision based only on the video evidence.”
Jackson said the question was, “Did Lovingier hockey slam that guy into the wall to hurt him or did Deputy Lovingier have a more noble intention to protect Judge Burd and maintain safety in the courtroom?”
But Martinez said he had reviewed videos with a critical eye and disagreed with Jackson's decision. A second video, which has not been publicly released, showed the incident from Burd's perspective.
“I don't for the life of me see how the prosecutor could make that assessment in light of the video,” Martinez said.
The judge's opinion is likely to bolster Morrissey's critics, who earlier this year unsuccessfully launched a recall petition against Morrissey.
Groups such as the NAACP, Colorado Latino Forum and Colorado Progressive Action complain that Morrissey is too cozy with law enforcement to prosecute bad apples at the police and sheriff's departments.
After the hearing, Padilla said the judge's words supported Morrissey's critics.
The prosecutors “don't care about an inmate like Anthony Waller,” Padilla said. “They care about protecting the system.”

KILLEEN, Texas -- An autopsy has concluded that synthetic marijuana was to blame for the death of a Fort Hood soldier shortly after his return from deployment to an Ebola hot zone in West Africa.
The body of Kendrick Vernell Sneed was found the morning of Jan. 13 outside an off-base apartment. Fort Hood officials say Sneed had returned the previous week from Liberia, where he helped construct an Ebola treatment camp but wasn't exposed to patients.
Killeen police, a hazmat team and several ambulances responded to the soldier's home after a report came in of a man's body being found outside, reported CBS affiliate KWTX in Waco.
Ebola tests were given has a precaution but came back negative.
A Killeen Police Department statement Thursday says a medical examiner determined "synthetic cannabinoid intoxication" was the cause of death.

Lions tight end Eric Ebron is dealing with another injury.

ALLEN PARK -- The hits just keep on coming for the Detroit Lions.
They've already lost Ameer Abdullah, likely for the season. They've played the last two weeks without Ezekiel Ansah, and the last three weeks without DeAndre Levy. And then Levy suffered another injury, to his knee, without even practicing.
Now, it's Eric Ebron's turn.
Detroit's starting tight end is expected to miss Sunday's game against the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, according to ESPN. Ansah also likely will miss the game, per the report, and given that Levy has suffered another injury, it's fair to expect all three to be sidelined against Philly (3-0).
Ebron has battled an array of injuries this year, including an ankle during camp, then back issues during the early part of the season. Then he suffered knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's loss against Chicago.
He was able to gut out the rest of the game, but played through visible pain to do so and spent much of the postgame in the trainers room seeking attention before hopping the bus to the airport.
"I play with my heart, man. I play through injuries, I play through pain, I play through soreness. Whatever," Ebron said. "I just went out there and just tried to make a more emotional impact on the team."
Detroit already has begun prepping for his absence, signing former Patriots tight end Clay Harbor this week. Khari Lee and Cole Wick are also on the roster.
But Ebron is easily Detroit's best player at the position. Despite all those injuries, he's second on the team with 210 receiving yards on 18 catches. He has only one drop.
ISO whitewashes role of Chicago Teachers Union in school closures
By Kristina Betinis
9 March 2013
Amid growing opposition to planned school closures and consolidations in Chicago, Illinois, a March 4 Socialistworker.org article entitled “Rahm's scorched-earth assault on our schools” crudely attempts to re-write the history of events surrounding the assault on public education in the city. Socialist Worker, the publication of the International Socialist Organization (ISO), seeks to whitewash the role of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), in which it has a leadership position. ISO member Jesse Sharkey is the current vice president of the CTU. Far from opposing the closure of schools, the CTU and the ISO have collaborated in implementing the Obama administration's school “reforms” with Democratic mayor Rahm Emanuel.
At the very beginning of the article, the ISO presents the impending school shutdowns as an effort “to undermine and cripple the Chicago Teachers Union—payback for the CTU daring to stand up to Emanuel with its nine-day strike last September.”
This statement is doubly false. First, school closures were planned from the very start of Emanuel's administration, part of a policy of dismantling public education and opening charters schools going back many years. When Emanuel left the White House, he made education “reform” a centerpiece of his mayoral election campaign.
Second, far from “standing up” to Emanuel, the unions, including the CTU, have collaborated in the attack on teachers and on public education. Since Emanuel has taken office, teachers unions in Illinois—the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers locals—have proven themselves indispensable in implementing right-wing education “reforms”.
Working in 2011 with Illinois Democratic and Republican leaders to craft the anti-teacher Senate Bill 7—a process in which CTU leaders were deeply involved—teachers unions expanded punitive teacher evaluation measures, gave school boards the right to lengthen the school day and year, raised the bar for a strike vote for Chicago teachers, and made it illegal for teachers to strike over issues they could not collectively bargain on, including layoffs, class sizes and the length of the school day.
In September, 26,000 Chicago teachers went on strike. The CTU worked deliberately to shut this struggle down as quickly as possible, and prevent it from developing into a political fight against the Emanuel administration and the Democratic Party. This then provided the green light for Emanuel to proceed with the closure of at least 100 schools in 2013. Despite opposition from teachers to threatened closures, CTU leaders insisted that teachers could not legally strike over the issue.
The ISO now writes, “Last September, Chicago teachers held the line in their strike against the city, pushing back the reformers' most drastic demands.”
In fact, while teachers showed great determination, the contract pushed through by the CTU accepted all of Emanuel's demands. CTU President Karen Lewis herself admitted that the final agreement was an austerity contract. The three-year contract included the right of principals to hire and fire teachers, the right to fire non-tenured teachers immediately and dismiss tenured teachers after a year, the lengthening of the school day and year without additional compensation, and the expanded use of standardized test scores in teacher evaluations.
The essential purpose of many of these measures was to make it easier for the school district to fire teachers as they implemented planned school closings.
The ISO closes its article with the claim, “As the CTU rightly argues, we should oppose all school closings and stand up against Rahm's scorched-earth war on public education...”
This too is a lie. Lewis made it clear on the second day of the strike that CTU accepted the mayor's plan to shut down schools. The main concern of the CTU leadership was to ensure that school shutdowns be carried out with the collaboration of the union and not unilaterally by CPS.
Lewis told the Chicago Tribune September 12, “We understand the whole movement of closing schools and doing it aggressively... we either do this together in some reasonable way or we will always be fighting, and I think the key is that the people that are making these decisions want to make them unilaterally.”
In the aftermath of the strike, during a November episode of Chicago Tonight, CTU Vice President Sharkey said nothing to oppose what he termed the “unpopular policy” of school shutdowns, and instead advised that it need be carried out in an orderly fashion. “There's no point in closing schools until there is a plan in place.”
Speaking at a union organized rally earlier that month, Sharkey said, “What the school board should do is take a year off. Have a moratorium on school closings and have a real process where there is a study of plans and the people who are part of the coalition here, the parents, the community and the teachers of Chicago have real input into what happens to our schools.”
This “real input” has been a series of sham hearings on the school closures and consolidations, where thousands of parents, teachers and students have voiced their opposition to the closures.
On February 11, CTU president Karen Lewis released a video announcing CTU would be sending organizers to assist those displaced by school closures. She admonished teachers—many who will be losing their jobs, and many more whose teaching conditions will become much more difficult after the closures—to support the CTU's efforts to do so.
As always, the ISO talks out of both sides of its mouth. When it writes, “[O]n this issue, there's not even the proverbial dime's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats,” it seeks to present itself as an opponent of the Democrats. In fact, the organization operates entirely within the framework of this big business party.
The attacks on public education place the mass of the population in direct conflict with the political establishment in the city of Chicago and in Washington. The ISO is part of this establishment. The organization speaks on behalf of a relatively privileged section of the middle class—including trade union executives—who seek to “earn” their position by proving their usefulness to the ruling class.
Emanuel's ability to proceed with the shut down of schools is a product of the collaboration of the unions and the ISO. Throughout the teachers strike last year, the World Socialist Web Site warned of precisely this outcome. A struggle to oppose these closures must be based on a fight against them, through the independent political mobilization of the working class on the basis of a socialist program.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former drug executive Martin Shkreli smirked and brushed off questions about drug prices then tweeted that lawmakers were imbeciles on Thursday, when he appeared at a U.S. congressional hearing against his will.
Shkreli, 32, sparked outrage last year among patients, medical societies and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton after his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of the drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent to $750 a pill.
The lifesaving medicine, used to treat a parasitic infection, once sold for $1 a pill and has been on the market for more than 60 years.
At a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Shkreli repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says no person shall be compelled in any criminal case “to be a witness against himself.”
Wearing a sport jacket and collared shirt rather than his usual T-shirt, he responded to questions by laughing, twirling a pencil and yawning.
Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, asked Shkreli what he would tell a single, pregnant woman with AIDS who needed Daraprim to survive, and whether he thought he had done anything wrong. Shkreli declined to answer.
“I intend to follow the advice of my counsel, not yours,” said Shkreli after South Carolina Republican Representative Trey Gowdy suggested he could answer questions that were unrelated to pending fraud charges against him.
After the hearing, Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, attributed his client's behaviour to “nervous energy.”
Later, though, Shkreli wrote on Twitter: “Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government.”
U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, who learnt about the tweet while Turing Chief Commercial Officer Nancy Retzlaff was testifying, pounded his fist on the dais. The Maryland Democrat then shouted about an internal Turing document in which a staffer joked about the price increase.
“You all spent all of your time strategizing about how to hide your price increase ... and coming up with stupid jokes while other people were sitting there trying to figure out how they were going to survive,” Cummings said.
Shkreli was arrested in December and charged with running his investment funds and companies almost like a Ponzi scheme. He has pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges, which are not related to the pricing of Daraprim. He also stepped down from Turing and was fired from KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc KBIOQ.PK.
Cummings pleaded with Shkreli to reconsider his views about drug pricing: “You can go down as the poster boy for greedy drug company executives, or you can change the system.”
At one point, Brafman asked to address the committee, but Chaffetz said no.
Shkreli was even asked about his purchase of a limited-edition Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop album for $2 million.
“Is that the name of the album? The name of the group?” Gowdy asked. After Shkreli again invoked the Fifth Amendment, Gowdy added: “I am stunned that a conversation about an album he purchased could possibly subject him to incrimination.”
Shkreli was allowed to leave early after he repeated he would not answer questions.
‘SUCH CONTEMPT'
Representative John Mica, a Florida Republican, said he would consider asking fellow lawmakers to hold Shkreli in contempt for his behaviour.
“I don't think I've ever seen the committee treated with such contempt,” Mica said.
Brafman said Shkreli would have liked to discuss drug pricing but had no choice, given the criminal charges against him.
Shkreli's tweet did not amount to waiving his right against self-incrimination, experts said. “The First Amendment protects Mr. Shkreli's right to post his opinion on Twitter that the Congress is populated by ‘imbeciles.' This is classic political free speech,” said lawyer Paul Callan.
Also at the hearing, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc VRX.TO interim CEO Howard Schiller put forward a conciliatory face, testifying that his company had changed its business and pricing tactics.
“Where we have made mistakes, we are listening and changing,” Schiller said during opening remarks. “In a number of cases, we have been too aggressive” about price increases.

Valeant shares rose more than 5 percent during the hearing.
Retzlaff testified that Turing acquired Daraprim because it was “priced far below its market value” and is committed to investing revenue into new treatments.
The Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general are investigating Turing for possible antitrust violations.

Days before breaking ground on a new spacecraft assembly line near Cape Canaveral, OneWeb and Intelsat announced a proposed merger Tuesday that would couple a planned fleet of 900 broadband Internet satellites with a high-power communications network in geostationary orbit.
The “share-to-share” merger, if finalized, will be followed by a $1.7 billion investment in the combined company by Japan's SoftBank. The merger and investment will reduce Intelsat's debt by up to $3.6 billion, officials said, revitalizing Intelsat as it struggles with falling prices for broadband capacity and reduced business from the U.S. government.
Meanwhile, OneWeb is about take another step toward deploying the largest satellite fleet in history with the start of construction of the company's factory in Exploration Park, Florida, just outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
A groundbreaking ceremony was set for Friday, but officials said the event was postponed due to scheduling conflicts. The first satellites should be completed at the facility next year.
The merger of Intelsat and OneWeb is contingent on bondholder and regulatory approvals, officials said.
“Assuming we can close this transaction, we think the Intelsat and OneWeb future advances the objectives of both companies,” said Stephen Spengler, CEO of Intelsat, with headquarters in Luxembourg and McLean, Virginia. “First, we create a global leader with the ability to provide consistent highly reliable broadband anywhere in the world, from a crowded city to the middle of the rainforest.”
Spengler added the OneWeb fleet, which will consist of 900 satellites in low Earth orbit at an altitude of 745 miles (1,200 kilometers), will operate as a “fully-integrated hybrid network” with Intelsat's 50-plus relay craft positioned in geostationary orbit more than 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the equator.
The OneWeb constellation will begin launching next year, building out a space network the company says will offer high-speed Internet with connection speeds comparable to ground-based service providers.
Greg Wyler, executive chairman and founding chairman of OneWeb, said the merger of large satellite fleets in low Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit is a “unique combination” to support wide-scale broadband services.
OneWeb's fleet in low orbit is 30 times closer to the Earth than geostationary satellites, cutting the system's latency, or the time it takes signals to travel between each spacecraft and the ground.
“First of all, there's broadband with low-latency with a terrestrial quality, which is what we're getting out of the OneWeb system, and then (we're) adding a lot of other features that the GEO (geostationary satellites) offer for wide-scale video distribution, wide-scale upload of software,” Wyler said Tuesday in a conference call announcing the merger. “So the combination of the two companies gives us a really nice set of features that we can offer our customers — not just stuff that people get today, but stuff that will be needed in the future.”
Based in Arlington, Virginia, OneWeb aims to beam wifi and mobile data service to customers as soon as next year, reaching homes, businesses, hospitals, schools, oil rigs, ships, airplanes and trains. It works by broadcasting a signal to a hotspot that customers can install on their roofs.
Spengler said Intelsat and OneWeb envision developing fully interoperable ground terminals that can access both satellite fleets.
“We're still going to be serving mobile operators and helping them with small cell expansion into remote rural areas, but we'll also have the ability to go direct to schools and into government offices,” Spengler said Tuesday.
Intelsat was already an investor in OneWeb, planning to take charge of day-to-day operations for OneWeb's satellites in orbit.
OneWeb plans to launch 648 satellites in the first phase of the constellation. The rest of the spacecraft will be spares pre-positioned in orbit or on the ground.
Wyler said OneWeb has raised $1.7 billion to date to fund the first phase of the program, with $1.2 billion coming from SoftBank under a previous fundraising agreement announced in December.
Airbus, Qualcomm, New Delhi-based Bharti Enterprises, Hughes Network Systems — a subsidiary of EchoStar Corp. — Coca-Cola and Totalplay, a company owned by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, are also behind OneWeb.
The satellite fabrication plant on Florida's Space Coast will produce up to three 330-pound (150-kilogram) spacecraft per day in an assembly line fashion. Airbus Defense and Space is prime contractor for OneWeb's satellite constellation, applying mass production techniques — such as automation and robotics — used in the company's airplane business to spacecraft.
The OneWeb factory will cover more than 100,000 square feet (more than 9,000 square meters), officials said.
“This will be the world's first fully-automated high-volume satellite assembly plant,” Wyler said.
Space Florida, a state agency charged with luring commercial aerospace business to the Sunshine State, helped arrange $20 million in government incentives to bring the OneWeb factory to the Space Coast.
The factory will create around 250 direct jobs at Exploration Park, officials said.
OneWeb's facility will be located across the street from Blue Origin's rocket factory. Blue Origin aims to launch its first “New Glenn” rocket from Cape Canaveral by the end of the decade.
The bulk of the initial OneWeb constellation — totaling up to 700 satellites — will be launched by Russian Soyuz rockets under a contract signed in 2015 between OneWeb and Arianespace.
OneWeb ordered 21 Soyuz launches from up to four spaceports — the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Vostochny and Plesetsk in Russia, and the European-run Guiana Space Center in South America — to send up between 32 and 36 satellites at a time.
Airbus is building the first 10 OneWeb satellites at its facility in Toulouse, France. Those spacecraft will be launched to test their performance and functionality in early 2018, Wyler said.
“We're starting with our first launch at the end of March of 2018,” Wyler said. “And then, several months after — maybe five months after — once we test out those satellites, we will be launching every 21 days, which sounds like a lot, but we're using multiple launch pads to do that.
“They are really a very high-volume launcher, even one time they launched twice in one day,” Wyler said of the Soyuz. “So they really have their act together, and we feel very confident about their capabilities.”
Arianespace also secured optional orders from OneWeb for five more Soyuz launches and three flights of the next-generation Ariane 6 rocket.
Virgin Galactic's air-launched LauncherOne vehicle, which is still in development and could fly by the end of 2017, was also awarded 39 launches by OneWeb to replenish the company's satellite fleet as old satellites stop working. LauncherOne will haul up one satellite at a time after dropping from a modified Boeing 747 carrier jet.
Wyler said OneWeb is set to start initial service by the end of 2019, with full global coverage available 12 to 18 months later.
As many as 2,000 more OneWeb satellites could be added to the network with sufficient demand, Wyler said.

Footage has emerged of Israeli soldiers blindfolding, binding the hands of and detaining a mentally-disabled child on suspicion of throwing stones in the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank.
The video, filmed by Palestinian videographer Samih Da'na, has been released by the Israeli rights group B'Tselem who document human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian Territories.
B'Tselem issued a statement that said in the video "soldiers are seen holding the boy, handcuffing him, blindfolding him and closing him in the jeep, despite cries by Palestinian residents that the boy is mentally disabled".
"The footage also shows settlers from Kiryat Arba, watching the incident from behind the settlement's fence," it said. "Some are seen calling out encouragement to the soldiers, including several racist remarks."
"The boy, A. a-Rajbi (full name withheld in interest of privacy), who will be 12 in a month, was detained after Palestinian children threw stones at soldiers on the main road of the Jabel Johar neighborhood in Hebron, close to the settlement of Kiryat Arba," the statement continues.
The rights group added that the boy was "held on the floor of an army jeep for some 15 minutes" until his father arrived and managed to convince the soldiers that his son is mentally-impaired and cannot speak.
The incident took place in the Jebel Juhar neighbourhood in Hebron near the settlement of Kiryat Arba, defined as illegal under international law.
In response to the incident, an Israeli army spokesman said, "A preliminary inquiry indicates that during the incident, army troops were urgently summoned to capture two stone-throwers in the city of Hebron. The two were captured as they threw stones at the nearby community.
"The first, an adolescent who had been given a suspended sentence [on a past criminal charge], was imprisoned after he was captured. The second [A., the young, mentally disabled boy], who is seen in the video clip, was released several minutes after his capture. The details of the incident are being investigated."
B'Tselem have documented previous cases in the West Bank where Israeli forces have detained minors for throwing stones.
In 2013, a five-year-old boy, Wadia Maswadeh, was held after being accused of throwing a stone at a military vehicle. Video footage showed the child crying hysterically as he is led away by Israeli forces. He was held for 30 minutes before being released at the Hashoter checkpoint in Hebron.
HONG KONG—Hong Kong's government argued Tuesday against a landmark ruling that could let foreign maids gain permanent residency as it appealed a case that has raised concerns about ethnic discrimination and strains on social services.
In the ruling in September, a lower court judge found that an immigration provision denying foreign maids the right to apply for permanent residency after seven years—as other foreign residents can—was unconstitutional.

The case has divided Hong Kong, with some arguing that barring maids from applying for residency amounts to ethnic discrimination. Some groups fear the case will result in a massive influx of maids' family members arriving in Hong Kong, putting a strain on the densely populated city's social services and health and education systems, but supporters of the maids say those worries are unfounded.
On the first day of a scheduled three-day hearing, government lawyer David Pannick argued that the court's ruling was wrong because it places limits on lawmakers' ability to decide who is eligible to permanently settle in Hong Kong.
The judge in Hong Kong's Court of First Instance had found in favor of Evangeline Banao Vallejos, a Filipino woman who had worked as a maid in Hong Kong since 1986. Vallejos sought a judicial review after her bid for permanent residency was rejected.
Pannick rejected arguments by Vallejos' lawyers that denying maids the right to apply for residency undermined the rule of law. He said the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, was not intended to be a “straitjacket” that prevented lawmakers from having flexibility when setting immigration policies to advance Hong Kong's interests.
“Our argument is that the concept of ‘ordinary residence' allows for a measure of discretion by the legislature,” Pannick told a three-judge panel in Hong Kong's Court of Appeal. According to immigration provisions, foreign maids in Hong Kong are not considered “ordinarily resident.”
Mark Daly, one of Vallejos' lawyers, would not comment on the government's position but said, “We're quite confident in our arguments.”
There are about 292,000 foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong, and most are women from the Philippines or Indonesia. Others come from Thailand, Nepal, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. About 95 percent of Hong Kong's 7.1 million people are ethnically Chinese.
By the end of 2010, 117,000 of the city's foreign maids had been in Hong Kong for more than seven years, the September ruling said, citing government figures.
Hong Kong permanent residents enjoy certain privileges including the right to vote and work without needing a visa.

Two years ago, Betsy Franceschini was getting at least 100 inquiries a day to her Kissimmee office from Puerto Ricans desperate for a better life.
Thousands of families fled the U.S. territory in 2015 for the metro Orlando area because of its crushing financial crisis and $72 billion debt. As the director of Florida's regional Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration office, Franceschini helped new arrivals connect with agencies that could provide help with housing, food and other services.
It was overwhelming then – but Franceschini says it's nothing compared to the "unprecedented" exodus of Puerto Ricans who are now trying to escape deteriorating conditions on the demolished colony in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
Almost 70 days after the destructive storm tore through the island's weak infrastructure, the situation remains intolerable – a significant portion of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens who live in Puerto Rico remain completely in the dark, without electricity or access to potable water. In two months, tens of thousands of people have fled to the mainland, with the majority headed to established Puerto Rican strongholds in Florida, especially Orlando. Franceschini, who now heads Hispanic Federation's Florida office, and other community members have been working for weeks to provide the island's hurricane victims with food donations, housing, access to jobs, health care and even English classes.
"We have a record number of people coming from the island – we've had more Puerto Ricans leave the island and come to the U.S. in the last several years than in the 1950s when a major exodus came to New York," she says. "Our community needs to come together and stay present and do what needs to be done."
The Puerto Rican exodus to Florida is so massive it could surpass the number of Cuban refugees who escaped to Miami during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 or the number of New Orleans evacuees who fled to Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, says Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute and professor of anthropology at Florida International University.
Duany says a conservative estimate from a report by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College projects that between 114,000 and 213,000 people will leave the island annually after Maria, a jump from the 89,000 who left in 2016.
In two years, the report estimates, Puerto Rico will lose 14 percent of its population, or 470,335 residents. In a 10-year span after the end of World War II in 1945, nearly 700,000 people arrived in New York City during the Great Puerto Rican Migration, according to research from the Library of Congress.
Florida, which already has more than 1 million Puerto Ricans, is expected to receive the most evacuees – since Oct. 3, more than 195,000 people have flown from Puerto Rico to Florida through major airports in Tampa, Miami and Orlando, according to data released Monday by the state emergency management division. Duany says that number, though, doesn't reflect how many people are staying or include evacuees who came on cruise ships.
"It's difficult to compare to any exodus, except perhaps the Irish exodus in the late 19th century during the Great Famine," Duany says. "More people left than remained. We may be seeing something like that given the magnitude of destruction that was created in Puerto Rico after the hurricane."
While politicians have desperately analyzed how the Puerto Rican exodus could turn Florida's voter base blue (Puerto Ricans tend to vote Democrat), less examination has been given to how politics could change on the island.
The continued loss of population, which Duany says has mostly consisted of young people between the ages of 18 to 45, would decrease the island's tax base. Before Maria, federal lawmakers had already established a fiscal control board over the commonwealth's budget, which imposed harsh austerity cuts that have affected schools and universities.
"There's no way Puerto Rico can address debt in any significant way if it doesn't raise more money from its citizens," he says.
President Donald Trump's perceived negligence toward the island after Maria and ugly public spats with Puerto Rican officials could also shift the island's opinion on retaining its status as a commonwealth or becoming a state, Duany says, but it's too soon to tell – Puerto Ricans are still in shock, and immediate needs like water, electricity and food haven't been met.
While Floridians have been welcoming Puerto Ricans to the Sunshine State with open arms, U.S. Rep. Darren Soto says a mass depopulation of the island would "strongly hurt their ability to recover."
"That's why we've worked hand in hand with [Puerto Rican] Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's office and with other legislators in other parties to get them what they need," Soto, an Orlando Democrat, says. "We tell everybody who wants to come here that as Americans, we welcome you. But we do understand that we have to fix the island's resources, so that people are only coming here because they want to – not because their schools are closed or they don't have jobs available or can't get basic utilities."
Jose Luis Rivera, a student at the University of Central Florida, is one of the thousands of young people who moved to Orlando before Maria to find better opportunities. Now, as the president of the new UCF Puerto Rican Student Association, he and other students are helping evacuees who are enrolling in the university.
Puerto Rican students are having a hard time enrolling in college classes because many have taken on two jobs to send money back home to their families for recovery efforts. Others can't find housing on campus or are worried about how long Florida's in-state tuition waiver for Puerto Rican students will last – the student association is pushing for at least a couple of years.
"Many of them are in shock, basically," Rivera says in Spanish. "They say the island looks like a disaster apocalypse."
German anti-immigrant and eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has found itself cornered over comments on shooting refugees who try to cross the border illegally.
On Saturday (30 January), regional daily Mannheimer Morgen published an interview with AfD chairperson Frauke Petry, to discuss her plan for “comprehensive checks” on the German-Austrian border to prevent unregistered refugees from coming in.
She said police must “prevent illegal border crossings, if necessary also by using firearms”, noting that it was “in the law”.
“No policeman wants to shoot at refugees. I don't want that. But the use of firearms is part of the last resort," she said, adding that it was crucial “not to let it come that far”.
It wasn't the first time an AfD member discussed the use of firearms to prevent border crossings.
In November 2015, an AfD member of the European Parliament (MEP) Marcus Pretzell already noted “the defence of Germany borders with armed force as a last resort is self-evident”.
Following Petry's comments, a third AfD member also discussed the possibility of shooting refugees.
MEP Beatrix von Storch, AfD vice-chairwoman since mid-January, was asked her via her public Facebook page if border police should use armed force to prevent women with children crossing the border illegally. She replied: "Yes".
After heavy criticism, she tried to nuance her comment, saying on Monday (1 February) that the use of firearms against children was "rightly, not allowed”.
“But women are, unlike children, sensible, so that the use here may be allowed under the legally narrow limits of [paragraphs] 11,12 and 13 of the UZwG," she wrote, referring to a law on the use force by German authorities.
A spokesperson for the federal interior ministry said on Monday “the use of firearms against people to stop an illegal border crossing is unlawful”.
"It goes without saying: No German policeman will use a firearm against people who are searching for protection in Germany,” spokesperson Johannes Dimroth told journalists.
Von Storch, a former lawyer, tried to defend her comments as being of a purely legalistic nature, but the mere debate on the issue has brought back bad memories of people being shot when they tried to breach the Berlin Wall - and strident criticism by the AfD's political opponents.
Centre-left vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Sunday that the AfD merits scrutiny by German intelligence, along with other left and right-wing extremists.
“To me, the AfD belongs in the Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution, and not on TV,” he said, according to Bild am Sonntag.
Gabriel's fellow Social Democrat party MP, Thomas Oppermann, said Petry's proposal was "reminiscent of the firing order in the GDR", the communist German Democratic Republic, which used lethal force to prevent people from fleeing its territory.
“The last German politician who was shooting at refugees was [GDR leader] Erich Honecker,” said Oppermann.
One of the AfD's founders, Bernd Lucke, who since left the party to set up a new one, also said the way the AfD regarded refugees was “inhuman”.
He said he “did not expect this radicalisation”.
Meanwhile, attacks against planned or inhabited refugee shelters in Germany have continued.
A police chief in the eastern German city of Leipzig said he was very worried about the situation, noting there was a “pogrom atmosphere” in which some people felt justified to use violence against asylum seekers.
Meanwhile, police in Cologne are looking to increase security ahead of a carnival, which begins on Thursday (4 February).
The city is under scrutiny after groups of men, mostly of “North African or Arab appearance”, attacked women on New Year's Eve, triggering an emotional debate on how to integrate the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants coming to the EU's largest state.
This article initially said Von Storch was asked via Facebook if border police should shoot women with children crossing the border illegally. This was corrected on 4 February to say she was asked if border police should use armed force ('mit Waffengewalt' in the German language) to prevent women with children crossing the border illegally.
Obese teenagers already show signs of hormonal differences from normal-weight peers that may make them prone to weight gain, according to a new study published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.
The study found obese teenagers have lower levels of a hormone potentially tied to weight management than normal-weight teens. Studies of adults have found that the hormone, called spexin, is likely involved in regulating the body's fat mass and energy balance.
"Our study is the first to look at levels of spexin in the pediatric population," said one of the study's authors, Seema Kumar, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. "Previous research has found reduced levels of this hormone in adults with obesity. Overall, our findings suggest spexin may play a role in weight gain beginning at an early age."
For children and teens, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex.
Obesity affects about 17 percent of children in the United States, according to the Society's Endocrine Facts and Figures Report. Childhood obesity is associated with an estimated $14.1 billion in additional prescription drug, emergency room visit and outpatient visit costs each year.
The cross-sectional study analyzed spexin levels in 51 obese and 18 normal-weight teenagers between the ages of 12 and 18. The participants had blood samples taken between 2008 and 2010 as part of a separate clinical trial. Researchers tested the blood samples to measure spexin levels.
Researchers divided the teenagers into four groups based on their spexin levels. Among the participants with the lowest levels of spexin, the odds of having obesity were 5.25 times higher than in the group with the highest levels of the hormone. Unlike what has been noted in adults, there was no association between spexin levels and fasting glucose.
"It is noteworthy that we see such clear differences in spexin levels between obese and lean adolescents," Kumar said. "Since this is a cross-sectional study, more research is needed to explore the physiological significance of spexin, how it may be involved in the development of childhood obesity and whether it can be used to treat or manage the condition."
EXCLUSIVE: In what I am told will go down as the highest price paid ever for U.S. rights on a movie at the European Film Market, The Weinstein Company has locked a deal to pay $7 million for The Imitation Game, the Graham Moore Black List script that Morten Tyldum directed with Benedict Cumberbatch playing Alan Turing, the genius British mathematician, logician, cryptologist and computer scientist who led the charge to crack the German Enigma Code that helped the Allies win WWII. Keira Knightley also stars in a film that will be shaped as a major release for the next awards season.
CAA brokered this deal based on a promo reel that had five bidders going after it hard before TWC just took it off the table, with the feeling that it has one of its major Oscar hopefuls for the next race. TWC currently has Philomena in the Best Picture race that will be decided next month.

Harvey and Bob Weinstein and their team headed by COO David Glasser bested five competitors that sparked to a 15-minute compilation of scenes on a picture that has just gone into postproduction. The film also stars Mark Strong and Matthew Goode, and it's produced by Nora Grossman, Ido Ostrowsky and Teddy Schwarzman. It was Schwarzman's Black Bear Pictures label that took the risk on the film after Warner Bros let it go. The TWC acquisition team of Robert Walak, Negeen Yazdi and Dan Guando chased this script for a year. TWC's Michal Steinberg closed the deal.

While the temptation is to liken this to TWC's last period Best Picture winner The King's Speech, Turing's tale doesn't end happy. After WWII, Turing was rewarded for his heroism by being prosecuted for being a homosexual. Disgraced and forced to choose chemical castration or else imprisonment, he eventually took his own life.
Harvey Weinstein confirmed the deal and said he was blown away by the footage. It was the same sum that TWC paid the last time there was a title with this much heat, when the John Carney-directed Can A Song Save Your Life? sold at the Toronto Film Festival last fall. That one also has Knightley starring.
“Teddy Schwarzman and Morten Tyldum took a script that Bob and I loved but were worried about its tone because if you got it wrong one inch to the left or one inch to the right, you would have major problems,” Weinstein told me. “These guys got it so perfect, they did a better job than I ever could have. Benedict is unbelievable, and this is going to be a big year for Keira. Between this and Can A Song Save Your Life? she is going to be a major star. We look at this as a major release and we're thrilled to have it.”
Okay, so you're a new Maschine user waiting for your new Mk3 to arrive. Or, maybe you're an experienced user who never really tapped into all the sampling options available to you in Maschine. Well, today is your lucky day! In this article we'll explore different sample sources you can use to get audio into Maschine.
Mobile phones, hardware synths, or field recorders
If you're planning on purchasing NI's soon to be released Maschine Mk3 hardware, you'll be able to plug any ¼” cable into the new studio grade audio interface. This is a 96 kHz, 24-bit audio interface with 2 x ¼” TRS line inputs and a ¼” mic input for use with a dynamic microphone.
Being able to sample directly into the Mk3 hardware should be the easiest and fastest way to get external audio into Maschine and onto a pad for further editing.
Youtube, Vimeo (and virtually anything that plays audio from the internet)
Windows users, the word for today is Voicemeeter.
Voicemeeter is a virtual audio mixer and virtual audio interface offered as donationware from software developers, VB-Audio. It's available for Windows XP, Vista, 7/8/8.1/10 in 32/64 bits and is similar to a program for Mac users called Loopback, which I think used to be called Soundflower. In a nutshell, this program allows you to bring audio into Maschine from any source that plays through it including other audio applications on your computer. It does require some configuration, but nothing too difficult. Once installed and configured:
- Go to your audio properties and select Voicemeeter as your main audio device
- Make sure Voicemeeter ASIO is selected in Maschine's audio preferences
- Go to Maschine's Sampler page and get to sampling!That's it!
Keep in mind that this covers you for any and all audio that plays from any website as well as audio playing from other applications on your computer. Have fun with that!
And for Mac users there's another cool app that allows you sampling other apps like Spotify, iTunes, Safari (soundcloud, youtube etc). The app is called Audio Hijack Pro. It's been around for many years and recently they've released an update with clean modern UI:
Loopcloud
A few months back, the good people at Loopmasters released a free application they named, Loopcloud. You're probably saying to yourself, “not another cloud-based sample storage platform”. Yes, but this is one of the best free options available to my knowledge at least.
It runs as a standalone application for Windows and Mac in both 32/64 bit format, comes with 1GB of free sample content and you get 150mb of new free samples every week. But, it really shines when you use it as a plug-in inside your DAW of choice. The Loopcloud plug-in syncs to your host tempo so you can audition samples that will already be in sync with your song. What's even cooler than that is you can drag n drop samples from Loopcloud directly into your session and keep it moving.
You can search for samples by instrument, genre, label, file format, content type, key and bpm. My only gripe is that you can't add samples from your hard drive, but Loopmasters have stated that this will come in a future update.
Splice
Certainly everybody in the audio community knows about Splice by now. For those that don't, Splice is one of the more popular online platforms for audio enthusiast, producers and musicians. Among other things, Splice also a great resource for samples, boasting 1 million samples from a plethora of sound providers. However, Splice is subscription based and there's a fee of $8 per month.
The good thing is that the fee covers any amount of samples you download during that time. With 1 million samples available and most likely more by this time, you can image that there are plenty of genres to choose from.
There's an application you have to download to your computer to be able to preview and download content. If you don't want to buy in to the subscription service, you can still purchase samples individually directly from the Splice application without having to purchase an entire sound pack.
Vinyl Record Youtube Channels
There's a healthy amount of Youtube channels that are based on obscure vinyl records that haven't been overused or maybe even haven't been used at all. I'm subscribed to quite a few and found these channels to be a source of inspiration whenever I have beat block.
I'll list a few channels here for you to check out, but also remember that if you install Voicemeeter (PC users) or Loopback (Mac users), you'll be able to sample right into Maschine immediately. I hope you all get lost in the fun of building your own unique sample libraries. Enjoy!

5 cool iOS apps to sample
Sampling iOS apps to Maschine is easy, just connect your iPhone/iPad to Maschine MK3 or another audio interface or just use USB cable if you use Mac (yes, it can transfer audio via USB as well).
Maschine as well as many iOS apps support Ableton Link - so you can easily play in sync.

Recensé : Minayo Nasiali, Native to the Republic. Empire, Social Citizenship, and Everyday Life in Marseille since 1945, Londres, Cornell University Press, 2016, 231 p.
La décision prise par six familles de squatter une maison vacante du centre-ville de Marseille en 1946, la formation d'un comité de quartier à Saint-Charles (1er arrondissement) en 1950, l'organisation d'un « bal des ascenseurs » à Saint-Barthélémy (14e arrondissement) en 1982 et la création d'un groupe de hip-hop (B.Vice) à La Savine (15e arrondissement) en 1989 : ces micro-événements participent-ils d'une histoire commune ? Minayo Nasiali, assistante-professeur à l'Université de Californie-Los Angeles, répond par l'affirmative dans cet ouvrage présentant des résidents marseillais qui, quelle que soit leur origine ou leur nationalité, ont su affirmer localement, pendant cinquante ans, une citoyenneté sociale soucieuse d'améliorer un environnement urbain souvent difficile.
L'histoire du logement en France est un champ d'étude largement scruté, avec des recherches portant sur les initiatives de rénovation et de réhabilitation urbaines étatiques et centralisées, mettant en lumière le rôle des ministères et des hauts fonctionnaires sur des groupes spécifiques (Portugais, Algériens), sur des organisations (la SONACOTRA par exemple) ou sur les « pathologies urbaines » nées des quartiers dits « sensibles » et des « grands ensembles ». Dans ce domaine, Minayo Nasiali innove en plaçant le logement au cœur des luttes pour une citoyenneté sociale. Elle démontre comment les débats locaux autour du logement et de l'urbanisme aident à restructurer, depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les relations entre les citoyens et l'État. Elle estime aussi que l'Empire colonial façonne ce processus dans la durée : les revendications des populations colonisées ou anciennement colonisées sont aussi tenaces en ce domaine que les discriminations qu'elles subissent.
De fait, l'historienne se place dans les interstices de l'historiographie du logement en France, un peu comme les « gens ordinaires » qu'elle étudie organisent leurs luttes dans les interstices pauvres de la ville. L'histoire de ces luttes est alors scrutée à partir des négociations quotidiennes entre les résidents de différents quartiers marseillais, les élus locaux et nationaux, les technocrates et autres experts (démographes, sociologues, urbanistes), grâce à des sources diverses comprenant des documents d'archives, des articles de presse et une enquête orale. Bien que la périodisation adoptée soit classique, la première partie (« Moderniser la cité impériale ») portant globalement sur les « Trente Glorieuses » et la seconde partie (« L'État Providence en déclin ? ») sur la fin de celles-ci, Minayo Nasiali donne à comprendre des mécanismes qui, pour être toujours marqués par leur contexte, dépassent cette simple chronologie.
Les gens ordinaires et leurs petites victoires
Tout au long du second 20e siècle (1945-2000), l'urbanisme marseillais, comme dans d'autres villes françaises, est l'objet de crises multiples et récurrentes : pénuries de logements dans l'immédiat après guerre (32 000 familles sans logements en 1946), hébergements temporaires devenus permanents dans les bidonvilles, les camps d'hébergement ou les cités de transit dans les années 1950-1960, « sarcellite » (du nom donné à cette « névrose » dont peuvent souffrir les habitants des grands ensembles) et violences urbaines dans les grands ensembles dans les années 1970-1980. Durant ces crises, les habitants se mobilisent pour améliorer leur ordinaire. Ils créent à la fin des années 1940 un « comité d'entente des squatters », qui rassemble près de 500 squats dans l'agglomération marseillaise en 1949. Dans les années 1950, se montent des « comités d'intérêts de quartiers », associations destinées à servir d'interlocuteurs entre les habitants d'un quartier et les élus locaux sur des sujets variés comme la voirie, le voisinage, la propreté, etc. Un collectif d'habitants à Saint-Barthélémy, quartier défavorisé doté de grands ensembles, voit encore le jour en 1982, et des médiateurs culturels et des Maisons des jeunes et de la culture font progressivement leur apparition à Marseille. Pétitions, lettres individuelles adressées au maire et notamment à Gaston Deferre (maire de 1953 à 1986), entretiens demandés avec les autorités : tous les moyens sont mobilisés pour obtenir des droits, améliorer les conditions d'existence et participer aux plans de réorganisation des quartiers. L'État-providence est aussi façonné par le bas.
De nombreuses « rencontres improbables » [1] se nouent entre résidents d'un même quartier, sans distinction d'origine. Métropolitains, migrants européens, sujets coloniaux parlent une même langue et revendiquent le même droit au logement, bien avant les solidarités de Mai 68. Catholiques (avec le Mouvement populaire des familles) et communistes (à travers la CGT) aident de concert les squatters. On découvre, alors, que de nombreuses familles colonisées réclament dans leurs lettres au maire une amélioration de leurs conditions de logement : ces familles luttent aux côtés de leurs voisins métropolitains, selon les mêmes modalités et avec les mêmes objectifs. Ainsi, en 1960, Slimane T. en appelle au maire pour obtenir une « maison confortable ou au moins une maison avec toilettes ». Dans sa lettre, il se présente comme un ouvrier du bâtiment performant (6 jours de travail par semaine) et comme un pilier solide de sa famille nombreuse (4 enfants) ; il affirme que son épouse est une femme au foyer exemplaire et insiste sur les services historiques rendus par sa famille à la France. Bref, il est un citoyen actif et un membre productif de la nation.
Le soubassement idéologique de ces luttes quotidiennes, individuelles ou plus collectives, évolue avec le temps. Au sortir de la guerre, si le logement est vu comme un droit de l'homme universel, il devient, progressivement, un droit réservé aux citoyens et plus particulièrement aux citoyens méritants. Dans les années 1980, il s'agit d'associer les riverains, notamment les jeunes, aux nouveaux projets, puis de favoriser le multiculturalisme. Ces micro-luttes quotidiennes sont ponctuées de « petites victoires » (p. 118), mais aussi de vrais échecs.
« Logiques de l'exclusion »
Minayo Nasiali démontre comment, dans cette construction par le bas d'une citoyenneté sociale, les « logiques de l'exclusion » – pour reprendre le titre d'un ouvrage de Norbert Elias – sont aussi nombreuses que discrètes. En premier lieu, les anciens résidents sont fréquemment hostiles aux nouveaux et réclament une priorité dans la mobilité résidentielle. C'est ainsi qu'Arnaud R., président de l'association des résidents de Saint Charles peut affirmer face aux habitants nouvellement installés : « Nous, les résidents, conscients de nos besoins et de nos droits, demandons l'éviction des nomades ».
En deuxième lieu, les différences ethniques et raciales sont régulièrement réactivées, dans le contexte de la décolonisation comme dans les époques ultérieures, tant par les institutions que par les habitants eux-mêmes. Cela est vrai des politiques destinées à reloger les squatters : les familles métropolitaines sont envoyées vers des logements HBM ou HLM quand les familles « nord-africaines » sont davantage conduites vers les camps de Grand Bastide et de Grand Arenas. Cela est vrai également des politiques de suppression des bidonvilles. Quand les familles de Peysonnel sont étiquetées, classées et envoyées généralement dans des cités de transit, les résidents « nord-africains » sont qualifiés d' « Algériens » ou vice versa : la nationalité devient un critère primordial de classement et de discrimination.
En troisième lieu, l'affiliation politique joue plus précisément dans le cas marseillais : les résidents n'hésitent jamais à utiliser le patronage et bien des communistes se plaignent d'être déconsidérés dans leurs demandes, comme lors de l'effondrement de l'immeuble du quartier Saint-Lazare, le 26 juin 1960. Le système du « hochement de tête » et du « clin d'œil » – euphémismes par lesquels les Marseillais désignent le clientélisme – fonctionne à plein, bien que toujours nié par les hommes politiques.
Franchir les micro-frontières sociales
Dès lors, de nombreuses micro-frontières séparent des habitants qui luttent pourtant pour des projets similaires. Les divisions peuvent venir de la base (de l'immeuble, du quartier), comme lorsqu'en 1984, des voisins protestent contre la nomination d'un gardien « fils de harki » par la SONACOTRA et obtiennent la nomination d'un Tunisien, ce qui conduit les harkis à protester à leur tour… Mais les divisions peuvent aussi venir de la sphère scientifique : les travaux conduits au sein de l'INED sur le « seuil de tolérance » ou sur « le rééquilibrage social » – autrement dit sur la proportion d'étrangers ou de familles précaires à ne pas dépasser dans des habitations collectives – sont ensuite récupérés par les autorités nationales comme, au niveau local, par les résidents, pour justifier certaines discriminations.
Finalement, les divisions sont toujours instrumentalisées par la sphère politique. Progressivement, les affrontements entre riverains deviennent plus idéologiques du fait de la montée des incertitudes économiques. Le « massacre du bus 72 » (un Algérien souffrant de problèmes mentaux tue le conducteur d'un bus et blesse de nombreux passagers le 25 août 1973), le meurtre d'un jeune comorien de 17 ans, fondateur de B. Vice (Ibrahim Ali Abdallah) près de La Savine, le 21 février 1995, sont autant d'événements instrumentalisés pour pointer les enjeux des tensions de voisinage dans les années 1970-1980.
Les politiques de la ville menées sous François Mitterrand (1981-1995) apportent un renouveau dans les quartiers marseillais quand sociologues, politiques et résidents tentent de favoriser le « vivre ensemble », ainsi qu'une citoyenneté sociale pratique et quotidienne. L'aide apportée aux jeunes dans le domaine musical et artistique en témoigne : l'ouverture d'une école de musique, l'essor du hip-hop (danse, chants, tags), l'engagement de jeunes dans des associations de quartier sont autant d'exemples d'une énergie créatrice impulsée à l'échelon local et du refus de se laisser imposer des politiques non désirées. Cela est aussi illustré à travers l'engagement dans la durée de certaines personnalités locales comme Françoise Ega qui, pendant plusieurs années, se démène dans la cité du Grand Saint-Barthélémy où elle crée des Amicales (dont l'Amicale générale des travailleurs antillais et guyanais), exige l'amélioration du système de transports publics, la création d'un centre culturel, et même la réparation d'un ascenseur, qui donnera lieu au « bal des ascenseurs », organisé pour collecter les fonds nécessaires à sa remise en marche.
En guise d'épilogue, Minayo Nasiali ouvre une fenêtre sur les nouveaux débats autour de la revitalisation urbaine lancée dans les années 2000 à Marseille pour faire – ou refaire – de la ville et sa région une « Californie de l'Europe ». Elle démontre alors que, comme Sisyphe, les « gens ordinaires » ne cessent d'agir pour modifier leur quotidien. Sur un plan politique, le livre offre sans nul doute des arguments à opposer à ceux qui doutent encore de l'utilité du droit de vote des étrangers à l'échelon local, longtemps promis par une partie de la gauche et systématiquement repoussé. Sur le plan scientifique, il présente le logement comme matrice essentielle des luttes sociales et écologiques du 20e siècle en France, luttes destinées à améliorer la qualité de l'environnement urbain sous toutes ses formes. Il invite aussi à décloisonner les recherches sur les groupes sociaux et les institutions grâce à une histoire qui croise sans cesse différents objets, comme l'État-Providence, les nationalités, les classes sociales, le logement, les associations, l'écologie, etc. Mais il donne également l'envie d'explorer des trajectoires plus individuelles pour suivre la sortie de ces cycles vécus dans un même quartier, mais pas forcément par un même individu. In fine, il enrichit l'histoire populaire portée récemment par Michelle Zancarini-Fournel, une histoire de « luttes et de rêves » [2].

Shu Yuhui, the owner of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Quanjian, has confirmed that the club have made an approach to sign Chelsea striker Diego Costa.
Yuhui also confirmed that the club had reached informal agreements to sign the likes of Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, PSG hitman Edinson Cavani and former Manchester United and Chelsea forward Radamel Falcao which subsequently fell through.
What Maurizio Sarri told Chelsea board about row with Kepa Arrizabalaga
Desperate to find a goalscorer, Tianjin have been scuppered by the Chinese Football Association's decision to change league rules to limit the amount of foreign players Super League clubs are allowed to bring in.
‘Our club had a massive investment plan for the new season but it was tightened up by the new rules,' Yuhui told Tianjin Sports Channel.

In their quest to recruit a big name, Yuhui revealed that he held a meeting with Costa's agent Jorge Mendes but was told that Chelsea would only allow their Spanish international striker to leave the club in the summer as opposed to a January switch.

‘I made an appointment with Mendes and he came to my hometown to visit me. At that time, we were interested in signing Costa,' he added.
‘PSG told us Cavani would only be allowed to leave in June, even though the player himself was willing to join us. The same can be said for Costa because Chelsea would only let him leave in June. However, the new season of CSL will almost reach the halfway stage in June, we can't wait so long.'

Setting their sights high, Tianjin, who are managed by former Real Madrid defender Fabio Cannavaro, contacted France international Benzema in regards to a high-profile departure from European football.
‘We need an out-and-out striker so we made a bid for Benzema. We also made an attempt for Falcao,' he added.
‘As a matter of fact, the club had even prepared the contracts for Falcao and [Benfica striker] Raul Jimenez. We had already reached agreement with them on wages and bonus. The pair were expected to sign the contracts, but the new rules forced us to give up on them.'

Our Government Is Planning to Stay at War for the Next 80 Years
Anyone Got a Problem with That?
Without public debate and without congressional hearings, a segment of the Pentagon and fellow travelers have embraced a doctrine known as the Long War.
By Tom Hayden
April 01, 2010 "LA Times" - March 31, 2010 -- Without public debate and without congressional hearings, a segment of the Pentagon and fellow travelers have embraced a doctrine known as the Long War, which projects an "arc of instability" caused by insurgent groups from Europe to South Asia that will last between 50 and 80 years. According to one of its architects, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan are just "small wars in the midst of a big one."
Consider the audacity of such an idea. An 80-year undeclared war would entangle 20 future presidential terms stretching far into the future of voters not yet born. The American death toll in Iraq and Afghanistan now approaches 5,000, with the number of wounded a multiple many times greater. Including the American dead from 9/11, that's 8,000 dead so far in the first decade of the Long War. And if the American armed forces are stretched thin today, try to conceive of seven more decades of combat.
The costs are unimaginable too. According to economists Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, Iraq alone will be a $3-trillion war. Those costs, and the other deficit spending of recent years, yield "virtually no room for new domestic initiatives for Mr. Obama or his successors," according to a New York Times budget analysis in February. Continued deficit financing for the Long War will rob today's younger generation of resources for their future.
The term "Long War" was first applied to America's post-9/11 conflicts in 2004 by Gen. John P. Abizaid, then head of U.S. Central Command, and by the retiring chairman of the Joint Chiefs of State, Gen. Richard B. Myers, in 2005.
According to David Kilcullen, a top counterinsurgency advisor to Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and a proponent of the Long War doctrine, the concept was polished in "a series of windowless offices deep inside the Pentagon" by a small team that successfully lobbied to incorporate the term into the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, the nation's long-term military blueprint. President George W. Bush declared in his 2006 State of the Union message that "our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy."
The concept has quietly gained credence. Washington Post reporter-turned-author Thomas E. Ricks used "The Long War" as the title for the epilogue of his 2009 book on Iraq, in which he predicted that the U.S. was only halfway through the combat phase there.
It has crept into legal language. Federal Appeals Court Judge Janice Rogers Brown, a darling of the American right, recently ruled in favor of holding detainees permanently because otherwise, "each successful campaign of a long war would trigger an obligation to release Taliban fighters captured in earlier clashes."
Among defense analysts, Andrew J. Bacevich, a Vietnam veteran who teaches at Boston University, is the leading critic of the Long War doctrine, criticizing its origins among a "small, self-perpetuating, self-anointed group of specialists" who view public opinion "as something to manipulate" if they take it into consideration at all.
The Long War has momentum, though the term is absent from the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review unveiled by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in February. One commentator has noted the review's apparent preference for finishing "our current wars before thinking about the next."
Still we fight wars that bleed into each other without clear end points. Political divisions in Iraq threaten to derail the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops scheduled for 2012.
As troop levels decline in Iraq, they grow to 100,000 in Afghanistan, where envoy Richard C. Holbrooke famously says we'll know success "when we see it." The Afghan war has driven Al Qaeda into Pakistan, where U.S. intelligence officers covertly collaborate with the Pakastani military. Lately our special forces have stepped up covert operations in Yemen.
It never ends. British security expert Peter Neumann at King's College has said that Europe is a "nerve center" of global jihad because of underground terrorists in havens protected by civil liberties laws. Could that mean NATO will have to occupy Europe?
It's time the Long War strategy was put under a microscope and made the focus of congressional hearings and media scrutiny. The American people deserve a voice in the strategizing that will affect their future and that of their grandchildren. There are at least three important questions to address in public forums:
* What is the role of the Long War idea in United States' policy now? Can the Pentagon or president impose such war-making decisions without debate and congressional ratification?
* Who exactly is the enemy in a Long War? Is Al Qaeda (or "Islamic fundamentalism") considered to be a unitary enemy like the "international communist conspiracy" was supposed to be? Can a Long War be waged with only a blanket authorization against every decentralized group lodged in countries from Europe to South Asia?
* Above all, what will a Long War cost in terms of American tax dollars, American lives and American respect in the world? Is it sustainable? If not, what are the alternatives?
President Obama has implied his own disagreement with the Long War doctrine without openly repudiating the term. He has pledged to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by 2012, differing with those like Ricks who predict continuing combat, resulting in a Korean-style occupation. Obama also pledges to "begin" American troop withdrawals from Afghanistan by summer 2011, in contrast to those who demand we remain until an undefined victory. Obama told West Point cadets that "our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended, because the nation that I'm most interested in building is our own."
Those are naive expectations to neoconservatives and to some in the Pentagon for whom the Long War fills a vacuum left by the end of the Cold War. They will try to trap Obama in a Long War by demanding permanent bases in Iraq, slowing American withdrawals from Afghanistan to a trickle and defending secret operations in Pakistan. Where violence flares, he will be blamed for disengaging prematurely. Where situations stabilize, he will be counseled it's because we keep boots on the ground. We will keep spending dollars we don't have on wars without end.
The underlying issues should be debated now, before the future itself has been drafted for war.

Of all our summer signings, Nacer Chadli was the most low-key arrival. What's more, the 6'1” wide forward hasn't had the chance to make much of an impact due to injury.
So far this season our attack hasn't caught the imagination like we'd hoped for having signed some expensive talent. The left side has been a particular problem though. Not only due to the number of players that have been given the role, but also the lack of chances we've created from this side.
So, could the return of Nacer Chadli boost our production down this flank?
Spurs' left side
The left side of the team has been a real problem this season and it's not just been the wide forward, but also the left back.
Danny Rose started the campaign in the position and his forward bursts got him in to attacking positions. His injury has meant that Jan Vertonghen has covered the role.
While he is able to get forward, Vertonghen doesn't have the speed to burst past his wide forward on the overlap or recover ground quickly like Rose if the ball is lost.
Take Danny Rose's performance away against Arsenal – a team that plays 4-2-3-1. We can see how much he gets up the line to receive the ball. We can also see how Nacer Chadli moves play forward to him to progress the attack.
Compare that with Jan Vertonghen away to Everton – another decent team that also plays 4-2-3-1. Vertonghen is playing with another inverted wide player in Aaron Lennon so should be offering width.
The Belgian does receive a lot of longer passes hit to him from the centre of the park to switch the attack, which he can bring under control due to his height. But he doesn't get up the field enough or take the ball played up the line. Lennon's passes to him are all backwards or in the middle third of the pitch.
But it's not just the full backs; the wide forward on the left in front of them has also struggled as well to create chances, whether it's been Lennon, Lamela or Sigurdsson.
Lennon is arguably the most one footed player we have and much better on the right flank. Sigurdsson plays the role extremely narrow and is better at bursting through the inside left channel to score goals rather than create them – as he did on his strikes against Norwich and Chelsea. Whilst Erik Lamela only played there in the debacle at Man City, but looked like a wide forward playing on the wrong side.
This lack of cohesion, and also lack of consistency, has lead to our left side being one of the least productive in terms of chance creation in the Premier League.
Only Hull, Arsenal and Fulham have created less of their chances down the left side than Spurs. Whilst only Newcastle, Arsenal and Fulham have a bigger imbalance in their chances created between left and right flanks.
Take our home loss to Newcastle, where we took a massive 31 shots and Tim Krul played a blinder. Our decent chance creation from good attacking areas inside the box came from the right side, whilst only one cross came in from the left.
Return of Nacer Chadli key?
The return to fitness of Nacer Chadli could prove key to getting more production out of the left side and making our attack more balanced as a whole.
In our trip to the Emirates, we saw how he linked with Danny Rose, but Chadli also offers the ability to get in beyond the full back in the final third himself. This gives his combination with the full back more of a one-two punch than that of a generic inverted wide player who just cuts inside and leaves the full back to overlap.
Being tall, he is the focus for long switches in play, as the ball often travels over distance to him, which he can then bring down under his control. But he also goes up the line, which keeps the defence honest, rather than them sitting narrow against a player that always cuts inside.
We can see this against Arsenal, but also how he was attempting to get in-behind his marker to supply short crosses and pull backs from inside the penalty area. This is the Andre Villas-Boas way of scoring goals.
We also saw this in our opening match of the season at Crystal Palace.
Nacer Chadli here was also the focus for long switches in play of the ball when it is transferred across the pitch. This increases the tempo of the attack.
Whilst he does come inside to receive the ball, as at the Emirates, he also goes up the line, trying to get in-behind in order to create some service for his teammates.
This type of play from the left flank is something we've been missing since Nacer Chadli has been out with injury.
In three Premier League starts and a substitute appearance against Chelsea, he is creating a chance to score every 30 minutes. This is much better than Gylfi Sigurdsson's 79 minutes per chance created in his seven appearances on the left in the Premier League. It's also better than Aaron Lennon's 69 minutes per chance created in his three league appearances on that side.
Whilst Danny Rose is an important factor, the return to fitness of Nacer Chadli will go a long way to rectifying the problem of our sputtering left side.

Lets face it, cultural appropriation sucks. We've all seen white people with dreads stomping around like they own the place, or drunk hipsters at music festivals with headdresses and bindis. As people of color it can be incredibly frustrating to see things like this. It reminds us that we live in a world in which whiteness continues to steal cultures without regard to the actual people who've invented or maintained those cultures.
Cultural appropriation occurs when members of a dominant group take elements and symbols of another culture for their own economic or social gain while simultaneously devaluing and silencing the bodies, opinions and voices of the oppressed culture.
This is problematic for a lot of reasons, and triggering for people of color because it reinforces the way imperialism and racism have allowed the white Western world to steal and exploit people of color while simultaneously denying us representation and rights.
Since most things regarding race in the US are thought of in terms of their relationship to whiteness, it's easy for people of color to spot when white people are appropriating our cultures. It's harder to examine the ways that we borrow from, steal from, and erase each other.
So, can people of color appropriate from each other?
1. Yes, we can. But:
2. Sometimes people call things appropriation without understanding that multiple cultures engage in the same practices and have shared practices for centuries.
If everyone who reads BGD gave as little as $10, we'd be fully funded for the next 10 years. GIVE today and help amplify marginalized voices.
While all groups of color face our own unique problems that grow with intersecting identities (gender, sexuality, class, etc) we all face a lack of representation and the repercussions of negative stereotypes in America. This is reinforced and evidenced in many ways, such as the creation of the model-minority myth of Asians in America, colorism (discrimination based on the pigmentation of your skin and the belief that lighter skin is better), or hierarchy among immigrant generations and who is considered ‘more American'.
When we take from each other, we might be assimilating into our neighborhoods or schools or community in order to be accepted by them.
Because many communities of color are set next to each other in the U.S., we often end up in a series of cultural exchanges that can be mutually respectful and important to our survival or negotiating of America. My friends of color would often hang out with me for Eid and dress up in our traditional clothes. We constantly exchanged food and recipes. I would go to their houses for Easter, Christmas, and Kwanza and participate in all of the rituals that came along with those holidays. The key here was that we were active participants in celebrating each other, not erasing each other. We were invited by each other to participate in customs, not just donning them because we thought they looked or sounded cool. We also weren't gaining social or economic capital from partaking in each other's cultures.
As people of color, many of us come from painful legacies of immigration, slavery, and exploitation. There is a violent erasure and orphaning that we have to deal with as we negotiate America. My experience has taught me that I am not considered American even though I was born here. I don't speak Urdu fluently, am not well versed on the current politics of Pakistan, but cling to elements of my Pakistani and Kashmiri culture and sometimes romanticize them. I rock saris anytime I can and wear kameezes as dresses. I do my research before I wear something, but a lot of time that comes from the Internet and not from some deep cultural exchange in my family. That might be considered by some to be appropriative, but for me and other individuals of diasporic identity, it is a necessary part of survival and sanity in America.
My South Asian friends have complained about seeing other people of color rocking bindis or shalwaar kameez and called them appropriative. Yes, it hurts us to see our culture trivialized or worn as an easily dispensable fashion accessory, especially when it wasn't seen as cool to wear those things growing up. However, it ignores the incredibly complex and rich history of exchange between East and North Africa and South Asia. Though bindis have an important place in Hinduism, they are not only a symbol of Hindu spirituality, but also have important symbolic value and origin in Africa. Therefore, people of the African diaspora have the cultural right to wear bindis in the same way people of the South Asian diaspora have that right.
So next time you are quick to call out someone for culturally appropriating, ask yourself:
Do I know the full history of this symbol? Is it used in other cultures as well?
Do I know the identity of the person who I am accusing of being problematic, or am I assuming their identity?
By using or doing this symbol, is this person benefiting from it socially or economically while erasing the people who made it?
This isn't to say that people of color can't be problematic or appropriative. Cultural exchange is important to know, but sometimes people can just fuck up and are appropriative.
We can do this by exoticizing other cultures, and like whiteness, taking while erasing the bodies of others. For example, wearing Indigenous American headdresses because its ‘cool' or ‘pretty' when we are not Indigenous American (such as Pharrell Williams wearing a headdress). The erasure of Indigenous American bodies and culture is not figurative, but very literally enacted by the systematic genocide of indigenous people. Even if we (or our people) were not the ones to have orchestrated this systematic genocide, we live on stolen land and might be complicit in their erasure.
This is also true for the pervasive anti-blackness in Asian, Latino, and Indigenous cultures—the way that we can appropriate slang, dress, and black cultures while simultaneously erasing black people. Or the ways that we can benefit off of black civil rights struggle without contributing to it or fighting against anti-blackness.
Here are some guiding questions to ask yourself when you wonder if you are appropriating:
Why do I want to do this? Is it to be cool? Because it looks pretty? (Heads up: if it's just to be cool or look pretty, it's probably problematic)
Is this a symbol of a political statement? If so, do I align with the politics not in just dress and appearance, but in actual struggle and resistance?
Do I know the history of this symbol or where it comes from?
Have I been invited by a member of this community to participate in this this culture, word, or symbol?
What role has this symbol played in my own life?
Why do I feel entitled to this symbol?
When we approach each other with respect for cultures and struggles as well as the awareness that communities of color have historically been reliant on each other for survival in America, we are much more likely to be able to define the line of respect and appropriation. We can question and examine our own choices rather than assuming that we should have access to everything.

Julie Bishop confirms Kevin Rudd seeking nomination for UN secretary-general
Updated
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed former prime minister Kevin Rudd has asked the Federal Government to nominate him for United Nations secretary-general.
It brings to an end month of speculation over Mr Rudd's bid for the role, currently held by Ban Ki-Moon.
Mr Ban's successor will take office on January 1, 2017.
Ms Bishop said it would be a matter for the Cabinet.
"Kevin Rudd has requested that the Australian Government nominate him and, as the Prime Minister has indicated on a number of occasions, that'll be a matter for Cabinet," she told Sky News.
"I'll certainly put the matter forward."
When asked if he supported the nomination of Mr Rudd, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull replied: "As the Foreign Minister has said, and I think I've said on many occasions, this is a matter that we will consider in the Cabinet."
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten urged the Coalition to back Mr Rudd, saying he was "suitably qualified".
Mr Shorten added it would be "petty" for them to not support Mr Rudd's bid.
"I think Mr Turnbull should put the national interest first and support an Australian," he said.
"The Turnbull Government has to decide if it's an Australian Government or a Liberal Government.
"If it's an Australian Government, it will support the Australian. If it's a Liberal Government, it won't back the Australian because of petty political reasons.
"Australians have had enough of that."
Previously, South Australian Liberal senator Cory Bernardi urged Ms Bishop not to endorse a "dysfunctional", "vengeful", "unstable", "megalomaniac" like Mr Rudd.
Senator Bernardi told the ABC in February "the Australian public would be very disappointed if we endorsed such a person for this significant role".
If nominated, Mr Rudd will face former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, who announced her candidacy earlier this year.

These are unprecedented times in the Gulf as a deep political conflict pits Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain on one-side, and Qatar on the other. In this intensive face off, the first victim is the truth – a media war so vociferous and relentless in its scale and audacity that it is difficult to know where to start. It is also difficult accessing voices directly from the region because of the laws criminalising views expressing any sympathy or criticism of state policies with threats of 5 – 15 years imprisonment.
To help outsiders make sense of what is going on, a small army of Gulf experts working for Western think tanks are commonly drawn on by the mainstream media for comment. What isn't usually made clear however is that many of those Western think tanks — even the most prestigious — receive a not insignificant amount of patronage from the very Gulf states that are a party to the conflict being commented on. In December, for example, we showed, using leaked documents, that the International Institute for Strategic Studies was being bankrolled by the Bahraini government – up to half its funding over the past five years alone!
In this regard, we have compiled a short cheat sheet of the most prominent think tanks known to receive significant funding from Gulf states, or who have an international office in one of them. The list is by no means exhaustive and is it is largely based on self-disclosure by the think tanks. That a think tank receives financial patronage from a Gulf state does not automatically mean that all of its researchers are necessarily biased in favor of the patron, as there certainly are cases of researchers with a track record of independence and integrity. However, when the analysis of a think tank aligns with the views or interests of its financial patron, it should raise questions about whether the line between independent research and political lobbying or PR is being blurred.
This list is a work-in-progress and we welcome any further information or feedback to improve or correct it.

Behind the house, rescuers were digging in the mud, searching for three people who had last been seen in that area before the landslide. A rice paddy and the canal, which ran through the valley, had disappeared under the mud, residents said.
Mr. Sekara and other residents said they had lost hope that anyone else would be found alive. “There's no point in them going back looking for survivors,” he said. “You'd have to look 40 feet under the mud to find people.”
President Maithripala Sirisena toured the area on Wednesday, declaring on Twitter after the visit, “The loss is devastating.”
More than 1,000 people, displaced by the slides or fearful of returning until the rains subside, were being housed at four temporary camps. At one of those, in the village of Hathgampola, where 113 families were sheltering, survivors told of narrow escapes as the mountain gave way.
Dingiri Mahattaya, 63, said that she, her daughter and her son ran for their lives once they realized what was happening. “Big rocks started to roll down the hill with a fierce sound,” she said. “Some of the rocks hit the walls and windows of the house. We opened the front door and ran through the rice paddy to safety.”
She said she did not know when they would be able to return. “They tell me that my house is now filled with water and mud,” she said, “and the walls have collapsed.”
Meteorologists said that, although the tropical island frequently experiences intense monsoons and flooding, this year's devastation was unusually fierce for so early in the rainy season.
With his badge and gun and take-charge bearing, Steve Pancoast seemed like justice personified as he investigated the death of a World War II vet who had been parboiled in a whirlpool bath at an Oklahoma state veterans center back in 2012.
Pancoast had been widely described in the press as the chief investigator for the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs (ODVA), and he acted as well as looked the part.
His investigation established that 85-year-old Jay Minter had suffered second-degree burns over 50 percent of his body when he was placed in a whirlpool that lacked a working thermostat. Minter very well could have survived if he had been rushed to a hospital capable of treating him effectively.
But a physician's assistant named Ken Adams allegedly opted to keep Minter at the Claremore Veterans Center. Adams happened to be married to Cynthia Adams, the center's administrator at the time.
The next day, Minter died. Ken Adams filed a report with the ODVA attesting that the primary cause of death had been arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with the burns only a secondary factor. The medical examiner reached a different conclusion following an autopsy.
“Complications of thermal injuries,” the medical examiner reported, making no mention of the supposed heart disease.
In the course of the investigation, Pancoast decided that Ken Adams had also played a role in the death of 86-year-old Louis Arterberry at the center. The World War II vet is said to have been in need of urgent care following an apparent stroke, but Adams had allegedly been preoccupied with arranging what court papers term “a sexual liaison.”
Adams was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and caretaker neglect. He pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.
In the meantime, there has come another shocker. And this one concerns not a vet but Pancoast himself.
Last week, the Office of the Oklahoma State Attorney (OAG) announced that 31-year-old Pancoast had been arrested for impersonating a police officer, after he allegedly lied about being a certified cop.
He also was charged with possessing a weapon while a convicted felon. He was said to have neglected to tell his employers that he had served three years in prison for larceny and weapons possession in New Jersey in the 1990s, before he moved to Oklahoma.
On top of all that, the ODVA announced that Pancoast had never been an investigator at all and that the agency does not in fact have any investigators.
“We do not have an investigative unit, we do not have an investigator,” an ODVA spokesman told The Daily Beast last week. “That's a title that was never given by us.”
The spokesman said Pancoast's real title was “safety programs administrator,” with duties including fire drills and “non-skid in the shower rooms so that nobody slips and falls.”
“We take care of veterans,” the spokesman said. “We don't investigate crimes or possible crimes.”
The spokesman added, “If someone's carrying a badge, that's something he got on his own.”
The spokesman concluded, “It's a bizarre story.”
The bizarre becomes doubly so when you consider what recently ousted interim ODVA director John McReynolds was quoted as saying back in 2012 after questions arose over the agency's handling of abuse reports in its seven veterans centers.
“In most cases we have investigators assigned to each facility who are trained to conduct lesser investigations,” said McReynolds. “But if it requires someone outside the facility…then it goes to the administrator, who will call me and I'll dispatch Mr. Pancoast to that location and he will initiate the investigation.”
That is exactly what Pancoast did after the deaths of Minter and Arterberry. He was still doing it in June 2014, when he signed an affidavit for a warrant to search the residence of an American Legion official who was suspected of embezzlement.
As described in court papers, a fellow ODVA employee named Amanda Lomonaco saw Pancoast as he prepared to join cops from various jurisdictions in conducting the search.
“Lomonaco stated she had been present and had personally witnessed Pancoast wearing a police tactical uniform, a badge and a pistol on June 10, 2014, when he and several other police agency officers, including officers from Mustang Police Department, Oklahoma Highway Patrol and Office of Homeland Security served a search warrant,” the papers say.
The papers further describe Lomonaco as having “witnessed Pancoast wearing pistols to work almost every day for the past two years.”
“Lomonaco stated she had witnessed Pancoast in possession of a .223 caliber AR-15 type assault rifle as well as several shotguns,” the papers say. “She had seen Pancoast with three Glock semi-auto pistols he said he had received for Christmas, 2014.”
Pancoast again seemed the quintessential lawman after a Korean War vet named James Laughlin died from head trauma at the Norman Veterans Center in October of last year.
“I'll tell you what, he sure looked the part,” Joan Laughlin says of the man who announced to her that he would be investigating her husband's death. “He's very official looking. He impressed me.”
The widow says she had initially been told by the center that her husband had fallen out of bed and bumped his head. She reports that Pancoast discovered surveillance video that seems to suggest another story.
By Joan Laughlin's account, the video that Pancoast obtained and she subsequently viewed shows James Laughlin—who suffered from dementia—absently wandering into the room of a patient who was known to be violent.
She reports that the video then shows staff rushing into the room. They drag out a battered James Laughlin.
“[The violent patient] had like to beat him to death in there,” Joan Laughlin says.
She contends that the video shows the staff piling on James Laughlin as if he had been the assailant. They end up dragging him into his room and out of view of the cameras.
“I don't know what happened in there,” Joan Laughlin says.
She ventures a guess from his apparent condition afterward.
“They did worse than [the violent patient] did,” she says.
She scoffs at the staff's report that her husband had been “combative.”
“The most laid-back, meek little guy you ever saw, 123 pounds and he was feeble,” she says.
In her view, the investigation was well on the way to establishing the truth of her husband's death when she suddenly stopped hearing from Pancoast. She called his office and a woman answered.
“She said, ‘Well, I'll have him call you back,'” Joan Laughlin recalls.
The widow then got a call from the OAG.
“‘Sorry to tell you, but he's been fired,'” the window remembers being told.
She then learned that Pancoast had been arrested and that the investigator whom she had been speaking with for six months had not been an investigator at all.
“I just about went nuts,” the widow says. “I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it.”
As set forth in an Affidavit of Probable Cause filed by the OAG, its agents had been contacted by a senior ODVA official who asked them to take into Pancoast's credentials.
On March 9, the OAG's chief investigator interviewed Pancoast, seeking to confirm that he was a certified law enforcement officer, as he had claimed in court documents and on the witness stand. Pancoast allegedly replied in the affirmative, but said he had neither the certificate nor his Oklahoma driver's license with him.
Later that day, Pancoast hand-delivered to an OAG receptionist a photocopy of what he said were his law enforcement credentials. OAG investigators determined that the certification was in fact for a security guard and apparently bore a forged signature—it was dated after the supposed signatory ceased working at the certifying agency.
The affidavit says Pancoast told the OAG that his date of birth was March 11, 1974. A criminal record check showed that a Steven Pancoast—with matching fingerprints, but a date of birth of June 23, 1973—had served time in New Jersey from 1992 to 1996.
“Two felony convictions were noted on Pancoast's New Jersey criminal record," the affidavit says.
Pancoast was arrested, and he pleaded not guilty. He reportedly denied being the Steven Pancoast who had done time in New Jersey, despite the apparent fingerprint match.
“Don't believe everything you hear, man,” Pancoast told a reporter for The Oklahoman. “I'm saying it's false...I really don't want to be made out to be a bad guy because I'm not.”
Prosecutors sought to determine what impact the arrest might have on the cases that Pancoast worked, including the two outstanding murder charges against Adams.
And then there is the death of James Laughlin. His widow says she called the ODVA and was told to call the OAG, only to be told to call the ODVA.
She is left wondering if justice will ever be done now that the man who seemed like justice personified is himself under indictment. She is no less fervent in her belief that her husband should not have died the way he did.
“He did not deserve that,” she says. “He was a good guy. He never hurt anybody in his life.”
She is left with the letters he wrote to her as many as five times a day when he was off serving his country in time of war.
“‘To my dearest darling, I love you so much and I miss you so much,''” she recited last week.
An ODVA spokesman told The Daily Beast that the local district attorney had looked into the case and confirmed what ODVA had initially told Joan Laughlin.
“He fell in his room,” the spokesman said. “He fell backward and hit the back of his head. That is the cause of his death.”
The spokesman allowed that the ODVA had fired several nurses present at the time of the incident.
“Because that's obviously not the way we treat our veterans,” the spokesman said.
But the spokesman insisted that neither the nurses nor the encounter with the other patient were contributing factors to the patient's death.
“The altercation played no part in it,” the spokesman said.
That being the same spokesman who reported that Pancoast had never been an investigator and that the ODVA has no investigators.
The press and the recently ousted agency director have said otherwise.
What seems clear is that the ODVA has trouble keeping track not just of its vets but also of its own staff.
And where did Steve Pancoast get that badge, anyway?

Visit Salt Lake City in February, in inversion season, and you'll hardly see further than 50 yards. The rocky mountain ranges, the dozens of craft breweries, the looming Salt Laky City Temple are all shrouded in gravy-thick smog. But even through the haze, if you wound up at the intersection of 1300 South and 300 East, it's impossible not to see the Fun Time Kidz Day Care, a DayGlo-green building with purple doors and yellow trim around windows blocked with pictures that look like they've been torn out of old coloring books. There's a deserted playground out back which, if it existed in a Silent Hill game, would definitely be a place where a zombie child would lurch out at you.
Depending on who you ask, Fun Time is either a normal day care (albeit a slightly creepy one) or a cover-up for something insidious. Possibly a CIA black site, a drug front, or an organ harvesting operation. For the people who suspect something sinister, it's become the subject of an enduring mystery: What's going on in this building, and why has nobody seen kids come in or come out?
The Fun Time Kidz Day Care conspiracy began on January 25, 2015 when user discogodfather6922 posted a photo to Reddit. He wrote that he'd lived nearby for five years, but he'd never have seen any "kidz" having a "fun time" inside. (The original thread, now completely redacted, is preserved on Imgur.)
Soon, other Salt Lake City locals weighed in. One user had admitted to seeing children inside, despite the cardboard in the windows. Another user claimed to be a letter carrier who had been inside the day care and said it was fully functioning. "The only strange thing is," the user added, "no matter what time of day I showed up with their mail, it always seemed to be nap time." Another user claimed to know someone who broke into the facility out of curiosity and found one room with a "chair facing a TV displaying a live video of another room in the building."
Later, users claiming to live in the neighborhood chimed in to say the place was just a normal day care, swept up in paranoia from digital sleuths. But their defenses aroused suspicion from other users. "I'm just going to point out that every person in this thread saying this place is legit registered their accounts in the last 15 or so hours," posted a user called Gthing.
The conspiracy theories reached a fever pitch so quickly that after only a few days, Reddit admins deleted the original thread from r/saltlakecity. At that point, there were already hundreds of posts and users had begun harassing the business and posting personal information about the owner, which the admins said amounted to doxxing. Banning all discussion of the day care, the admins argued, was necessary to stop future "witch hunts" and to "[protect] personal information and the lives of innocent people."
But that didn't stop the conversation—in fact, it only fueled the suspicion. The original post, on the Salt Lake City subreddit, migrated to r/conspiracy, r/conspiro, and r/subredditdrama. Many users also pushed back on the administrator's decision, arguing they only posted publicly available information and never advocated that people harass the business. Later, the discussion moved to other sites. One 4chan user even posted photos taken through the building's windows.
On one of the threads, I noticed a familiar username—a Salt Lake City–based writer named Bryan Young, who I know through the alt weekly where I used to work. Young claimed to know the guy who owned the day care. "He's nice and nothing weird is going on there. He bought the day care for his mother and runs it at a loss so she has something to do," he posted. "Nothing nefarious. I've lived in that neighborhood for five years too and have seen people there."
I asked Young if he could put me in touch with the owner, but he told me that for the sake of his clients and their children, the owner didn't want any publicity. I called the owner anyway and he told the same thing, seemingly exasperated by all the interest in his business.
Indeed, the Reddit thread spurred a slew of harassing phone calls. One Redditor supposedly called the Salt Lake Tribune asking journalists to investigate the day care's connection to sex trafficking. People even showed up to peer into the windows, which made the place look even creepier. Megan Draper, who owns the hair salon across the street, told me she's seen many curiosity-seekers loitering around the place.
"They have people looking in the windows trying to see in there, and they look like creepy pedophile stalkers," Draper said. "That doesn't help the business."
But without the owner's insight, what would explain the creepy stillness of the place? The covered-up windows? The rumors of the chair facing the live video feed? The lack of sightings of children around the building? The refusal of the owner to comment? I decided to go through some public records to see if there was any documented explanation. The property is owned by Chunga International, LLC, and according to Utah Department of Commerce records, there have been two owners since 2012. I checked their names and the company name through state and federal court searches—nothing. The state health department site lists the owner's name as the director of the licensed day care facility, and the only citation against them is a complaint from 2014 for noxious weeds, the kind with thistles that can hurt people, in the outdoor play area. According to records, they resolved that problem within a month.
The paper trail seemed only to indicate a normal day care business—something neighbors have insisted both online and offline since the Reddit drama started. And while many Redditors said they'd never seen kids visiting the day care, some neighbors and nearby business owners say it operated like any other normal childcare facility—kids and all.
"It's really sad that people are making up this crazy FBI, bullshit story," said Joanna Black, who lives a few houses north of the facility. Sure, it's an "ugly, sad little building, with sad little windows," she said, but from her observations, it's also one that provides day care services to mostly low-income families.
Another neighbor, Gregory Dolan, admitted he'd never seen kids go in, but he's pretty sure there's nothing suspicious going on inside. "What you find in a lot of these local legends [is they're started] by an ignorant person who doesn't know what's going on," Dolan said. That said, he conceded the place was "creepy as hell."
And perhaps that's it—our hunger for the strange, bizarre, and fantastical can outweigh the more boring truth. The conspiracy against Fun Time took a peculiar building and turned it into a larger-than-life legend, much like shadows on a wall appear large and scary, and take on an entirely different shape than the objects they come from. "They have these steel spring playground animals," Dolan said, "and on a winter night, or any night really, when it's desolate, those things take on a creepy vibe."

Now that he rules the comedy roost, Louis C.K. is finally releasing his unseen, black-and-white movie from 1998 that features young stars-in-the-making in J.B. Smoove, Steve Carrell, Amy Poehler, and Wanda Sykes. The star of FX's Louie took to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno last night to pitch his 15-year-old film, Tomorrow Night, which will debut on his website in February and can be downloaded for a $5 fee. A fresh look at the movie's trailer shows a veritable who's who of modern comedy, and explains why the movie is now being released. At the same time, the trailer's weirdness pretty well explains why it has taken so long for the movie to reach a wider audience.
Quasi-sexual ice cream seats and creepy old people romance doesn't often make for a blockbuster. So, yeah, despite (because?) of the now-big comedy names, the film looks a bit bizarre. Though the movie premiered at Sundance in 1998, it was never released beyond that. Let Louie himself explain why: "It was a black-and-white movie, and when I made it I wasn't anybody. It was shrewd," he joked.
But oh, those now-recognizable faces do make the film look like an intriguing project. There's a screaming, open-mouthed Carrell, officially billed as "Mail Room Guy Without Glasses" on the IMDB. There are plenty of shots of J.B. Smoove as the sassy mailman, and an uncredited Wanda Sykes alongside him. And a big-haired Conan O'Brien appears as well, portraying himself on stage.

In August 1999, Joshua David walked into a community board meeting in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood.
People were debating what to do with an old, elevated rail track that ran through the neighborhood between Gansevoort and 34 Street. It had been abandoned since 1980. Before that, it was built to haul goods into the city's meatpacking district.

David thought it was kind of a cool old relic, and he thought other people would feel the same.
"I went into that meeting thinking, 'Oh, we'll find some historic preservation group that's all into this,'" David tells weekends on All Things Considered guest host Laura Sullivan. "We'll just give them 20 bucks, lick a few envelopes and feel good about it."
But there were no groups. No one wanted to save the old track — except for one other guy at the meeting, Robert Hammond.
Neither David nor Hammond had ever been to a community board meeting before, but they exchanged business cards and decided to start a nonprofit, Friends of the High Line. With a few more meetings and some fliers, they thought, maybe they could convince the city not to demolish the old track.
"My mom asked me, 'What's the chances of it happening?'" Hammond says. "I said, 'You know, 1 in 100.'"
It took 10 years of fundraising, permit applications, feasibility studies, and wooing city and state officials, but Hammond and David beat those odds. They tell the story of how they did it in a book out next month, High Line: The Inside Story of New York City's Park in the Sky.
Early Opposition
Today, the High Line is one of Manhattan's most popular public spaces: a mile-long, modern, high-concept park built on the old railroad track. In the 10 months after it opened in 2009, it drew 2 million visitors and — in a rare ratio for a public space in New York — about half were tourists. Half were native New Yorkers.
There are hints in the modern park of the High Line's history: You can see the original rail tracks sticking out from areas of shrubs and trees. These rails date back to the 1930s, when they carried trains loaded with goods into the meatpacking district on tracks that ran along 10th Avenue.
The last train ran in 1980. "It was a trainload of frozen turkeys coming into the meat market," Hammond says, "to give New Yorkers turkeys for Thanksgiving."
Over the next 20 years, many people in the neighborhood came to view the High Line as an eyesore and wanted it torn down. Many thought it was holding up development of the neighborhood.
"Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani really wanted to demolish the High Line," Hammond says. "One of his last acts in office — two days before he left — was signing the demolition order."
By that time, Hammond and David had the support of Chelsea's gay and art communities. The two eventually gained support from celebrities like fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and actor Edward Norton, both of whom contributed to a growing list of benefactors funding legal efforts to save the High Line.
Early on, no one had any big plans for a park. They just wanted to keep the track around.
Rail-Banked
For Hammond and David, the "holy grail" of saving the High Line was something called a Certificate of Interim Trail Use, or CITU.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jeffrey Donenfeld/Friends Of The High Line Jeffrey Donenfeld/Friends Of The High Line
Issued by the Surface Transportation Board, a CITU allows the government to "bank" out-of-use rail corridors as trails on the grounds that the country might need them again. The term of art is "rail-banking." Without a certificate to rail-bank it, the land beneath the High Line would have been lost to local owners and developers.
"We originally thought we could just apply and get one, they way you'd send away for a prize by mailing in a couple of cereal box tops," David writes in High Line.
After five years of fundraising, permit applications and even a lawsuit against the city, they had their CITU authorizing development of two-thirds of the full High Line.
"Nothing more stood in our way," David writes. "We could break ground."
A few years later, Hammond and David were on a roll. They'd settled on a design team to work around a "wildscape" of weeds and wildflowers. They'd secured both city and federal funding, including $18 million that came with the help of then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.
They'd wooed the Bloomberg administration with an economic feasibility study that showed the High Line would easily double its original $150 million cost in tax revenue from increased property values in the area. (That revenue figure has since been raised to nearly half a billion dollars.)
Still Wild
If you start at its southern terminus and walk the entire length of the High Line, you eventually arrive at a locked fence at 30th Street. Hammond and David have the combination.
One the other side is the final, undeveloped third stretch of the High Line. It goes all the way around Manhattan's west side rail yards.
Hammond and David are trying to secure development rights for this part of the High Line. For now, it's just the way they found it years ago: nothing but rusty railroad tracks and waist-high weeds.
"To me," Hammond says on a tour of the site, "this was the magic we wanted to save. Like right now, we're alone. It's just us, up here [in] this private garden right in the middle of New York."
Hammond says he was always secretly fearful he wouldn't like the new park as much as the old, secret High Line.

"What's made me so happy is that I like the new park better," he says. "The design influences the way people interact.
"I always notice when you're up on the High Line you see people holding hands. And you don't see that, just in people walking down the street. New Yorkers don't do it. But on the High Line they hold hands, and so I think that's the testimony of it really working."
There's just something about the woods. They have an air of mystery and adventure coupled with a sense of comfort that I adore. I used to love playing in the woods when I was growing up (which is one of the perks of growing up out in the sticks). Almost any day I wasn't in school would find me packing my lunch and disappearing into the woods, only coming back when the sun was starting to set. So of course, when I found out Solstice Scents was releasing a woodland collection, I needed it.
The Business Side of Things:
I ordered a sample set of five and requested every Woodland collection scent except Grey's Cabin. I don't generally like cocoa/chocolate scents, so I chose to leave that one out.
Shipping was fast, as per usual! I made my order on January 17th and it was picked up on the 21st (which does seem like longer than usual, but remember there was a holiday in there). USPS did their thing and got everything to me in a timely manner.
Now, into the woods!
White Fox:
Notes:
Vanilla Musk, White Fur, Wood Blend, Frozen Dirt, Snow.
Random Thoughts:
This is such a sexy scent to me! I immediately put it all over my skin when I smelled the sample vial. I might actually cry if there's no re-stock of this I fell all over myself to get a full size of this in the random re-stock on the 25th (AND SUCCEEDED), and I have zero qualms with declaring that this is my new favorite. It smells very sweet in a crystalline sort of way – a bit tinkly, if you will. Under that, though… there's this spicy, musky, dangerous edge that keeps this feeling very skin-like.
Looking back at the notes, I can kind of get where the “frozen dirt” note might come into play with the vanilla musk and make something wonderfully, dangerously, affair-esque-ly skin-like happen. It's like having a sexy romp in the dirt …. in the woods …on a snowy day… I don't know, just go with it!
Winter Dove:
Notes:
Vanilla Crystals, Spicy Carnation, Nutmeg, Cream.
Random Thoughts:
This perfume… it's messing with me. It's the entire reason it's taken me so long to get this review together. I just couldn't decide if I liked it or not, so I had to set it aside for a couple of weeks and come back to it. Jury's still out, but I think it's okay… First applied, it's floral, spicy, and creamy; sweet with a touch of earthiness behind it. It stays pretty true throughout. When I had first gotten this, I kept psyching myself out. I kept thinking this was going the play-doh way, even when co-workers smelled me and assured it wasn't at all. After setting it aside and trying it again, my fears were quelled. While I don't know that I'll reach for it super often, I think I'll keep this one around, see if it grows on me some more.
Night Watcher:
OH, COME ON! I couldn't do it! If you expected something other than exactly this, you definitely over- (or under-) estimated me!
Notes:
Forest Floor, Tree Tops, Bark, Mountain Air, Fir Balsam, Juniper, Moss, Oud, Dried Herbs, Cedar Tips.
Random Thoughts:
This is a deeply woodsy scent; a trip into the deeper parts of the forest, if you will. When will I reach for it? When I'm yearning for the deepest, most mysterious part of the woods. That's what this scent is. It's the oldest, most twisted trees. The damp earth, moss, and other plants around them lend this rich earthiness that's so realistic. You can feel this forest living and breathing around you. There's something weaving in and out that's almost spicy but altogether comforting. This, reader, is the part of the woods where anything can happen.
[Yes, I was singing songs from Into the Woods When I was typing this. What of it?!]
Hidden Lodge:
Notes:
Dry Wood Blend, Oud, Woodsmoke, Spices, Castoreum (Botanical Interpretation).
Random Thoughts:
Oh, reader. You know I love smoky scents, don't you? If you didn't I should just throw that in right here. Darling Clandestine's Carny Wedding is one of my all-time favorites, and I desperately want to get my hands on Long Winter Farm's Bonfire. Hidden Lodge… it's right up my alley. The wood note seems a bit bright and the smoky note makes it reminiscent of a roaring bonfire. It's a very cozy scent. There's also something smooth hanging out in the mix, but don't mistake smooth for creamy or sweet. This isn't a sweet blend, it's just good old outdoorsy fun! With fire. It makes me think of being in a cabin in the Great Smokey Mountains with a fireplace roaring.
Monarch:
Notes:
Rich Red Musk, Fir, Juniper, Cedar, Frankincense, Labdanum, Moss.
Random Thoughts:
Ah, juniper. I'm a big fan of its almost-berry/fern/piney smell. This perfume is a mix of woodsy smells and juniper when first applied, maybe with a bit of moss or lichen hanging around in the background.
After a bit, the juniper smell dies down and almost disappears. A raw, deep musk comes up to mingle with the woody note – this turns into what is (to me) a bold, slightly woody, skin-like scent. I enjoyed the first phase of this scent more than the second, but this is still a pretty wonderful smell! As with most of the scents in this collection, Monarch is a comforting smell to me.
Bonus Round: Rose Mallow Cream:
Notes:
Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk.
Random Thoughts:
Every once in awhile, I'll get it into my head to try out a rose scent. My grandmother was an avid gardener. Green thumb doesn't even begin to touch her ability – she was magical when it came to growing things! Every year, she would get her Burpee catalog in and I would sit with her and try to talk her into ordering all the flowers I thought were the most awesome-looking. There were some flowers that were always in the lineup, though, and one of them was roses. She grew these great big rose bushes outside of every house we ever lived in (which is impressive, because we moved around quite a bit). I miss the smell of roses blooming outside the window, hence why I occasionally give a rose perfume a go. Most of the time they turn play-doh-y on me.
In the vial, the play-doh smell reigned king. On my skin, it's there for a bit and then it just fades to a point where it's almost present, but not quite. It's that word that's on the tip of your tongue and you just can't say it. Aside from that note, everything settled into a light, fresh floral scent. It was definitely sweet, but I didn't detect any (distinctly) marshmallow smells at any point. I think this is a pretty scent, but it seems that 99% of floral perfumes just aren't my cup of tea; I think I'll have to count this one into that mix.
Bonus Round, Pt 2: Cellar
Notes:
Damp Earth and Stone, Wooden Casks, Cool Fall Air, Crisp Apple, Pear and Broom Corn.
Random Thoughts:
This is the cellar I want in my hypothetical future mystery mansion (that will be left to me via the will of some distant relative). It's bright: herbal, fruity, earthy, and warm. Yet I never lose sight of the fact that this scent is, indeed, underground somewhere, surrounded by stone walls with timber beams running across the ceiling. Pretty quickly, pear comes to the forefront of the scent, and it melds beautifully with all the other notes. I feel like this will be a scent to bring a little umph into more mellow days. Definitely very Autumnal.

The battle between Apple and Qualcomm over patent royalty payments continues, with Qualcomm devoting the first 20 minutes of its hour-long quarterly earnings call to discussing the dispute, notes CNET.
NordVPN
Bring it on, Apple — at least, that's what Qualcomm's top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers's licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier.
The dispute began when the FTC accused Qualcomm of engaging in anti-competitive practices by insisting on being Apple's exclusive supplier of baseband processors in return for reduced patent royalties. Apple then sued Qualcomm for around a billion dollars, accusing it of withholding a $1B rebate.
Qualcomm described the accusations as baseless and said that Apple ‘misrepresented facts.' The company later said that it was considering a countersuit against Apple. Instead, Apple filed a second lawsuit, this time in China, seeking a further $140M in damages.
Apple started using Intel 4G LTE chips in the iPhone 7/Plus, but because these chips include technology patented by Qualcomm, it has to pay a royalty to the company. Mollenkopf claimed that the royalty rate the company demanded was reasonable given the money that Apple makes from using the technology.
“They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology.” While the value of Qualcomm's patents have “tangibly and meaningfully increased over time,” it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added.
The company did, however, strike a conciliatory note in repeating earlier assurances that it would continue to supply Apple with chips during the dispute, and that it was confident the issue would be resolved.
I'm confident we'll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past.
Apple referred CNET to an earlier statement.
LEGO brick artist Jason Corlett has recreated Pacific Rim's Cherno Alpha as a custom three-foot tall model.
Pacific Rim was easily one of 2013's most enjoyable films and it's not all that hard to pin down why. Put succinctly, when the core concept of your film is giant robots pummeling skyscraper-sized monsters you're immediately scoring some major points on the awesome scale. It didn't hurt, of course, that the movie's mecha were some of the coolest in recent memory. Gipsy Danger, Crimson Typhoon, Striker Eureka; they all looked the part of slick, powerful fighting machines perfect for the task of beating giant monsters into submission.
And then there's Cherno Alpha. The oldest Jaeger featured in the film, Cherno Alpha is slow, bulky and cumbersome. That being the case, I'd be lying if I were to say it wasn't my favorite of Pacific Rim's robot roster. Sure, it lacks the shine and polish of the other Jaegirs, but in a lot of ways that's its charm. It's like the Serenity in Firefly; it just wouldn't be as lovable if it didn't have that past-its-prime look.
Luckily for me, I'm not alone in my preference for the little Russian Jaeger that could. LEGO artist Jason Corlett, for instance, recently completely a build project transforming Cherno Alpha into a custom model nearly three feet in height. The build itself involved "no-less than 5,000 pieces" and took "roughly 70 hours to build." All in all, it's a nice a model that does a great job of emulating the design of the movie. Check it out and let us know what you think. For my part, I'm hoping that Corlett decides to continue with even more Jaeger models.

Updating apps on your Android phone or tablet can be a double-edged sword. Sure, there's the promise of new and exciting features, but there is also the risk that an option you particularly loved has been removed. There is no way to roll back to a previous version of an app in Android, but this is something that AppWereRabbit rectifies.
AppWereRabbit can auto backup Android app before they get updated so you can revert back to an older version if you are not happy with the latest version.
Start by heading over to Google Play and grab yourself a copy of the app.
Once installed, you'll initially be presented with a list of all of the apps you have installed. At first glance, this may seem like information that's available elsewhere in Android, but it's handy to be able to see not only the names of all your apps, but also details of how much space they're taking up and when you installed them.
At the bottom of the screen, you'll also find an overview of the amount of free space you have left. Any apps that you have installed on your SD card will be highlighted in green.
There are now a number of options available to you. Tap on the name of an individual app and you'll be given the opportunity to uninstall, launch, back it up and much more. If you want to keep a copy of the associated APK, select the the “Export apk” option.
The export option is different from backing up. Export the apk and you can then reinstall the app from scratch without the need to re-download it. The backup option enables you to save a copy of the app in its current state so you can roll back if you update and decide you don't like the latest version.
These are obviously useful options, but they require a degree of planning to use them. Thankfully AppWererabbit can help to automate the backup process for you.
Auto backup
At the main screen of the app, swipe from left to right to pull out the left hand menu.
Scroll down through the list of options and tap “Settings” and then scroll down before tapping “Basic”. In the “Backup” section, use the “Backup folder” option to choose where backups should be stored and then scroll down to the “Auto Backup” section.
Tick the box labelled “Auto backup” and you'll no longer have to worry about manually backing up an app before updating it – it will all be taken care of for you automatically every time you update an app through Google Play.
Backing up apps can use up a lot of space and you can help to keep this under control by limiting the number of backup versions that are created.
By default, AppWererabbit will store up to 50 versions of an app before starting to purge the older backups. This could mean you quickly eat through a great deal of storage space, particularly for app that are updated frequently.
Within Settings, tap the “Maximum version limit” entry and choose a new setting.
Restoring App
When the time comes to restore an app that you have backed up – be it manually or through automatic versioning – this is easily done.
Pull out the left hand menu and select the “Backuped Apps” option. Here you'll find a list of all of the apps you have backed up. Tap an app you are interested in and you can opt to install it from Google Play, or tap “View versions” to select one of your backups.
Versioning and backing up are great ways to ensure that you always have access to the apps you need. There's no need to worry about whether an app is going to disappear from Google Play, or if a feature you love is removed.
This is just a sample of what can be achieved with AppWererabbit. There's more to explore, but this is arguably the most useful feature.
You're fenced! Donald Trump puts up barrier and trees around Scottish neighbour's home... and then sends him the bill
As neighbourly disputes go, it is certainly one of David and Goliath proportions.
David Milne, 46, from Scotland, whose house is next to Donald Trump's proposed golf course, was shocked when the American tycoon put up a fence around the property - and then billed him for it.
Mr Milne and 'The Donald' have been at loggerheads for years after the landowner refused to sell his house to Trump in order to expand his lavish course.
Fenced in: David Milne, whose house sits next to Donald Trump's proposed Scottish golf course, was stunned when the American tycoon put up a fence around his property
Trump's contractors erected the fence and planted dozens of trees around Mr Milne's house before sending an invoice for £2820 ($4,600) - half the total amount of the cost.
'There is no way I'm going to pay it,' Mr Milne told the Scottish Daily Record.
'As far as I'm concerned it's just another attempt to intimidate and bully me. But it's not going to work. I'm not paying any attention to it at all.'
Not budging: Mr Milne, left, was even more shocked to receive an invoice and letter, right, asking him to pay for half the cost of the fence and a series of trees that Trump had installed
Trump is currently building what he has dubbed the 'best golf course in the world'.
The entire development spans some 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of land on the north-east coast of Aberdeenshire.
Trump has planning permission to build two championship courses, a lavish hotel, clubhouse and 950 houses on the Menie Estate.
Home: The neighbours have been at loggerheads for years after Trump offered to buy Mr Milne out for 15 per cent more than the going rate for his home
But the American has also applied for planning permission for adjoining land, on which Mr Milne's home at Hermit Point stands.
Trump has branded it 'ugly' in the past but health and safety adviser Mr Milne has lived there for nearly 20 years with his wife Moira and has no plans to move.
in 2009 Trump tried to buy Mr Milne and three other homeowners out by offering 15 per cent more than the asking price for their houses.
Uncanny: Donald Trump, seen here promoting his development, is remarkably similar to the puppet in the video
Plan: An artist's impression of the proposed 500-hectare (1,235-acre) site that will incorporate two championship courses, a lavish hotel, clubhouse and 950 houses
Neighbours: Just a few fields separate Trump's proposed golf complex and Mr Milne's property near Aberdeen, Scotland
But Mr Milne said the offer was 'somewhere between laughable and insulting' at the time.
Now it seems The Donald has changed tact by trying to block Mr Milne out altogether.
'I could not believe it when the bill arrived,' he said. 'I priced the materials and I could put up the whole fence on my own for about £800.
'It's made from the cheapest stuff available but that's the kind of standard we've come to expect from Mr Trump and his organisation.'
The resort is due to open next summer but Mr Milne believes it is behind schedule.
'I think they've underestimated the Scottish weather,' he told the Record.
Calls to the Trump organisation were not immediately returned.

According to this, 53-year-old Youssif Z. Omar was seen pulling his 14-year-old daughter's hair and slapping her in front of her high school because she wasn't wearing a hijab. Someone called the police, who arrested Omar for child abuse. Officer Latisha Stroer, who made the arrest, said that Omar grabbed the girl “very violently by the hair and pulled her down a flight of stairs.
Here's the thing that gets me about stories like this – liberals act like Islam is just another faith like Christianity and Judaism and we have to be understaaaaaanding that their culture is different than ours and turn a blind eye when crap like this happens. It's just their tradition to beat the living daylights out of their kids and women when they aren't doing Islam just the right way. But when Christians start talking about “hate the sin, love the sinner” (whether it's gay marriage or abortion or divorce or stealing a dollar for a pack of gum or whatever), we're being preachy and judgey and that's not what Jesus would do, is it?
It's the double standards that never end.
A small airplane landed on Ga. 316 in Gwinnett County on Monday afternoon, police said.
The plane is registered to a Buford man, FAA records show. It appears to be designed to look like a Messerschmitt BF 109, a plane used by Nazi Germany in World War II. The design includes a swastika on the plane's tail.

The aircraft landed safely just before 1 p.m. and there were no injuries reported, according to Gwinnett County police. The plane landed on the highway near Harbins Road, the same intersection where an accident involving a milk truck spill snarled traffic earlier this month.
Fred Meyer, who was piloting the plane, was the only person on board. He does not own the aircraft but built the engine and helps take care of the maintenance, he told Channel 2 Action News.
“The engine just quit, it just died,” Meyer told Channel 2. “You just sort of fall back on your training at that point in time. You dont think of the circumstances, you just think of your training.”
The landing took place about three miles east of the Gwinnett County Airport at 12:45 p.m. After the landing near Dacula, the plane was pulled into the median.
The plane was described by a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman as a “Sonex experimental, amateur-built aircraft.” Sonex is a company that sells kits that allow people to build their own airplanes.
Meyer told Channel 2 the Nazi design was “just for fun.”
“A lot of people like to paint these planes up like old war birds,” Meyer said.

In other Gwinnett news:
In February of 2003, Hessam Ghane, an unemployed chemist, sat alone in his apartment in Independence, Missouri, grappling with the familiar clutch of depression. He called a crisis hotline and told the counselor who answered that he was considering suicide. After he hung up, two police officers arrived at his door. Ghane asked to be taken to a hospital with a psychiatric unit. The officers drove him to a nearby medical center in Kansas, where an emergency-room assistant asked Ghane if he had a way to take his life. Ghane admitted that he had a stolen jar of potassium cyanide for that purpose, but he didn't want to surrender it. “I don't want to give it up, because I might use it later,” he recalled telling the assistant.
Three months later, federal prosecutors charged Ghane with violating the federal law that codifies the Chemical Weapons Convention, the global disarmament treaty that the United States ratified in 1997. The convention, which built on earlier, weaker pacts, was intended to eradicate chemical weapons worldwide and is now being enforced in Syria. The signatory nations—there are a hundred and ninety of them—must adopt domestic laws to implement and enforce the treaty within their own borders. Ghane's cyanide was a chemical weapon, the prosecutors claimed, and possessing it for a non-peaceful purpose—even if his purpose was only to harm himself—was illegal under the law. In December, 2010, after Ghane had spent almost eight years in pre-trial detention facilities, a jury convicted him. He was sentenced to ninety-seven months in federal prison—nearly the amount of time that he had already spent behind bars.
Ghane, who goes by “Sam,” had an unwelcome reminder of his case last week when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the conviction of Carol Anne Bond, who had been prosecuted under the same law. Her case, in which she tried to use chemicals to harm her husband's paramour, became a cause célèbre among some libertarian constitutional scholars as an example of overreaching treaty power. In the long-awaited ruling, the justices found that Bond's crime was a simple assault that should have been handled by local law enforcement, and that her prosecution under the Chemical Weapons Convention was a misapplication of the law. “In sum, the global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the Federal Government to reach into the kitchen cupboard, or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.
Those words have an ironic, albeit unintentional, double meaning in the context of Ghane's case, because he kept the jar of the potassium cyanide in a bag under his kitchen sink. Ghane had hoped that the ruling would vindicate him. Instead, the majority ruling that tossed out Bond's conviction specifically cited Ghane's case as an example of a justified prosecution under the law, lumping him in with white supremacists who tried to get their hands on explosives and chemical weapons, and another man who released a chlorine gas cloud in a residential neighborhood.
Ghane has long insisted that he only kept the chemical for the purpose of killing himself. Even before the ruling, he felt deeply aggrieved that his conviction had pushed him into the ranks of the infamous few accused of hoarding and using chemical weapons, such as Bashar al-Assad. “It's a joke to me,” Ghane told me over Skype from his lawyer's office several months ago. “But what can I do? I'm one person, the bottom of the ladder.”
Ghane is among only a handful of domestic prosecutions since Congress passed the chemical-weapons statute in 1998. In one case, in Albany, New York, a man sprinkled mercury around a hospital with which he had a billing dispute. In Tucson, Arizona, a man released a chlorine gas cloud at a former customer's home. A neo-Nazi in Tennessee was convicted for trying to obtain nerve agents from a military arsenal in Arkansas. Ghane's case—though its circumstances are unusual—probably would have remained nothing more than a strange footnote in the history of chemical weapons disarmament but for the Bond case.
Bond gained notoriety in part because of the lurid details of the case—a jilted wife, a sordid affair, an out-of-wedlock child—but also because some conservative legal scholars believed that the domestic implementation law should have been struck down on constitutional grounds. That argument, notably made by Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, was that the implementation law created a new, unconstitutional federal power. If the court took that position, many supporters of the law warned, other treaty laws could have been challenged on the same grounds. But that didn't happen; instead the six-justice majority essentially sidestepped the constitutional question, ruling that Congress never intended the law to apply to “a purely local matter.”
The prosecutor's case against Bond, as in Ghane's, centered on the convention's ban on using chemical weapons and their toxic components for anything other than “peaceful purposes.” The convention and the statute that implements it in the U.S. intentionally make no distinction between stockpiling warheads full of sarin and hoarding a stolen jar of chemicals. The framers of the convention deliberately made the pact as broad and as strict as possible, to stamp out even the most tentative first steps toward gathering precursor chemicals for weapons.
Barry Kellman, the director of the International Weapons Control Center at the DePaul University College of Law, told me that even before the U.S. ratified the convention, international-law experts considered the possibility that minor cases could arise because of the convention's strict edicts against possessing toxic chemicals. In the nineties, he headed a group of legal experts who wrote a manual on implementing the treaty. Kellman said that the group wondered if the treaty's provisions might result in prosecutions for minor infractions. They even discussed a hypothetical scenario—a woman serving poisoned pasta to her husband. In the end, the group dismissed that possibility, assuming that prosecutors would not pursue such cases. Kellman remains adamant that the law needs to be as strict as possible to be effective, but said that it wasn't intended for cases like Bond's or Ghane's. Prosecuting such cases is a “distraction” from the real purpose of the law, which is pursuing offenders like Assad, Kellman told me.
“Nobody thought that it would arise,” Kellman said. “We were all talking about something that we didn't think was going to happen.”
Whether it is peaceful to contemplate using toxic chemicals for suicide is a macabre ethical and philosophical question. Its legality under the convention, though, is not in doubt, at least in the eyes of federal prosecutors. Ghane's problems had begun long before he arrived at the hospital in Kansas. Born in Iran, he left the country in the nineteen-seventies to seek better job prospects in the United States. He earned a Ph.D. in chemistry from Louisiana State University and became a U.S. citizen. After Ghane moved to Missouri, in 1992, to take a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the corps fired him less than a year later. He performed poorly at work, his superiors claimed, and he had made threats that his then-girlfriend had reported. Ghane accused the corps of discrimination, and filed a lawsuit that a judge dismissed in 1997. As part of numerous hospital admissions for depression and thoughts of suicide, doctors noted his paranoid delusions about government persecution. After he ranted during one hospitalization about the judge who had thrown out his employment lawsuit, the F.B.I. questioned him. Around 2000, Ghane stole the potassium cyanide from a college where he had taught chemistry; he was worried, he testified in his trial, that his depression might become too much to bear..
Then came the 2003 call to the crisis hotline. The day after Ghane told the physician's assistant about his cyanide, a psychiatrist interviewed him in the hospital's locked ward. Ghane had seen the same doctor many times before, and had mentioned the cyanide to him at least once, when he was suicidal the previous year. In this visit, Ghane was more irritable and angry than usual, the doctor noted. Ghane railed against the Corps of Engineers and then blurted, “You know I have access to chemicals.” This time, the doctor was unnerved enough to alert the hospital and police, with Ghane's permission. Also with Ghane's consent, police searched his apartment and seized the cyanide from under his sink. He was indicted and arrested that May. In jail, his mental health deteriorated sharply, and litigation over his competence ping-ponged through the courts. The government's case seemed to be bolstered by testimony from a jailhouse informant, who produced a sketch Ghane made in jail purporting to show a plan to pump cyanide gas into a courthouse.
In early 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found Ghane competent to stand trial. The proceedings began that September. Ghane's attorneys sought to discredit the informant, arguing that he had tricked Ghane into making the drawing. Prosecution witnesses testified that Ghane's cyanide was enough to have killed hundreds of people. The jury deadlocked, resulting in a mistrial. During Ghane's second trial, in late November of that year, the prosecutors dropped the informant and the sketch from their case; they emphasized, instead, the testimony from the hospital psychiatrist along with Ghane's own words about suicide, and the dangers that the cyanide posed to first responders.
In his closing arguments, the prosecutor returned to Ghane's suicide attempt itself: that alone, he argued, was a non-peaceful purpose. “The evidence here today and the evidence over the last few days has been why he wanted to use it, which was to kill himself,” he said. “An act of violence on himself that would put others at risk.” Questions from the jury room indicated that they struggled with whether “peaceful purposes” included suicide, but, on December 1st, the jury voted to convict him. About two months after he was sentenced, he was released to a half-way house. The prosecutor, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed.
Ghane has exhausted all his appeals, including an unsuccessful petition to have his case heard by the Supreme Court. One of Ghane's attorneys, Justin Johnston, said that he may try to get Ghane's conviction set aside with a legal tactic called a writ of error coram nobis, a kind of legal Hail Mary intended to convince the courts that new evidence proves an error was made in the trial. In rare occasions that such writs are granted, it is when a “manifest injustice” has been done. The ruling and its reference to Ghane's case now muddies that plan. Johnston said in an e-mail, though, that he's still considering it. “I'm disappointed that the complicated facts of Dr. Ghane's case were reduced to a parenthetical that misses the mark. The evidence was not that Dr. Ghane intended to harm 450 people. He initially intended to harm no one but himself, and his decision to seek help showed that he ultimately intended to harm no one at all,” Johnston wrote.
Before the ruling, Ghane described his life today as “tranquil.” He lives in a retirement home in Independence. He gathers with his fellow residents for a morning coffee, before leaving on the bus to look for jobs at an employment agency or to go grocery shopping. A self-admitted news junkie, he watches CNN and listens to radio news in the afternoons, and then prepares Iranian meals for dinner. He takes in movies when he can.
The Bond reversal, with its damning parenthetical, reignited Ghane's anguish. He remains adamant that he never sought to harm anyone—with the exception, possibly, of himself—and told me that the only reason he didn't want to give up his cyanide was that he had suicide on the mind. “I didn't know going to a hospital and saying that ‘I'm suicidal, please help me,' is going to get me eight years in prison,” he said.

After the Axis powers were defeated and the victorious democracies began rebuilding an open world order, it took decades for the flow of trade, money and people to regain momentum. Global trade did not recover to its 1914 peak until the 1970s, and capital mobility — the scale and ease of money flows — did not recover until the 1990s. Once these flows gained speed, however, they thundered along right up to the financial crisis.
Today, 2008 looks to be as clear a turning point as 1914. With global demand weak, and many nations erecting import barriers, trade is slumping. Measured as a share of global gross domestic product, trade doubled from 30 percent in 1973 to a high of 60 percent in 2008. But it faltered during the crisis and has since dropped to 55 percent.
The flow of capital — mainly bank loans — is retreating even faster. Frozen by the financial crisis and squeezed afterward by new regulations, capital flows have since slumped to just under 2 percent of G.D.P. from a peak of 16 percent in 2007.
The flow of people is slowing, too. Despite the flood of refugees into Europe, net migration from poor to rich countries decreased to 12 million between 2011 and 2015, down by four million from the previous five years. Between 2009 and 2014, the number of Mexicans leaving the United States outnumbered new arrivals by 140,000, and that was before Mr. Trump's first anti-Mexican tirades.
In an echo of the 1930s, the slowing of trade, global investment and migration are further weakening the global economy. There are many reasons to expect that this new age of deglobalization will last, as the postwar order is under assault from both popular autocrats in emerging powers like Russia and China, and populist candidates in Western democracies.
The recent trade boom was fueled by relatively simple deals that cut import tariffs. But trade deals have become more complex, and now take much longer to complete. At the same time, the world's major economies have imposed hundreds of protectionist measures since 2008, led by India, Russia, China and the United States. And once such protectionist walls spring up around one industry, they tend to grow and spread to other industries.
Changes in China's economy will further slow trade. When China opened up in the 1980s, its vast population turbocharged global trade almost overnight. Nations all over the world prospered by supplying raw materials and parts to plants in China, and later in countries like Poland and Mexico. Before 2008, much of the global trade boom involved intermediate goods traveling within these supply chains. But this trend has reversed. Supply chains are contracting, particularly as China moves to make its economy less dependent on trade, and its factories learn to make more parts at home.
It was this week 20 years ago that Sega launched its Saturn console in the US, bringing forward the date by several months to beat the original PlayStation to market. Starved of software support and with only a few retailers on board, the ploy failed, and Sony's machine marched to victory.
But the Saturn was a really interesting console, with dozens of great games that still hold up today. Occasionally, they turn up as digital downloads on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, but the best way to experience them is on the original machine – as long as you have some space under your TV.
Sega Saturn: how one decision destroyed PlayStation's greatest rival Read more
The cheapest and easiest option is to pick up a UK PAL console on eBay for around £60-70 – they will often come with a few staple games like Virtua Fighter 2, Sega Rally and Nights into Dreams, and at least one controller. There are two drawbacks with this. First, you won't be able to play imported Japanese games, which means you'll miss out on quite a few cult 2D shooters and beat-'em-ups that never got a European release. Also, PAL televisions have a 50hz refresh rate as opposed to the 60hz on Japanese and US sets, so poorly converted titles will run slower and may have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. However, many releases were carefully prepared for the European market, and Sega actually ironed out early bugs present in the original Japanese NTSC versions. It's worth checking out retro gaming forums for advice on specific titles.
If you buy an imported Japanese machine, you'll need a stepdown transformer so that you don't blow your console up when you plug it in (Japanese voltage is 100v, in the UK our mains voltage is 240v), and a multi-region TV set. An easier option would be to buy an Action Replay or ST-Key cartridge, which allows you to play imported titles. You may also need to replace the internal battery, which is used for the machine's built-in memory. Fortunately, that's easy to do.
You'll want to play games through a good cathode ray tube TV, or even better a CRT monitor like a Sony PVM or Trinitron, or a Hantarex ‘quadristandard' set (available reasonably cheaply on eBay these days). If you're determined to stick with a modern flatscreen display, and want to play lots of 2D games, I'd advise the purchase of a scan-line generator or a scaler like the Micom XRGB-mini Framemeister which will improve the visual output (although results will vary depending on your TV and the game itself). RGB Scart, RGB component, S-Video and composite connections are preferable to the default RF cable, and can all be bought online. I use Retro Gaming Cables for my older consoles, and they offer friendly advice on getting everything set up.
What to play
So what games should you buy? Well, there are staple titles that you absolutely have to own (that's if you can find them – and afford them). The Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon games, Sega Rally, Fighters Megamix, Burning Rangers, Nights, Shining Force III, Radiant Silvergun and Sega Worldwide Soccer are all great. Beyond these, the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history (and the standard Saturn controller is excellent for this genre). Capcom's Street Fighter Alpha, XMen: Children of the Atom and Darkstalkers titles are all fabulous, as are SNK's Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown and King of Fighters franchises.
For shooters, anything by Cave, Taoplan or Treasure is worth picking up. Radiant Silvergun, Battle Garegga, Batsugun (arguably the first bullet hell game), Darius and DoDonPachi are the key titles, but the excellent Racketboy site has a huge list of recommendations. There's also a great rarity guide if you're interested in tracking down more hard-to-come-by titles.
Apart from the console itself, you can also pick up a multitap which lets you plug in up to six joypads (there's a list of compatible games here, but the key draw is ten players Bomberman with two multitaps), and an excellent arcade stick, which will enhance all those 2D blasters and fighters. Sega also released its own analog stick, the 3D control pad, but only a handful of titles supported it – though one of these is the essential Sonic Team title Nights into Dreams, so it may well be worth hunting down. Oh, and you'll definitely need a light gun if you have Virtua Cop.
The great thing is, Sega has a huge online community of fans and acolytes. Sites like Racketboy and Sega-16 are mines of information and have busy forums populated by friendly and knowledgeable enthusiasts. The Saturn may have failed, but it left behind almost 1,000 titles (over 250 of those for PAL territories), many of which are still worth discovering and playing in their original format. The only problem is, the Saturn is a powerful gateway drug to other similar contemporary systems. Before you know it, you'll be clearing space for a Neo Geo, PC Engine and FM Towns Marty. The one part of the retro console experience you can't buy on eBay is an understanding partner.
As we begin 2015, we can take solace that the “torture” debate is finally behind us. But before we close the book on six sordid years of Democratic demagoguery and investigations, let the record show that the opponents of the CIA interrogation program were completely and utterly defeated.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, launched a six-year, 6,000-page, $40 million investigation into the CIA interrogation program, with the goal of convincing Americans that a) the program did not work and that b) enhanced interrogations were wrong and should never again be permitted.
She failed on all counts.
Just before Christmas, a Post poll revealed the American people's final verdict. The vast majority agree with the CIA that these techniques were necessary and justified. A majority think that Feinstein should never have released her report. And — most importantly — 76 percent said they would do it again to protect the country.
Americans were asked, “Looking ahead, do you feel that torture of suspected terrorists can often be justified, sometimes justified, rarely justified or never justified?” Note that the pollsters used the loaded word “torture” (even though the CIA contends that the techniques did not constitute torture), which should have biased the question in favor of the critics. Instead, 17 percent replied they would support using the techniques “often,” 40 percent “sometimes” and 19 percent “rarely.” Only 20 percent said the techniques should “never” be justified.
The fact is, in actual practice the techniques were only used “rarely.” Of the tens of thousands of individuals captured since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, only about 30 were subjected to enhanced interrogation of any kind, and just three underwent waterboarding. So “rarely” is the answer that most closely approximates what actually took place. That means 57 percent of Americans would actually be willing to support the use of enhanced interrogation techniques more frequently than they were actually employed.
Indeed, the poll shows that Feinstein and the opponents of CIA interrogations have actually lost ground over the past five years. In April 2009, the Pew Poll asked almost the exact same question. Back then, 71 percent said they would support enhanced interrogation (15 percent “often”; 34 percent “sometimes”; 22 percent “rarely”). Only 25 percent said “never.” So in five years, we've seen a 5 percentage point shift in support of enhanced interrogation.
The more Feinstein and the CIA critics voiced their objections, the more the needle of public opinion has moved in favor of the CIA's position.
That's not all. While Feinstein was pressing ahead with her politicized investigation, President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, reopened a criminal investigation of CIA officials involved in the interrogation program. He did this despite the fact that Obama came to office in 2009 pledging to “look forward as opposed to looking backwards” and promising the men and women of the CIA that they would not have to “feel like they've got spend their all their time looking over their shoulders.” He did this over the objections of seven former CIA directors, without so much as reading the detailed “declination memos” prepared by career prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia, who had conducted an exhaustive inquiry into allegations of abuse in the CIA program during the George W. Bush administration and found no crimes to prosecute.
Like Feinstein, Holder was driven by a desire to reach a predetermined conclusion. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Holder had told the left-wing American Constitution Society that “our government authorized the use of torture” and promised the crowd, “We owe the American people a reckoning.”
Result? After two years of wasted resources and untold grief for these dedicated intelligence officers, Holder came up empty. The special prosecutor he assigned to deliver that day of “reckoning” came to the same conclusion as the career prosecutors before him: There was no criminal wrongdoing by CIA officials.
So, despite the best efforts of Holder and Feinstein, the CIA has been cleared both by the Department of Justice and by the court of public opinion.
One of the architects of the CIA program, James Mitchell, recently revealed on “The Kelly File” that at one point Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) told him: “Your country will turn on you. The liberal media will turn on you. The people will grow tired of this, they will turn on you. And when they do, you are going to be abandoned.”
KSM was wrong. Yes, the liberal media turned on Mitchell and the other CIA officials who got captured al-Qaeda leaders to reveal their plans for new attacks. So did Eric Holder and Dianne Feinstein.
But the American people never did.

RAW VIDEO: Chopper footage of 100,000+ Occupy Oakland Takes back Highway
[youtube r4jYdCaHrjQ]
Report filed by Zennie Abraham in Oakland
Oakland's Interim Police Chief Howard Jordan (a capable and politically smart leader in a tough position) got the Occupy Oakland General Strike crowd count massively wrong: it's not 7,000, but 100,000.
This blogger has been in Oakland since 1974. The largest crowd at Frank Ogama Plaza was for a speech by then-Senator, now President Barack Obama in 2007, and for which was estimated at 18,000. Barack filled the space with people.
The Occupy Oakland General Strike had that many people in the plaza for most of the day, while two huge crowds were outside of it: one marching down Broadway, the other a set of people walking around various parts of downtown Oakland with protest signs.
You can't take a snapshot of an event like this, because of its time length; you have to think of it as a dynamic. In any population there are births, deaths, in-migration, and out-migration. For the Occupy Oakland General Strike, there were no births, thankfully no deaths, but a lot of in-migration and out-migration.
What was so amazing about the size of the crowd both inside the plaza and just outside of it, then marching to the Port of Oakland, was that it did not decrease in size; it increased. And that was with some people leaving it, and others coming in from BART and from around Oakland via foot or other parts of the Bay by car.
For that to happen all day long and considering the capacity of the plaza and the crowds outside of it points to 100,000 people. I've never seen anything like that in the entire history of this city.
And that is why it must be said that much of the media should be drawn and quartered for the most irresponsible coverage I've ever seen. Many outlets just waited for something bad to happen, or looked for it. But there were so many people more having a great time, that whatever happened was far away from downtown Oakland.
The Whole Foods Oakland Facility is on 27th and Harrison and outside of downtown Oakland, and a good mile away from City Hall Plaza. But to the media eye, the vandalism that happened there made headlines. Let's just get this out of the way: it should not have happened, but that's no excuse to get the whole story wrong.
The happy time lasted for much of the evening, but as the people either went to the Port (I did not go over there) or went home, a crowd of 100,000 shrank, like The Hulk turning back into Bruce Banner, to about a few 100 at best.
Here's where the media – except the SF Appeal – really screwed up.
The violence happened because of a rather dumb attempt by some with Occupy Oakland to take over an abandoned building in downtown Oakland. Why this idea was allowed to pass the General Assembly I do not know, but Oakland's Occupy movement is not known for thinking things through all the time. It's too prone to make moves that are outside of the rules of the Occupy movement – moves that at times cause violence.
(And on that note, business people should be involved in the Occupy Movement, too. It's something that can be impacted by the voice and involvement of business people. That's why I think Oakland Chamber of Commerce head Joe Haraburda's just plain out to lunch on this whole issue. He paints Occupy Oakland in “us versus them” terms, which just shows how much he doesn't get the whole deal and how it can actually be FORMED to help Oakland business. More on this today, but it must be said there's a case to be made for the need to be compensated for work. Business people can make that case in solidarity with the movement. Hey, there are Occupy Oakland t-shirts for sale – think about it.)
And that's not to let Oakland Mayor Jean Quan and the police off the hook here. The main problem is there militaristic approach has only served to make sure that more and more of these skirmishes take place. Downtown Oakland businesses are suffering in the process. Quan has done NOTHING to convince Occupy Oakland to work to help businesses by patronizing them.
The punishment for both Quan and Police Chief Jordan should be to force both of them and their staffs to eat lunch and dinner at Flora, Max's, Luka's to start, then go bar hopping in the Uptown.
And I'll join them.
But I digress.
The bottom line is all of this Occupy Oakland General Strike business has been misreported. The count is 100,000, not 7,000. And the night of activities should not be seen as marring a successful day of parties and festivities.
Stay tuned.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency released nearly 600 illegal immigrants convicted of sex crimes, many because their home countries refused to take them back, according to newly obtained documents.
ICE said that a total of 564 illegal sex criminals were let go for legal reasons in the latest accounting period, fiscal 2015.
Of those, ICE was forced to release 151 because their native nations would not accept them. Under a 2001 Supreme Court case, the government can't indefinitely jail illegals ordered deported if their home countries won't take them back.
The documents, obtained by the Immigration Reform Law Institute under the Freedom of Information Act, do not give names or locations of the illegals, but do provide a general classification of the sex crimes. They are:
95 convicted of "commercialized sexual offense."
275 convicted of "other sexual offenses."
194 convicted of "sexual assault."
Of the total, 218 were granted bond by an immigration judge and 12 released due to "prosecutorial discretion," including consideration under DACA, or deferred action for childhood arrivals.
The numbers and crimes are a shock to groups pushing for tougher immigration policies.
"The anti-borders left routinely inject sanctimony into the immigration issue claiming that anyone with opposing arguments is morally inferior," said Dale Wilcox, executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute.
"But when statistics like this come out, statistics which show the horrific consequences of having an unregulated immigration system, they merely step over them like they don't exist," he added.
His group has a solid record of obtaining insider documents that show flaws in the immigration system.
The documents note that the number of sex criminals released could be higher because other law enforcement agencies also hold the illegals.

If you take a look at a list of the fastest airplanes to ever grace the skies, many of them, for whatever reason, were primarily active in the 1960s. That may change soon enough.
Military.com is reporting that the U.S. Air Force is looking to partner up and develop a hypersonic jet capable of traveling at five times the speed of sound, otherwise known as Mach 5. By way of contrast, the famed Concorde aircraft traveled at Mach 2.04.
DON'T MISS: New Device Provides Secure and Anonymous Wi-Fi With an Incredible 2.5-mile Range
According to the report, Air Force Chief Scientist Mika Endsley is hoping that a joint project between the Air Force and the Department of Defense will result in this blazing fast aircraft taking flight sometime before 2023.
The planned hypersonic jet is said to build upon the success of a previous hypersonic test flight conducted with an X-51 Waverider.
“X-51 was really a proof of concept test. It showed that you could get a scram jet engine, launch it off an aircraft and it could go hypersonic. It was able to go more than Mach 5 until it ran out of fuel. It was a very successful test of an airborne hypersonic weapons system,” Endsley said. The 2013 test flight, which wound up being the longest air-breathing hypersonic flight ever, wrapped up a $300 million technology demonstration program beginning in 2004, Air Force officials said.
To be clear, the X-51 Waverider was launched off of a plane already in flight. It wasn't a traditional plane that took off via a runway. Additionally, the hypersonic test flight only lasted a few minutes before the X-51 ran out of fuel.
So naturally, getting from the drawing board to the air with an enhanced design is much easier said than done. For starters, Endsley points out that there are both material and technical challenges in getting such a project off the ground. For one, finding materials capable of withstanding such extreme temperatures (the faster you go, the more things heat up) for a prolonged period of time is a tall order. Additionally, engineering guidance systems “that will function when you are going at those types of speeds” pose another challenge.
Assuming that the initiative proves successful sometime within the next decade, a plane traveling at Mach 5 would be able to fly from New York to Los Angeles in just 30 minutes. Even more tantalizing is that such a plane would be able to fly anywhere in the world within 4 hours time.
But before you get too excited, the report adds that the requisite acceleration needed to get to such a speed effectively rules out that such a plane would ever become a mainstream way to travel.
Two of the most common features that consumers consider when they use a credit card are the interest rates and rewards.
For Greg McFarlane, author of "Control Your Cash: Making Money Make Sense," the most important feature of all is one that few people even recognize: "The main thing I care about as a consumer is the protection a credit card gives me," he says.
From travel insurance to fraud protection, these little-known credit card services can be worth thousands of dollars over the life of a card for those who spend the time to take advantage of them. "People don't usually take the time to read the information that's sent to them, and it's not what they're thinking about when they get a card," says Carrie Coghill, director of consumer education for FreeScore.com. "But the reality is that there are some good reasons to use a credit card, as long as you follow a few rules."
Just as there are some items you should never charge on a credit card, there are some you should -- that is, when you have the cash to pay a balance on time and in full. Because of key perks and protections embedded in many cards, you'll get what you pay for -- and then some.
1. Big-ticket items
From computers to home appliances, major purchases are almost always worth putting on a credit card, says Coghill. "Not only can you typically get extended warranties over and above the original warranty offered, but some cards will give you price protection," she says. "If you find a lower price within 60 days, you can be reimbursed the difference." That can be a lifesaver if your fridge goes on the fritz and you need a new one immediately. You may not get the best price when you buy it, but putting it on a credit card means you can price shop at your leisure and still get the benefit.
2. Service provider purchases
If you got new tile in your bathroom or new landscaping in your backyard, everything might have looked fine when it was installed and you paid for the service. But a week later, perhaps the grout is cracking or the shrubs have died. "If you paid with cash or a debit card, that money's already out the door," says McFarlane. "But if you pay with a credit card, the burden of proof is on the merchant to show that the work was done to your satisfaction." Because merchants who accept credit cards agree to the terms set by the card companies, the card company can exert serious leverage and charge back disputed purchases when one of its customers has been wronged.
3. Fragile or breakable items
That delicate vase was going to look gorgeous in your dining room -- before you tripped on a stair and smashed it to pieces. Your new laptop was going to change your life -- and then you dumped an entire cup of coffee on it. If you made the purchase on a credit card, you might not be out of luck, says Kim McGrigg, spokeswoman for Money Management International, a national credit counseling agency. "When a problem like this arises, people might think about contacting the store or the manufacturer," she says. "But in addition to these things, you should think about calling your credit card company." While you might only be able to recover a few hundred dollars in damages, it's certainly better than having to eat the entire cost yourself.
4. Travel expenses
Credit cards shouldn't be used to buy a trip you can't afford, but if the money's in the bank, you can put almost every travel expense on your card and see extra perks. Many cards offer an array of travel services, from automatic travel accident insurance, car rental insurance and lost luggage insurance. "There are cards that will even reimburse you for essentials if your luggage is delayed or if things are stolen from your hotel room," Coghill says.
5. Automatically recurring purchases
From gym memberships to cable packages to credit monitoring services, it's easy to sign up for monthly expenses and then find that you're not taking advantage of them. Sometimes it's easy to get taken off of subscriber rolls, but other times you'll need to get tough. "Some companies don't have the best reputation for customer service; they'll start automatic recurring payments but won't stop. Paying by credit card offers a layer of protection between you and the biller," says Liz Weston, author of The 10 Commandments of Money. If a call to the primary company won't stop the payments, a call to your credit card company will.
6. PayPal purchases
When you sign up for PayPal, the site will encourage you to pay sellers directly from your bank account, but that's not the wisest decision, says Weston. "The protections you get from those transactions are dictated by the method of payment you use," she says. "Transactions made using your bank accounts are governed by different federal regulations, which are inferior" to those of credit cards. Unplug your bank account from PayPal and make the credit card company as your middleman, and you'll have an easier time keeping your money in the bank if you're defrauded or need to dispute a purchase.

Warning comes as air pollution is expected to reach eight or nine on a 10-point scale in much of southern UK
Millions of vulnerable people in southern England and Wales were advised to stay indoors as unusually high levels of air pollution smothered London and other cities, just weeks after heavy pollution led to restrictions on car use and the offer of free public transport in Brussels and Paris.
Prof Frank Kelly of King's College London said tiny particles of pollution could cause problems for some people – such as those with asthma – and contribute to longer-term problems for others.
"Periods of very high pollution in London arise usually because the city's normal pollution emissions are increased further by polluted air arriving on light winds from neighbouring areas such as northern Europe," he said. "However, whether home-produced or arriving from the continent, the tiny particles we take into our bodies with each breath cause immediate problems for some individuals, such as those with asthma, and contribute to longer-term problems for most of us in the form of heart disease and stroke."
Leanne Stewart, from Eltham in south-east London, described feeling breathless after a routine half-mile walk to her son's thisschool yesterday morning.
"I've been doing the usual school run about half a mile from my house, which is usually quite an easy walk, but I'm still breathless now," she said. "I could feel my chest getting tighter and tighter and my son, who's eight, had to stop and have his inhaler.
"I went light-headed and had to get a bus back. It's only half a mile and I usually do it twice a day, no problem. I've never had that problem before. My son felt like the air wasn't getting into his lungs so I'm worried about him today, but I've just texted him and he said he's fine."
Experts said this week's air pollution was not unusual for this time of year, but the difference was that the public was being informed because of the Met Office's new forecasting system.
"Two weeks ago, when the air pollution map of the south-east turned red, no one was informed," said Dr Ian Mudway, lecturer in respiratory toxicology at King's College London. "The BBC ran stories about the pollution in Paris and Milan, but no one thought it worthwhile to inform the British public that they were being exposed to dangerous levels of fine particulates [tiny pieces of liquid or solid matter].

"At-risk groups were not informed, which to my mind is unforgivable. My suspicion was that there was an almost 'what the public don't know they can't complain about' attitude. Thanks to the new forecast, air pollution is going to ratchet very rapidly up the public consciousness and it will be interesting to see how government, both local and national, responds."
On 1 April, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) handed over responsibility for reporting air pollution to the Met Office, a move welcomed by Alan Andrews at the environmental law firm ClientEarth.
"I think it has to be a good thing, because the Met Office are good at communicating to the public and it depoliticises it; it takes away the issue of a minister worrying about looking bad because of putting out a pollution warning."
Forecasters warned that one of the year's worst smogs would worsen as Wednesday progressed, with air pollution reaching the maximum "very high" level in many parts of southern Britain.
The unusually high levels of air pollution are a result of inland pollution and powerful dust storms swept in from the Sahara by strong gales.
"We usually see this happen several times a year when big dust storms in the Sahara coincide with southerly winds to bring that dust here," said Paul Hutcheon at the Met Office. "More dust rain is possible during showers expected later this week."
Defra said air-pollution levels on Wednesday were expected to reach eight or nine on a 10-point scale in much of southern England, the Midlands and southern Wales.
The south coast is forecast to see pollution hit the maximum level 10.
Adults and children with lung problems, heart defects and older people are being urged to avoid any strenuous activity and asthmatics have been told to use their inhaler more often.
Advice on the Defra website for the general population facing "very high" pollution levels states: "Reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat."
Defra forecasters issued the fresh warning after air pollution levels reached 10 in north-west Norfolk on Tuesday.
"For England and Wales, moderate to high air-pollution levels are forecast for central and south-east England, to the south and east of a line from around the Wash to Cheshire to east Devon, with local very high levels expected in parts of East Anglia and the East Midlands," said a Defra forecaster.
Conditions are expected to worsen on Wednesday evening and into Thursday as the smog extends north.
High levels of pollution are forecast to stretch across East Anglia, the Midlands, Lincolnshire, Wirral and north and east Wales, then further north over much of England's north-west coast, south-west Scotland and the north-east of Northern Ireland.
Cleaner air from the Atlantic should bring some respite for south-west Wales and England's southernmost counties on Thursday, forecasters said, although many other parts of England and Wales will experience higher levels of smog than usual.
Keith Taylor, the Green party's MEP for south-east England, said the high level of pollution showed the need for stronger government action.
"Episodes like this often have a number of contributing factors," he said. "What seems clear is that towns and cities across south-east England need to reduce the level of air pollution in their streets by cutting the amount of traffic. But on top of that it's clear that our government must play a role in pushing for stronger air pollution laws from the European Union, rather than trying to water down the rules we already have."
The UK faces fines of up to £300m a year and embarrassing court appearances after the European commission launched legal proceedings against it for failing to reduce "excessive" levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution from traffic, despite 15 years of warnings and several extensions and postponements granted to the government.
According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution has become the world's single biggest environmental health risk, linked to about 7 million deaths a year – or nearly one in eight deaths in 2012.

LEIDEN, Netherlands, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Scientists in the Netherlands have generated a novel electric current and sent it across a record-breaking distance of 600 nanometers.
The current, an alternative super-current, consists of electrons spinning synchronously. Scientists propelled the current across a wire made of chrome dioxide.
The new research, detailed in the journal Physical Review X, builds on the discovery of superconductors more than a century ago. In the 100-plus years since Nobel Prize-winner Heike Kamerlingh Onnes first sent electrons through super-cooled metal without resistance, physicists have been trying to understand the mechanics of super-currents.
Building on Onnes' work 50 years after his groundbreaking discovery, scientists observed electrons spinning in pairs. Researchers suggested their spinning explained the ability to escape the classical rules of electricity and travel across metal mediums without resistance.
However, their hypothesis included an assumption that pairs of electrons spun in opposite directions, effectively canceling each other out and creating a net spin of zero -- an assumption since proven false.
More recent superconductor studies have shown super-currents can have a net spin.
In the latest experiments, scientists found magnetic chrome dioxide only hosts electric currents with a net spin. When they super-cooled the metal to a superconducting state, researchers measured a surprisingly strong spinning super-current.
Scientists also managed to bridge a 600-nanometer gap with the novel super-current. Though such a gap seems small, it's large enough to suggest the phenomenon can have practical uses. Researchers believe the alternative super-current can be used to power a computer hard drive without energy loss.
Yusei Kikuchi is scheduled to toe the rubber for the Seibu Lions Friday night against the Orix Buffaloes as Japanese baseball gets back to intraleague competition this weekend.
Kikuchi (7-2) has been among the best pitchers in Japan this season, and will take the mound after coming within two outs of a no-hitter in his last outing.
The left-hander is one of three pitchers, all Pacific Leaguers, who have found a way to enter late June with sub-2.00 ERAs despite the tide shifting back to hitters somewhat this year.
Kikuchi leads the triumvirate, and Japan, with a 1.41 ERA, and is followed by Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles ace Masahiro Tanaka (1.57) and the Orix Buffaloes' Brandon Dickson (1.89). Lions submariner Kazuhisa Makita (2.01) was among their ranks as recently as this past Saturday before allowing four earned runs against the Yokohama BayStars.
Hanshin Tigers hurler Jason Standridge is the leader in the Central League with a 2.23 ERA.
Dickson has been effective, but Kikuchi and Tanaka have been the standouts among the PL pitchers.
Kikuchi is 7-2 this season with opponents hitting just .179 against him. The Seibu pitcher also has a 0.96 WHIP and 65 strikeouts in 76 1/3 innings. Tanaka, meanwhile, is a perfect 9-0 with a 1.04 WHIP and 74 strikeouts in 92 innings.
Kikuchi has the better ERA, but Tanaka holds the edge in terms of fielding independent pitching (FIP), which measures the things pitchers have control over (walks, hit by pitches, strikeouts and home runs) and is thought by many to present a more accurate reflection of a hurler's contributions. Tanaka's FIP is 2.49 while Kikuchi clocks in at 3.07.
The performance the PL trio has been able to put forth may be even more impressive given the recent revelations that NPB secretly altered the standardized ball over the offseason, which led to an increase in home runs and other offensive statistics.
Two-horse race: Prior to the start of interleague play, the race for the Central League pennant was simply the Yomiuri Giants, Hanshin Tigers, and everyone else.
A few weeks later, nothing has changed.
The Giants and Tigers were the only two CL teams to finished above .500 against the Pacific League and further increased their lead on the other four CL teams, who at this rate could be resigned to playing for third before very long.
Yomiuri went 13-10-1 during interleague play and managed to increase its lead over the second-place Tigers to 2 1/2 games. Hanshin meanwhile went 12-11-1 and extended its lead over the third-place team (currently the Hiroshima Carp) from seven games to 11 1/2 games.
Jack-of-all-trades: The Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters wrapped up their interleague campaign on Tuesday night by finally unleashing two-way rookie Shohei Otani as both their starting and No. 5 hitter.
Otani became the first starting pitcher in 50 years to bat as part of the cleanup trio (3-4-5) and handled himself well in both roles. The rookie maxed out at 157 kph on the mound and was 1-for-3 with a double and an RBI at the plate.
Otani likely won't get another opportunity to pull double duty in the same game this season with the Fighters returning to Pacific League competition, where the designated hitter rule will be in effect.
Rep. Marlin Stutzman is claiming he was duped by his own GOP leaders.
The Indiana Republican said he voted Thursday on a rule advancing the $1.1 trillion government funding bill after leadership told him they planned to yank the massive measure and replace it with a more palatable short-term funding bill.

Stutzman's vote proved crucial to the 1,600-page bill's final passage late Thursday night, given that the procedural rule vote passed 214-212, just a one-vote margin.

“I supported the rule because I was informed by leadership that the cromnibus was dead and a short term CR [continuing resolution] would take its place,” Stutzman said in a statement after the vote.
“I was very surprised and even more disappointed to see the cromnibus back on the floor. The American people deserve better.”
This past summer, Stutzman lost a three-way race for majority whip, a job that went to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.).

It took 21 years for nearly 200 countries to reach an agreement in Paris last year to put the brakes on climate change.
Now for the hard part.
At the COP22 summit in Morocco from November 7-18, negotiators will have to decide on the details of how to make sure each country is actually reducing its emissions (and not just saying it is); how to compensate poorer countries for the damage done by hurricanes, floods, droughts and other effects of climate change; and how to shore up financial aid from the developed to the developing world.
“It was a massive leadership challenge to get to Paris. It's an even bigger leadership challenge to implement Paris,” said Rachel Kyte, head of the U.N.'s Sustainable Energy for All initiative.
The landmark deal agreed upon at the United Nations' COP21 summit in the French capital last December laid out the ambitious goal of slowing global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and eventually to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. It's a tough — and some say impossible — ask, given that the planet's temperature reached 1 degree above pre-industrial levels in late 2015.
The Paris agreement requires almost every country in the world to tackle climate change. But it does not spell out how. The 197 members of the U.N. climate change secretariat must now come up with their own plans and targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Some say they'll put a price on carbon dioxide. Others want to go big on renewable energy. A few are looking at emissions-free nuclear.
Here are five things to help you get primed for Marrakech:
1. Remember Paris
The Paris climate agreement does not require specific cuts to countries' greenhouse gas emissions. It instead creates a system that requires all countries to pitch in with something, then monitors their progress and urges them to continue ramping up efforts.
It also sets an end goal, which is key for buy-in from businesses and investors. That goal is a world where humans emit only as much carbon dioxide as can be naturally absorbed or stored by the middle of the century and a limit on global warming at well below 2 degrees and eventually 1.5 degrees. That reassures investors that there will be demand for technologies to store and use CO2 emissions and generate clean, green energy.
In a huge surprise to most climate negotiators and advocates, countries rushed to ratify the deal as quickly as possible, pushing it past the threshold needed for it to enter into force (with a final shove from the EU) three days before the start of the COP22.
The speedy ratification was a huge symbolic win for the climate change movement, because it tells the world it has to start cutting carbon emissions. But the sum of national plans still falls short of the long-term goal. Promises now on the table mean a temperature rise of at least 3 degrees.
The Paris agreement's goals therefore put even more pressure on governments to boost their efforts in 2018, when they meet for the first time to review their progress, and again at the Paris agreement's required check-ins every five years after that.
"To have a two-in-three, or 65 percent, chance of holding global warming to 2 degrees by the end of this century, we will need to decarbonize the electricity supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 70 percent by 2050, relative to 2010, and have net emissions approaching zero by 2100," Hoesung Lee, chair of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in interview. His panel of thousands of climate scientists will publish a report in 2018 on what more it will take to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.
2. Marrakech battle lines
The broad political agreement reached in Paris isn't enough to erase the deep battle lines drawn over two decades of slow-moving climate negotiations, which are likely to flare up again as the focus shifts to laying down rules.
“We've resolved the big political questions,” said Jo Tyndall, the co-chair of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement, which oversees negotiations following the deal. “But you look at a cooking show and you can give a bunch of contestants a box with exactly the same ingredients, and they will come up with a whole lot of different dishes.”
The biggest difference is between poorer countries that believe the wealthy world should carry the burden of slowing the climate change its industrialization helped cause and developed countries that argue the division should be more nuanced, to take into account big emerging economies able to do more than the smallest and least developed ones.
The most contentious debates will likely center on four issues: how to measure, report and verify emissions; how to ensure those emissions numbers are transparent; how to account for the loss and damage countries have already suffered from climate change; and how to expand the financial aid to help developing countries adapt to climate change and curtail emissions.
It will be tough to convince countries to open themselves up to monitoring, verification and reporting their emissions data. Rules can help ensure they don't fiddle with the stats, but they also expose countries to international scrutiny and risk the shaming that comes with it.
“Monitoring, reporting and verification is where the equity and fairness debate will play out,” said Liz Gallagher, a senior associate at the environmental think tank E3G. “So if you're Georgia, what kinds of standards of accounting and reporting and verification should you have in comparison to China, and how much support is available for you to improve your data collection and analysis?”
Transparency rules are similarly touchy, but also key to tracking the world's progress on climate change.
Countries now use a variety of methods to calculate emissions reduction pledges. The EU measures its emissions against the level in 1990, just before the collapse of the Soviet Union's high-polluting smokestack industry. China aims to peak its emissions in 2030; Japan compares its emissions cuts to the level in 2013, when coal-fired power went up to cover for shuttered nuclear reactors. Others say they will measure reductions against 2015 levels.
Then there's the unresolved issue of money and other forms of support, like the transfer of technology.
The developing world succeeded in getting a section in the Paris agreement that specifically acknowledges the loss and damage suffered from natural disasters — everything from food shortages to destroyed homes. But the agreement is careful not to hold the developed world liable for the climate change caused by its early industrialization. That was a red line for the U.S., EU and others.
In Marrakech, negotiators will have to work out a timeline for providing support in areas such as early warning systems, risk assessment and management, and risk insurance.
They'll also have a preliminary discussion on how to move beyond the developed side's pledge to come up with $100 billion per year of public and private climate finance by 2020, although a firmer agreement isn't expected until the COP23 in 2017.
For now they're on track to provide just over $90 billion by 2020, of which $67 billion is public, according to a report developed countries released in October. But the amount of money that's actually needed to tackle climate change is estimated to be in the trillions.
"In Paris they postponed meeting this commitment, and developing countries are now rightly asking to deliver the climate finance promises," said Mohamed Adow, senior climate change adviser at the NGO Christian Aid.
3. Gang of two
China and the United States, the world's first- and second-largest CO2 emitters, again emerged as the climate change leaders this year.
Presidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama triggered a race to push the agreement into force in time for the Marrakech summit by joining the Paris deal together in early September.
“The fact that the U.S. and the Chinese could be a G2 was a fundamental spanner in the works of those who wanted to play an old-fashioned bloc negotiating system that would just see everybody circling around common-but-differentiated responsibility,” the U.N.'s Kyte said.
Yet the future of the new U.S.-China climate partnership depends on the outcome of the American presidential elections on the second day of the COP22 and the new leader's willingness to follow through on commitments made in Paris.
An unexpected victory for Republican nominee and climate-skeptic Donald Trump would threaten to break up the couple and knock the U.S. out of its leadership post on the international climate stage.
It would take Trump four years to withdraw the U.S. from the ratified agreement. But that wouldn't stop the new president from disrupting efforts to meet its global warming targets, simply by refusing to pass the laws needed to meet the country's emissions-cutting commitment.
4. Europe still means business
The EU was, and remains, a fundamental alliance-builder on this front.
It led the effort to build the informal “high-ambition coalition” of wealthy and poor countries in Paris, throwing weight behind a demand from island nations to include the 1.5-degree goal, and it brokered a deal among EU member countries in September to quickly ratify the Paris agreement even though only seven national parliaments had done so.
How it translates the Paris goals into climate policies for the years 2020 to 2030 will be key to maintaining that reputation.
The issue has already created divisions within the bloc, with some countries (including Germany, Sweden, the U.K. and France) pushing to amp up the EU's climate efforts to match the new 1.5-degree target and others (including Poland and Italy) still clinging to struggling industries such as coal and steel and arguing the policies should be aimed at limiting global warming to 2 degrees, since that's what EU leaders agreed to in October 2014.
The Commission has said it will wait for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report on how to meet the 1.5-degree goal, due by September 2018, before proposing tougher targets. NGOs argue it's waiting too long.
5. What the COP22 won't change, yet
The key achievement from Paris is that the world has committed to slashing CO2 emissions. That doesn't mean fossil fuels are dead — at least not yet.
“There is a point on the horizon — mid-century — that we have to be at, and you work back from that and you make your decisions about risk and opportunity,” Kyte said.
“If you're Georgia, what kinds of standards of accounting and reporting and verification should you have in comparison to China, and how much support is available for you to improve your data collection and analysis?” — Liz Gallagher, a senior associate at the environmental think tank E3G, on international scrutiny that will come with the sharing of data
That means businesses can start taking tough emissions cuts into account for long-term strategies. Bankers, for instance, are trying to understand how their clients and markets might be exposed to the shift away from fossil fuels, while renewable energy companies are jumping into poor and emerging economies.
Oil and gas producing companies and countries have cautioned that renewables, energy storing batteries and other green technologies are still too young to take over from fossil fuels. Oil remains a crucial fuel for transportation and gas is the sturdy partner for smaller, more intermittent solar and wind sources, they argued.
“Yes indeed, humankind is moving towards green energy,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a speech in October. “But at the same time, the world's oil and gas production continues to increase, although a bit slower than before.”

Netflix's chances of winning an Oscar this year will again ride on documentaries, after the streamer's prestige-pic pickup “Beasts of No Nation” failed to earn any nominations.
Two Netflix docus, “What Happened Miss Simone?” and “Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom,” garnered Academy Awards nods Thursday.
But drama “Beasts of No Nation” from director Cary Fukunaga was ignored by the Academy, despite an aggressive lobbying campaign by Netflix to woo voters. Netflix paid nearly $12 million for the rights to “Beasts of No Nation,” plus whatever it plunked down to promote the film, hoping to curry Oscar's favor. The company released the drama about an unnamed, war-torn West African nation simultaneously in theaters and on its global streaming platform last October.
For “Beasts,” many hoped British thesp Idris Elba would make it into the running for best supporting actor. (It's worth noting that no black actors picked up an Oscar nomination this year.) Elba received a 2016 Golden Globes best supporting actor nomination for “Beasts”; he lost to Sylvester Stallone, who won for his reprise of Rocky Balboa in “Creed.”

It's also possible some industryites were turned off by Netflix's business model — that it was somehow a movie less worthy of recognition because it hit the Internet-streaming service as it was playing in cinemas, or that Netflix is perceived as a threat to the long-term health of theatrical distribution. But perhaps a bigger reason for the shutout was that “Beasts of No Nation” dealt with subject matter Academy members found inaccessible or simply too foreign.
Meanwhile, Netflix has better odds than ever at winning an Oscar in the documentary category, though it will be hard to beat the much-awarded “The Look of Silence” and the critically and commercially successful “Amy.”
Liz Garbus' “What Happened Miss Simone?” about jazz singer Nina Simone and “Winter on Fire,” a retelling of the unrest in Ukraine over 93 days in 2013 and 2014, will also face off against hard-hitting and topical “Cartel Land.”
Netflix has clearly become a significant player in the documentary world, and this year marks the third straight year its documentary titles have been on the Oscar ballot. In 2014, “The Square,” about the 2011 popular uprising in Egypt, was in contention, and last year “Virunga,” about endangered gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was nominated in the category. The streaming service has focused on procuring quality under Lisa Nishimura, VP of original documentary programming. Netflix's wildly-popular “Making a Murderer” docuseries is also likely to be an awards contender at the Emmys next fall.
Netflix's only Oscar win so far came in 2014, for short documentary “The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life,” about pianist and Holocaust survivor Alice Herz-Sommer.

A good teacher tells you about the world. A good mentor helps you find your way through it.
Ken Heyman, the photographer and photojournalist, was my first mentor. Luck paired us up.
I entered the Pratt Institute in the fall of 1971 on a baseball scholarship. By the following spring, I was not so interested in bats and mitts. The art and music of New York City had snagged my attention, and I just didn't want to play ball anymore.
Pratt naturally demanded that I pay back the scholarship, and provided me with on-campus jobs: mail carrier, photo lab assistant, slide projector operator. One morning, I was alone in the photo lab, sweeping the floor, when the phone rang. A woman was looking for someone to come to Ken Heyman's office and mount photographs to preprinted holiday cards. I went.
I must have done all right by the cards, because Ken asked me back to help organize his color archives. My tools were a loupe and a light box. I learned to be an image intermediary.
Ken was then in his early 40s. He had already published the book “Family” with Margaret Mead, the famed anthropologist; worked for Life magazine; and had his photographs exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art.
I studied Ken's work in depth. What was intriguing was the absence of an obvious self. His images weren't personal statements, but searches for pristine human facts. I found, through Ken, that you could add to your life by studying the lives of others, and that recording those other lives could be a serious artistic contribution.
Dr. Mead was first Ken's teacher, then his mentor. She encouraged him to look at others. Many of his seeing strategies derived from her: when you arrive at a new place, observe what people wear on their heads and on their feet; find where they get their water; explore their markets. Even more important: know your own prejudices and don't apply your personal values where they don't belong. You might not see what's there.
There were times over the following years when I saw a lot of Ken, and periods when we wouldn't see each other at all. Our relationship meandered.
In 2009, Phil Block of the International Center of Photography asked if I would help Ken with his class at the center. He had been sick and Phil worried that the workload would slow his recovery. So Ken and I taught together, and enjoyed our time enough that we continued to meet every week.
We talked about life and politics and, of course, photography. I started filming our exchanges to share with others. I was teaching myself to use a new DSLR camera for video. Some of the results are better than others.
“Ken Heyman: Conversations With the Photographer, Part I,” produced with Anne Cronin, is arranged to follow Ken's career chronologically, beginning with his association with Dr. Mead, then moving on to segments about Ernest Hemingway, Andy Warhol and Leonard Bernstein.

THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT announced today it was planning a limited ban on “face-covering clothing,” widely interpreted as a new attempt to outlaw burqas, the head-to-toe robe worn by some Muslim women.
It's understood that only a few hundred women in the Netherlands wear the garment, out of a population of 17 million.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his coalition has drawn up a proposal to ban face-covering clothing on public transport and in schools, government buildings and medical institutions.
The proposal will be sent for assessment to the Council of State, a panel of legal experts.
The panel was heavily critical in 2012 of an attempt by the government to ban burqas, saying it breached religious freedom provisions in the Dutch constitution.
Rutte insisted the latest move is not targeting any particular religious group and will not go as far as the earlier attempt at a general ban on burqas.
It has nothing to do with religion or what people do in their own homes.
Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said people “can still walk along the street in a burqa,” but they would have to remove it to get onto a bus.
In 2011, France became the first country in Europe outlaw face-covering veils in public.
The Dutch Muslim women's organization Al Nisa said in a statement that the proposal is not tackling a serious problem in society, but rather reacting to fears.
Fear that threatens to manifest itself against anything that we find different or strange.

"United are wasting their time. It took a long time for Cesc to get his dream move back home and he won't give it up.
"This is home, it is where his family is, and he is playing with his closest friends. He has told us that he is happy."
That's what Gerard Pique told the Sun this week. And it makes perfect sense. You'll remember the annual tedious, drawn-out transfer sagas that finally ended on August 15, 2011. The controversy of the Barça shirt at Spain's World Cup celebrations… the will he, won't he? Of course he won't and how couldn't he?
Well, he did and if it was an unsettling year for Arsenal fans, just imagine what Cesc Fabregas was going through.
Now, having finally returned home to his family, Catalonia and Barça after leaving them all as a 16-year-old, would he really pack his bags again just two years on?
If El Mundo Deportivo is to be believed, the answer is yes. Because, despite what his pal Pique said, it hasn't been a particularly happy return home for Fabregas the footballer. Social life aside, the midfielder will be anxious to enjoy his football next season as, at 26, he is now 'middle aged' in footballing terms. He's already had 10 years at the top, and it's very unlikely he'll have 10 more.
With another Fabregas transfer saga rumbling on, El Mundo Deportivo claims that the former Arsenal player "has considered a move back to England". And with the prospect of a season on the Barça bench and United keen for him to fill Scholes' boots for double his current wages, why wouldn't he?
Because at the Camp Nou, Cesc has a problem - he won't get in the starting XI next season, not regularly anyway. And after his performances last term, the fans wouldn't be that bothered to see him go.
Thiago Alcantara left Barça because he didn't want to play second fiddle to Xavi and Iniesta in midfield, leaving the fiddle for Fabregas to pluck away on whilst he sat on the bench.
Neymar's arrival is doubly damaging for the former Arsenal midfielder: firstly it means Iniesta will drop from attack into midfield more regularly, alongside Xavi and Busquets, leaving Messi, Neymar and a winger (Pedro, Alexis, Tello or Cuenca) to lead the line. And secondly, when Messi is rested or unavailable, the Brazilian forward will be second in line for the 'false nine' role, where Fabregas was often employed under both Guardiola and Vilanova.
If he stays at Barcelona, the 26-year-old will probably be left to scrounge for playing time when others are injured or rested. And at 33, Xavi has got at least a season or two left in him, so Fabregas will have to be patient before he takes up that mantle.
After a great start on his return in 2011 - including four goals in his first four league games - the fans began to lose patience in their prodigal son last season and Cesc was often on the receiving end of frustrated tuts and whistles from the Camp Nou faithful.
But the stats, at first glance, are surprising. Last season, between filling in for Messi in attack and getting the nod in the middle, Fabregas played in 48 games in all competitions for Barça, including 30 league starts. And he scored 14 goals. Not bad for a disappointing year.
But when you look more closely, the cracks start to appear.
Tito Vilanova saw Fabregas not as his solutions man, but the one who made way when something more was needed. In the big games, or when Barça had their backs to the wall, Fabregas was often either dragged off on the hour mark - generally the time managers will make their first change when things aren't going to plan - or he was left on the bench. Maybe the cause or the effect of his plunge in confidence.
The midfielder played a total of just eight minutes over two legs in the Supercopa against Real Madrid at the start of the season: he made a brief appearance in the first leg and was an unused substitute at the Santiago Bernabeu.
On week two of La Liga, with Barça losing 1-0 away at Osasuna, Fabregas was replaced on 62 minutes before Messi's brace won the game.
The following week in a tight 1-0 win against Valencia, he was again brought off on the hour mark with Barça hanging on without him for all three points.
In El Clasico at the Camp Nou in early October, the midfielder was replaced after 61 minutes once more, with the game finishing 2-2.
Down to 10 men and leading 4-3 in a crazy game away at Depor two weeks later, Tito sacrificed Fabregas after an hour, bringing on Xavi to steady the ship for the final 30 minutes.
He played a total of just 20 minutes in two physical and tense Champions League games against Celtic. And in Barça's first league defeat of the season against Real Sociedad in January, Fabregas was replaced again on 58 minutes.
A pattern was emerging and it would continue in other crucial games, including defeats against Milan in the Champions League and Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey - at the Camp Nou. Both times Fabregas was the man Tito substituted with half an hour remaining, when the former Barça manager was desperate for something to change.
In the Champions League quarter-finals the Catalans were heading out after Javier Pastore's opener for PSG, before Pedro equalised in the 71st minute - 10 minutes after Fabregas had been hauled off.
When the going got tough, Cesc Fabregas's number was up. Literally.
He was an unused substitute in two massive Champions League clashes: the all-important second leg against Milan, when Barça turned the tie on its head hammering the Italians 4-0, and the humbling at the hands of Bayern Munich in the first semi-final.
There are exceptions. Fabregas played in some big games and scored a few important goals - a brace at Sevilla with Barça 2-0 behind and the opener at the Bernabéu in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final. Also, in a side with so much quality, playing so many fixtures, rotation is inevitable. But Fabregas is not the midfield general he was at Arsenal and could be at United.
Whereas he was replaced 11 times after an hour last term, Arsene Wenger substituted his captain just once before the 65 minute mark in his entire final season with the Gunners - excluding injuries - when Arsenal were leading Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0 in a Champions League group game and Fabregas had just netted a penalty. And it's inconceivable that Wenger would have left the Spaniard on the bench for a must-win game.
At Arsenal he was the solution when a change was needed, at Barça he's the change when a solution is needed. And next season, with the arrival of Neymar, Fabregas will play an even more insignificant role than he has already, which just isn't right for a player of his ability and skill.
If the decision to return to Barça in 2011 was made with his heart, maybe this time Fabregas needs to put his career first.
SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia's relationship with Turkey had fully recovered after what he called a crisis caused by Ankara's shooting down of a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in 2015.
Russia retaliated against Turkey at the time with a slew of economic sanctions and Ankara later took measures which made life difficult for Moscow too.
Speaking after holding talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan in the Black Sea Russian resort of Sochi, Putin said relations were finally getting back to normal and that trade had stopped falling.
“Some time ago our bilateral ties, as it well known, were tested. Now we can say with certainty remark that the recovery process in Russo-Turkish ties is complete,” Putin told a news conference. “We are getting back to a normal cooperative partnership.”
Putin said Russia would launch a joint investment fund with Turkey with funds of up to $1 billion and said Moscow stood ready to help Turkey improve security measures at its tourist resorts.
VANCOUVER — Jailed marijuana activist Marc Emery is suffering from a “superbug” infection called MRSA, leaving his wife seriously concerned for his health as he serves at least three more years in a Mississippi prison.
Jodie Emery said he was diagnosed earlier this year after a boil above his buttock tested positive for the infection
While his initial outbreak has been treated, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is a staph bacterium that can cause infections that are resistant to most antibiotics.
MRSA is highly contagious and has become a widespread problem in prisons and hospitals, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control website.
Emery, known as Vancouver's “prince of pot,” is serving five years for conspiracy to manufacture marijuana through his mail-order cannabis seed company. He was extradited to the United States last year and is expecting an early release date of July 9, 2014.
While Emery is trying to stay safe by washing his hands frequently and avoiding injuries, Jodie worries the MRSA could lead to fatal complications.
“Marc suffering this sort of dangerous infection after being extradited and imprisoned in the U.S. — after harming nobody at all — proves the insanity of war on marijuana,” Jodie said.
“Peaceful, non-violent people like Marc are being put in harm's way because of prohibition.”
MRSA makes surgery risky and can create severe infections in open wounds. One of Emery's former cellmates died of post-surgical complications involving an infection, Jodie said.
Emery has been keeping busy in jail, learning bass guitar for a prison band called Stuck. Another group of prisoners wrote a song about him called Prince of Pot after seeing Tommy Chong wearing a Free Marc shirt on CNN.
“He's in really good spirits emotionally,” Jodie said. “Trying to stay positive is the hardest thing for both of us.”
Emery was transferred from a private facility in Georgia to a jail outside Jackson, Mississippi. in April. His request to be moved to a Canadian prison was rejected. He will be eligible to apply again in two years.
He began selling marijuana seeds in Vancouver in 1994, and was a founding member of the Marijuana Party of Canada. He was arrested in 2005 by Canadian police acting on a request from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
He has received thousands of letters of support from all over the world, Jodie said.
“When medical marijuana was first legalized in California in 1996, he sent seeds down to people who really needed them,” she said. “We get letters from people who say, ‘Marc Emery saved my life.'”

Image caption Mr Chen is said to be happy with the arrangement
Prominent Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng has left the US embassy in Beijing, a week after seeking shelter following his escape from house arrest.
Mr Chen's lawyer said the activist was "happy" after receiving "clear assurances" from Beijing that he would be free to stay in China and study.
However, some friends said Mr Chen was reluctant to stay in China and chose to do so after threats to his family.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Beijing for high-level talks.
Mr Chen's case has threatened to overshadow the talks, which are due to focus on issues like Syria and trade.
Mrs Clinton said the US would follow Mr Chen's fate in the long term.
Clinton message
Mr Chen was driven from the US embassy to a VIP section of Chaoyang Hospital for a check-up, before being united with his wife and two children.
He was accompanied to the hospital by US ambassador Gary Locke and other US officials.
Analysis Chen Guangcheng has apparently been given assurances that he and his family will be moved to a "safe environment" inside China. He told a friend that he believes he now has "true freedom" in his homeland. But that is not assured. China's ruling communist party does not tolerate much criticism. Activists and dissidents are routinely kept quiet. The Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for suggesting political change. So if Mr Chen continues to speak out against injustices, it is difficult to see how he will be able to live free from interference. The US is also in a tricky position if the deal backfires. It says it will continue to monitor the activist's status. But it will have little power to force China to stick by its promises.
Some 20 police officers ordered journalists to leave and detained one protester carrying a banner reading "Free Guangcheng. Democracy for China", Agence France-Presse news agency reported.
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas met Mr Chen's wife at the hospital. She told him that she and their two children were well.
State news agency Xinhua said Mr Chen left the embassy "of his own volition".
In a statement, Mrs Clinton said: "I am pleased that we were able to facilitate Chen Guangcheng's stay and departure from the US embassy in a way that reflected his choices and our values.
"Mr Chen has a number of understandings with the Chinese government about his future, including the opportunity to pursue higher education in a safe environment," she said.
"Making these commitments a reality is the next crucial task. The United States government and the American people are committed to remaining engaged with Mr Chen and his family in the days, weeks, and years ahead."
After leaving the US embassy, the Chinese dissident had a telephone call with Mrs Clinton in which he reportedly said: "I want to kiss you."
Mr Chen's lawyer Li Jinsong said he had spoken to his client on the phone. He said Mr Chen was "very happy and wants to hug all his friends".
Mr Li said the dissident had told him he now had "true freedom", his rights were now protected by the national law and he was "a free citizen".
'Threats' to family
However, a close friend of Mr Chen told Associated Press that the dissident had chosen not to go to the US because he had been warned his wife would face recriminations if he did so.
Zeng Jinyan, herself an activist in Beijing, told the BBC she had spoken to Mr Chen and learned he had opted to stay in China to protect his family.

Ms Zeng said that Mr Chen "had no choice" because "thugs with sticks" were waiting for him and his family in their home village in Shandong province.
She said: "It's impossible, he couldn't do anything. He said, 'please help me'."
Bob Fu, of Texas-based rights advocacy group ChinaAid, said reliable sources had also told it that Mr Chen had left the embassy because serious threats to his immediate family members were made by the Chinese government.
"We are deeply concerned about this sad development if the report about Chen's involuntary departure is true," Mr Fu said.
These reports contradicted one US official, who said Mr Chen had "made clear from the beginning that he wanted to remain in China, and that he wanted his stay in the United States Embassy to be temporary".
The official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the dissident had gone into the embassy on 26 April "requesting medical treatment from the embassy" - which had been given.
The official said China had "acknowledged that Mr Chen will be treated humanely while he remains in China.
"He has been reunited with his family - his wife and two children - at the hospital, and they remain together with him as a family. He had not seen his son in a few years, and his wife had not seen [the son] either, so this was a family reunification after a long and difficult separation."
Mrs Clinton said she was glad to have the chance to speak to Mr Chen and "to congratulate him on being reunited with his wife and children".
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin earlier said Mr Chen had been taken into the US embassy "via abnormal measures", the Chinese authorities were "strongly dissatisfied", and the US should apologise.
Mr Chen, who has been blind since childhood, has long been a high-profile figure and international rights groups have frequently expressed alarm at the treatment of him and his family.
He was placed under house arrest in 2010 after spending more than four years in jail for disrupting traffic and damaging property.
Mr Chen exposed how local authorities in Linyi, in Shandong, forced thousands of women to have abortions or be sterilised as part of China's one-child policy.
Mr Chen's colleagues said the escape from house arrest had taken months to plan, and was carried out with the help of a network of friends and activists.
He scaled the wall that the authorities had built around his house, and was driven hundreds of miles to Beijing, where activists say he stayed in safe houses before fleeing to the embassy.
Several people involved in Mr Chen's escape have been detained or have disappeared in recent days.
SEOUL (Reuters) - Asiana Airlines Inc said the pilot in charge of landing the Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco's airport on Saturday was training for the long-range plane and that it was his first flight to the airport with the jet.

“It was Lee Kang-kook's maiden flight to the airport with the jet... He was in training. Even a veteran gets training (for a new jet),” a spokeswoman for Asiana Airlines said on Monday.
The plane was travelling “significantly below” its intended speed and its crew tried to abort the landing just seconds before it hit the seawall in front of the runway, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Sunday.
“He has a lot of experience and previously flown to San Francisco on different planes including the B747... and he was assisted by another pilot who has more experience with the 777,” the spokeswoman said.
Lee, who started his career at Asiana as an intern in 1994, has 9,793 hours of flying experience, but only 43 hours with the Boeing 777 jet.
Co-pilot Lee Jeong-min, who has 3,220 hours of flying experience with the Boeing 777 and a total of 12,387 hours of flying experience, was helping Lee Kang-kook in the landing, the spokeswoman said.
National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said Sunday that it was too early to say whether pilot error or mechanical failure were to blame.
But she said there was no evidence of problems with the flight or the landing until 7 seconds before impact, when the crew tried to increase the plane's speed and the plane responded normally. The control tower was not alerted to any plane issues.
Witnesses said the plane on Saturday appeared to be too low as it approached the runway, hit the ground before the runway started and the impact sheared off part of the tail of the plane and possibly landing gear as well.
Asiana's chief executive said on Saturday that he did not believe the fatal crash was caused by mechanical failure, although the carrier refused to be drawn on whether the fault laid with pilot error.
American universities used to be a place where difficult ideas were encountered and built in biases challenged. The universities, an inspiration from the Catholic Church, were the home of diverse ideas that were meant to inspire wisdom in students in addition to the learning of practical skills that would help build the economic strength that enabled America to dominate the globe. A fine example of this thinking is ensconced in the motto of DePaul University, Viam sapientiae monstrabo tibi, or I will show you the way to wisdom. Wisdom enlightens the mind and strengthens the individual, which has direct consequences for the broader culture and society. But our universities have turned their backs on promoting wisdom and instead have adopted a mission of promoting a distorted sense of social justice.
Social justice is a concept that originates in Catholic Social Teaching. Indeed, it could be said to be foundational to Catholic Social Teaching. The concept emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in the writings of the Italian Jesuit Luigi Taparelli d'Azeglio. Taparelli coined the term to defend the rights of landed nobles during the turbulent mid-nineteenth century nationalization process that led to the founding of the Italian state. Later the term would be invoked and defined broadly in papal writings, most notably in Pope Pius X's 1904 encyclical Iucunda Sane, which sang the praises of Pope St. Gregory the Great, whom Pope Pius X called a great defender of social justice and the essential foundation of society, the family.
The Catechism defines the just society as one that “provides the conditions that allow associations or individuals to obtain what is their due, according to their nature and their vocation. Social justice is linked to the common good and the exercise of authority” (CCC 1928). Social justice requires the recognition of the transcendental dignity of man as a creature made in the image and likeness of God and that as a result rights are prior to society. Social justice is concerned principally with promoting human dignity and strives for promoting the common good, which according to Gaudium et Spes “embraces the sum of those conditions of social life by which individuals, families, and groups can achieve their own fulfillment in a relatively thorough and ready way” (GES 74). Little mention of power arrangements are made in the Catechism and the body of Catholic Social Teaching, and for good reason, as the Church is principally concerned with the spiritual health of the person and the earthly health of society beginning first with the traditional family. Power and politics is only of concern when it conflicts with our duties to our neighbor and to God.
This is a far cry from those definitions promoted at secular and nominally Catholic universities. These institutions define the just society as one that promotes the equal distribution of political and social rights and an equal distribution of wealth while being one that opposes structural injustices of power and unearned privilege. This is a definition that comes from Marxism, which is concerned primarily with the two facets of materialism—productivity and power—which are the false idols of the secular world.
Power arrangements, as the Church teaches, are of concern when they violate human dignity and cause harm to the family. This is where many Christians fall into the secular trap of social justice, as seemingly unjust power arrangements are highlighted by secular authorities (including Marxist professors) to present an image of society that draws the mind of Christian students away from the teachings of the Church and instead focuses on the solutions presented by cultural Marxists. Insidiously this is enabled by these professors using some of the same language that the Church uses, such as love, and human dignity, in addition to social justice.
The principal difference between what the secular Left calls “social justice” and what the Church teaches is that, for the secular world, social justice is equated with a proper distribution of goods, chiefly power. For the Church social justice is a right arrangement of relationships and arrangements that do not prevent man from pursuing his relationship with God and with his neighbor. The secular world is concerned with material goods and the power they bring and represent while the Church is concerned primarily with the common good. Pope Paul VI defines the common good in Gaudium et Spes as “the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily” (26). The qualifying statement is “reach their fulfillment,” which is found by fulfilling our duties to our families, neighbors and society through a relationship with God. It is the culmination of what Our Lord said to his disciples when he said “No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends” (Jn 15:13), for as we are in relationship with Christ and expected to live like him, so too are we expected to sacrifice ourselves for our neighbors and family.
Contrasting that with the secular definition of social justice we see that the secular definition is logically incoherent, as it plays off the selfishness that secular culture promotes while advocating Marxism as a remedy. The Marxist solution will fail (as it always does) because it is opposed to the will of God who has written his moral law on our hearts. We cannot live dignified lives in rebellion against his will. Yet the Christian position is being expelled and suppressed at our universities while the Marxist position is becoming more and more enshrined within their formal power structure. From the universities this position gets promulgated to the greater society. In any case, our duty is to turn to God and be witnesses for Christ and his Church in opposing these ideas in the public square, regardless of the cost.

18th Street Brewery: A Good Reason To Visit Gary
By Chuck Sudo in Food on Mar 11, 2014 8:20PM
It's been six months since Drew Fox opened 18th Street Brewery in Gary, Indiana after an aggressive bout of fundraising that included a Kickstarter campaign and various tastings around Chicago. I finally made my way to 18th Street a couple weekends ago via the South Shore Line, to see how Fox and the brewery was doing.
It turns out that Fox is not only doing well, he's thriving. In fact, on the day of my visit his tasting room was filled with Blackhawks fans making the trip to Soldier Field for some outdoor hockey, the standard assortment of beer geeks and locals from Gary and other points of Northwest Indiana. When Fox announced his plans to open a brewery in Gary I wrote it would take some "chutzpah and commitment" and Fox had plenty of each. His faith was unwavering throughout the buildout and has been rewarded with a loyal and growing customer base as well as Fox being named the best new brewer in Indiana by the user review site RateBeer.com, proving once again that if you have a good product and business plan, people will help it succeed.
Chicagoist "Beer of the Week" columnist Jason Baldacci gave me a scouting report of 18th Street prior to my trek. "Expect a lot of heavy beers," Jason said. As the South Shore line passed parts of Gary that resembled a cross between a Jean Shepherd essay and the fallout from a Moody's credit downgrade I tried to remain objective as the train approached Gary's Miller station. 18th Street is located a short walk (two blocks) away from the station; a set of freight rails separates 18th Street Brewery from the amazing Miller Pizza Co.
I found Fox busy hauling kegs in his brewhouse and overseeing some new construction happening in his space, which was a dry cleaner in a previous life. A look at the beer menu reminded me why I should remain objective regardless of the intel I receive. Of the five beers available, two were session ales and none was higher than 9 percent alcohol by volume. But all of 18th Street's selections were teeming with flavor and exhibited amazing balance between malt and hops, exactly as Fox learned as an apprentice brewer at Pipeworks Brewing. What was most impressive of 18th Street's brews was a focus on classic hop varietals. "You won't see us throwing Citra hops into every beer we brew," Fox said. Instead he works with classic hop varietals like Cascade, Simcoe and Amarillo.
While beer geeks and Gary residents have embraced 18th Street Brewery, Fox recognizes his fight is far from over and admits local officials have responded to the brewery with mild affirmations. "I know the city is fighting an uphill battle," he said, "but they should be embracing every business that decides to call Gary home."
18th Street Brewery is located at 5725 Miller Ave. in Gary. Hours of operation are 3 p.m.- 10 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday; noon- midnight Friday and Saturday and noon - 8 p.m. Sunday.
Ahead of Apple's September 9th event that will include the introduction of Apple's first wearable computer, along new, larger iPhones, The New York Times has profiled the existing wearable market. The juiciest bit from the story? A purported quote from Apple design chief Jony Ive, relayed by another Apple designer. Said Ive, referring to the existing watch market, “Switzerland is in trouble.”
Here's the full section:
According to a designer who works at Apple, Jonathan Ive, Apple's design chief, in bragging about how cool he thought the iWatch was shaping up to be, gleefully said Switzerland is in trouble — though he chose a much bolder term for “trouble” to express how he thought the watchmaking nation might be in a tough predicament when Apple's watch comes out.
So, it appears Jony did not actually say “trouble.” He said something “bolder.” Perhaps “screwed” ? :D
Apple's watch, we first reported, will have a strong sense of fashion in addition to fitness. We're expecting the device to have a fair-sized display along with wireless charging, a variant of iOS, integration with Apple's new HealthKit and HomeKit services, the ability to make NFC-based mobile payments by touch, and of course, several medical-grade sensors for monitoring a user's pulse, hydration, heart rate, and other fitness/health data points.
This also could explain Apple's recent hire of a Switzerland-based watch company's marketing head. It also turns out that, if the Ive quote is true, Swatch could have a lot more to worry about than just a trademark.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) argues in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News that he is the best positioned 2016 GOP presidential candidate to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a general election face-off.
In states such as Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and more, Paul has been shown to be leading Clinton in polls.
“I think in order to win these states that President Obama you got to attract independents and consistently in at least five states we're leading her—in states that were won by President Obama, we win the independent vote,” Paul said. “I think that's an important feature because people want so badly to have somebody who can beat Hillary Clinton. I think it's one of our strongest calling cards right now: We're the only one beating her in all five of these states.”
Paul, who's polling best against Clinton among the entire Republican field, said he isn't sure if Bill Clinton—the former president and Hillary's husband—meant him when he said in an interview with CNN this weekend that he thinks Republicans will “wind up voting [in the primary] for the person they think has the best chance to win” the general.
“You know, I don't know—far be it from me to know what goes on inside Bill Clinton's head,” Paul said when asked if he thought Bill Clinton was talking about him.
What I would say is we would say we are the most credible candidate and the polls seem to be indicating that this is true as well. So we will keep trying to get the independent vote because ultimately that's how the Republican Party is going to have to win these difficult states. Those are really tough states for us, but so are Michigan and Illinois. As Republicans know, I've been working very hard to try to attract the African American vote and that's a big reason why we don't win a lot of these states is because we haven't done very will with the African American vote.
Paul also said he thinks what positions him best against Clinton is that his campaign launch—which started in Kentucky and had four more events in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa then Nevada—was presidential.
“I think if you compare the launches of all the different candidates so far I think there would be only candidate so far—and that would be ours—that actually had a launch that was as presidential, as big [as Clinton's which drew approximately 5,000 people] and in as many places,” Paul said.
We launched our campaign in five states with at least a thousand people at each rally and you saw how it was set up. I think ours was done at a presidential level in terms of the caliber of how we presented our campaign. Our stagecraft—I don't think anyone else has done that. I've seen a couple other people announce on TV, some did a mandatory university convocation. I don't know if Hillary's even going to do other places—she only did one right? Is she even going to do other places?
Paul also reacted to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign announcement on Monday by tying him to Clinton.
“I think there is some Bush-Clinton fatigue and I really sense that people are looking for something new—something this century kind of stuff. I think there's a hunger for something new out there,” Paul said. “I would be surprised really if we end up with a Bush or a Clinton. I will be shocked to tell you the truth.”
Paul, who's in South Carolina on Monday with his wife Kelley Paul, just arrived after several events with large crowds in Southern California. He drew 900 people in Orange County and 800 in San Diego over the weekend.

Are members of Congress using inside info to get rich? We'll talk dirty politics and big money with a panel including former super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
The U.S. Capitol is seen in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011. The Senate is at right. (AP)
It started with a basic question, as so many good investigations do. How is it that so many members of congress come into office as solidly middle class and leave quite rich. The answer, as Peter Schwiezer discovered was the rules don't apply to them.
What Wall Street would call insider trading is legal for Senators and Congressmen, who are often in the position to be the ultimate insiders. Lobbyists like Jack Abramoff add another dimension of dirtiness, just ask him. Gore Vidal called Bribery our form of democracy, here's the documentation.

Jack Abramoff, former lobbyist and author of Capitol Punishment: The Hard Truth about Washington Corruption From America's Most Notorious Lobbyist.
Highlights
Congress is using non-public information to make stock trades and enrich themselves, contends author Peter Schweizer, in a new book detailing what he describes as rampant insider trading on Capitol Hill.
“During the debate over the Obama healthcare bill there were people on both sides of the aisle that were trading healthcare stocks that, if they were anyone else in America, the timing of their trades would have led the Securities and Exchange Commission to be suspicious,” he said. “For members of Congress, this is considered common practice.”
Compounding that problem is the “revolving door,” where Congressional staff leave for lucrative jobs in the private sector and often trade on their access to politicians that they previously worked for.
“What I would do was to offer a job to a staffer on the Hill…and the second that that job is offered, even if the jobs is a few years down the line, from that minute on, [the staffer] is owned by that lobbying firm,” said Jack Abramoff, the formerly jailed lobbyist. “Their loyalties switch and that is utter corruption.”
It is an open secret in Washington, Abramoff said, that politicians were trading on inside information. “It's almost worse than insider trading, where companies trade on information that's not yet public,” he said. “People on the Hill have information that companies themselves don't even have yet.”
Unfortunately, Ambramoff conceded, reform efforts pushed through Congress rarely reform. “It's actually worse than that: lobbyists look for these reform bills, gleeful, because they know that the people who are pushing these reforms really get too serious because they (a) want to become lobbyists when they leave, and (b) benefit from the system while they're in there. So, there's nothing that they're going to put forward to put a crimp in the lobbying world,” he said.
“Think of reform bills as moving trains that are going to pass, moving past the House and Senate and getting signed by the president. So clever lobbyists look to try to put onto those trains garbage that has nothing to do with reform. I myself tried to do it to the Help America Vote Act, where I tried to put a measure to get a casino legalized in Texas.”
“The worst thing it does is enabling them [Congress] to go around patting themselves on the back and to tell everybody to go back to sleep, the problem is solved,” Abramoff said. “The problem is not solved.”
From The Reading List
60 Minutes "Washington, D.C. is a town that runs on inside information - but should our elected officials be able to use that information to pad their own pockets? As Steve Kroft reports, members of Congress and their aides have regular access to powerful political intelligence, and many have made well-timed stock market trades in the very industries they regulate. For now, the practice is perfectly legal, but some say it's time for the law to change."
The Daily Beast "Schweizer, who is 47, lives in Tallahassee with his wife and children (“New York or D.C. would be too distracting—I'd never get any writing done”) and commutes regularly to Stanford, where he is the William J. Casey research fellow at the Hoover Institution. "
CBS News "Jack Abramoff, the notorious former lobbyist at the center of Washington's biggest corruption scandal in decades, spent more than three years in prison for his crimes. Now a free man, he reveals how he was able to influence politicians and their staffers through generous gifts and job offers. He tells Lesley Stahl the reforms instituted in the wake of his scandal have had little effect."

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), was registered as a lobbyist for the NRA Institute from 2009 until the end of 2015 on issues such as protecting Second Amendment rights, and regulation and gun control, according to lobbying disclosures. He donated $2,700 to the Clinton campaign in April when he was still registered to lobby against gun control. In addition, a colleague at his Forbes-Tate lobbying shop, Elizabeth Greer, also donated $2,700 while registered to lobby for the NRA.
The donation, and Forbes' hosting of the upcoming fundraiser, may complicate a central part of Clinton's current broadside against her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The former secretary of state has made support for gun control a major part of her primary campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. She has been especially forceful in contrasting her longtime support for gun control laws to Sanders' record, noting his support for some NRA-backed initiatives in the past.
In a televised CNN debate in October, Clinton attacked Sanders for voting against the 1994 gun control legislation known as the Brady Bill “five times” and for supporting legislation that extended immunity to gun manufacturers from lawsuits brought by victims of gun violence. Sanders has defended himself by noting his career D-minus rating from the NRA and that he currently endorses the same gun control legislation that Clinton touts.
Appearing on CNN on Tuesday, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who is scheduled to attend the fundraiser, was asked about the event by Jake Tapper.
"As I understand your reference to the gun lobbies," Podesta said, "the person no longer does that; that's a good thing for the country because we need to beat back the gun lobby. I think what's important is that she can stand up as she always has to special interests, to the people who are taking our country in the wrong direction, and she'll do that.”
“But as you know,” he continued, “there's a lot of money coming at us from the other side and we're going to raise resources that we need to raise to compete both in these primaries and then if we're -- if we become the nominee, as I think we will, in the general election. Super PACs are already advertising against her and they have been since Iowa. And we're going to raise money that we need to compete.”
Earlier Tuesday, Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in an emailed statement, “Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with a record of standing up to the NRA and the more than 850,000 people who have contributed to her campaign know exactly where she stands.”
Receiving contributions from lobbyists or ex-lobbyists for the NRA highlights the difficulty in promoting a progressive message on guns and many other issues while accepting money from registered lobbyists. Clinton declined to extend President Barack Obama's ban on contributions from lobbyists to her own campaign. The Democratic National Committee has also stated it is ending the Obama ban on lobbyist contributions.
The lobbyist contribution ban was seen by many as largely symbolic (the CEOs and executives who employ the lobbyists could still donate), but it still helped to underscore Obama's message that he was funded by small donors, even as he raised more money than any other candidate in the modern election period. Further, banning lobbyist contributions prevents the confusion of politicians calling for new gun controls or regulations on fracking or crackdowns on pharmaceutical companies while simultaneously taking money from those who are paid to ensure the opposite policy outcome.
On Thursday night, Fox News aired its second part of the interview between Megyn Kelly and Julian Assange, with the former pressing the Wikileaks founder about recent claims on interest into the mysterious death of Seth Rich.
Seth Rich was a 27-year-old staffer for the Democratic National Committee who was gunned down shortly after 4 a.m. under suspicious circumstances this summer in Northwest DC. The circumstances surrounding Rich's death have spurred conspiracy theories online, with many believing that the young staffer could have been leaking information to the FBI regarding the Clinton family.
“Why are you so interested in Seth Rich's killer?” Kelly bluntly asked her guest Thursday.
Assange responded, “We're very interested in anything that might be a threat to Wikileaks' sources… we're not saying that Seth Rich is necessary connected to our publications. ”
Kelly pressed further, “Do you have any suspicions on who may have been behind his murder?”
The Wikileaks founder said to Kelly, “We have received information… we don't want to compromise the investigation,” coyly.
It's a theory that Assange himself slyly danced around recently during an interview with a Dutch television program. “That was just a robbery I believe, wasn't it?” asked the host for clarification.
“No, there's no finding,” he said simply at the time. I'm suggesting that our sources take risks and they become concerned to see things occurring like that.”
Assange and Wikileaks offered $20,000 in exchange for information regarding the shooting death of Rich.

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
Former Eagles running back LeSean McCoy surely let out a sigh of relief when he was let off the hook for his alleged involvement in a February bar fight that injured two off-duty police officers. Current Eagles wideout Nelson Agholor likely had a similar reaction when it was announced he would not be charged with sexual assault in a case involving an exotic dancer.
But now Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, whose office made the decisions not to press charges against the two football players in separate cases, is being questioned by the conflict-of-interest police.
Williams on Monday filed amended financial disclosure forms for the years 2010-2015, according to Philly.com, and included in the report was the revelation that Williams has received two free, all-access sideline passes from the Eagles since 2011. Also listed as gifts in the filings were "sports tickets," according to the report, with no further description.
MORE: Eagles are a mess (but an interesting mess)
An Eagles rep told Philly.com the sideline passes also are offered to the mayor, fire commissioner and police commissioner. The person also said Williams' second pass is reserved for a member of his staff.
"It's a total inability to understand the nature of conflicts of interest by a public official who has important responsibilities concerning conflicts of interest," said former chair of the city Ethics Board Gregory Williams.
John McNesby, head of Philadelphia's police union, was critical of Williams' investigation into the McCoy incident. He provided a few choice words after the DA office announced in April it had not found sufficient evidence to charge McCoy, who now plays for the Bills. Tensions between the DA's office and Philly PD reportedly had grown during the McCoy investigation.
MORE: McCoy defends character after investigation
As for Agholor, police reportedly wrapped up their investigation June 24 and handed it over to the DA's office after finding insufficient evidence to charge the wide receiver.
Williams was elected as DA in 2009, according to the report, and he said he released the reports in an effort to address "the need for greater transparency."
McCoy, who spent the first six seasons of his NFL career with the Eagles, was traded to the Bills in March of 2015, well before the alleged incident took place.

David Fincher is an auteur in the same way that Alfred Hitchcock is - you can tell a Fincher film from seeing a single frame. His shots are colored with inky blacks and sickly fluorescent greens and they are always compositionally perfect. His camera moves with an eerie disembodied smoothness that makes a Kubrick film seem down right warm and inviting. His movies mine the murky recesses of the human condition; you are more likely to see a grisly murder in a Fincher movie than a passionate kiss. Even movies that have a relatively low body count, like The Social Network, are imbued with a distinctly Finchersque grimness.
A growing number of critics are starting to pay attention. Above you can see Tony Zhou illustrate the director's stylistic restraint in a video essay called "And the Other Way is Wrong." Fincher himself once said, “They know you can do anything so the question is what don't you do, not what do you do.” And Zhou elegantly shows what Fincher does not do, which is such staples of Hollywood filmmaking as hand-held cameras and close ups. He likes his camera locked down and aloof.
In another video essay series, Aaron Aradillas and the great Matt Zoller Seitz focus simply on the openings of Fincher's films. The series starts with Fincher's first, and most maligned, movie Alien3. Aradillas and Zoller Seitz argue that the film is distinctly different from the first two Alien films. Ridley Scott, director of Alien, kept the shots long and the edits largely invisible. Fincher, in contrast, used fast and jarring edits. He started as a music video director and was still in MTV mode when he made Alien3.
In a later episode on Zodiac, arguably his masterpiece, Aradillas and Zoller Seitz show that Fincher brilliantly packed the film's two opening sequences with an impressive amount of exposition, setting up not just story elements but also the film's complex, subjective point of view.
There are four videos in total in this series with a promise of a fifth. You can watch them all here.
Earlier this week, we showed you Cameron Beyl's five-part, three-hour Directors Series study of Stanley Kubrick. Who is he tackling next? Fincher, of course.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Roger Federer experienced quite a range of emotions these past two Australian Opens.
A year ago, he sobbed on court after losing a thrilling final in five sets.
Federer was all smiles Sunday after rather easily beating Andy Murray 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (11) for a fourth championship in Melbourne and 16th Grand Slam title overall.
"All of a sudden, it was over, and it hit me," Federer said. "It was very much a roller-coaster."
While Murray missed a chance to end a drought for British men at Grand Slam tournaments that stretches all the way to 1936, Federer became the first Dad to win a major singles title since 2003. He also now can aim at a true, calendar-year Grand Slam, something no man has accomplished since 1969.
"I'm over the moon winning this again," the 28-year-old Swiss star said. "I played some of my best tennis in my life these last two weeks. It's also very special -- the first Grand Slam as a father."
"I'm over the moon winning this again," Roger Federer said Sunday. "I think I played some of my best tennis in my life these last two weeks." Findlay Kember/AFP/Getty Images
Federer had only recently discovered he was to become the father of twins when he lost the Australian Open final in five wrenching sets against rival Rafael Nadal last year, then broke down during the presentation.
This time, Federer was in control of the action pretty much throughout against Murray, and afterward, it was the 22-year-old from Scotland whose voice was breaking and who was choking back tears.
"I can cry like Roger," Murray said. "It's just a shame I can't play like him."
Compounding the emotions for Federer in Australia a year ago: He missed a chance to tie Pete Sampras' then-record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles. But Federer didn't have to wait long. He matched that mark a few months later at the French Open, where he also completed a career Grand Slam by winning a major on clay to go with his grass and hard-court titles.
Then he regained his Wimbledon crown for major No. 15. In his first major after his twin daughters were born, he was upset in the U.S. Open final by Juan Martin del Potro.
Now the girls are six months old, and Federer has settled into living and traveling with the family. He'll head to the French Open in May as the defending champion for the first time.
In Melbourne, where he also won titles in 2004 and 2006-07, Federer said he'd returned to his highest level. That can't make other players feel too good.
Federer also credited the likes of Murray and Nadal for helping him lift his game.
"I always knew I had it in my hand. The question is do I have it in my mind and in my legs?" he said. "That's something I had to work extremely hard at.
The Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, already facing increased fragmentation, would be further harmed by the planned construction of a new paved road and a bridge in the area. Photo Credit: NGO Friends of the Orangutans
The Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Sabah state is home to rich and varied ecosystems of exotic species, featuring a photogenic kaleidoscope of iconic animals: proboscis monkeys, several species of hornbills, the Asian pygmy elephant and Borneo's emblematic orangutan. The reserve's forests are at constant risk of further environmental degradation through land conversion and fragmentation fueled by illegal logging, agriculture and palm oil cultivation.
But there is another grave new threat to the wellbeing of flora and fauna in the 26,000-hectare sanctuary. In a bid to stimulate the local economy, Sabah's state government wants to expand a paved road and build a new bridge that would cut through the wildlife reserve. The planned bridge will connect the western bank of the Kinabatangan River to Sukau village, replacing the current ferry, which runs between Sukau and a gravel road built by an oil palm company. The new paved road will in turn connect Sukau village to Litang and Tomanggong, over 40 kilometers away to the southeast.
The new infrastructure is meant to boost local communities' economy, but environmentalists believe that it might end up doing the exact opposite. New roads are vital arteries of transport, but in remote wildlife reserves such as in Kinabatangan they can inflict lasting damage on the local ecology. In addition to further fragmenting natural habitats, they also facilitate the easier movement of poachers and illegal loggers, both of whom pose a constant threat to the area's wildlife.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature is set to declare Bornean orangutans “critically endangered” as a result of the continued loss of their habitat. Efforts are underway to protect these unique animals, whose numbers have dwindled to a mere 800 in the wild, but the new infrastructure could well undermine those efforts. The proposed building project would also go against the existing Sabah Elephant & Orangutan Action Plans, which calls on Sabah to “Prevent any process that would further fragment the habitat of” wild elephants and orangutans, including the construction of roads and bridges.
“The Kinabatangan region is already very fragmented and the populations of protected species such as Bornean orangutans and pygmy elephants are decreasing,” Upreshpal Singh, director of NGO Friends of the Orangutans, has said in a statement. “Their survival in the area will only be a bigger challenge if such a project is approved.” The environmentalist added: “We urge the Sabah government to cancel this project as it will cause dramatic environmental, social and economic consequences. Orangutans are endangered. They don't need their habitat to be even more fragmented.”
In the world of music, bands need to do all they can to stand out among the masses. David Bowie and Alice Cooper were pioneers in stage dress up and alter egos. Since then many bands have incorporated their own stage gimmics and dress attire to stand out. V is for Villains chose to be an electronic-industrial band of comic book-esque villains. The band consists of Mr Agitator (vocals), Fallon Flynn (guitar), Veronica Jade (keyboards) and The Pulse (drums), each with their own background and story.
Their album Evolve or Die is what I would consider an electronic album with hits of industrial. Tracks like “Just Another Sinner” and “A World Without Rules” have an industrial beat with a sound sort of between bands like KMFDM and Razed In Black with a dash of Mindless Self Indulgence. I hate name dropping but it is a rather adequate way to describe these tracks.
“Playing The Villain” switches gears and is a driving, fast paced electronic track. “Everybody Hates Me” is another electronic heavy track with some nice bouncy beats and hooks. Where as “March of the Villains” sounds like the bands own personal movie soundtrack with industrial beats mixed together with some sweeping orchestral tones.
While not super chaotic (unlike the vocal styling of Mindless Self Indulgence), Nick Santiago's high pitched vocal delivery on most of the tracks never fully appealed to me. There is enough fluctuation that it didn't completely drive me away, but I feel it worked to flatten the album. I preferred it more when he was singing lower in key and I think it fit the music better in those moments. Female backing vocals help to balance things out at times though.
V is Villains, Evolve or Die is a decent album but has some room to improve. It does an ok job of mixing up the electronic style to keep things interesting enough. If you're a fan of electronic-industrial, it's worth giving a listen. Let us know what you think of it.

The Military Cross (MC) is the third-level military decoration awarded to officers and (since 1993) other ranks of the British Armed Forces, and formerly awarded to officers of other Commonwealth countries.
The MC is granted in recognition of "an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land" to all members of the British Armed Forces of any rank.[5] In 1979, the Queen approved a proposal that a number of awards, including the Military Cross, could be recommended posthumously.[6]
History [ edit ]
The award was created on 28 December 1914 for commissioned officers of the substantive rank of Captain or below and for Warrant Officers. The first 98 awards were gazetted on 1 January 1915, to 71 officers including one jamadar and three subadars, and 27 warrant officers. Although posthumous recommendations for the Military Cross would be unavailable until 1979, the first awards included seven posthumous awards, with the word ‘deceased' after the name of the recipient, from recommendations that had been raised before the recipients died of wounds or lost their lives from other causes.[2]
Awards are announced in the London Gazette, apart from most honorary awards to allied forces in keeping with the usual practice not to gazette awards to foreigners.[7]
From August 1916, recipients of the Cross were entitled to use the post-nominal letters MC,[8] and bars could be awarded for further acts of gallantry meriting the award,[9] with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone to denote the award of each bar.
From September 1916, members of the Royal Naval Division, who served alongside the army on the Western Front, were made eligible for military decorations, including the Military Cross, for the war's duration.[10] Naval officers serving with the division received 140 MCs and eight second award bars.[3]
In June 1917, eligibility was extended to temporary majors, not above the substantive rank of captain.[11] Substantive majors were made eligible in 1953.[12]
In 1931, the award was extended to equivalent ranks in the Royal Air Force for actions on the ground.[13]
After the Second World War, most Commonwealth countries created their own honours system and no longer recommended British awards. The last Military Cross awards for the Canadian Army were for Korea. The last four Australian Army Military Cross awards were promulgated in the London Gazette on 1 September 1972 for Vietnam as was the last New Zealand Army Military Cross award promulgated on 25 September 1970. Canada, Australia and New Zealand have now created their own gallantry awards under their own honours systems.
Since the 1993 review of the honours system, as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, the Military Medal, formerly the third-level decoration for other ranks, has been discontinued. The MC now serves as the third-level award for all ranks of the British Armed Forces for gallantry on land, not to the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.[14]
Description [ edit ]
The Military Cross has the following design:[15]
46 mm maximum height, 44 mm maximum width.
Ornamental silver cross with straight arms terminating in broad finials, suspended from a plain suspension bar.
Obverse decorated with imperial crowns, with the Royal Cypher in centre.
Reverse is plain. From 1938 until 1957 the year of award was engraved on lower limb of cross, [16] and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient. [15]
and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient. The ribbon width is 32 mm and consists of three equal vertical moire stripes of white, purple, and white.
Ribbon bar denoting a further award is plain silver, with a crown in the centre.
Recipients [ edit ]
Numbers awarded [ edit ]
Since 1914 over 52,000 Military Crosses and 3,717 bars have been awarded.[3] The dates below reflect the relevant London Gazette entries:
Period Medals 1st bar 2nd bar 3rd bar Honorary
MCs Honorary

In addition, approximately 375 MCs have been awarded since 1979, including awards for Northern Ireland, the Falklands and the wars in the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan.[18]
The above table includes awards to the Dominions:
In all, 3,727 Military Crosses have been awarded to those serving with Canadian forces, including 324 first bars and 18 second bars.[19]
A total of 2,930 were awarded to Australians, in addition to 188 first bars and four second bars. Of these, 2,403 MCs, 170 first Bars and four second Bars were for World War I.[20]
Over 500 MCs were awarded to New Zealanders during World War I and over 250 in World War II. The most recent awards were for service in Vietnam.[21]
The honorary MC awards were made to servicemen from fifteen Allied countries in World War I, and nine in World War II.[3]

The three-digit telephone number "9-1-1" has been designated as the "Universal Emergency Number," for citizens throughout the United States to request emergency assistance. It is intended as a nationwide telephone number and gives the public fast and easy access to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). In the United States, the first catalyst for a nationwide emergency telephone number was in 1957, when the National Association of Fire Chiefs recommended use of a single number for reporting fires.
In 1967, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a "single number should be established" nationwide for reporting emergency situations. The use of different telephone numbers for each type of emergency was determined to be contrary to the purpose of a single, universal number.
Other Federal Government Agencies and various governmental officials also supported and encouraged the recommendation. As a result of the immense interest in this issue, the President's Commission on Civil Disorders turned to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a solution.
In November 1967, the FCC met with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) to find a means of establishing a universal emergency number that could be implemented quickly. In 1968, AT&T announced that it would establish the digits 9-1-1 (nine-one-one) as the emergency code throughout the United States.
The code 9-1-1 was chosen because it best fit the needs of all parties involved. First, and most important, it met public requirements because it is brief, easily remembered, and can be dialed quickly. Second, because it is a unique number, never having been authorized as an office code, area code, or service code, it best met the long range numbering plans and switching configurations of the telephone industry.
Congress backed AT&T's proposal and passed legislation allowing use of only the numbers 9-1-1 when creating a single emergency calling service, thereby making 9-1-1 a standard emergency number nationwide. A Bell System policy was established to absorb the cost of central office modifications and any additions necessary to accommodate the 9-1-1 code as part of the general rate base.
With Enhanced 9-1-1, or E9-1-1, local PSAPs are responsible for paying network trunking costs according to tariffed rates, and for purchasing telephone answering equipment from the vendor of their choice.
On February 16, 1968, Senator Rankin Fite completed the first 9-1-1 call made in the United States in Haleyville, Alabama. The serving telephone company was then Alabama Telephone Company. This Haleyville 9-1-1 system is still in operation today.
On February 22, 1968, Nome, Alaska implemented 9-1-1 service.
In March 1973, the White House's Office of Telecommunications issued a national policy statement which recognized the benefits of 9-1-1, encouraged the nationwide adoption of 9-1-1, and provided for the establishment of a Federal Information Center to assist units of government in planning and implementation.
The intense interest in the concept of 9-1-1 can be attributed primarily to the recognition of characteristics of modern society, i.e., increased incidences of crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies, inadequacy of existing emergency reporting methods, and the continued growth and mobility of the population. In the early 1970s, AT&T began the development of sophisticated features for the 9-1-1 with a pilot program in Alameda County, California. The feature was "selective call routing." This pilot program supported the theory behind the Executive Office of Telecommunication's Policy.
By the end of 1976, 9-1-1 was serving about 17% of the population of the United States. In 1979, approximately 26% of the population of the United States had 9-1-1 service, and nine states had enacted 9-1-1 legislation. At this time, 9-1-1 service was growing at the rate of 70 new systems per year. By 1987, those figures had grown to indicate that 50% of the US population had access to 9-1-1 emergency service numbers.
In addition, Canada recognized the advantages of a single emergency number and chose to adopt 9-1-1 rather than use a different means of emergency reporting service, thus unifying the concept and giving 9-1-1 international stature.
At the end of the 20th century, nearly 93% of the population of the United States was covered by some type of 9-1-1 service. Ninety-five percent of that coverage was Enhanced 9-1-1. Approximately 96% of the geographic US is covered by some type of 9-1-1. Other Federal Government Agencies and various governmental officials also supported and encouraged the recommendation. As a result of the immense interest in this issue, the President's Commission on Civil Disorders turned to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a solution.The intense interest in the concept of 9-1-1 can be attributed primarily to the recognition of characteristics of modern society, i.e., increased incidences of crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies, inadequacy of existing emergency reporting methods, and the continued growth and mobility of the population.
Umno's Tasek Gelugor MP Datuk Shabudin Yahya said that physically and spiritually it is not a problem to marry off girls aged between 9 to 12 years old. — File pic
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 — The future of rape victims is “not bleak” if they are married to their rapists, Umno's Tasek Gelugor MP Datuk Shabudin Yahya said today.
Speaking in the Dewan Rakyat while debating the Child Sexual Offences Bill, Shabudin said that marriage between a victim and her rapist can in fact help solve social problems.
“The thing is they have an opportunity — with a marriage they can lead a healthy and good life,” he said during the committee stage debate of the Bill.
“For a wife that was raped, if she can marry (the person) she would not go through such a bleak future. At least she has someone who can become her husband. So this will be a remedy to social problems,” he added.
Shabudin said so while objecting to an amendment to the Bill proposed by Teo Nie Ching (Kulai-DAP), who wanted the Bill to be amended to also spell out the invalidity of child marriages.
The proposed amendment was voted down and the Bill was subsequently passed without any major changes.
Shabudin said that it is not fair to “assume” that a person committed a sexual offence will continue being a “bad person”.
“Maybe he repents, or regrets. It is better to have people who regret rather than people who do not regret. So in this case, let us not put an assumption that the person will remain bad. (Marriage) can be an exit clause for this problem,” he said.
He also said that physically and spiritually it is not a problem to marry off girls aged between 9 to 12 years old.
“They reach puberty at the age of 9, or 12. And at that time, the physical state of their body is already akin to them being 18 years old,” he said.
“So physically and spiritually it is not a barrier for the girl to marry,” he added.
Shabudin was defending existing provisions which allows minors to be married off as long as their parents or guardians seek permission from the Shariah Courts.
There is limited data about child marriages in Malaysia, but it was previously reported that around 15,000 girls below the age of 19 are married in the country.
The new Bill by Putrajaya criminalises sexual connection without consent to minors aged 18 and below, but provisions allowing child marriages was not addressed in the Bill.
Natalie Wood's sister claims to know who killed the actress 33 years ago.
"I know who killed Natalie," Lana Wood told Closer Weekly of one of Hollywood's biggest unsolved mysteries.
Natalie Wood's case was reopened in 2011 and although Lana cannot reveal details of her sister's drowning, she did claim that "according to the detectives, they think they do [know], too. There is no way the could [shut down] a case this close to being solved."

Lana hopes the new information will lead to the truth coming out but every day she is reminded of her sister's tragic death, she said.
"I don't believe there is such thing as closure," she told the magazine. "Her death is ugly and painful to this day. It always will be. These days, I only go to the cemetery once a year because it hurts too badly."
Natalie Wood died after she fell off a yacht on Nov. 28, 1981, according to her husband Robert Wagner. Bruises on her body were originally said to have been from her failed attempt to climb back onto the boat.
She was nominated for three Academy Awards during her lifetime. Her death stunned the world and has remained one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries.

Live Out Loud Productions, a leading Detroit video production company, was recently contracted to work on the production of BURN, a documentary about the lives of Detroit firefighters produced by Denis Leary.
Online PR News – 05-September-2013 – Detroit, MI – Live Out Loud Productions, a Detroit video production company committed to brand awareness and identity by challenging, inspiring and strengthen viewers, was recently contracted to work on the production of BURN, an award-winning documentary about Detroit firefighters. By providing location audio, camera, and local production services, Live Out Loud Productions helped to bring BURN's important message to audiences all around the globe.
BURN is an action packed, award-winning film about the city of Detroit, told through the eyes of the firefighters on the front lines. From directors Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez, and executive producer Denis Leary, this riveting and inspiring film explores human struggles, hope, and personal courage in the face of overwhelming odds.

Reprinted from the Press and Journal:
She never saw it coming.
Appearing on MSNBC's “Hardball with Chris Matthews,” State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was caught off-guard by the host's tough questions. When asked what it will take for the U.S. to defeat the Islamic State, Harf admitted “we cannot win this war by killing them.”
She went further: “We need in the medium and longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it's a lack of opportunity for jobs.”
Islamic radicals are capturing vast swaths of Iraq and Syria because they want… jobs?
Non-interventionists, who at first favored President Obama's reluctance for war, are tiring of the political-correctness. The administration appears clueless on how to deal with ISIS. The president's team is more frightened to use the word “Islam” than of scores of Egyptian Copts murdered in cold blood by Islamic State soldiers.
The inability to “know thy enemy,” as Sun Tzu put it, is just one reason Obama won't win the war against ISIS. His recent request to Congress for the use of military force is a mere formality.
Nearly 3,000 troops are already on the ground in Iraq, ominously echoing the beginnings of the Vietnam War. Airstrikes have been going on for 6 months, despite NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's admission that strikes won't be enough to defeat the new caliphate.
Even if the Oval Office was occupied with someone more hawkish, America would still be inept at defeating ISIS. In brute force, the U.S. military is vastly superior to the estimated 20,000 jihadists pledged to the Islamic State. But ISIS isn't operating on the same epistemological level as the generals at the Pentagon. For them, this fight goes beyond bullets and rockets. It's a history-defining struggle to bring on the end times.
The Western mind can't begin to comprehend such devotion. The rise of strict secularism in the public sphere has left us incapable of understanding the motivation behind the Sunni-dominated Islamic State.
We live in what philosopher Charles Taylor calls the “Secular Age” and it shows. Public policy follows god-less reason. We see ISIS only as a threat to American embassies in Iraq. Islamic fighters see us as necessary evil in their holy war for global domination.
Graeme Wood of The Atlantic recently profiled the Islamic State, detailing its origins and goals. The one takeaway from the report is that the U.S. is engaged in a futile struggle. We have nothing to offer ISIS. They aren't tortured souls yearning to breathe free. ISIS has one clear goal: Restore an Islamic caliphate governed by Shariah Law. Western democracy, with its secular bend and laws of tolerance, is a threat to their preferred way of life.
This is visible in the gruesome actions carried out by ISIS radicals. Throwing gay men off the top of buildings, stoning apostates, forcing Christians into servitude – these are things Americans would never think of doing. But to the Islamic State, all of this is necessary. It's rooted in their “vision of life as obedience, order, and destiny.”
ISIS doesn't even operate on the same plane of civic virtue as us. According to Sharia, Muslims can't recognize borders of sovereign nation-states. Doing so is a form of apostasy or polytheism. The United States can't carve out an Islamic-only country to placate ISIS, à la Israel. Nothing we offer is enough.
Our misunderstanding of ISIS's motives stems from America's unique beginnings. Our founding documents are a compromise between deism and Puritan fundamentalism. Thus, our Declaration of Independence contains the spirit of God who is both personal and removed from day-to-day life.
Over time, the balance led to religion retreating from the public square to an exclusively private vocation. The result is a mindset University of British Columbia psychology professor Joe Henrich calls WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic.
Being WEIRD is unlike anything else known in the world up until the 19th Century. Our values of reason, fairness, and rights are not shared by the rest of the world. In mindset, America is exceptional. But the irony is that this exceptionalism may be our undoing in trying to eliminate ISIS.
Islamic State members don't think like us. They are more than religiously devout; they firmly believe the apocalypse is approaching and their conclave will be led to victory by a messiah named Mahdi. In their view, the ransacking of homes stealing of wealth, and trail of death and destruction will soon be justified with the world's end. The final confrontation between the good Muslims and evil forces will take place in the Syrian city of Dabiq. One of the perceived enemies is America.
ISIS isn't looking for peace; the caliphate is seeking confrontation. As Wood writes, “The biggest proponent of an American invasion is the Islamic State itself. “
How do we compete with an enemy that is asking to be destroyed?
Nobody, Democrat or Republican, has the answer. We are at a lack for what conservative writer Rod Dreher calls “the intensity with which religion is felt in most of the world.”
Centuries of enlightened thought have left the West numb to the power of spiritual ideas. Our values have no bearing on the Islamic State.
Reason can only go so far in combating people who believe beheadings and immolation are lawful requirements. The uncomfortable truth the Obama administration won't admit is that ISIS is not an anomaly of Islam; they adhere to a strict Sunni interpretation.
There is good news, however. It's entirely possible the Islamic State could fail on its own. Religious devotion, it turns out, doesn't provide water or electricity to cities. The towns ISIS controls are, for the most part, impoverished. They risk losing support simply because they can't keep the lights on.
That's may be our only path to victory. Force will only get us so far. Tearing down their government and giving them jobs and democracy won't eradicate ISIS. They don't want a constitutional government. They want us dead, and a path to paradise.
Let's hope that never happens.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran and Saudi Arabia will exchange diplomatic visits soon, Tehran said on Wednesday, indicating a possible thaw in relations between the regional rivals since they severed diplomatic ties last year.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) that the visits could take place after the haj pilgrimage ends in the first week of September.
“The visas have been issued for both sides to make this trip,” Zarif said, according to ISNA. “We are waiting for the final steps to be completed so diplomats from the two countries can inspect their embassies and consulates.”
Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia are at their worst in years, with each accusing the other of subverting regional security and supporting opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran in Jan. 2016 after a prominent Saudi Shi'ite cleric was executed, prompting Riyadh to close the embassy.
Saudi Arabia and several other Arab governments have severed ties with Qatar, citing its support of Iran as one of the main reasons.
Iran has blamed Saudi Arabia for being behind deadly twin attacks on June 7 in Tehran claimed by Islamic State. At least 18 people were killed and more than 40 wounded in the attacks, in which Riyadh has denied any involvement.
Thousands of Iranian pilgrims are currently undertaking the haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.
Your alternate news site sucks, and everyone thinks you're an idiot for reading it. These sites are like catnip for dipshits. They always post "BREAKING NEWS" articles with Earth-shattering headlines and have urgent-sounding names that make it sound like some serious shit's about to go down:
Look at this bullshit.
Except what you get instead is some poorly-written, unresearched opinions, debunked conspiracy theories and a bunch of pseudo-scientific articles with "one weird trick" to cure something gross like mouth rot. Want a scoop? Any time you read a website that advertises a product for people missing teeth, that means they're advertising to you.
Now I know what you're thinking, "but Maddox, I have all my teeth!" You won't for long. People who read alternate news sites will eventually lose their teeth. It's an Anankean inevitability; you're going to do something stupid like put a firecracker in your mouth because you are stupid. Want to know how I know? Because you read bullshit instead of news, and you not only think you're informed, but that you're smarter than the general populace because you're doing your own independent research from an independent news source. Except you're not. You're an idiot who's going to lose all his teeth. These sites are using you for money:
Any time I see one of these bullshit articles, I quickly scan the URL for words like, "truth, planet, evolution, natural" or anything that sounds like it might be a website that sells you pink Himalayan anything. If it's not from a trusted, or "main stream" news source, I become more skeptical, not less.
For example, here's that article I referenced in the video from WorldTruth.tv:
The "truth" that your Doctor doesn't want you to know because he wants his patients to die 1
The article is scarce on sources, but one of the only legitimate studies they link to clearly states that, "there is no scientific literature establishing the benefit of an alkaline diet for the prevention of cancer at this time 2 ."
As with most websites and people trying to con you, if you want to know "the truth," all you need to do is follow the money. If a website is touting the benefits of a certain supplement that they also happen to be conveniently selling, guess what, idiot? The article was written to sell you a product. You're reading an ad.
Drink this for a boner 3
Speaking of ads, InfoWars is one of the worst offenders. They pretend to be the arbiters of some supposed truth, while Alex Jones bloviates every week about some supposed government takeover that he keeps promising will happen year after year. They're coming for your: guns, property, liberty. They're always coming, but never here. UPDATE (10/14/16): The screenshot of the Infowars website has changed since I created this video, but you can still see the item in the store on Archive.org, including the 1600+ reviews giving it 4.5:
When it comes to food, any time I see the words "ancient, wisdom" or "legend" on the package, I spike that shit into a land fill. Speaking of, here's an excerpt from the InfoWars "super male vitality" product:
"Super Male Vitality is the result of ancient wisdom reinterpreted over several years in the light of modern equipment and analysis.
Reinterpreted over several years? What the hell does that even mean? When you interpret something, you make sense of it. When you reinterpret something, that means someone already made sense of it (supposedly the "ancients"), and now you're making more sense of it? Why? I thought the ancients were wise? And if we're relying on ancient wisdom, why is the use of "modern equipment and analysis" a selling point? I thought the ancients knew their shit?
Ancient wisdom is garbage. The "ancients" drank mercury and didn't know the function of our brains. These are a people who had a life-expectancy of 30 years, had no cars, no Internet and no floss. Most of them were missing teeth... and if they were around today, they'd probably listen to Infowars. Sounds like a civilization made entirely of morons.
Stop buying into this bullshit. You're getting played. If it's not a "main stream" news source, that means they don't have anyone to answer to and nobody will lose their job if they report inaccurate information. You're not "woke" for reading alternate news, you're a dipshit. Rather than poring over old news clips to prove that 9/11, Sandy Hook, or the Boston Marathon was an "inside job," you should go outside and get a job.

Electric bus manufacturer Proterra announced that transit agency SporTran is rolling out Louisiana's first fleet of zero-emission, battery-electric transit buses in Shreveport.
The five Proterra 40′ Catalyst E2 buses will go into service this month and serve Louisiana's third-largest city. According to Proterra, this milestone marks the combined commitment and foresight of SporTran and Shreveport in being the first city in the state to purchase battery-electric buses, paving the way for other public transit agencies to follow suit and recognize the economic, environmental and operations benefits. To mark this achievement, SporTran, Proterra and senior government officials came together on Wednesday with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards to commemorate the deployment of the new electric buses and the debut of new transit stations and infrastructure.
“In the wake of a devastating hurricane season for surrounding communities, we're reminded by our long-term mission to sustainably serve Shreveport and our neighbors,” said Dinero Washington, CEO at SporTran. “This means providing reliable and safe transit for all. It also means providing innovative and cost-saving solutions that ensure clean, reliable transit today and for years to come. We're proud to partner with Proterra and introduce these new zero-emission buses into our fleet.”
In 2016, SporTran won a Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Low or No-Emission Vehicle Deployment Grant, which funded the five electric buses, three depot chargers and an on-route fast charger. By replacing its diesel buses, SporTran estimates that the new Proterra Catalyst buses will save more than $2.2 million on maintenance and fuel over the lifetime of the five vehicles. As a result, SporTran will re-invest the savings into Shreveport's transportation system with the goal of improving bus routes, technology and rider experience.
According to Proterra, its 40′ Catalyst E2 series gets 22 MPGe, while conventional diesel buses average 3.86 MPG. These buses will utilize Combined Charged Standard (CCS) plug-in DC fast chargers, enabling multiple types and brands of EV cars, trucks and buses to potentially share the same charging equipment and lower infrastructure costs for all electric vehicles.
“We are proud to partner with SporTran, an innovative transit agency that continues to raise the transit bar for its passengers and community alike. We look forward to helping SporTran speed into a cleaner, healthier future for all, by providing a model for zero-emission transit,” said Ryan Popple, CEO of Proterra.

When the Americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in Geneva, the meetings took place at the Palace of Nations, one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the 20th century that have housed the United Nations since it was formed after World War II. Those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war, an order associated with American leadership — or domination — amid the tensions of the Cold War.
Now, the role of the United States in Syria and across the Middle East is widely seen as having receded under former President Barack Obama, and its future remains uncertain. Mr. Obama, while backing some rebel groups, resisted deeper American involvement in the Syrian conflict, ceding the leading role to Russia. His successor, President Trump, has signaled broad approval of Russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on Syria.
Officially, all sides in the Syrian conflict describe the goal of the talks in Astana as reaffirming a tenuous cease-fire in order to revive the Geneva talks. The cease-fire, started in December and known formally as a cessation of hostilities, is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups, including the Levant Conquest Front and the Islamic State.
A strengthening of the cessation across Syria, the United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday, could pave the way for discussion of more substantive political issues at talks scheduled for February in Geneva. The United Nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in Astana, but Mr. de Mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms.
Western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in Astana could be a Russian effort to ultimately replace the Geneva discussions, which the Russian government has criticized. The Syrian government and the Russians have long argued that the Geneva framework, calling for a transitional body with full governing powers, does not require President Bashar al-Assad to step down, while the opposition has insisted that it does.
But as a practical matter, an increasing number of Western countries, including the United States, and even some of the rebels' backers in the Middle East, like Turkey, have moved toward the Russian position.
With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria, and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants, they have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad to step down ahead of a settlement, instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement.

Those golden arches turned to turquoise at one McDonald's in Sedona, Arizona. Apparently, gold doesn't match the cityscape well enough.

A writer for the Santa Barbara Independent might have summed it up best: "Leaders wanted no vulgar, ticky-tacky, pseudo-gold conflicting with the warm glow from Mother Nature's buttes, mesas, and towering cathedral-like mountains."
Although this is being hailed as the only McDonald's with turquoise arches in the world, there are other McD's with interesting architecture.
A Las Vegas McDonald's has a huge arch and a sign sparkly enough to be a chandelier in the Trump Hotel.
There's also this one in New York's Hyde Park, which puts a unique spin on McDonald's trademark sign.

Whenever there was a discussion about TV trackers in the last couple of weeks, the spotlight has been on BTN. While BTN definitely is a feature filled private tracker, it is not the only TV torrent site that's been improving. This post is about ShareTheRemote (better known as STR), another gazelle based tracker that's grown a fair bit since it's launch several months ago. STR recently introduced a number of changes to its ratio system – this includes new free leech modes (half leech, double upload), changes to what users placed under ‘ratio watch' can download, changes to their TV show database (TheTVDB) and other minor tweaks. ShareTheRemote is currently closed for signup but they do have an official invites IRC channel where potential new members can get invited.
Quoted below are some of the recent changes made to STR, as posted on news items on site homepage:
We have modified our tracker to support two new freeleech types. These are 'half-leech' and 'double upload'. Their functions are just as their names imply; when downloading half-leech torrents, only half of the data you download will be counted, and double upload torrents will award double the upload credit that you seed.
Effective Immediately: Torrents over 25GB are no longer freeleech, they are now half-leech.
Although this change may be met with some disparity, it is for the best of the site's health. Allowing so many large torrents to be freeleech was having detrimental effects on their seeder retention and the site's economy. We will be evaluating ways to counterbalance the loss of this freeleech for new users, so feel free to make suggestions!
We plan to use double upload as an incentive for people to download and seed underseeded torrents. We haven't came up with exact numbers for this yet, but we hope to have it implemented within the next few days.
Finally, due to TheTVDB's frequent downtime and decision to block embedding images from another torrent site, banners hosted on TheTVDB may no longer be used. It is still encouraged to use banners from that site, however you should first upload them to an image hosting site such as imgur. Since we felt that the ratio brackets were not adequate for the size of torrents on this site, we've increased them by a factor of 1.5. This effectively increases the grace period for new users to 15GB. A full list of ratio requirements is available at rules.php?p=ratio. We've rolled out another set of tracker changes that we hope you guys will enjoy.
The most notable of these changes is that users on ratio watch can now download full freeleech torrents. We hope that this will help users who find themselves on ratio watch without torrents that receive frequent traffic work their ways off of it.
To fix an oversight on my part, torrents may now be any logical combination of the three freeleech types. The main reasoning behind this change is to allow underseeded half-leech torrents to be double upload as well.
Additionally, the tracker now supports 'single user freeleech'. This feature treats every torrent as freeleech for any user who has this flag set. Although we do not know how or if this feature will be used, we decided to add it to prevent a later recompile if we decide to implement it.
Although somewhat overshadowed by the success of BTN, ShareTheRemote too boats an impressive set of site features. They too have a TV Shows Database, detailed series pages, staff picks and even a TV news section. Series pages are similar to that of BTN – individual episodes and season packs for a particular show are accessible from a single location. The collector add-on found on these pages makes downloading all available full season packs for a particular show a breeze. In addition to the widgets you can see in the screenshot to the right, there is a recommendations add-on which suggests other similar shows to the user.
Currently, there are over 7200 users and nearly 5000 torrents indexed on this tracker. Some of these torrents are full season packs and some, as said earlier, are individual episodes. While STR already has a healthy flow of new daily torrents, they would need to improve this aspect if they are to compete against the likes of BTN, BMTV, etc who definitely add more content every day.
STR has been open for registration several times in the past but the site is currently invited only. However, there's still hope for those who missed the open registrations (or for those hearing about this tracker for the first time right now). Although many are unaware, STR has an official invites channel hosted on their IRC server. You may get an invite by following the procedure mentioned on the channel topic.

The Spanish cabinet, in an extraordinary meeting this evening, has agreed to remove from office Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and all members of the Catalan government after the declaration of independence approved today by the Catalan Parliament. The announcement was made by prime minister Mariano Rajoy in a press conference after the cabinet meeting this evening. He also made the announcement of the dissolution of the Catalan Parliament ahead of early elections on 21st December. The cabinet has also agreed to present a request for the enforcement of a ruling to the Constitutional Court for it to annul the declaration of independence.
With this, the Spanish government starts enacting the measures it has planned based on article 155 of the Spanish Constitution after receiving approval from the Spanish Senate this Friday. "Injustice has been imposed on the law in a string of arbitrary and exclusive decisions", said Rajoy on the independence process. He showed himself calm in the "confidence that the [Spanish] state has sufficient means to, peacefully and with moderation, recover normality and dissolve the threats being made against coexistence," he said.
The Spanish cabinet has given the green light to five decrees:
Removal from office of Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. Removal from office of vice-president Oriol Junqueras and all the ministers of the government, except Santi Vila (who handed in his resignation yesterday). Designation of Spanish ministries as the bodies in charge of taking on the roles of their Catalan counterparts. This decree also includes an appendix detailing equivalences for the roles that present more doubts, according to Spanish government sources. Closures of Catalan government bodies: Diplocat (Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia), offices and delegations abroad, removal of the representatives of Catalonia to Brussels, removal of the director of the Mossos (Catalan police) and the responsible official in the Catalan Interior department. Dissolution of the Parliament of Catalonia and the calling of Catalan elections for the 21st December.
Central government sources note that, with the firing of the government, also to lose their jobs are those senior officials holding "positions of trust", cabinet members and advisors, some 140 people.
The government sources add that, even if Puigdemont and his ministers remain in place, their salaries are suspended, as is their ability to sign documents. If they do so, they would be committing a crime of usurpation of functions. The Spanish government, however, avoided explaining whose role it is to make them leave, although everything suggests that the Public Prosecutors' Office would have to act. Rajoy labelled the government and its deputies as "fan of 'when things are worst, all the better', who have liquidated the pro-negotiation and inclusive Catalan movement".
Rajoy appeared solemn but direct during his speech, after which he didn't accept any questions, which started around 8:15pm at the Moncloa palace (his official residence). At the lectern, he denounced the declaration of independence, saying that all Catalans, be they pro-union or not, found it "heart-breaking, sad and agonising" and that "they couldn't allow this situation based on lies, frauds and impositions". As a consequence, he defended his decisions to "return democratic legitimacy to the self-government", currently "liquidated".
The calling of "clean and legal" elections was the topic that Rajoy went into in the most depth. First, he noted that Puigdemont had "the opportunity to call elections" this Thursday, but that he didn't. As such, Rajoy will offer "real ballot boxes, which have checks, which can set the foundations for the necessary cooperation between Catalans". On this point he insisted that it was never his wish to call such early elections, but the declaration of independence has pushed him into it "so that they cannot commit illegal acts" in the name of the Catalan Parliament.
Finally, the prime minister thanked PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) and Ciudadanos (Citizens), and their leaders, Pedro Sánchez and Albert Rivera "for measures which they share and have proposed", as well as smaller regional parties that present for elections with the PP (Popular Party). He continued that today should be "a day for calm and hope for all Spaniards". "Catalonia needs to find itself again with the law, the truth and with itself" to return to "coexistence and concord", he concluded.
The Leica R series of lenses was first introduced in 1964 with the original Leicaflex body. Recently, the Leica R lenses have made somewhat of a revival in recent years with the advent of larger digital formats. Fast, sharp, relatively cheap, manual aperture, 270 degree focus throw, and easily mountable to certain modern lens mounts, the Leica R lenses sound pretty much perfect on paper for motion film work. But how do they compare to their modern counterparts?
I recently picked up a Leica R 50mm Summicron (Leica's way of saying f/2.0) to start working on my own set (19mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 90mm). The serial number on my particular lens indicated that it is a Version 2 made in 1978. Version 2 are said to be optically and mechanically superior to the Version 1, which ran from 1962 – 1975, though I have not done any tests to support that claim. Instead, I decided to directly compare my 50mm Version 2 Summicron to other more popular and expensive lenses. The prices range from ~$500 – $20,000 per lens, but would the results align with the price?
The Lineup
I chose to compare my Leica R 50mm to other 50mm lenses based on availability and specs — mainly lenses of similar speeds. I would have loved to add Zeiss Ultra Primes, Super Speeds, and Master Primes to the mix, but unfortunately those weren't available at the time of this test. Regardless, I was happy with my selection below:
This was by no means a scientific test; I wasn't able to control the light as well as I would have liked. In the future, I wish to shoot a more extensive test with video clips to show movement, flaring, and bokeh. But this was simply a visual comparison with stills pulled from the camera.
I opted to shoot with an Arri Amira at 4k UHD (3840 x 2160), ProRes 444 in LogC, and then with a Rec709 LUT applied in post. With the Amira, I was able to use both EF and PL lenses with a simple mount change on the Amira body. As stated before, I only tested the lenses at a F/2.0 with the exception of the Zeiss CP.2. I kept the exposure index at the Amira's native 800, 5600K color temperature, at 23.976 frames per second. In addition, I chose to shoot at a shutter speed of 1/250 in order to open the lenses; I didn't want to use any ND to avoid optical performance loss, and I didn't want to pull down to a lower EI, as performance at native ISO is important and most people shoot at native. I also knew I would be only pulling stills for this test — videos will be coming in the future!
On with the tests
First off, let me get this out of the way: please excuse my dead facial expression. I was pulling focus wirelessly with a director's monitor off camera right, and I wanted to make sure I achieved critical focus, so apologies for my dumb face. Anyways, moving on…
Click the pictures for full resolution!
Starting with the focus chart, it's quite apparent how different the colors vary from lens to lens. To my eyes, the Leica is immediately cooler than the others. The Zeiss CP2 and Schneider Xenar exhibit some more magenta, while the Cooke S4 is slightly warmer than the others, yet brighter. Something that might be worth noting is that the Leica goes by F-stops whereas the Zeiss, Schneider, and Cooke go by T-stops. F/2.0 on the Leica may not be equivalent to the T/2.0 on the other lenses, but closer to T/2.2 – T/2.5. This might explain why the Leica looks slightly underexposed compared to the other lenses. Another interesting note is that when the Canon L was attached to the Amira's EF mount, I was given the option to set it's T-stop rather than F-stop in the Amira's menu options, even to the extent of being able to choose 1/8th stops (I set it to T/2.0, 0/8). Exposure-wise, the Canon looked similar to the other 3 lenses not including the Leica but I'm not sure how accurate the Amira's T-stop setting is compared to the Canon's actual F-stop rating.
By sampling the white and middle gray squares of the focus chart, we get a clearer look of the color shift with each lens.
The corresponding vectorscopes also demonstrate the color shifts:
Now everyone knows that shooting focus charts isn't the best way to test a lens and make any lens look bad when put under the microscrope. So how do the lenses render skin tones and human facial features?

Compared to the Canon, the Leica seems to exhibit lower contrast and evens out the skin tones within the areas around and underneath my eyes and my nose. Both are sharp, but it looks like there's slightly less detail in the hair with the Leica, while the Canon seems to hold finer skin detail. I personally like the way that the Leica renders my skintone and has a more “even” look to it.
The Cooke is exceptionally sharp, as expected for the price. There's definitely something more to the Cooke that stands apart from all the other lenses; it has a dimensionality that is hard to put my finger on. It really looks like my face is popping out of the image. There's a glow to the skin and it really looks like it changes the proportions of my head to a flattering level (it's also very awkward to objectively analyze my own face and facial structure). Perhaps it's in the way that it handles contrast compounded with it's sharpness and minimal barrel distortion? Or it's in the way that it seems to compress my head into a less distorted space? The perspective of the Cooke is something that is very new to me, and I'm still trying to figure it out.
Surprising to me, the Schneider Xenars and Zeiss CP.2s are very similar. Both have a reddish magenta hue to them and are very sharp. The Schneiders seem to do something similar to the Cookes in the way that it compresses my face in a more pleasing way, but not quite to the extent of the Cooke. It looks as though the Cooke and Schneider seem to narrow my head around the forehead, pulling the head in, rather than stretching it out like the Canon, Leica, and Zeiss (or perhaps it's correcting it?). I'm really not sure, if anyone has any insight I would love to hear what you think.
Corner Sharpness
One more set of images, which holds the most surprising results! I don't think you'll even be ready to see this.
The Cooke performs the worst by far when comparing corner and edge sharpness. It even goes to the extent of completely distorting the focus circle on the very top left portion of the focus chart. There's also very clear soft fall off on the edges of the frame compared to any of the other lenses. I found it very hard to believe seeing how a single Cooke S4 costs $20,000 and gets outperformed in a category by a $500 lens. The Leica performs poorly as well when compared to the Canon, Zeiss, and Schneider, which I was somewhat expecting given the age of these lenses. There's also pretty clear chromatic abberation with the Canon (which isn't only visible in the corners). The CP.2 also fell victim to this when rack focusing various parts of the focus chart which isn't evident in the still photos.
And there you have it, a fairly unscientific visual comparison between these 5 lenses. I guess what's left to say is… are the Leica's worth it? I personally think so, and I'm definitely in the market to look for a few more Leica Rs to complete my set. Overall, I was pretty happy with the performance of these lenses. The Leicas might not be as sharp, but there's a color flatness and degree of low contrast that I really like. I find it feels “cinematic” and “filmic” in the way that it smooths and blends skin tone and color. There are still a few more things for me to cover but I want to save that for future posts. This was my very first blog post, and I hope to write more and add videos for the next one.

Canada's Women's U-20 Team looks set to compete with the best in the world after two spirited friendlies with Korea Republic that were part of the team's latest camp in Burnaby, BC, 31 May to 10 June.
As they continue to prepare for this summer's FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Canada 2014, Head Coach Andrew Olivieri's team took on Asian U-19 champions Korea Republic in a pair of friendlies in Vancouver.
On Saturday 7 June, defender Kadeisha Buchanan and midfielder Ashley Campbell had the goals as Canada took the lead twice but each time were pegged back in a game that ended in a 2:2 draw.
Three days later, the teams were right back at it and for the second straight game, Canada jumped in front. This time it was Nichelle Prince scoring in the 20th minute but the Koreans responded just four minutes later.
The teams remained in a stalemate until the 79th minute when Korea scored again to come away with a 2:1 victory.
Canada still has just under two months to continue preparations. The team will head south in July for a pair of friendlies with CONCACAF rivals Mexico before finally being in the home stretch for their FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup opener on 5 August against Ghana at BMO Field in Toronto.
They'll stay in Toronto for their second game of the competition on 8 August against Finland before moving onto Montreal for their third game of Group A action against Korea DPR on 12 August at the Olympic Stadium.
Over the last few years, Texas Tech's football uniforms have been a hot topic of discussion. Some uniform combinations have impressed while others have disappointed. So we are starting a new series at Viva The Matadors to find out which Red (or white or black or grey) Raider uniforms you, the fans, like the most.
The seeding for the tournament is outlined below, with a brief reason for the seed and a picture of the uniform from a game it was worn in. While we couldn't reach an absolute consensus as a staff, the seeding is a general guideline of how the writers at VTM feel about each uniform combination (though admittedly there were some specific points of disagreement *cough* Lone Star Pride *cough* ombré).
#1 Seed: Black Throwbacks - A classic look that most people really liked. I'm also very partial to the old school Double T.
#2 Seed: Black/Red/Black - Everyone loved these too, especially as they were rolled out after the team hadn't worn red in years.
#3 Seed: Black/Black/Black - This is the sharp, standard look worn at most home games.
#4 Seed: Black/Red/Red - More flashy, this pleases a lot of fans who are more tired of the all black and want to see more red.
#5 Seed: White Throwbacks - Not only were these worn in two huge road wins last year (at Arkansas, at Texas), but they look sweet as well.
#6 Seed: Grey/Grey/Grey - These were a little more hit or miss with the fans, but I really liked the all grey look.
#7 Seed: Black/White/Red - This is a sharp road look that hasn't been worn since the Leach era I believe.
#8 Seed: Black/White/Black - Classic road look that has transcended different generations of Texas Tech football.
#9 Seed: Grey/White/Grey - Again, the grey is hit or miss, but I think this is a pretty good twist on our road uniforms (though they might be bad luck since we're 0-3 in these with losses to OU in 2013, TCU in 2014, and West Virginia in 2015).
#10 Seed: White/White/White - The white helmets on the road are fairly new to Texas Tech football. Personally, not a fan, but some like the storm trooper uniforms. To me it just doesn't look like Texas Tech without a little red and/or black.
#11 Seed: Black Lone Star Pride - Another hit or miss combo, but many fans were glad not to see them again in 2015. I thought the helmets were a little much, but the rest of the uniform was pretty sweet.
#12 Seed: Black/Black/White - For some probably irrational reason, I hate wearing white pants at home. Not a fan of these.
#13 Seed: 2013 Holiday Bowl, Black/Grey/Black - I would have liked these better if the colors were switched and it was grey helmets, black tops, and grey pants.
#14 Seed: White Lone Star Pride - I never met someone who liked these, but at least they're unique(?).
#15 Seed: White ombré - I kind of liked the helmets on these. The rest was awful.
#16 Seed: Black ombré - My eyes are burning. The literal worst uniforms I've ever seen.
We are really looking forward to settling this debate once and for all (until the next batch of new uniforms is rolled out). Starting tomorrow with the #1 seed vs. #16 seed, we will roll out one matchup per day, y'all will vote in the poll at the bottom of the article, and eventually we will crown a winner.
Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas has accused Jews living in Judea and Samaria of training wild boars to uproot Arabs' trees. The fantastic claim is included in a quote from Abbas that appears in an official presentation on PA incitement presented Sunday to the Israeli cabinet.
Abbas made the claim in a speech in Ramallah on the eve of his appearance at the United Nations in September, in which he asked for recognition of PA statehood. The speech went virtually unnoticed in the media, except for some vigilant blogs.
"The occupation and its actions, this is the nightmare that weighs down upon us," Abbas said. "…Attacks by settlers that find their expression in uprooting trees, burning mosques and even training dogs to attack us and sending wild boars to spread corruption on the face of the earth."
Abbas continued: "The settlers deal with us in three ways: when they run across someone they attack him; they have trained the dogs well for this, and the boars, too, for uprooting trees."
Just one week after Abbas gave his speech, a terror gang murdered Asher and Yonatan Palmer of Kiryat Arba.
The Minister for Strategic Affairs, Moshe Yaalon, and Ministry Director Yossi Kupferwasser, presented the quotes as part of a report on the "Incitement Index," which shows an upsurge in PA incitement against Israel in recent months.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called the Index "an important eye-opener and reminder regarding where we live."
"We have seen horrific things here," he said, "that define the Jews as poisoners of wells, among other things, and prepare the hearts for harsh and cruel deeds."
The Elder of Zion blog has found that the wild boar libel originated with reports that appeared on PA news sites. A 2010 report on the Palestine Press Agency claimed:
"Pigs from settlers from the settlement of 'Ariel' continued their attacks on the rights of farms and houses in Salfit and surrounding villages. Witnesses said that a swine herd consisting of twenty pigs attacked the farming communities, breaking down peach and apricot trees... Witnesses said the pigs made scary sounds and also attacked a field of wheat belonging to farmers Imran Ahmed Khalil Masri and Abu Dar.... The farmers expressed their indignation at the repeated attacks of pigs and have shown that attempts to eliminate them and get rid of them have failed dismally."
Elder of Zion noted wryly that "the evil Jews did not only train the pigs to distinguish between Arab and Jewish farmlands, but they also train them to make scary noises!"
Past Muslim "Zionist animal" theories have included stories about Mossad trained bee-eaters, vultures and sharks, as well as poison-resistant rats purportedly trained to drive Arab residents of Jerusalem out of their homes.
There is a hell of a lot of zombie movies coming in the next year or two — so many that it almost seems ridiculous to get excited over one more. But when that one is an adaptation of a well-liked novel and has Brad Pitt set to star, it's a different story. The film adaptation of Max Brooks‘ novel World War Z was recently said to be nearly dead, but now may have financing set, and is gearing up to shoot as soon as June.
Let's skip right over the obvious joke about a zombie movie coming back to life and get to the details. Skydance Productions, that being the company headed by David Ellison, who was a key financier for Paramount films True Grit and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, is the possible savior. The company's involvement has been possible over recent weeks, and Deadline reports Mr. Ellison and “as many as two other financiers” are seriously in talks to finance the film, which is quickly gearing up to shoot. (Paramount holds a short and expensive option on the film — the company's second option on it — so likely wants to move on it fast, especially if Brad Pitt is still willing to sign.)
Marc Forster is still set to direct. Will this still be a PG-13 affair, which was recently reported as a key factor? Right now we don't know, but it still seems likely.
(But if Sucker Punch can be PG-13 and still be rife with creepy overtones of sexual threat, coercion and rape, then this movie might work as a PG-13, too.)
David and his sister Meghan Ellison are becoming two of the most important financiers in the business. He's working closely with Paramount andin addition to the films mentioned above is also set to pay for a big chunk of the Top Gun sequel, should it happen. Meanwhile, her Annapurna Productions is more on the arthouse side of things, with financing being devoted to films like Inherent Vice, The Master and The Wettest County in the World.
WWDC 2016 wrap: A complete list of developer takeaways
The 2016 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) wrapped up last week. Several of the announcements that were made and behind-the-scenes changes that were discovered last week will have a serious impact on the future of Apple's platforms and the third-party developers who build applications for them. For those of you who didn't follow the news coming out of WWDC as closely as we did, here's a look at some of the important news, developments, and reactions.
A Developer's Guide to the OWASP Top 10 GET REPORT
Apple opens iOS services to developers
Included in the introductions for the new versions of iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS (formerly OS X) were announcements at WWDC about many services that Apple is making available through either APIs or extensions. That includes the following for iOS 10:
SiriKit enables iOS 10 apps to work with Siri.
Developers have access to iMessage, a Messages framework that lets apps provide access to Messages. That could mean apps that let you make payments, share content, or modify content all through iMessage (adding stickers seems to be the main example at the moment).
New types of access to Apple Maps are now available to developers.
Proactive suggestions help iOS suggest your app at appropriate times.
The introduction of the User Notifications framework lets developers schedule notifications based on context such as time or location. You can also "customize the appearance of local and remote notifications when they appear on the user's device."
Apps can recognize speech and transcribe it into text with the APIs in the Speech framework.
Enhancements to app search include in-app searching, the ability to continue a search, and crowdsourced deep-link popularity with user privacy.
Apple Pay now allows payments from websites and through Siri and Maps.
Also keep in mind that Apple will require HTTPS connections for iOS apps by the end of this year. But as the industry in general is moving toward HTTP/2 and encrypted connections, this was going to happen anyway.
[ Conference: ADM Summit 2019: Optimize Your Deployment Pipeline ]
Winding Apple Watch forward
Right now Apple Watch is tied to the iPhone for the bulk of app capabilities. The two major improvements that will affect developers are a better UI layout and markedly faster speed. Both of these improvements might lead to more people finding the device useful as well.
Developers now have access to a number of frameworks that were previously only available on other Apple platforms. They include CloudKit for remote storage, SceneKit with its fast rendering engine, the SpriteKit graphics rendering engine, and animation infrastructure such as GameKit and AVFoundation. However, even with improvements over time, battery life is still an issue.
Non-mobile platforms
If you're developing for the Mac or Apple TV, there were some important developments. For example, macOS Sierra lets people use Apple Pay on websites by allowing authentication through the iPhone's fingerprint reader or with a pass code.
Picture-in-picture floats a little PIP video window so people can perform tasks and watch something at the same time. (Although this doesn't sound like the best productivity feature in the world.)
Finally for macOS, a new API lets third-party apps integrate with Contacts and you can sell and distribute Safari extensions through the Mac App Store.
For tvOS 10, users can switch between dark and light interface styles; using the UIKit lets apps automatically adapt their behavior. The Video Subscriber Account framework helps apps authenticate content with a cable or satellite TV provider. And tvOS now has HomeKit, Photos, ReplayKit, UserNotifications, and more.
Changes across multiple platforms
Apple introduced a number of features that reach beyond one platform. For example, there is a collection of neural network inference functions that work across all of Apple's device operating systems. They won't do the training, but once you have data derived from training, they can do the inference.
Another big change is the new file system for both iOS and macOS. They're moving from HFS+ to their new homegrown system, APFS. This is still in the early stages of development and won't be introduced until at least some time next year. For many developers, the underlying specifics of file systems may not matter so much. But if you're working at a low level, now is the time to start understanding how it will operate.
New versions of Swift and Xcode: Coming soon
Swift has seen significant changes in the upcoming Version 3.0. Memory management is easier, the framework stack—which is built on Foundation and Cocoa—has been updated, and you can mix and match Swift code with Objective C and have access to Cocoa frameworks. Development snapshots, which are not official releases, are available for Xcode and Ubuntu 15.10 and 14.04.
Xcode has also received some significant improvements, including smaller installation size, faster performance, and less memory usage. You can get a preview of Xcode 8 with Swift 3 with your Apple developer ID.
Apple development: Cross-platform apps a key concern
The big question is what all of these changes mean for the continued viability of the Apple ecosystem. The best explanation was one from Wendell Adams of AB Mobile Apps. Apple is making the jobs of developers easier by putting more tools into their hands, and that has implications for the company and future strategies. "Apple, after building this, can create any product in the world and have content for it" because existing apps will be able to move to new platforms easily, Adams said. "It could be a scooter with a screen on it. It'll have more capabilities [and content]. Apple can on day one launch a platform with ten times more content than on the original iPhone."
But there's always a price to pay. Developers may find themselves more locked into the Apple way of doing things. That approach could create more complications for developers who want or need to work cross-platform. The more they rely on pre-existing capabilities—and the more that Apple insists developers use its approaches only—the more difficult it may be to support multiple platforms.
What are your thoughts on the changes announced at WWDC? Are you underwhelmed — or excited?

Image copyright Other Image caption Calling BT's talking clock now costs more but it said it still had low-income options
BT has warned millions of customers it is increasing its prices by up to 6.5% from December this year.
It will increase the line rental for direct debit customers by 6.25% to £16.99, and the rate for calling UK landlines by 6.44%.
The set-up fee for landline calls, residential calls, to the speaking clock and call return charges will also increase for some or all customers.
But BT said it had added "extra money-saving options" for poorer customers.
'Taken care'
The majority of its customers were on inclusive call packages and would not pay set-up fees or pence per minute charges on calls, said BT.
BT's option for low-income customers, BT Basic, will stay the same at £5.10 a month with a call allowance.
John Petter, chief executive at BT Consumer, said: "We have taken care to make sure that low-income customers avoid price increases."
He added: "We have added extra money-saving options for low-income customers and for customers who only want a phone line for calls."
Broadband prices are going up by as much as 6.49%, although BT said its current "high profile" press and TV broadband offers would stay at the same price.
It added that call bills had fallen 14% in the past five years.
Sky, BT's rival, is set to increase some of its tariffs from September.
Andrew reviews the sequel to Olympus Has Fallen .
I hope they still have a couple slices
left when we get there. The sequel to Antoine Fuqua's 2013 Die Hard inspired action thriller Olympus Has Fallen is everything you expected it to be: more of the same. Something of a xenophobic, Cannon Films inspired response to ISIS, this is the kind of action thriller which Toby Keith would be proud of. That's not to say it isn't entertaining trash but there were times when the crassness of the thing would make the likes of Michael Bay blush. Picking up where the first film left off, our John Rambo, excuse me, our John McClane, sorry, our Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) finds himself working to, once again, rescue President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from terrorists. Instead of being barricaded inside the White House, this time around our heroes find themselves in a terrorist attack crippled London running for their lives, relentlessly pursued by extremists. The one-man army film is checked your brain at the door popcorn fun and if you think too hard you'll hurt yourself. Just sit back and enjoy the CGI laden mayhem, bullet dodging, one liner and Gerard Butler doing all he can to not burst into the line 'This is Sparta!'.
Protect the President! Share this review.
Part video-game movie, partial Hollywood movie vengeance for the recent Paris attacks by ISIS, London Has Fallen panders to every familiar action cliche depicting a one-man army against stereotypical middle eastern terrorists. The setup is for Gerard Butler to get to work and kick ass in between explosions. About the only real surprise is the killing off of one of the previous film's supporting characters. The rest of it is pretty formulaic action movie trash. Reportedly Antoine Fuqua was tapped to direct London Has Fallen but was tied up making The Equalizer and one wonders whether or not the studio should have simply waited a little longer. If Fuqua has demonstrated anything with the modestly sized action thriller, it's that like his contemporary Walter Hill you can give a B movie more solidarity than it deserves with a little finesse. With newcomer Babak Najafi behind it however, all caution is thrown to the wind in this frankly mercenary, CGI heavy exercise. The audience in attendance seemed to be eating it up despite the obvious formulaic predictability of the whole thing. To the film's credit, Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart and veteran actor Morgan Freeman are clearly having fun and don't take the endeavor all that seriously, cracking one liner right and left with more than a few chuckles thrown in between slayings. The film is a joke but at least the actors seem to be in on it.
Wait! What? I'm God. And the President!
There's not a whole lot to say about this one. If you've seen the trailer, you know what you're in for. Fans of the throwaway action flick will no doubt get some entertainment value out of it and I'll admit I was laughing through most of it. Is it a tad insensitive in terms of timing due to the recency of the Paris attack? Maybe. But if people can't vicariously vent out their frustrations about terrorism fears through an old fashioned B movie with a superhuman single handedly devouring the bad guys right and left, then what good are things like Commando, True Lies, Rambo: First Blood Part II, and of course Die Hard? Crass, politically incorrect and even corny at times, London Has Fallen is implausible and ridiculous but can tickle your fancy if you plant your tongue firmly in cheek while watching. If Gerard Butler has proven anything by continually taking on these silly headed action flicks time and time again, with the help of The Expendables movies, he's reminded modern moviegoers that the spirit of Cannon Films is indeed alive and well.

Reporters Without Borders' annual rankings find US's relative improvement “hides overall negative trends”
The U.S. ranks 41st out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders/Reporters Sans Frontières' (RSF) 2016 press freedom index, largely due to the government's “war on whistleblowers,” mass surveillance, and the lack of a shield law for journalists that guarantees their right not to reveal sources or other confidential information.
(Related Reading – Fearless Ink: The Unofficial Crusade of Nearly 70 Murdered Journalists in 2015)
That's despite the fact that the U.S. actually moved higher in the rankings this year, advancing from its previous position at 49th in 2015. Its “relative improvement by comparison hides overall negative trends,” the organization stated in a press release accompanying the report.
Much of the criticism regards President Barack Obama's administration, as well as the crackdown on civil rights coverage during the Black Lives Matter protests that took place over the past two years.
The group writes:
The main cause for concern for RSF continues to be the current administration's obsessive control of information, which manifests itself through the war on whistleblowers and journalists' sources, as well as the lack of government transparency, which reporters have continually criticized. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined. Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA operative, was convicted solely on the basis of metadata in January 2015 of disclosing classified information to James Risen and is now serving a 3.5 year prison sentence. [….] RSF is also still troubled by the arrest of journalists during #Blacklivesmatter protests in Baltimore Minneapolis
RSF's annual report measures the level of press freedom worldwide using the following indicators: pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, infrastructure, and abuses and acts of violence against journalists.

Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.
Hyundai's first plug-in vehicle is not a pet project or a limited-run experiment; it's a fully fleshed out evolution of the traditional hybrid Sonata that offers an eye-popping 600 miles of range.
And while the Sonata Plug-in Hybrid is still based on Hyundai's tried-and-true mid-sized sedan and not built from the ground up like the Volt and Prius, the Korean automaker still manages to make its green vehicle stand out.
Getting the basics out of the way, the Sonata Plug-in Hybrid looks nearly identical to its non-plug-in counterpart. There are a few updated badges, slightly revised bumpers and lights, chrome side sills and, of course, a charge port on the driver's side front fender. There's also a unique alloy wheel design, and plug-in Hybrids are available in four exclusive colors: Pewter Gray Metallic, Diamond White Pearl, Eclipse Black and Seaport Mist.
The interior also gets Plug-in specific updates, including a new gauge cluster that helps drivers indicate the battery's state of charge. There's a blue pearl leather interior option that features contrasting stitching, too.
Drive Modes
The biggest and most important change to the car's interior is a button that changes how the Plug-in prioritizes how it saves fuel. A hybrid mode uses the gas and battery mode together, while an EV mode puts priority on utilizing the electric motor to its fullest and depleting the big battery before firing up the internal combustion engine. A third mode uses the internal combustion engine like a generator to charge the battery and can be activated by holding the HEV button. In addition to the different drivetrain modes, there's a drive mode selector that modifies the steering and responsiveness of the car.
Unlike the normal Sonata Hybrid, there is no Sport mode, which is fine because the Plug-in feels more powerful than the normal Hybrid model. Total combined horsepower of the Plug-in is rated at 202 ponies, up nine from the Hybrid model, but the electric components of the Plug-in are more advanced. The slim lithium polymer battery pack of the Plug-in is now five times larger than its hybrid counterpart and the electric engine is 32 percent more powerful, too. Unlike other fuel-friendly cars, the Plug-in feels lively when pressed.
Paired to these electric components is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 154 hp. Unlike other hybrids that use a CVT or direct-drive transmission, the Hyundai uses a six-speed that is smooth, though eager to jump into the highest gear possible.
The car drives smoothly and quietly, and the EV mode is very responsive, which is impressive when you realize that the car weighs 3,800 pounds. Although weight is the enemy of efficiency, the Sonata Plug-in can still achieve 40 mpg when driven in its hybrid mode. Drive it as a plug-in, and it earns 99 mpg-equivalent (MPGe). All-electric range is 27 miles with total range (gas and electric) rated at 600 miles, which is huge. Driving dynamics are typical of the mid-size segment, which is to say it drives easily and sedately. It's not razor sharp like the Mazda6 and skews closer to the Toyota Camry in terms of handling and comfort.
Like our experience in the Sonata Hybrid, the Plug-in is very refined, smooth and quiet. The transition from gas-electric hybrid mobility from pure EV is hardly noticeable and the regenerative brakes aren't overly grabby. The bigger battery and more powerful electric components also mean that the car stays in EV modes longer and at higher speeds.
A few questions arise when it comes to the usability of the plug-in hybrid. I never needed a Level 2 charger installed in my home and the battery was fully charged when plugged in overnight. The next morning, the car could complete my commute to the AutoGuide.com office on pure EV mode without needing to fire up the internal combustion engine. On the way home, though, the battery gets depleted and the Sonata is running in hybrid gas-electric operation. While stuck in traffic, I set the car to charge mode, so that the second half of my commute home can be completed in EV mode. It worked out in my favor, helping me earn about 60 mpg during my week of driving.
ALSO SEE: 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid vs 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid
Instead of a tachometer, the Plug-in Hybrid has a driving coach that indicates if you're not driving in an eco-friendly way. Stay below a certain threshold and the car stays in EV mode and the range depletes in a reasonable manner. Go above that and your range will disappear quickly. The system is very helpful in making you a greener driver.
Features
A few extra driver assistance systems are standard on the Plug-in model, including blind-spot monitoring and a lane-change assistance system that can determine if a car is accelerating into the lane you're signalling to move into. Additionally, there's a lane departure warning system that lets you know if you're drifting out of your lane unintentionally, and rear-cross traffic alert, which ensures you won't back out of a parking spot if there are cars coming.
Other handy features include a ventilated driver's seat to keep you cool and a heated steering wheel for those colder days. Adaptive cruise control with the capability to bring the car to a complete stop is also available. The Sonata Plug-in also has a hands-free trunk opening feature that triggers the opening of the trunk by detecting the key fob as you walk to the rear of the vehicle. Unfortunately, the full capability of the trunk is limited by the extra electric gear, so cargo capacity is rated at just 9.9 cubic feet.
Charging the electric battery takes under three hours with a Level 2 charger or nine hours with a standard Level 1 charger.
The Verdict: 2016 Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid Review
The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Plug-in has a killer feature, and that's the 600-mile total range. That alone sets it apart from other hybrids and green cars. Not just a toy or proof of concept, the Sonata Plug-in Hybrid is fully featured. The car is still limited to some markets, although they are ones that offer hefty rebates. Residents of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont can get at least $4,500 in federal and state rebates, which help the car earn its keep.

Gillard unveils major frontbench shake-up
Updated
Prime Minister Julia Gillard has announced her new-look Cabinet after earlier confirming that former prime minister Kevin Rudd would be given the Foreign Affairs portfolio.
Former foreign affairs minister Stephen Smith has moved aside to allow Ms Gillard to fulfil her promise to Mr Rudd, the man she deposed as prime minister and Labor leader.
Ms Gillard confirmed that Wayne Swan will remain Treasurer, former climate change minister Penny Wong will take over from Lindsay Tanner as Finance Minister and Greg Combet has been promoted to Climate Change Minister.
There are four new ministers, with Bill Shorten given the role of Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Superannuation and Financial Services. Mark Butler will focus on Ageing and Mental Health, Gary Gray is the new Special Minister of State and Jason Clare will focus on Defence Procurement.
Mr Rudd says it is a great honour to be Foreign Minister and says he can work with Ms Gillard even though she replaced him as Prime Minister.
"There are national interests in this country which extend far beyond the personal interests of any individual; that applies to me as well," he said.
But Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop says Ms Gillard should not have appointed Mr Rudd to Foreign Affairs.
"The leader that was sacked by his own party because he led the Government off course and caused the Government to lose its way, is now expected to navigate Australia through our foreign policies," she said.
"The leader who was sacked by his own party because he couldn't get along with people is now Australia's number one diplomat."
Mr Smith will replace John Faulkner as Defence Minister, with responsibility for Australia's involvement in the war in Afghanistan.
Of his new role, Mr Smith earlier said he was committed to holding discussions on Australia's role in Afghanistan.
"One thing I am looking forward to, so far as Afghanistan is concerned, is a parliamentary debate on Afghanistan that of course has come out of discussions with the independents and Mr Wilkie and the Greens," he said.
"My colleague, Defence Minister Faulkner, very strongly supports that notion and I think that is important."
Former environment minister Peter Garrett will now take on the Schools, Early Childhood and Youth portfolio.
"Making sure that we focus on education is vital, giving every child a chance of a great school education," Ms Gillard said.

Changes to the nation's immigration policies are likely after the most recent elections.
Some faculty members, staff and students at universities, including Texas A&M, are pushing for more provisions to protect undocumented immigrants.
There's now a growing effort to designate the A&M campus a sanctuary.
"America without immigrants is not America. We need the undocumented community and we need a path to citizenship and we need sanctuary cities right now," said Jose Monsivais, who is a Texas A&M Student and the vice president of the Council for Minority Student Affairs.
An online effort is gaining signatures asking to make A&M a sanctuary campus. Among the requests to school leaders: asking them to not comply with deportations or raids, and refusing to release the immigration statuses of students and staff.
"It is super concerning. Students are worried about their families. They are worried about their parents, and they're worried about themselves," said Monsivais.
Sonia Hernandez and Felipe Hinojosa are associate professors of history at the university and helped start the effort.
“I really was very impressed with this idea of the Aggie family and the Aggie Spirit, and I think if we're going to treat all students the same way and make them feel like they are part of the Aggie family, this is the necessary step that we needed to take. And it's really about ensuring a a safe campus, helping our students feel safe. An academic space should not be a space where there's fear and that is really sort of at the heart of this petition," said Hernandez.
“Over 500,000 people were repatriated in the 1930s. Among those 500,000, 60 percent were U.S. citizens, and so this fear of mass deportation or putting these policies in place, part of it is protecting the students that we have. Another part of it is that if you are a Latino in this country, if you are Mexican-American, there is a possibility that that legislation could impact your life even if you are a U.S. citizen. We've seen it historically, and there's no reason to believe that that wouldn't be the case today," said Hinojosa.
Petitions for more protections have been happening not only at Texas A&M, but other universities including Yale, Brown and Stanford. Work is also happening to make the City of Austin a sanctuary city.
Jonathan Trudelle is a construction science student and sees the benefits of an immigrant workforce. While he doesn't want a wall, he also doesn't support a sanctuary.
"I think it adds to the problem. We don't have an immigration plan at all, really," he said.
We also heard from college Republican leadership on campus. They tell us they are supportive of the GOP's stance on immigration, and believe sanctuary cities promote illegal immigration and violate the law.
So far, close to 1,000 people have signed the petition. Organizers plan to present it to Texas A&M President Michael K. Young and Provost Karan Watson later this month.
We've called university administration for information regarding the number of undocumented students on campus, but are still waiting for a reply.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's defense technology agency plans to set up a joint center with China to produce and maintain military equipment in the latest sign of the strengthening security relationship since a 2014 coup.

The plans to establish the facility - and discussions on a Chinese naval center to serve submarines Thailand ordered this year - point to a growing Chinese security presence in the oldest U.S. ally in the region as elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
The Thai government's Defence Technology Institute (DTI) will set up Thailand's first commercial joint defense facility with China in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen in July, a defense ministry spokesman said.
It will be responsible for assembly, production and maintenance of Chinese land weapon systems for the Thai army.
“All our production will be for domestic official usage,” defense ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantravanich told Reuters, adding that it could become an assembly and maintenance center for all states in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Specific details, he said, were subject to further discussions between the ministry and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) - which makes tanks and weapons among other heavy equipment.
NORINCO did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment. Its website describes it as “a pioneer and leader of Chinese military trade, and an important team to implement China's Going Global strategy”.
Kongcheep said the Chinese would provide training and technology transfer, but details of any Chinese personnel in Khon Kaen were among things being discussed.
The Chinese Defense Ministry did not respond when contacted by Reuters for comment.
BIG PURCHASES
China has become an increasingly important source of weapons for Thailand, particularly since the United States and Western countries downgraded ties after the army seized power in 2014.
Major purchases since 2015 include orders for 49 Chinese tanks and 34 armored vehicles worth over $320 million - much more than the army has bought from other countries, although it also ordered helicopters from both Russia and the United States.
The biggest Chinese purchase is the Royal Thai Navy's order for three submarines at a cost of over $1 billion.
Thai and Chinese armies and air forces have begun joint exercises, complementing Thailand's continuing drills with the U.S. forces. On the civilian front, Thailand and China plan development of a high-speed rail link as part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative.
Relations with the United States are warming again too, however, particularly since new U.S. President Donald Trump hosted junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha at the White House.
The joint weapons manufacturing center in Khon Kaen - apparently similar to one in Pakistan - could complement China's growing military presence in neighboring Cambodia, said Paul Chambers, who has researched Thai military and regional security.

“It opens the door for the potential of growing Chinese military influence in mainland Southeast Asia,” said Chambers, of Naresuan University in the northern Thai province of Phitsanulok.
New legislation taking effect next year will allow Thailand's Defence Technology Institute to operate on a commercial basis, but it will remain entirely under government ownership.
Thailand's Defence Ministry said the government was also holding preliminary discussions with Ukraine, Russia and South Africa about joint defense manufacturing facilities, similar to the deal with China.
life-style, dining, vegan, Bonta Vera, Gardein
It's a beautiful sunny Saturday and we've taken the drive out to Minmi. It's been a while since I've been out this way and viewing it with fresh, older eyes makes the little village seem quaint and peaceful. Nestled in a backstreet is the old courthouse. But these days, rather than busting baddies, it houses goodness. True Goodness that is, otherwise known as Bonta Vera – a vegan cafe open for breakfast and lunch which boasts Newcastle's first 100% plant-based menu. The building is historic, rustic, and charming. It's surrounded by gardens and gum trees and has views across to the Watagans from the back of the building. There's a big wrap-around verandah with lace wrought iron. The room is open and the floors are hardwood. Stained glass windows and ceiling roses surround hungry customers who want to be here, not criminals who would rather not. It's only 12.15pm but already there's people waiting for a table. It's partly because it's growing in popularity through a savvy social media presence (despite only being open for five weeks) and partly because there's not a lot of seating. Well, there is, but there are only tables for four or six people, which leaves all groups of two taking up more room than necessary by hogging a large table if it's the only one left. We are told by a waitress to wait on one of the pews that line two of the walls or to get takeaway. Meanwhile, a table of 12 leaves, freeing up a six-seater for the two of us to sit at. The lunch menu, available from 11am and ordered at the bar, reads fairly straightforward: burgers, pies, schnitzels and so on. Except all the meat and dairy products – the beef patties, the fish burger, the slices of cheese – are actually plant-based. I've always found faux-meat to be a little strange in its purpose. If you're against eating bacon (either ethically or for health reasons), why develop something that looks, smells and tastes like it, just so you can still pretend you're eating bacon? But that's just me – for those who need the masquerade to help transition, or those who just enjoy the idea of chomping into a cheeseburger, then the Bonta Vera offerings will appeal. The cafe uses a product range called Gardein. This company has won awards for their innovation in vegan food and one look at their ingredient list and you can see there's nothing weird going into them. The beef patties that come out on the Triple Threat classic cheeseburger (with cheese, onion and sauce), that arrive pretty quickly despite the rush of the room, are meaty, juicy and look just like mince patties. The chicken schnitzel has the little golden crumbs and the texture and smell of chicken. The cheese slices are yellow and stretchy, they are even melting from the heat off the patties. The taste is almost authentic - I can't actually believe I'm eating plants. It's incredible really and I feel so full afterwards (or was it all those chips that came with them?) that we opt to take a slice of the creamy rose and vanilla cheesecake home with us for later. Other offerings on the menu include salads (chicken caesar, thai beef, roast vegetable) and sandwiches (club, chicken, salad, ham). In fact, more items use the pretend meat than not. It's a bit of a novelty, but I can't help but wonder if there's more to a vegan diet than facon. During our visit, the staff we see are a bit flustered and at times, a little abrupt. It seems at odds with the fact there is no table service and the simplicity of the menu. With time and evaluation, this will no doubt be addressed. Moving the cash register and queue to order food away from the door where the meals come out might prevent a future disaster too. The current menu at Bonta Vera relies heavily on imitation, but the fact is, the place is packed and all these people have come to Minmi just to eat fake burgers in nice surroundings. Vegans must be rejoicing there is now a cafe purely dedicated to eating without any harm being done to animals.

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- Playing in the season opener has been at the forefront of Adrian Peterson's mind almost since he went down with a torn left ACL in the Minnesota Vikings' second-to-last game of the 2011 season.
How long it has taken other running backs to return from the injury doesn't concern Peterson. The running back has always seen himself as different from everyone else, and he has made it abundantly clear that he expects to play against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
He has one more week to make his case to Vikings coach Leslie Frazier and his staff.
Frazier said Monday that the Vikings would not make a decision on Peterson's status until game day, and he cautioned that even if Peterson does return, he shouldn't expect the workload he carried before he was injured just yet.
"We recognize if he's able to get in this first ballgame, it'll be with limited exposure," Frazier said. "We'll talk about it as the week goes on and see how he's doing and if it's even a viable option to let him play."
That means fewer carries than Peterson is used to getting as the workhorse and focal point of the Vikings' offense, and likely more work for backup Toby Gerhart.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle the Vikings have in handling the situation is Peterson's state of mind. He has worked tirelessly to get himself prepared to help his team, throwing himself into the rehab process from the moment he came out of surgery. With the Vikings coming off a 3-13 season, Peterson knows they need him in the backfield to have any chance, and the coaches know it, too.
"You really have to take the emotion out of it," Frazier said. "You have to really hone in on what's best for him, what's best for our team. Adrian is not just another guy on our team. He is in so many ways the face of what we try to do. We have to be able to see the big picture when it comes to him and that's the way we'll approach it."
On a rebuilding team coming off a last-place finish in one of the strongest divisions in the league, the Vikings may not need to rush him back. Peterson said he felt like he was ready to play in the preseason, but the coaches and the team's training staff preferred to take a more gradual approach.
"I'd love to have him out there, that goes without saying for our entire team," center John Sullivan said. "But at the same time, it's out of our hands. I hope he is. But if not, we've got to go forward with the guys that are ready to go."
In a bid to lower air pollution in the city, Istanbul's largest taxi drivers' organization, the Istanbul Taxi Companies' Office (İTEO) launched Tesla electric taxis yesterday.
Yahya Uğur, chairman of İTEO, said the launch of the environmentally friendly Turquoise Taxi service marks the beginning of a new era in the business.
Some 200 electric taxis will be available in the city by January, he said.
Although they will help cut emissions, electric taxis come at a price for potential fares. They will be 15 percent more expensive than their gas-guzzling counterparts.
The electric taxis can travel 300 kilometers on a fully charged battery, with a top speed of 140 kilometers per hour.
Defending the higher fare, Uğur said: "New vehicles are needed for new Turkey," and added that the new vehicles will improve the quality of taxi services in Istanbul.
"This might also help our fight against pirate taxis, Uber and similar services," he said.
Uber, the ride-sharing service, has faced protests from taxi drivers around the world since it began eight years ago.
It also faced the wrath of Turkish taxi operators after it entered Turkey in 2014.
Drivers said that the U.S.-based company disrupted the industry. It is apparently illegal, but continues to operate through legal loopholes.
An increased use of mass transit and taxis in Turkey's most populated city calls for efforts to curb air pollution.
Istanbul's transport authority announced earlier this year that it would purchase 200 electric buses as it strives to keep Istanbul's growing traffic problem less hazardous to health.

On June 14, just after midnight, a fire broke out on the fourth floor in Grenfell Tower, a 24-story public housing project located in West London, which around 600 people called home. The majority of Grenfell residents were sound asleep as the fire jumped from the fourth floor to the top floor in just 15 minutes. One eyewitness told London's Channel 4 local news that Grenfell “just lit up like a matchstick.” Desperate to survive, some residents began to jump out of windows, while others screamed for help. A woman reportedly threw her child out of a window, in an attempt to protect him from the turbulent flames. Although the death toll has not yet been confirmed, it is expected to rise to over 100, with dozens still missing.
Most who perished, or who lost everything in the flames, were working-class people of color. They were Arab, Muslim or African. They were European migrants, Black British, refugees, and asylum seekers, sharing the tower with the poor white working class of London. Meanwhile, multimillion-pound properties with their perfectly manicured front gardens stood under the shadow of the still smoking, charred block. Grenfell Tower is austerity in ruins. The horror of poor people burned alive just feet from some of the country's most expensive mansions, many of them empty moth-balled investments, perfectly captures the devastating effects of capitalism.
There are around 4,000 similar public housing blocks in the UK, most of them built in the 1960s and 70s. They were built basic: concrete frame, concrete columns on the outside. The majority of public housing units are located in areas that have started to gentrify. Kensington, where Grenfell Tower is located, along with Chelsea, have a higher proportion of high earners than anywhere else in the country. More people work in banking there than anywhere else in Britain. These residents, in their luxury apartments, considered the concrete tower an “eyesore.”
Role of gentrification
Grenfell is owned by the local wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and when the wealthy neighbors began to complain about Grenfell, the borough contracted the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Organization, KCTMO, to refurbish the tower in part to increase the number of apartments available for private rent or sale. KCTMO then embarked on an 8.6 million pound renovation project to improve the “aesthetic” of the tower. The project involved wrapping the building in an aluminum cladding so that it would blend better with the luxury towers nearby. That work left the tower with just one staircase and exit — an exit that the management company failed to keep clear.
With gentrification also came an overshadowing of the diverse working-class community in the local council by their elitist neighbors. Grenfell residents did not have much of a voice in their local council. In the last parliament, only 6 percent of the members were people of color. Yet, they were trying desperately to make their voices and concerns for their safety heard. For years, the tenants had been raising concerns about how the KCTMO was cutting corners on safety and refusing to listen to their concerns. These concerns included lack of sprinklers and fire alarms, smoke coming from electrical appliances and outlets, the state of the fire escapes, and the elimination of a car park, which slowed emergency response vehicles from getting to the tower during the fire. However, the tenants were silenced by a system that prevented them from being heard. Those that were the most persistent were threatened with legal action for defamation, which had the effect of discrediting their claims of neglect and mismanagement.
Ignoring the Grenfell residents' concerns, KCTMO chose to “renovate” a building for poor people in the most unsafe way possible to save money. For just 5,000 pounds more, KCTMO could have used fire-resistant cladding on Grenfell Tower.
While the nature of the fire is still unknown, the conditions that made it possible are not. Since Margaret Thatcher introduced right-to-buy in 1980, public housing and its tenants have been undermined and sidelined. Right-to-buy released many previously publicly owned units onto the private market, which allowed long-term public housing tenants to buy their apartments at a discount. Many quickly re-sold at a mark-up soon after. As a result, the most desirable projects ended up in part-private ownership, such as management organizations and tenant management organizations. This was justified by claims that management of public housing would improve, bureaucracy would be done away with, and responsiveness to tenants would increase.
The result: local government has become distanced from housing facilitation, central government funding for social housing has been reduced, and the involvement of powerful private companies has increased. Regulation and “red tape” were called enemies of entrepreneurship. They were characterized as intrusive and undesirable, while the private sector was commended as the epitome of efficiency.
“Red Tape Challenge” = eliminate safety protections
In 2011, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron initiated a “Red Tape Challenge,” which intended to slash and burn much of the UK's safety regulations. The “Cutting Red Tape” legislation was part of the Tory conservative party plan to abolish a ‘health and safety' culture they claimed was hurting money-making businesses. On the UK government website, a statement from Business Secretary Sajid Javid says: “This government is delivering on its commitment to free firms from 10 billion pounds of heavy-handed over-regulation and build a more productive Britain. Hundreds of businesses responded to our Cutting Red Tape reviews and we are taking decisive action based on their experiences.” The UK government is blatantly telling the people of the UK that they are not interested in them, but instead, listening to firms' and businesses' concerns.
The “Cutting Red Tape” move cut more than 2,400 pieces of regulation, including many fire regulations. For example, fire safety inspections had been reduced for some companies from six hours to just 45 minutes. Imagine, only taking 45 minutes to inspect a 24-story, 120 unit housing towers. Just this year, the Conservative Party voted down a bill that would have required to make landlords provide liveable housing, and it is easy to understand why: 39 percent of Tory member's of parliament were landlords, with nearly a quarter of members of parliament across all parties owning rental properties. The Tory government wants to see social housing privatized while poor people continue to be forced to live in unsafe housing and have their very real concerns about safety and quality ignored.
Grenfell Tower is not the first fatal fire fueled by a terrible for-profit system. A 2011 report found that three quarters of Britain's social housing blocks were potentially unsafe in a fire. In 2009, a fire in Lakanal Tower, at that time considered the worst tower fire in London, killed six people and severely injured dozens. The Lakanal fire also could have been prevented by proper fire-safety checks. After the Grenfell tragedy, 75 buildings have been tested for fire safety and they have all failed.
So what is the UK's plan moving forward? Many of the victims, after losing all they had, some even family members, have been sleeping in cars and in parks because they have no where else to go. They are even still being required to pay rent! Meanwhile, the council continues to issue press releases while the leader and the deputy leader of the council go around giving press interviews, ignoring the fact that the relief effort is failing.
What should replace Grenfell?
London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, is in favor of tearing down public housing skyscrapers. However, he does not offer a substitute to replace the towers with the same number of apartments at the same price to the renters.
Some have suggested not building any more public housing towers, and instead building more street level housing. However, housing in London, like in downtown Los Angeles, is in such high demand that there's very little “street level” housing available, so renters either are homeless, forced to rent miles further away, or stick to renting in existing unsafe “tower” housing.
And where is Theresa May during all of this? On June 14, the day of the fire, she said nothing at all until 6:30 that evening. The following day, she ventured out to the scene of the disaster where she congratulated the emergency services on their inexhaustible efforts, but made absolutely no contact with the affected survivors, nor the workers and volunteers who poured in to the area to help in any way they could.
Less than an hour later, Jeremy Corbyn arrived. He listened to people and promised to find out the truth. He told them he would speak for them. And he did. He stood in front of parliament and called the Grenfell tragedy a “disastrous effect of austerity,” and demanded Theresa May provide the resources needed for working-class communities to live in safe homes so that tragedies such as Grenfell will never happen again.
A tragedy of capitalism
Grenfell was a preventable political tragedy. And it is part of a larger problem — the problem of structural inequality in general. A problem in which profits are put before people. And this problem has a name — it is capitalism. If Grenfell tower had not been “prettified,” it might still be standing today and hundreds of people would not have been victims of corporate manslaughter. The Grenfell Tower housing block fire in London is proof that those in power have no problem with neglecting and destroying poor people's lives for the sake of their bank accounts. This fire and the countless crises facing working people in the United States, UK, and beyond are proof that the capitalist system is a total failure at meeting the needs of humanity. Under capitalism, corporations will continue to look for ways to profit instead of playing a productive role in serving the people.
This failed system however is not permanent and we can and will fight for a new world. We saw hundreds protesters, angry at the government's handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster, descend on the offices of Kensington town hall while others blocked the prime minister as she met residents for the first time near the scene of the tragedy days later. We saw demonstrators march through central London chanting: “No justice, no peace.” Corbyn's near victory — defying ruling class commentators and news outlets who predicted his crushing defeat — is a source of hope for the growing socialist movement around the world.
We will continue to fight for housing, for healthcare, for education, for jobs, for the planet. We must organize and stand together to end the inequalities manufactured by capitalist society so that we can build a society based on meeting people's needs, a socialist society. And so, I encourage you to join the Party for Socialism and Liberation in the fight for true liberation, in breaking free from these capitalist chains so that the people may truly prosper.
Trillium Releases a Canned Collaboration Beer with Evil Twin Brewing
The new session IPA is Trillium's first venture into the aluminum market, and there's more on the way.
Devoted foodies and restaurant newbies love The Feed. Sign up now for our twice weekly newsletter.
Today at noon! 3.3% ipa $13/4pack Mosaic, Citra, Amarillo 1 case per person limit 90bbl run Both breweries A photo posted by JC Tetreault (@trilliumbrewing) on Jun 20, 2016 at 6:16am PDT
When Trillium Brewing Company opened its Canton taproom earlier this month, Evil Twin Brewing founder Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergso was there behind the scenes with co-owners JC and Esther Tetreault.
Today, beer fans can taste the spoils of that visit. Trillikini, a collaboration between the two breweries, went on sale at noon today. The release also marks Trillium's first foray into the canned beer market, with help from Iron Heart Canning, a mobile operation.
Trillikini, a play on Evil Twin's Bikini Beer, is a super sessionable, 3.3 percent ABV, “hazy blonde IPA.” It's low in alcohol, but Mosaic, Citra, and other hops give it clean, crisp flavors and a refreshing bitterness, per the tasting notes. The collaboration is available in 4-packs at both Trillium's Fort Point and Canton locations for $13, and it is currently on draft at the Canton taproom. The Tetreaults made about 90 barrels of Trillkini, so it may last later into the week if you can't make today's release.
The collaboration brews don't end with Trillikini. Sierra Nevada's 2016 Beer Camp mixed pack, currently on shelves, features two bottles of Pat-Rye-Ot, which uses the Tetreault's choice of rye from Valley Malt. Evil Twin announced a second joint release coming soon, an imperial coffee stout called “Dusk Trill Dawn.” Trillium also has an IPA called Hundred Thousand Trillion in the works, brewed in partnership with Other Half Brewing in New York. No release date is set yet for either of those brews, but a Trillium representative confirmed Hundred Thousand Trillion would be canned, too. (Update, June 22: Dusk Trill Dawn is available at both Trillium locations at noon today.)
Besides any future collaboration with Trillium, Evil Twin is definitely coming back to Boston in September. The New York brewery is one of 50-plus around the world that have signed on for the first-ever Copenhagen Beer Celebration taking place stateside, on City Hall Plaza September 23-24.
Keep an eye on Trillium's social media and website for more on collaboration and can release details.

WASHINGTON — Democrats have seized on video of Rep. Chris Van Hollen angrily confronting Republicans on the House floor over changes to the chamber's rules as proof Republicans purposefully pushed the nation into a government shutdown and crisis over extending the nation's debt limit.
The Republicans' decision to alter an obscure procedural rule has enraged Democrats and given them evidence that Republicans have purposefully thrown the government into chaos with a shutdown.
Normally, any member of the House can force a vote on legislation which the Senate and House are unable to agree on. Although it is a rarely used mechanism, House Republicans were taking no chances in the days leading up to the shutdown.
Republican leaders were nervous about the possibility that the Senate's clean spending extension bill would pass the chamber on the strength of Democratic votes — or worse, that it would fail, taking it off the table permanently as a solution.
That concern appears to have driven the decision to change the rules to allow only Majority Leader Eric Cantor to force a vote on the Senate plan.
The House routinely alters its rules for considering legislation. The majority's control of the Rules Committee makes it possible for them to limit the number and type of amendments that can be considered, the length of debate, and virtually all the other contours of a floor debate.
But the changes to the rules used to block Democrats from forcing a vote on the Senate's spending plan is not the type of change that is routinely made, and is yet another sign of the Republican leadership's tenuous control of the chamber.
The problem with Islamic feminism is not necessarily the flaw in its premise, but its practical implication as well, that is women‘s rights are pretty much at the discretion of wisdom of Islam. Where Islam supports the rights of women, it might work. Where it does not, what about that? What are we supposed to do in that situation? What if after playing all the mental and lingual gymnastics, we still could not find a single verse which could save us? I am raising all these questions because this has happened before and still continues to happen. Islamic feminists will enthusiastically give speeches about the inherent feministic nature of Islam, and will bring abolishment of burying females in 6century Arabia; they will talk about the status of respect for the mothers and sisters in Islam as if other women do not deserve one, they will talk about the use of polygamy to shelter women without questioning why those women need the shelter of marriage in the very first place, they will talk about the role of Muslim women in wars during the expansion of Islam but won't bring their status as a material possession in the events after hijrat from Makkah to Medina, which is celebrated as a great example of brotherhood and fraternity which was achieved by exchanging food, clothes, utilities and women. They will talk about the non-religious basis of hijab, but emphasize modesty of clothing as if that's an idea not rooted in misogyny and control of a woman's body. And lastly, which happens to be my favorite one, is when they talk about “respect” of women in Islam. The same respect which lead many Muslim men to compare women's bodies to gold or candy. I mean, you are free to compare women with diamonds in the hope that you are showcasing respect for them, but how I see it is that it's a gross example of objectification which fuels the culture of ownership, ‘protection' and honor. And we are talking about pretty basic things here. When it comes to homosexuals, transsexuals and expression of genders, where feminism has played an unprecedented role, Islamic feminism miserably fails, like it fails in addressing concerns about pre-marital sexual relationships, the verse about beating wife on dissent, the Sharia laws which no sensible woman can take seriously and “the second sex” status of women in Quran.
Today I had the pleasure of talking to Selfless Gaming owner and coach Steve “Ryu” Rattacasa. We talked today about the state of the NA CS scene, how CS is evolving itself and we also spoke a bit about Selfless and himself.
Selfless Gaming is based out of North America and has Overwatched, Rocket League, Killer Instinct and Super Smash Bros alongside, CS:GO teams for both Males and Females.
Reece: First of all, let's talk a bit about the American CS scene. The American CS scene has always been a big scene, but now more teams are growing who were formerly unknown to the casual fan with the help of big competitions like ELeague and ESL Pro League: NA. Do you think the NA scene could grow bigger than the EU scene in the future?
Ryu: Yes because that's what the math is going to show—and Americans love competition, love competitive sports/activities, and having things like ELEAGUE showcasing our games on TV will continue to push it into the mainstream (which it's still not a part of).
People say there are issues with the American CS scene, for example, they say players have no passion and are just there for the big salaries. From both a business view and a player's view, do you think there are any major issues with the American CS scene right now, and what do you think could be done to solve these issues?
It's definitely disappointing to see the average work ethic of some of the teams/players that “make it” to the pro level—but I've always said the entire “system” for a player to go through to get recognized was flawed. It rewarded individual stats and overly aggressive styles of play which never emphasized the most important things, like teamwork, communication, etc. That's slowly begun to change, but it's still a few seasons out before we see what kind of impact some of those changes will have.
There have been a lot of organizations who have come and gone and have only survived a short period of time. In your opinion, what makes a successful and sustainable esports organization?
Generating revenue, super passionate fans, and great, long-term partnerships—and it's real, really hard to do. Right now the scene is flooded with big name investor money, and none of those orgs have the real incentive to be profitable or sustainable, and that's extremely risky. That's how bubbles grow…
What do you think is different with the EU scene and the NA scene? Do you think the NA scene could become bigger than the EU scene? Why?
There's almost too much to list, but I'd say overall the NA scene focuses on individual aim, and EU plays good, consistent team-based CS:GO. We certainly have the talent for it, but it'll take time. C9 (Cloud 9) is an example of what a team would need to look like to beat EU teams regularly.
Onto a bit about Selfless now. Recently we saw some roster changes with Michael “Mainline” Jaber being dropped and Vincent “Brehze” Cayonte being added. Was there any big reason behind this change or was it just the right player popping up at the right time?
Mainline lost his love of the game—the fire, the drive, the passion. He was lethargic in practices, he was late frequently, and we just weren't “feeling it” with him anymore. It was obvious we had to move on, and once we started to shift the in-game leadership role away from him, he either had to step it up with his work ethic and grind himself into being a top player, or move on. He decided to move on. I loved playing with him and wish that wasn't the case, but I think a bit of a break for him from the top competitive scene will be really good for him in the long run. He's not hanging up the mouse just yet.
You are the owner of Selfless Gaming, you write the articles for the site, but you also coach the team and do analyst elements for the ESL Pro League North American scrims. Do you prefer the business side of things or the pundit side of things, or even the player side of things as you used to be a player? Why?
I love all of it. Being an owner allows me the opportunity to move my focus around to different elements any given day of the week. So in addition to the coaching stuff, the analyst work, and the “general CS:GO” activities, I also get to work on marketing, social media, recruiting talent (for CS:GO and other games), finding and securing partnerships, and so on. My previous career in technology was very successful but got very, very boring for me quickly. This variety is really the spice of my life right now, and I love it all.
Valve have made a few big changes to CS:GO recently. For example, the coaching ban. As a coach yourself, what do you think about the coaching ban?
Classic Valve—not listening to what the players want, and operating as an obstacle to the growth and progression of the game instead of a catalyst for it. It's ridiculous and will result in lower quality CS:GO.
They've made some other pretty big changes recently like the gambling ban and of course, new gun sounds. People are even saying CS:GO is dying. What do you think about the gambling ban? Do you think CS:GO is heading up or down? Is it “dying” like people say?
I don't care about the gambling ban—and I think it's only a short-term thing anyways. Esports betting will be MASSIVE—way bigger than people think or realize right now—but it'll take the time to follow the appropriate legal avenues. I don't think the game is dying anytime soon, despite the 12-year-olds who lost skins and issued death threats via anonymous social media accounts not being able to wager skins anymore.
Dota 2 has “The Invitational,” an annual tournament with a massive prize pool which determines the best team in the world. With Counter Strike, we usually have 3 major tournaments per year. Which format do you think is better, the one big tournament style or the 3 tournament style?
I love what Valve has done with the International, but I prefer at least 2 MAJOR events per year, so I'm not a huge fan of the single gigantic event per year.
Now a bit about yourself. You transitioned from being an IGL to a coach due to a busy work schedule. How hard was it to stop playing and start coaching? Do you think you might follow the steps of Immortal's Zews and return to being a player at some point in the future?
It wasn't too hard—I was able to do the things I was truly good at, I was able to bring in young talent and help players develop and play the right way. The only hard part about it was WATCHING instead of playing, and knowing that my impact on the game was less “direct”. As much as I think my value could be at an all-time high as a player right now (due to the ridiculous coaching rule change), I have no plans to return to playing. I truly believe that if I did, with my work ethic, I could be back in form quickly, though.
Finally, what can you say to help people who are trying to break through to the professional scene?
Recognize what you are naturally good at (because yes, TALENT EXISTS), and go all in on that. Hard work should be a part of your equation for success regardless of what you do in life, so figure out the strengths you have, work really hard, and always be a great teammate. And as a relevant side note, I'd encourage all younger players that want to go pro in one way or another to focus on building their individual following/brand. That'll be more and more important as Esports grows.
Thank you very much for your time, Steve. Any last things to say? Any shoutouts?
Thank you to every single fan of any/all of our teams, all of our supporters, all the haters who keep fanning the flames, and a huge shutout to ClutchChairz for making the best gaming chairs we've ever been fortunate to game in. As I write this, Kaboose is lounging hardcore in his chair and loving it.
LUCKNOW -- The Editor-in-Chief and Chief Managing Director of a news channel has been arrested for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups in Sambhal, a senior police official said on Thursday.
Suresh Chavhanke was arrested yesterday night by Sambhal police with the help of local police from the Chowdhury Charan Singh Airport, when he was about to leave the city, the official said.
An FIR was lodged against Chavhanke, head of Sudarshan TV news channel under various sections of the IPC including those dealing with promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth and over content to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public and other sections on April 10 in Sambhal.
Provisions related to deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion and Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2000, have also been invoked against him.
It was alleged that the channel had telecast a programme in which its Editor-in-Chief and CMD Suresh Chavhanke dished out objectionable content because of which tension prevailed in the city.
The FIR was registered by the SHO when the matter was raised during a meeting of the Peace Committee in Sambhal on April 9, in which prominent citizens pointed out the programme telecast between April 6 to April 8.
When contacted for its response, the channel had said that it condemned any attempt to suppress and intimidate the media.
"We condemn any act to suppress and they intimidate the media. To protest this I will reach Sambhal on April 13," a statement issued by Chavhanke said.
The Government had assured Rajya Sabha yesterday that it would take action against a TV channel in Uttar Pradesh.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had said, "We cannot allow anyone to disturb peace and communal harmony."
"Media's independence is one thing but it cannot be so free that it spreads communal disharmony in various parts of the country. We have taken note of it and will take action," Naqvi had said.

On October 19th, 2015, Canadians voted for change by choosing more of the same.
Yes, Justin Trudeau is Prime Minister of Canada. In spite of the youthful, hungry-for-change image crafted by campaign staff, Justin Trudeau becomes the 13th Liberal leader in Canadian history to form a mandate in the House of Commons and the first-ever son of a Prime Minister to take over the mantle. In those respects, Canada really did vote for change by choosing more of the same. A slightly different more of the same, but more of the same in a broad, historical sense. O Canada, you are so adorable. Too cautious and polite to choose real change, i.e. the first-ever NDP government. Not that anyone's blaming you, Canada, because Tom Mulcair and the NDP really botched their approach.
Whether you like the concept of change through more of the same or not, here are some things you need to know about the new Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau.
1. Tax changes
Hikes for the highest earners, cuts for middle-income Canadians within the first 100 days is what Trudeau has promised. He also promised to reverse the Conservative government's doubling of tax-free savings account limits and the income splitting they introduced for families with young children.
Reserving judgement on this promise until I get to see every single rich person's tax return.
2. Inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women
Trudeau pledged to build a “renewed relationship” with Canada's indigenous peoples as well as open an inquiry into the 1,000s of missing and murdered First Nations women. Unfortunately, there is no information on how Trudeau plans to build said “renewed relationship.” Fingers crossed that he's not hoping that opening an inquiry is more than enough to repair the relationship.
I would like to think that the Haida tattoo on his shoulder binds him to this promise but if history has taught us anything, this will be the first promise to be jettisoned.
3. Revamped child benefits
Families with young kids and household incomes below $200,000 will get more tax-free money under Justin Trudeau's Canada Child Benefit set to replace all existing federal child benefit programs. Any families earning more than $200,000 will get nothing.
Let's hope that the plan gets amended to give families earning more than $200,000 some contraception.
4. C-51
Justin Trudeau promised to “amend” C-51, however the details of how he plans to amend the controversial privacy-ending security bill are not currently known. Our advice: learn to love C-51 because it is here to stay.
5. Infrastructure infusion
If you have been on a bridge or highway in Canada recently and noticed that the sh*t is one wet winter away from being completely turned to rubble. Trudeau's promised to invest big money in infrastructure but how will he divide that money up among the many provincial and local governments trying to get that money?
While that remains to be seen, the infrastructure investment was touted as a job creator and economy stimulator. Will it be? I can guarantee that in Montreal, Trudeau's infrastructure plan will create a ton of no-show jobs because that's how we do things.
6. Pot
LEGALIZING IT!
At least, he said he would. Given the amount of tax revenue legal weed has generated in Colorado, it seems crazy not to give ending pot prohibition a try. Especially when one consider's that Canada's weed is world-renown. Wine and cheese ain't illegal in France, is it? It's time to embrace the fact that we are a nation with great weed and profit off it. The fine print of how legal Canadian weed will be regulated and taxed is still unknown but you can get an image of what legalizing marijuana will look like for Canada here.
7. Long-form census
Long-form census is coming back! So if you love stats…
8. Electoral reform
Justin Trudeau promised this would be Canada's last plurality-based election. His government, he said during the campaign, will consult Canadians on a new electoral system with an aim to adopt proportional representation.
Then again, given the election's results, Trudeau is probably going to take a “If it ain't broke, don't fix it”-approach to electoral reform now.
9. Climate change
Trudeau has pledged to attend the upcoming climate change conference in Paris. The awkward thing about this, of course, is that while Trudeau's pledged to set ambitious emission-reduction targets for Canada, he hasn't yet said what those will be and probably won't know by the time he flies to France. He has promised to hammer out some kind of climate change policy within 90 days of the summit, however.
In other words, Justin Trudeau's climate change plan is to cram?
10. Pipeline projects
Trudeau and Mulcair both promised to revamp Canada's energy project approval process. How would he revamp it? We still don't know. But he'll have to decide soon, and determine how that applies to projects already in the regulatory pipeline.
11. Right to die
Physician-assisted death gets deleted from Canada's Criminal Code on Feb. 7. Trudeau's promised to consult with Canadians on how to approach this issue, but he'll have to work with the provinces to figure out how they approach the deadline without creating a legally murky patchwork of regulations across the country.
12. ISIS and terrorism
Trudeau has said he'd end Canada's combat mission fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and stick to training Iraqi troops instead. But that may not be such a good idea ever since Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has come under fire for human rights abuses.
You know what? I'm starting to notice a common theme with all these promises: THERE ARE A LOT OF F*CKING UNKNOWNS.
Did we just get sweet-talked and knocked up by a dude that's all smile and no substance? Are you telling me that last night we had a one night's stand with Justin Trudeau and now we are having a baby and going to have try and make it work for the next four years?
It could have been worse though. This could have never happened:
Will Taiwan's proposed serving of U.S. beef give it a seat at the table in the next round of trade talks?
Taiwanese officials on Wednesday said they would recommend a conditional lifting of restrictions against U.S. beef that contains a “safe level” of ractopamine, a meat-leanness enhancer used by U.S. cattle raisers, to the legislature. Lawmakers can still reject the proposal, as they did with a similar one two years ago.
Taiwan, along with China and the EU, has a zero-tolerance policy on the chemical agent, citing health concerns. But the U.S. insists the beef meets international standards and is safe for human consumption.
The beef impasse has been a sore spot in Taiwan-U.S. trade relations. Following the initial restrictions, Washington in 2007 suspended trade talks with the island under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, or TIFA, the forum under which the two are supposed to hammer out trade issues. Taiwanese media speculated this week that the last-minute trip cancellation by Francisco Sanchez, an Under Secretary for the U.S. Department of Commerce, was a show of U.S. impatience.
Taiwan has made inroads in broadening trade and economic ties with China, but the island continues to seek wider access to the international market by striving to sign free-trade agreements or similar trade pacts with the U.S. and other regional partners, especially amid the emergence of South Korea, Taiwan's biggest competitors. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, who won a close re-election contest earlier this year, has pushed such agreements to give added oomph to the island's economy.
Taiwan may have its eyes on a bigger prize. Taiwan is also seeking a U.S. endorsement of its bid for membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region.
“Without TIFA, there would be no platform to discuss an FTA [free-trade agreement] with the U.S., which will also affect Taiwan's hope to join TPP in the next 10 years,” economic minister Shih Yen-hsiang told local reporters.
It remains to be seen how the legislature will deliberate on the matter, but it appears the cabinet's recent decision has only further fueled the local anti-U.S. beef sentiment.
The Democratic Progressive Party, the island's biggest opposition party with 35% of the legislature's seats, has already threatened to slow work over the matter.
The government said the partial ban will pertain only to beef, while all import pork must remain ractopamine-free. Still, the proposal also faces opposition from the local hog-farm industry.
“It feels like the government has slapped us in the face,” said Pan Liang-chou, the head of the hog raiser association, who plans to lead a protest on Thursday.
While Taiwan has no local cattle industry to speak of, the hog farming community is a vital and strong part of Taiwan's agriculture business. Agriculture is roughly 1.7% of Taiwan's total GDP in 2011, according to the government statistic department.
China, meanwhile, continues to keep ractopamine under strict watch.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott
Republican presidential hopefuls could learn from Prime Minister Tony Abbott's campaign.
Today's edition of the Australian contains a brilliant analysis by the paper's main political correspondents, Dennis Shanahan and Sid Maher, on how the campaigning strategy used by the Liberal party won Australia's federal election for (now Prime Minister) Tony Abbott. It has all the marks of authoritative inside briefing.
That Abbott's campaign was brilliant is not disputed by either Labour or the media. There's a reasonable argument that the implosion of Labour's campaign helped Abbott to a larger victory than he might otherwise have gained. But it is common currency that by the time the election was announced, Abbott was on course to win a substantial victory (almost) whatever happened.

That's a big change from most of the past four years after Abbott became leader of his party by one vote. He was then regarded by his Labour opponents, by the country's cultural establishment, and by most of the media as a primitive, radical, extreme, and unelectable right-winger. These forces kept up a steady drumbeat of hostile criticism along these same lines. Labour certainly believed its own propaganda; so did the media; and some of Abbott's own party were at the very least spooked by it. Ruthlessly and unremittingly negative, it might have been inspired by the Tammany bon mot: “Say what you like about negative campaigning, at least it's more honest than positive campaigning.” Most political consultants here and in Oz also think it's more effective than positive campaigning.
That was not the view of the four people who are the subjects of the Shanahan-Maher article — namely, Tony Abbott himself, the party leader; his chief of staff, Peta Credlin; the party's federal campaign director, Brian Loughnane (coincidentally, Credlin's husband); and their pollster, Mark Textor. (Full disclosure: Loughnane is a friend of several years' standing.) On the morrow of the 2010 election, when Abbott held Labour to a near-draw, Textor gave Loughnane a memo entitled “A Campaign by Grown-Ups for Grown-Ups.” Its argument was that for the coming three years, through last week's election, the Liberal party campaign should be relentlessly positive.

#ad#It should ignore the Labour charges that Abbott was extreme, unpopular, and unelectable and focus instead on the fact that, as the polls showed, he was respected. He was authentic, courageous, and competent. Above all, he was a known quantity. Abbott had been in national politics for almost 20 years. He had held several senior ministerial jobs, in which he had performed well. And though he held some opinions that were unpopular or “controversial,” he neither frightened people with them nor backed nervously away from them. His formula for dealing with such matters (I paraphrase) went like this: “Am I worried about divorce and family breakdown? Yes. Will I try to outlaw them? No.” Voters approved of his authenticity and reasonableness even whey they disagreed with him.
Advertisement
The four strategists concluded that Labour and the media would be unable to make their charges of extremism stick unless Abbott gave them the ammunition. The watchword of the Liberal campaign should therefore be “steady.” Abbott should present a strong reasoned case for his main policies and mount a reasoned but not angry critique of Labour's failures. He could go negative on Labour policies — polls showed that his attacks on Labour's carbon tax were popular — but not against Labour personalities. Above all, he should largely ignore the attacks leveled against him by the government and the media. Since these attacks reflected Labour's defective analysis of who Abbott was and what he stood for, the voters would be less and less influenced by them. They knew Abbott — an opposition leader gets about — and he simply didn't fit the caricature. Some of the more sneeringly snobbish attacks would probably drive traditional Labour voters into Abbott's waiting arms.
Advertisement
That analysis was followed and it worked. Even when Prime Minister Julia Gillard was replaced by Kevin Rudd in a last-minute coup less than three months before the election, the Liberal campaign kept a cool head and maintained the strategy. It relied on Rudd's gradually losing his cool, making wild charges, descending into purely negative campaigning, and ceasing to enjoy the prestige that comes of simply being prime minister. That is what happened. And while Rudd was exploding and imploding, Abbott kept steady. The voters rewarded him with a victory just this side of a landslide.
Advertisement
Most conservative parties and leaders face something like the same negative cultural stereotyping as Abbott did. This undoubtedly puts them at a disadvantage and gives their opponents a leg-up in an election. The answer to it is neither to rage wildly against it nor to surrender nervously to it — a response that Australians call the “cultural cringe.” The first reaction makes voters nervous that the potential prime minister is too irresponsible or prejudiced to be trusted with the highest office; the second reaction makes even those being appeased contemptuous and dismissive. Even if such appeasement is rewarded electorally, it usually ensures that the incoming government will be too compromised by its concessions to achieve much in the way of conservative reform.
Advertisement
Abbott demonstrated, however, that conservatives can overcome such cultural opposition by presenting a positive, reasoned case for their policies in a grown-up way. Sure, they face the disadvantage of a liberal establishment and a cultural atmosphere hostile to their values and policies, but they have the incomparable advantage that those values are the values of most voters across the spectrum. If they present their case calmly and steadily, the voters will see through the negative caricatures. If they start out lacking the respect of the voters, they will gradually earn it by the manner of their campaigning. And respect will turn into votes when the time comes.

Republican presidential hopefuls might therefore think of signing up for Abbott's correspondence course. Fortunately for David Cameron, he won't need to fork out his $19.99. Mark Textor is the partner (in the international consulting company Crosby-Textor) of Lynton Crosby, whom the British prime minister recently hired as his new principal political strategist.
Very courageous of you, if I may say so, Prime Minister.

Walker, a Republican, didn't sign the bill in public. Walker signs ultrasound bill
MADISON, Wis. — Gov. Scott Walker quietly signed a contentious Republican bill Friday that would require women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and ban doctors who lack admitting privileges at nearby hospitals from performing the procedures.
Opponents contend legislators shouldn't force women to undergo any medical procedure and the bill will force two abortion clinics where providers lack admitting privileges to shut their doors. The law takes effect Monday. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit within hours of the signing alleging the bill is unconstitutional and asking for a temporary restraining order blocking the measure.
Story Continued Below
"What the Legislature has done is to set up a system where the ability to provide abortions is contingent on the decision of a private institution and that's unconstitutional," Planned Parenthood's attorney, Lester Pines, said in an interview.
A spokeswoman for the state Department of Justice, which defends state laws, said agency attorneys would review the lawsuit and respond in court.
The bill is part of a broad GOP push to dramatically curtail abortions nationally.
North Dakota's governor, Republican Jack Dalrymple, signed a law this spring that outlaws abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, making North Dakota the most restrictive state in the nation to get an abortion. The state's lone abortion clinic has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the law.
Republicans in Arkansas this spring passed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Center for Reproductive Rights. A federal judge has temporarily blocked that law. A trial has been tentatively scheduled for next year.
Alabama passed a law similar to the Wisconsin bill in April requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit contending the law would shut down three clinics because doctors at the clinics haven't been able to get admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law in June. Another federal judge has temporarily blocked Mississippi officials from closing down that state's only abortion clinic because providers there lack admitting privileges.
Under the new Wisconsin law, any woman seeking an abortion would have to get an ultrasound. The technician would have to point out the fetus' visible organs and external features. Abortion providers would have to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles to perform the procedures.
Supporters argue ultrasounds will help the woman bond with the fetus and convince her to save it. The admitting privileges requirement ensures a woman who suffers an abortion-related complication has an advocate who can explain what happened when she reaches a hospital, they say.
Opponents maintain the law authorizes the government to dictate medical procedures. They've blasted the admitting privileges as ridiculous, saying an ambulance would take an ailing woman to the nearest hospital regardless of whether the abortion provider has admitting privileges.
Walker, a Republican, didn't sign the bill in public, instead sending out a statement early Friday afternoon saying the bill was now law.
"This bill improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future," the statement said.
The fight now shifts to court, just as it has in other states.
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU allege the admitting privileges will force a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Appleton to close as well as the Affiliated Medical Services abortion clinic in Milwaukee to close. The physicians in both clinics lack local admitting privileges and don't have time to secure any before the law takes effect, the lawsuit alleges.
Hospitals often grant privileges only to physicians who guarantee a minimum number of annual referrals, a requirement the abortion providers can't meet because abortion problems that require hospitalization are rare, according to the lawsuit. And some hospitals won't grant admitting privileges to abortion providers out of political, ideological or religious reasons, the lawsuit added.
Without a clinic in Appleton northern Wisconsin women will have to travel hundreds of miles to obtain abortions at Planned Parenthood's remaining clinics in Madison and Milwaukee, the lawsuit said.
The case fell to U.S. District Judge William Conley. It was unclear whether he would take any action before Monday.
Barbara Lyons, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, praised Walker for following through on promises to sign the bill. She said the law is on solid legal ground, noting eight other states have similar admitting privileges requirements for abortion privileges.
"It's no surprise they'll be challenging," she said of Planned Parenthood. "They see their livelihood threatened, their income threatened. We don't think in the long run they'll be successful."

Abstract
Intellectual property scholars have begun to explore the curious dynamics of IP's negative spaces, areas in which IP law offers scant protection for innovators, but where innovation nevertheless seems to thrive. Such negative spaces pose a puzzle for the traditional theory of IP, which holds that IP law is necessary to create incentives for innovation.
This paper presents a study of one such negative space which has so far garnered some curiosity but little sustained attention - the world of performing magicians. This paper argues that idiosyncratic dynamics among magicians make traditional copyright, patent, and trade secret law ill-suited to protecting magicians' most valuable intellectual property. Yet, the paper further argues that the magic community has developed its own set of unique IP norms which effectively operate in law's absence. The paper details the structure of these informal norms that protect the creation, dissemination, and performance of magic tricks. The paper also discusses broader implications for IP theory, suggesting that a norm-based approach may offer a promising explanation for the puzzling persistence of some of IP's negative spaces.
Few marketing campaigns have the power to stick with you vividly for decades. The way Sega launched Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992, however, really fits the bill.
Even to this day I remember that ‘Sonic 2sday' was November 24, 1992. I remember the excitement I had as a child as that day approached. This was the first simultaneous global launch of a video game and it was a big deal. I remember hopping on a bus down to the local games shop (Microbyte in Bradford, staffed by two affable young chaps called Jools and George) after school to see the game first-hand and to sneak a look at the preorder list to confirm that my mum had indeed secured my copy for Christmas Day.
This wasn't just a game launch, it was a branded, global event, and in many ways the marketing has stuck with me over the years more than the game. I still think ‘Happy Sonic 2'day' to myself every time November 24 rolls around.
All this is at the forefront of my mind this week as I've been listening to the audiobook of Console Wars, a colorful account of the 90s battle between Nintendo and Sega. As per the story in the book, Sega of America was deciding how to launch Sonic 2 – its biggest title of the year. A mall tour accross the USA was all planned out, but a day before everything had to be locked down, it just wasn't considered quite good enough – not ‘Sega' enough. A high-profile, branded, global launch for the game, however, really was, and it was conceived at the last minute.
Given that Sonic 2's launch is remembered fondly and vividly to this day, it worked.
If you're a lean startup, you won't have the resources Sega had at its disposal 23 years ago, but then again, audiences have never been easier to access.
Stopping and thinking about whether you're really being quite as ambitious as you could be donen't cost anything, but that's what Sega did, right at the last minute. It could be the difference between getting the job done and true greatness. Are you being true to yourself and your brand, or just getting the job done?

Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sits down with 'The View' to discuss Trump leading in the ABC/Washington Post poll.
She told them: "A lot of people shouldn't have been getting their inaugural ball gowns and popping their champagne corks prematurely. Because you have to respect people, you have to give people a chance to express their voice and exercise their choice. Starting two weeks ago, we had a lot of people in the media saying... he has no path. People tend to snap back and say that is not fair, and say they are going to vote for him. Hillary Clinton got a little too comfortable, was waiting out her lead, now we're forcing her back in Michigan --a state which hasn't gone Republican since 1988. Tim Kaine yesterday was in Wisconsin, a state that hasn't gone Republican since 1984. And we're loving the ABC News poll! It is our favorite poll."
Host Whoopi Goldberg challenged her repeatedly that Trump said the media and the polls were crooked. "Everything was crooked, and now he's doing better because they're neck and neck. I'm just wondering, will it be crooked if he slips back down in the polls?"
"I think you should get ready for a chyron that says 'President-Elect Donald J. Trump.' He told me to tell you that he'll be on you show as soon as he's elected."
"I don't care if he ever comes on this show," Goldberg snapped back. "He's been very nasty about people I care about."
"Wow," Conway said. "Let me tell you what's nasty. Hillary Clinton's endless... There were tens of millions of dollars in negative advertising from Hillary Clinton."
DETROIT—Bragging to teammates and coaches on the sidelines, Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins reportedly boasted on several occasions Sunday that he got laid during a 34-yard interception return against the Detroit Lions. “Right when I picked off the ball in the end zone, I noticed her glancing at me, so I headed up the field, made a couple of moves, and we were fucking like crazy by the 15-yard line,” said Jenkins, who informed the referees the woman was “a total, cock-starved nympho.” “It was pretty hot and heavy. This chick wanted me to bone her in all these weird positions, which is probably why I didn't get all the way to the end zone.” When pressed by doubtful teammates, Jenkins finally admitted that he had only received a quick halfhearted hand job right as he was tackled.
Andrew Normore has been hard at work for years trying to catch his big break. The soon-to-be dad works by day at a marketing department, where he just got a promotion, and the rest of the time he devotes to his development projects and continued learning. Until not too long ago, his most successful project was “Super Chromecast Party”, a simple yet fun mini-game multiplayer Android app that got over 20,000 downloads on the Play Store.
Other projects such as “Angry Doge” didn't find much success, but Andrew knew when to cut the cord and focus his effort onto something new and this time he seems to have struck gold with his latest personal venture, BitGamer.tv.
BitGamer.tv launched without much fanfare on February of this year. It is the first streaming service whose donation system is completely based on crypto currencies. An avid gamer for most of his life and an active member of the DogeCoin community, Andrew saw an opening in the lucrative streaming market (in the somewhat-recent wake of Google's $1 billion acquisition of Twitch.tv) and went to work in a frenzy, managing to prototype, get feedback and launch a beta version of his service including DogeCoin support in only two weeks. One of the platform's coolest features so far is the ability for viewers to set challenges for the streamer, into which other users can jump in to increase the prize.
As a few months passed, Andrew, still the only developer at the time, added support for Bitcoin and LiteCoin donations for streamers and BitGamer's userbase kept growing slowly. A subreddit was created with a dedicated base of followers for whom Andrew has a strong appreciation:
“I have two loyal helpers over at /r/BitGamerDotTV who have been super helpful at manning the sub reddit.”
“The community at /r/BitGamerDotTV is actually something I consider special. I think most members are from /r/DogeCoin – but never the less it is a friendly and warm place to spend time on the Internet. Everyone is friendly. I think it is because you're SEEING a person stream (it is possible to stream your web cam feed alongside of your game stream). Putting a human face to a /u/username is a huge step in the right direction, in terms of friendliness and courteousness. Values I hold in high esteem, and am proud to see the subreddit has naturally grown these values!”
At first view BitGamer.tv may not seem like much, but Andrew's efforts on developing the platform have been impressive enough to catch the eye of an investor who has been involved in the area of streaming service providers since 2004 and has chosen to remain anonymous so far; they like Andrew's idea and they want to take it to the moon.
In a whirlwind, suddenly BitGamer.tv found itself being acquired by a company with enough capital to catalyze Andrew's vision for the future of the platform:
“I am retaining as their lead developer, and have a massive amount of input into what goes on. I'm still fairly young, part of me regrets giving up control of my idea – but believe me, there is more I will do for this planet. Elon Musk is a personal hero of mine, he didn't do over a million until he was 34; I still have time.”
So far in his role as Lead Developer he has spent the past few weeks overseeing the upgrade to new servers and next on the list of features for BitGamer.tv is to add support for Subscriptions, although some of its members are doing fine so far without them: the current donation record in a single session so far went to the user “Akuthia”, who accumulated 550,000 DogeCoins in a sitting while playing Kerbal Space Program.
Following our interview, I'm certain that his angel investors made the right choice, BitGamer.tv will continue to add new users to its community and Andrew will go on working at full steam to improve their experience.
WASHINGTON — About a week ago, Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a passionate champion for the poor in New Orleans and the lone Democrat in the state's congressional delegation, received a phone call from President Obama, pleading for his vote to enhance the president's trade negotiation powers.
Mr. Obama did not get very far.
“I represent a trade district,” the congressman said. “I could very well vote for this. Problem is, I don't want to.”
That is a problem for the president. In recent days, he has been personally calling House Democrats, leaning particularly hard on the 45 House members in the Congressional Black Caucus, like Mr. Richmond, whom he hopes in the end can be persuaded to side with him. The pitch is one he has repeated to all audiences: Every modern president but Richard Nixon has had the congressionally given power to negotiate trade deals that cannot be amended or filibustered.
His pro-trade emissary to the caucus, Representative Gregory Meeks, Democrat of New York, makes it more biting: Denying the first African-American president that same authority smacks of bias, especially when opposition is rising in the Republican Party's Tea Party wing.

For his first novel, the 2011 blog-turned-book-turned-movie The Martian, Andy Weir chose a main character who was pretty similar to himself: a white guy who loves science. For his follow-up, which came out on November 14, Weir wanted to try something different: Artemis follows Jazz Bashara, a 20-something woman of color who lives on the first (and only) city on the Moon, where she, well, moonlights as a smuggler.
Essentially, Artemis is a lunar sci-fi thriller, and it arrives at a high point in cultural moon lunacy—entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are infatuated with the idea of settlements there, and startups like Moon Express see Luna as a base for further spaceward travel. And according to Stephen Hawking, humanity should probably relocate to the Moon to escape Earth's impending doom. But is Weir's vision of future lunar life—particularly as it concerns Jazz and other minorities—really a better place to live?
Sarah Scoles, Science Contributor: I listened to the audiobook version of The Martian while driving from California to North Carolina in 2015. Just as main character Mark Watney's crew was getting pummeled by a dust storm on the Red Planet, I was (kid you not) plowing my Kia into a ground-level red cloud at the California-Arizona border. I thought, “I. am. Mark. Watney.” And, in that coincidental moment, I felt more connected to Mark than I did to Jazz throughout Artemis. Which is surprising because while I live neither on the moon nor Mars, hello, it is I, a human woman on earth who knows a technical thing or two, like this Jazz (although, admittedly, she's a much better smuggler). I was excited about the premise of a woman-headlined, high-profile sci-fi novel, but things didn't turn out like I expected.
Justice Namaste, Editorial Fellow: I definitely have a lot in common with Jazz. In my twenties, unsure about what to do with my life, usually broke. But about 50 pages in, I noticed a phrase that felt a little weird, and as I kept reading, I started to pick up on a pattern.
Early in the book, in a letter to her pen pal Kelvin, Jazz refers to herself as "light brown.” Weir tells us Jazz is of Saudi Arabian descent, and implies that she was raised Muslim, but is no longer practicing. Now, I've been a light-skinned black woman my entire life, and while I've heard plenty of people refer to themselves as "light-skinned" or even "light,” I've never heard "light brown" before. This was the first time I noticed what soon turned into a series of references to race that felt forced and awkward.
Crown
Scoles: Weir does note, in the acknowledgments, that he asked women for help in tackling “the challenge of writing a female narrator” and “[making] sure the portrayal of Islam was accurate.” But some blind spots seem to remain.
Namaste: Like at the beginning of the book, Jazz makes an offhand reference to Artemis's racial makeup, in a way that implies everyone is on the same footing. But just a few pages later, she also mentions that career demographics are based on race: “With the exception of me and Rudy, everyone in the room was Vietnamese. That's kind of how things shake out in Artemis. A few people who know one another emigrate, they set up a service of some kind, then they hire their friends. And of course, they hire people they know.”
There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this, but it's one of the few times that ethnicity is mentioned in the book. Jazz is introduced as Saudi Arabian early in the story, but then her ethnicity seems to disappear from view—except in her conversations with her father and other Saudi Arabian folks in the welding industry. However, even these minimal references to racial dynamics make it clear that Artemis is a place (like every other place) where race influences both personal relationships and societal dynamics. The problem is that the book doesn't overtly acknowledge that.
Scoles: On the other hand, the reader never forgets that Jazz is a woman. Example: “I giggled like a little girl. Hey, I'm a girl, so I'm allowed.” In an interview with SyFy Wire, Weir said, “I'm certainly not trying to make a point by having a female lead….She doesn't encounter any distinctly ‘female' challenges....And the story takes place in a future society where there is practically no sexism.”
The book does portray powerful, intelligent female characters (I think the ruthless head of the colony is pretty rad), and passes the Bechdel Test. But then also, one of Jazz's boyfriends has sex with a 14-year-old girl, and that's allowed because “different cultures have different sexual morals, so Artemis doesn't have age-of-consent rules at all.”
This pseudolibertarian attitude toward sex laws mirrors Weir's hands-off stance toward putting serious topics in his fiction. Weir has stated more than once, in interviews about Artemis, that he means no politics by it all. “[My stories] have no subtext or message,” he told The New York Times. “If you think you see something like that, it's in your head, not mine.”
But, at least in some modes of literary criticism and consumption, authorial intent—in this case, Weir's desire for our apolitical comprehension—matters not at all. The text stands alone, and means to each reader what it will. And I, for one, think consent laws and, say, the black markets in which Jazz operates, are political.
Namaste: I think that comment gets at one of the key issues—regardless of whether Weir intended to make Artemis a “political” book, choosing a woman of color as his main character made it impossible for the story to be left out of conversations about gender and race.
Weir's comment about Artemis being a society without sexism feels similar to race-related idea of “color-blindness.” You've probably heard the argument before, when someone says “I only believe in one race: the human race.” The idea behind this is that if you don't see racial difference, you can't possibly uphold inequality. However, many scholars argue that by refusing to acknowledge when racial discrimination does exist, color-blindness actually supports systems of racial inequality.
Scoles: On the other hand, Artemis focuses constantly about Jazz's gender and intercourse exploits, in a way that seems meant to telegraph that Artemisians are beyond sexual stigma. But then there are moments like this one, when Jazz is talking to her father's colleague: “You were nice little girl,” the colleague says. “Now you are bad.”
“Okay...,” responds Jazz. “Look I want to talk to you about something—”
“You are unmarried and have sex with many men,” says the colleague. Jazz then notes, to herself, that the woman's son has sex with many men.
This interaction says to me that perhaps men having lots of unwed sex (even queer sex) is okay. But not so much for women.
Namaste: And in the same way Artemis may not be the sexually liberated environment it passes itself off as, perhaps Jazz is not the sex-positive role model she is assumed to be. Sure, Jazz likes sex, and she's comfortable talking about it, but is that really all it takes to have a progressive view on sex? I mean the notoriously sexist idea of “locker room talk” checks both those boxes. It seems like this characterization of Jazz assumes that sexually progressive women approach sex in similar ways to men, when really sex positivity is about having a healthy and nuanced attitude towards sex, a depth that Jazz seems to lack in this story.
Scoles: And then there's the whole subplot involving the star scientist, Svoboda, her partner in crime. I'd say Jazz is top-dawg in the dynamics most of their interactions, and their relationship is mutually beneficial. But Svoboda agrees to help Jazz with technical challenges—if she agrees to test his newly invented reusable condom in exchange. Because, you know, Jazz has a lot of sex, whereas he is a nerd and bad with women.
Namaste: Jazz is the quintessential “cool girl” (otherwise known as the “girl who's one of the guys” or just Jennifer Lawrence)—a “Manic Pixie Dream Girl”-adjacent trope. Author Gillian Flynn laid out a perfect description in Gone Girl. Despite Jazz's embodiment of this trope, she is also shown as a quick-witted smuggler whose scientific knowledge and ability to improvise gets her out of all sorts of jams.
Scoles: OK, so we can agree: Sexism exists on Artemis. So does racism, but it's barely ever mentioned. Artemis seems to over-emphasize the role of gender (say, with the constant mentions of Jazz's sex life), while almost completely avoiding discussions of race.
Namaste: This is a natural result of color-blindness. If you don't believe race is important, or if you believe that differentiating people along racial lines is bad, it makes sense to mostly avoid talking about race in a meaningful way. There's a word for this lack of discussion: erasure. He does create a society in which people are of different races, which is a step in the right direction. And people from a variety of ethnic groups have power, and interact. But the book glosses over those interactions, and how race might inform them, and inform people's identities, in a way it doesn't gloss over, say, the physics of explosions. While Artemis's science and tech are fleshed out, the book could spend similar time playing out how earthly social issues might play out on the moon.
Scoles: Weir handles what I will eloquently call “queer stuff” (I can say that because I'm gay, which is a joke that will illuminate itself in a second) with similar lack of nuance. Jazz's ex-boyfriend, Tyler, left her for a man named Dale. Dale helpfully explains the following: “Tyler's gay, Jazz. Gay as Oscar Wilde wearing sequins walking a pink poodle with a tiara on his head.” This defines “gay” as “tired-ass stereotypes.” But it's OK! Because a gay character says it.
Later, the bartender (affectionately?) calls Dale an “arse bandit.” Generally, when Dale is around, Jazz makes sure to let us know that, hey, never forget, he's the gay one, gay AF, sex with men, doesn't like girls, nope, not at all. Jazz is mad that Tyler left her for Dale (fair enough, although her relationship with her closeted boyfriend was probably not on firm long-term footing anyway), so she herself may be more apt to mention his orientation. But it (and mentions from other characters) land wrong, like if my friends said, “Good to see you, gay friend,” when I walked into the room. I wouldn't like that, were I here or in Artemis.
And in Artemis, Weir ginned up a society full of different races, queer people, and a competent, crafty, mouthy, smart, independent, sexually uninhibited female character. And that counts for a lot. But the world could have been built and written to do something deeper. Not to contain a “political message,” but to acknowledge that even in Moon Land, life and race and gender are complex. Let's all admit that this stuff is ingrained in all of us, and the art we create reflects it, and then that art reflects back on society.
Namaste: It makes me wonder: Why make her a woman of color at all? Why not just write a white man? Saying that these aspects of identity don't really affect who Jazz is suggests that ethnicity, religion, and gender can just be slapped on top of an already-formed character, and that they aren't actually integral to her identity development and character arc. Since Artemis is already on its way to being made into a movie, this is an area the filmmakers need to be sure to handle with nuance. Because personally, if life on Artemis has the same social issues as we do here, I'd rather save my cash and stay on Earth.
The news has broken this morning that I'll be leaving Rackspace as its futurist to join UploadVR as an entrepreneur in residence.
Why join a virtual reality publication that most people haven't heard of? Yes, I know you have, but most haven't yet.
Earlier this week I visited Cape Town, South Africa where Tyrone Rubin, founder of SenseVirtual, threw a party for me there. He brought three HTC Vive VR setups. He too is building a business on VR. His helps brand activate new users with VR. Mine is to get a front-row seat at the smiles that VR is causing. Thing is, most of the other people who were invited haven't gotten to try VR yet. Photos of that are here.
I watched carefully as they all got a few minutes in the headset and saw their smiles grow.
That's not the first time I've seen that reaction. I've now seen hundreds of people get their first demo in places all over the world. Same smiles every time. In my experience, at least, the smiles don't wear off.
Everytime I get into one, even if you put me into something I've already experienced, the smile comes back.
As a futurist at Rackspace I learned to watch for people's emotion when discovering something new. The more emotion, the more interesting it is (and, yes, even cloud computing nerds get emotional when they discover something like Node JS or containers for the first time).
I've never seen a product bring so much emotion out of its users as VR does. Grant Weston, 17-year-old son of our chairman, told me he won't use his Xbox if he had a VR headset after he had a chance at one at CES. Exactly Grant and you won't be the last kid saying that.
So, the big question is “when?” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder who purchased Oculus, says VR won't be ubiquitous like smartphones are for a decade or maybe longer. I don't disagree if it's framed that way, but most of the nerds who live around me in Silicon Valley have already ordered either an HTC Vive or an Oculus Rift. That tells me the world is shifting already, even if it's the rich nerds who are shifting first. Plus, watch what is happening at the big music event, Coachella, where Google will make a full-on VR push, handing out Google Cardboards to hundreds of thousands of attendees.
The answer of “when” is an interesting one. Most people I talk with think VR is sort of dorky until they get in it themselves. Just look at how the Internet treated Mark Zuckerberg after he was photographed at Mobile World Congress in front of an audience who was wearing Samsung's GearVR. Put them in one and then they become a believer. This happens nearly every single time. The problem is how many people can get a demo in the first year? After all, it takes 15 minutes, either in a retail store, or over someone's house that has one setup.
I figure that number will be in the low millions the first year and of those how many will buy? 25% would be aggressive because VR headsets, at least the high end, have some pretty real problems. First of which is the cost. I've spent already about $3,000 on my headsets and PCs to run the high-end versions and I haven't yet gotten mine. In fact, even if you buy Oculus Rift, or did earlier this year when they went on sale, you still will need to wait until summer time when the controllers ship to get the full experience.
Also if you can afford the headset there are other problems: my wife gets sick in some and there's a tether to a big, ugly, PC. Needed for the Nvidia card inside which is why the experience of wearing one is so mind blowing, but still. These are factors that will all slow down growth so the insiders who have had their try inside a headset are getting ahead of the rest of you. Translation: the market is a bit overhyped short term.
That all doesn't take away from the smiles. The smiles will continue, even after articles decrying lack of sales, or lack of original content (which, let's be honest, will only come after lots of headsets sell).
The smiles are why I made this move. I want to be part of something that is so, darned, fun! Thanks UploadVR for giving me a chance to be a part of this community (and doing the hard early lifting of making one of the strongest media brands in the VR space).
Oh, and notice that we haven't even talked about AR, which will follow VR into consumer markets in two to four years, and is even more fun and will bring a deeper change to our culture.
I've never seen two waves of consumer products like those that are starting to hit the market this month. Just full of opportunity and I don't think I'll have another chance at 51 to get involved in such a big shift in how we compute if I wait this one out.
The smiles tell me its time.

A reader tells us:
Major layoffs at Universal Music Group on Friday. People from every department were axed (there were a few departments spared, it seems, though). From what I can tell, most of the major imprints were hit (IDJ, Universal Records).
It seems that they are trying hard to keep the layoffs out of the press.
We've reached out to UMG for confirmation, but please pass along any pertinent information to nicholas@alleyinsider.com or 727-507-1699.
UMG last went through layoffs in December 2007.
Update: A UMG spokesperson got back to us (very quickly!) to say no, there were not "massive" or major layoffs at the company. He says the rumor stems from layoffs at one of UMG's many labels -- perhaps Interscope.

It looks as though Laurent Koscielny's phone may have had a couple of texts from Arsene Wenger when he returned from international duty…
Following a frank interview undertaken in Brazil, which was massively skewed by headline writers across Europe, the centre-back has stressed that he's certainly not looking for a move away from Arsenal and even gone so far as to praise the club's financial policy even though he believes the squad needs strengthening.
Here's the important bit of a lengthy interview carried by lepopulaire.fr this weekend:
Q: Let's talk about Arsenal, sometimes people say your club lacks ambition, is that something you feel as a player?
LK: Not necessarily. Instead, we're very ambitious, we always play all games to win.
You can't always though…
Well that's because other clubs have more strength.
This is the rub right? You seem yourself to regret this?
I never said that. I feel very well at Arsenal. I am aware it's a great club and I have a four-year contract. I know there's talk about me and Barcelona and Bavaria, but people make their own conclusions. [possibly down to his agent?]
The facts are simple: I have a contract at a club where I am happy. Full stop. We all know how situations change in football but I repeat that I'm not one to make castles in the sky. I live in the moment, I seek nothing but to play the best I can.
In my mind my goal is to win trophies with Arsenal with whom I'm about to start pre-season training. I've no ulterior motives. I'm at a healthy club, which plays beautiful football, doesn't lose money every year, sticks to its own budget and plays in the Champions League. Not many players can say the same.
Arseblog News suggests that draws as definitive a line under things as is possible.
For those who like a bit of background, Laurent also answered questions on his favourite football, what it's like playing Messi, which opponent he hates playing against the most and how he never really believed he'd make it to the top level. Check it out here.

Los Angeles (AFP) - The governor of California on Wednesday signed an ambitious climate change bill that aims to increase the use of renewable electricity and make buildings more energy efficient.
"California has taken groundbreaking steps to increase the efficiency of our cars, buildings and appliances and provide ever more renewable energy," said Governor Jerry Brown at the signing ceremony.
"With SB 350, we deepen our commitment."
The bill aims for California to generate 50 percent of its electricity from renewable resources such as wind and solar energy by 2030.
It also calls for buildings in the West Coast state to become twice as energy efficient by 2030.
"Today, California is laying the groundwork for a healthier and sustainable future for all of our families," said state senator Kevin de Leon.
"We are showing the world through innovation how we can transition and increase access to renewable energy while cleaning up the air we breathe, especially in our most polluted communities."
The legislation had suffered a major setback last month when it had to be amended to remove a component that would have required reduced gasoline consumption on California roads.
Oil companies had opposed the measure, launching a fierce lobbying campaign that included television and radio ads.
California is the largest US state by population -- the third largest state by area -- and often is seen as a trendsetter for the rest of the country.
Eight northeastern states are suing the Trump administration for denying their request to further crack down on smog pollution from nearby states.
The states, led by New York, had asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2013 to add eight states and part of another to an area known as the Ozone Transport Region. The designation requires those states to take actions to mitigate ozone pollution that blows to downwind states.
The Obama administration's EPA proposed denying the petition just before Inauguration Day, and current EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA knows this pesticide is dangerous, so why did it reverse the ban? Archives investigation finds no ‘secret' Pruitt calendars existed California has sued the Trump administration 46 times. Here are the lawsuits MORE finalized the denial in November.

New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont say that denial violates the Clean Air Act.
“Millions of New Yorkers are breathing unhealthy air as smog pollution continues to pour in from other states,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.
“The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to act. Yet the Trump EPA has abandoned its responsibilities — repeatedly failing to act to control smog pollution that jeopardizes New Yorkers' health.”
The states filed their lawsuit in the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the judges to compel the EPA to accept their petition.
For Schneiderman, the lawsuit is the latest in more than 100 actions he has taken against the Trump administration in less than a year.
An EPA spokesman declined to comment, saying it is the agency's policy not to comment on pending litigation.
In its November Federal Register notice denying the petition, the EPA said existing programs are better suited to address the issue of smog blowing across state lines, like the Clean Air Act's “good neighbor” provision and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule.
“The states and the EPA have historically and effectively reduced ozone and the interstate transport of ozone pollution using these other [Clean Air Act] authorities,” the agency said.

Her story: Chrissy Bielot, 35, grew up in Pikesville. She works as a payroll analyst for an information technology staffing firm in Hanover.
His story: Jeff Marshall, 36, calls Blackfoot, Idaho, his hometown, but says his family moved frequently while he was growing up because his father was an aircraft mechanic. Jeff moved to Maryland in July 2005 for his job as a conductor for CSX and is now a train dispatcher for the company. His parents, Chuck and Connie Marshall, are retired and live in Arimo, Idaho.
Their story: In early 2013, Jeff and a co-worker joined Meetup.com, a website to meet people who share the same interests. They created a board game club and hosted meetups for several months before Chrissy joined the club.
That July, the group organized a board game barbecue, which was Chrissy's first time attending a get-together.
Throughout the evening, Jeff and Chrissy say they unintentionally kept finding themselves next to each other in a group of about 20 people.
"At the end of the activity, you get a little email listing everybody at the event, and you can click on the link and it just sends everyone a quick 'nice to see you' email," Jeff says.
Being new to the site, Chrissy got Jeff's message and didn't know he had also sent it to the rest of the group.
When Jeff followed up with a personal message to Chrissy saying the group would be glad to have her again, she thought he was flirting. But when he didn't ask her out, she decided to make the first move. They met one day in Glen Burnie for dinner, followed by a walk on the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail.
The proposal: In December 2013, Jeff and the board game club members arranged a holiday game night with prizes.
With the other group members aware of his plan, Jeff rigged the prize selection process so that when Chrissy won, she would draw from a bag holding paper slips for only "big" prizes, one of them being a proposal and engagement ring.
"The problem was, I won the first game," Chrissy says. Jeff hadn't had time to switch the normal prize bag for the special, "big prize" bag. Chrissy was determined to claim a board game called King of Tokyo as her prize and ignored Jeff when he tried to sway her decision to choose another.
He left the room and came back with a box, saying that she forgot to consider one prize. He then got down on one knee and proposed.
Chrissy and her son, Cole, live in Parkville but will move to Jeff's house in Severn this summer when Cole finishes school.
Venue: About 75 guests attended the ceremony and reception at the Elkridge Furnace Inn. Officiant Joel Lessard presided. Jeff and Chrissy included Cole during a sand ceremony in which the three of them poured colored sand into a glass frame to signify the joining of their families.
Flowers and decor: The colors of the wedding were red, white and navy. Because Chrissy is highly allergic to live flowers, she ordered wooden flowers online to use instead. Her bouquet consisted of wooden red roses, and the centerpieces used wooden white and blue flowers.
Tables were named after board games, such as Power Grid, the first game Chrissy and Jeff played together.
Her dress: The bride wore a strapless ivory ballgown with floral beading by Oleg Cassini from David's Bridal. She wore a matching beaded veil and red peep-toe high heels.
Bridesmaids' dresses: The women wore strapless, knee-length navy satin dresses from David's Bridal with red peep-toe high heels.
Men's attire: The men wore gray tuxedos from the Vera Wang collection at Men's Wearhouse. Jeff wore an ivory vest and tie, and the groomsmen wore navy vests and ties. Cole, the ring bearer and Jeff's junior groomsman, wore a gray tuxedo and ivory vest and tie to match Jeff.
Music: DJ Bill Marsh of Carlysle Entertainment in Savage played music. Jeff and Chrissy's first dance was to "Love of a Lifetime" by Firehouse.
Food and dessert: Chef Daniel Wecker at the Elkridge Furnace Inn made roasted New York strip steak, turkey breast, salmon, rockfish, artichoke cheese dip and mini quiches.
A three-tier cake with caramel pecan, vanilla and chocolate raspberry layers was served for dessert. Tye's Mud Hut in Severn made a cake topper featuring two meeples — board game pieces in the shape of miniature people.
Favors: Guests received a pair of red-white-and-blue dice engraved with Chrissy and Jeff's names and wedding date.
Special touches: Jeff's brother, Rob Marshall, made a woodwork box decorated with Chrissy and Jeff's names and wedding date to hold the rings for the ceremony. Guests signed Jenga tiles instead of a traditional guest book.
The couple hosted a second reception in Idaho for Jeff's family members who couldn't make it to the wedding.

Last year Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro announced a forthcoming board game version of long-running card game Magic the Gathering to be released in 2015. At the time it had the working title "Magic the Gathering Strategy Board Game," but now Hasbro has revealed the official title will be Magic the Gathering: Arena of the Planeswalkers. Check out the box art here:
Arena of the Planeswalkers is for two to five players and includes five Planeswalker figures. All characters from Magic lore, four were announced at the initial announcement: Chandra Nalaar, Jace Beleren, Nissa Revane, and Liliana Vess. Today we can reveal the fifth Planeswalker in the game: Gideon.
Lookin' good, Gideon!
Longtime Magic fans should know these characters, but Hasbro says no prior Magic experience is necessary to enjoy Arena of the Planeswalkers.
The game is due in select retailers this June and will be more widely available in August for around $30. In the box will be: six modular board pieces, four plastic terrain pieces, three plastic glyphs, two temple ruins, five painted Planeswalker mini figures, 30 squad mini figures, one 20-sided die, eight combat dice, 30 damage counters, 60 spell cards, 10 Squad stat cards, and five Planeswalker cards.

Haunted Ellicott City Maryland: B&O Railroad Station Museum
B&O Railroad Station Museum was completed in 1830 and is the oldest surviving railroad station in the USA and the original terminus of the first 13 miles of commercial track ever constructed in America. In 1857, the building was expanded for passenger service with waiting rooms and a ticket office
The station has experienced two major restorations. The first occurred in 1976 which converted the station to a museum. The second occurred in 1999 which restored the station to its 1857 appearance
During the Civil War, trains on the B&O railroad stopped in Ellicott City to house Confederate soldiers who had surrendered or were captured by the Union. Some conjecture their spirits still remain
The museum is reportedly haunted by a box-moving and stair climbing ghost that has been named “Charlie.” During Civil War re-enactments the apparition of a union soldier has been seen

Information from Wikileaks cables has resurfaced showing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller personally delivered highly Enriched Uranium to Russians in Moscow circa 2009.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Special Prosecutor Robert Muelller flew to Moscow and gave the FSB 10 grams of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) in 2009 <a href="https://t.co/mNdcTa7boQ">https://t.co/mNdcTa7boQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/nPjFSKPHWQ">pic.twitter.com/nPjFSKPHWQ</a></p>— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/891431096688271365">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
This not only proves a conflict of interest for Robert Mueller but brings into question not only his integrity but the lack of intelligence of those who recommended Mueller as Special Counsel.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller has now two serious problems. He has a disqualifying conflict of interest regarding a large part of his work involving his personal friendship with James Comey, and now a conflict of interest regarding his relationship with Russia.
Ideally, Robert Mueller will recognize that and resign,but if he chooses not to resign, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should immediately appoint another special counsel, as per the recommendation of Congress.

I've said for sometime Robert Mueller cannot be trusted. He knowingly fabricated the false evidence used to support the invasion of Iraq, claiming that data showed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which later was proven to be false.
Robert Mueller also was FBI Director at the time of the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001 that changed the world, and some imply his direct ignorance of intelligence given to the FBI by foreign intelligence communities could have prevented the attack, to begin with.
<strong><span style="color:red;">Quite simply, Robert Mueller is a corrupt Deep State Operative with not only a history of lying, but clearly has a conflict of interest on multiple fronts and must either immediately resign, or be replaced.</span></strong>

Chelsea bad-boy Ramires is a shock summer target for Barcelona.
Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta is planning a "mini-revolution" at the Nou Camp this summer after a disappointing season which reigning La Liga champions Barça look set to end empty-handed.
Brazilian midfielder Ramires is on the Catalans' wish-list because they like his energy and work-rate.
It could mean the 27-year-old may have played his last game for Chelsea in the Premier League, as he has been given a four-game ban by the FA for elbowing Sunderland midfielder Seb Larsson in last week's meeting at Stamford Bridge.
Ramires cost the west Londoners £20million from Portuguese heavyweights Benfica in 2010 and is a regular for Brazil.
One of his most memorable moments in a Chelsea shirt was scoring against Barcelona in the Nou Camp as the Blues won a Champions League semi-final on the way to lifting the European Cup two years ago.
Barça want to strengthen their midfield options this summer and it is likely there will be several incomings and outgoings this summer.
Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas could be one of those sacrificed, with his former club and Manchester United - who chased him last summer - both likely to be interested.
Barcelona may be ready to offer Chelsea around £20m AND a choice of one of their younger players either on loan or on a permanent deal.
People tell you to dream big
but maybe it's the tiny dreams that matter.
Sometimes my dream
is just to make it through the day.
I wrote these lines a few weeks ago and have been waiting for more words to come to mind, words that would sound more positive and hopeful. (I shared in my last post that I've been dealing with a bout of increased pain–more than my usual baseline of chronic pain, which I've learned to manage.)
I've decided to stop waiting for any profound insights because I'm really at a pretty basic level on Maslow's hierarchy of needs right now. So, I've decided to take my own advice and focus on the tiny dreams:
When I feel tired, I will rest.
When I feel hungry, I will eat.
(And I'll try not to get the previous two mixed up.)
When I feel sad, I will let myself cry.
When I feel happy, I will let myself smile.
When I need help, I will ask.
Regardless of how I feel, I will be kind.
I will remind myself that my blog is called The Self-Compassion Project!
Most of all, I will remember that tiny dreams are still dreams. All dreams matter.
There has been a startling and consistent increase in violent sex crimes within the US Army since 2006, according to a new Pentagon report released Thursday.
It comes one day after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta vowed to reduce the number of sexual assaults within the military, calling the numbers “unacceptable.” He announced that the Pentagon was preparing a series of new initiatives in an effort to try to curb the assaults.
While the measures that Mr. Panetta announced this week were widely welcomed, some democratic lawmakers pointed out that many of the newly-announced initiatives were already slated to go into effect with a law passed by Congress late last year. Others warned that the announced steps did not go far enough to combat the fast-growing problem.
The rate of violent sexual crime has increased 64 percent since 2006 according to the US Army report, which noted that “rape, sexual assault, and forcible sodomy were the most frequent violent sex crimes committed in 2011.”
While women comprise 14 percent of the Army ranks, they account for 95 percent of all sex crime victims.
The study warns that reports of crimes such as forcible sodomy may increase among males in the coming year with the repeal of the law that barred openly gay troops from serving in the military. “Now victims may be more likely to report sexual offenses in the absence of the former Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy,” since troops no longer have to fear being removed from the military if it is discovered that they are gay.
At the time of the study's publication, “There were no discernible trends regarding same gender sex crimes.”
Even in the face of increasing rates of rape and aggravated assault in the military, Mr. Panetta emphasized that “we assume this is a very underreported crime,” and that incidents of sexual assault are roughly six times as high as reports of the crime. Last year there were 3,191 reports of sexual assault throughout the US military, but Panetta said that, realistically, the estimate for assaults “actually is closer to 19,000.”
A recent military investigation found that many victims of sexual assault say they do not report the crimes because they do not believe the perpetrators will be prosecuted. For this reason, Panetta announced a plan to better train military lawyers in prosecuting sex crimes.
The Pentagon's new initiatives also call for more standardized training for the military's sexual assault response coordinators (known as SARCs). Panetta emphasized that the military will now keep records of sexual assault on file longer to aid in prosecution, and will also transfer troops who have been sexually assaulted to new units.
While these steps are all positive, they were also mandated by law in the Defense Authorization Bill passed last month, noted Rep. Niki Tsongas (D) of Massachusetts, in a statement on the heels of the Panetta press conference.
Rep. Jackie Speier (D) of California for her part praised a provision that will now allow military spouses to have the same access to confidentiality and treatment within the military system, but warned that the announced policies “are not bold enough.”
Unit commanders “continue to have complete and total discretion over incidents of assault in their unit,” Representative Speier said in a statement. “A commander can choose to investigate a case or sweep it under the rug.”
Speier has proposed a bill that would establish an independent body to investigate and prosecute military sexual assault cases. “By doing so, it removes the inherent conflict of interest that exists in a command and control environment,” she said.
General Peter Chiarelli, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, who shepherded the Army's study released Thursday, said that one reason sex crimes figures may have increased “so dramatically” in the past five years is that troops feel more comfortable coming forward to report the crime.

The Army study indicates that the vast majority (97 percent) of perpetrators “at least casually” know their attacker. Both the victims and perpetrators of sex crimes tend to be among the youngest soldiers.
For that reason, Chiarelli is examining the possibility of reconfiguring barracks housing, which now more closely resemble civilian apartment to offer troops more privacy, but could contribute to security breaches as well. That said, the figures were “bad news,” Chiarelli acknowledged. “We know we've still got a lot of work to do.”
DESIGN drawings have emerged of four potential new models from American cruiser firm Victory, each using a liquid-cooled engine.
Three of the machines appear to share a similar DOHC V-twin engine, along with wheels, forks and swing-arm, but differ in styling and bodywork.
The three drawings are each by a different Victory designer. One is by former Harley designer Richard Christoph, one by ex-Volvo stylist Ryan Black-Macken and a third by Salvador Gonzales.
A fourth drawing, by Greg Brew, deign chief for Victory's parent company Polaris Industries, shows a more traditional-looking cruiser. It appears to have a different engine, using a belt drive on the left instead of the right.
The drawings could signal plans by Victory to encroach more into the territory of Ducati's muscle cruiser, the Diavel, with higher-performance machines.
Indian Motorcycles, also owned by Polaris, last year introduced a new range of traditional American cruisers last year to compete Harley-Davidson.

Ai Weiwei, the once-jailed dissident who was served notice for $2.4 million dollars in tax fines by China, has been getting a flood of donations (some in paper airplane form) to help pay off the steep bill, the artist told multiple news outlets. "More than 20,000 people have together contributed at least $840,000 since Tuesday, when tax officials gave Mr. Ai 15 days to come up with an amount that was more than three times the sum he was accused of evading in taxes," The New York Times reported, noting that the artist only wanted to accept smaller donations and deemed the money "as loans that he will repay."
The contributions, as Agence France-Presse reports, have been through online bank transfers and even from people throwing money over the wall of his courtyard. "Every morning we have to pick up the money thrown into the courtyard. Sometimes they are folding it into planes or boats," Ai Weiwei was quoted saying by the AFP. Unfortunately, it seems unclear if this show of support may hit another roadblock, as BBC News notes: "An editorial in China's English-language Global Times newspaper cited unnamed experts as saying the artist could be accused of 'illegal fundraising.'"

Be it hereby ordained by the Board of County Commissioners of Skamania County, WA : Whereas, there is evidence to indicate the possible existence in Skamania County of a nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an ape-like creature or a sub-species of Homo Sapiens; and Whereas, both legend and purported recent sightings and spoor support this possibility, and Whereas, this creature is generally and commonly known as a "Sasquatch", "Yeti", "Bigfoot", or "Giant Hairy ape", and has resulted in an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters, many armed with lethal weapons, and Whereas, the absence of specific laws covering the taking of specimens encourages laxity in the use of firearms and other deadly devices and poses a clear and present threat to the safety and well-being of persons living or traveling within the boundaries of Skamania County as well as to the creatures themselves, Therefore be it resolved that any premeditated, wilful and wanton slaying of such creature shall be deemed a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed Ten A Thousand Dollars ($10,000) and/or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed Five (5) years. Be it further resolved that the situation existing constitutes an emergency and as such this ordinance is effective immediately. ADOPTED this 1st day of April, 1969. The above ordinance was partially repealed and amended in 1984 by Ordinance 1984-2: The ordinance was amended to make the crime a gross misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in the county jail and/or a $1000 fine. The new ordinance also created a million-acre refuge within the County. Board of Commissioners of Skamania County

Sunday Tasmanian 26 May 2002, Page 11 Nowadays the vow is not to tie the knot By Gerard McManus
Australian men are avoiding marriage because of the financial ruin marital break-ups bring.
New figures show that a quarter of all women will never be proposed to as men opt for no-strings-attached casual relationships.
Today 29 per cent of men is likely never to marry and the trend is rising.
And recent Family Court rulings which force men to pay for child support for children that are not their own have only reinforced widespread perceptions of anti-male bias by the court.
There are now more than two million Australian men and women in the lonely hearts club - those 45 years and under who have never married. On current trends the club is likely to double over the next 15 years.
Men are opting for relationships where there is no commitment, no offspring and most of all no danger of long-term financial loss from divorce.
And statistics also show that if a woman wants to marry the worst thing she can do is get a university degree, which pushes out the marriage age and lengthens the odds of never marrying.
University degrees produce the most old maids (almost twice as many women with university degrees are not married at 45 compared with women with no qualifications at all).
Women with diplomas fare almost as badly, ahead of women with basic certificates and those with no qualifications at all.
Women with trade certificates appear to have the best prospects of getting married. Just 5 per cent of tradeswomen aged 45 are not married.
"I think it is wonderful that men are starting to wake up," family law reform campaigner Sylvia Smith said last week. "Why would a young man with a lucrative career risk losing 70 to 80 per cent of his assets by getting married?
"Property settlements are meant to be 50/50 but in the vast majority of cases the result is more like 80/20 towards women."
The Full Bench of the Family Court recently ruled that it had no power to force the Child Support Agency to refund $4290 in overpayments to a Victorian man who discovered by DNA tests that he was not the father of his wife's child.
In another case currently before the Family Court, also in Victoria, a man is seeking repayment of about $40,000 in child support payments after he also discovered that two of the three children he had been supporting for 8 1/2 years turned out through DNA testing not to be his.
The Child Support Agency insists it has no power to refund the money, and Children and Youth Affairs Minister Larry Anthony says he is seeking advice on the matter.
The Family Law Act of 1975 ushered in not only the era of no-fault divorce and high dissolution rates (currently running 46 per cent), but a corresponding trend of an increasing reluctance to marry.
Since 1975 there has been a five-fold growth in the number of men who have never married.
In 1975, 4 per cent or about one in 25 women had never married by the time they reached 45 years of age.
According to the 1996 Census (the 2001 Census figures are due to be released soon), more than one in four women had never married by the age of 45, and this figure is continuing to rise.
Between 1986 and 1996 there was a rise in the number of women living in de facto relationships from 7 per cent to 12 per cent in the 25- to 29-year age group.
However, the proportion of married women fell by 15 per cent so that the proportion of women in 1996 who were coupled in any type of live-in union fell from 67 per cent to 57 per cent.
The number of people getting married is also falling, despite the increasing population. In 2000 there was a decrease of 900 marriages compared with the previous year.
Men and women are also delaying getting married, with the average age of men getting married now 30, and women almost 28.
In 1971 an extraordinary 62 per cent of women aged between 20 and 24 were married. By 1997 this figure had fallen to 13 per cent. Related Articles: How is Mortality Affected by Money, Marriage and Stress?
By Jonathan Gardner, Watson Wyatt, LLP, and Andrew Oswaldi, Department of Economics, Warwick University, March 2004 Marriage is found to be associated with substantially lower rates of mortality, for both men and women. Married men are predicted to be some -7.2 percent less likely to die over the period [ 1993 to 2000 ] than unmarried men. For women, the effect is smaller.
Women married in 1991 are approximately -4.1 percent less likely to die over the period 1993 to 2000 than otherwise similar unmarried women.

From Marxism to Feminism: The planned destruction of the American family
Statement of Bill Wood
FC-8 Hearing on Waste, Fraud, and Abuse July 17, 2003
TESTIMONY FOR THE [US] WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE The planned destruction of the family was part of the communist agenda from its inception by Karl Marx and Frederic Engels. It became government policy in the USSR in about 1917. It was so successful in the USSR that it threatened to destroy society in the USSR. Curiously, while in the 1940s the USSR took steps to repair the damages its family-hostile policies had caused, American communists imported the Soviet agenda for the planned destruction of the family into the USA. It has been and continues to be promoted by left-leaning liberals in the West ever since.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had settled charges against a Florida company and its two top executives for sending more than 42 million unwanted and deceptive text messages to consumers.
Messages sent by the company had promised free gift cards worth up to $1,000, the commission said, but when consumers tried to visit a Web site to collect the prize, they were instead connected to a site that asked for personal information, like Social Security numbers and credit card numbers. It also required them to pay for additional services to receive a gift card.
The company, Rentbro, and its principals, Daniel Pessin and Jacob Engel, both of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., were required to turn over remaining assets and to repay up to $377,321, the amount the business had collected.
The settlement came as part of a sweeping crackdown on text message fraud that the commission announced in March. The agency filed eight cases in February and March against 29 companies and individuals around the country, accusing them of sending text messages with fake offers.

McCain says he won't vote for the Republican bill repealing the Obama health care law. His statement likely deals a fatal blow to the last-gasp GOP measure in a Senate showdown expected next week. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, file)
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. John McCain declared his opposition Friday to the GOP's last-ditch effort to repeal and replace “Obamacare,” dealing a likely death blow to the legislation and, perhaps, to the Republican Party's years of vows to kill the program. It was the second time in three months the 81-year-old McCain emerged as the destroyer of his party's signature promise to voters.
“I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,” McCain said of the bill, co-written by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, his best friend in the Senate, and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. “Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it.”
McCain, who is battling brain cancer in the twilight of a remarkable career, said he could not “in good conscience” vote for the legislation. That all but ensured a major setback for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and appeared likely to deepen rifts between congressional Republicans and a president who has begun making deals with Democrats out of frustration with his own party's failure to turn proposals into laws.
During the election campaign Trump had pledged to quickly kill President Barack Obama's health care program — “It will be easy,” he contended — and he has publicly chided McConnell for not winning passage before now.
With the Arizona senator's defection, there are now two declared GOP “no” votes on the repeal legislation, the other being Rand Paul of Kentucky. With Democrats unanimously opposed, that's the exact number McConnell can afford to lose. But Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said Friday she, too, is leaning against the bill, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was also a possible “no,” making it highly unlikely that McConnell can prevail.
So once again, the GOP seems destined to fail on a campaign promise that every Republican agreed on — right up until the party obtained full control of Congress and the White House this year and was actually in position to follow through.
Trump, speaking at a political rally Friday night in Alabama, called McCain's opposition “sad” and “a horrible, horrible thing” for the Republican Party. But he said he would continue the fight to repeal “Obamacare” even if it meant going back again and again.
“It's a little tougher without McCain's vote, I'll be honest. But we've got some time. We're going to go back,” he said and added: “You can't quit when you have one or two votes short.”
Vice President Mike Pence also said the fight wasn't over. “This is not going to be easy. Some have gone so far as to announce their opposition already,” he said. “President Trump and I are undeterred.”
Graham, too, vowed in a statement to “press on,” and reaffirmed his friendship with McCain.
Up until McCain's announcement Friday, close McConnell allies were still optimistic McCain's relationship with Graham might make the difference.
GOP leaders hoped to bring the legislation to the Senate floor next week. They face a Sept. 30 deadline, at which point special rules that prevent a Democratic filibuster will expire.
Democrats hailed McCain's announcement and pledged to commit to the bipartisan process he sought. GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington have been working on a package of limited legislative fixes to the “Obamacare” marketplaces.
“John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “I have assured Sen. McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process.”
The Graham-Cassidy bill would repeal major pillars of Obama's law, replacing them with block grants to states to design their own programs. Major medical groups are opposed, saying millions would lose insurance coverage and protections, and a bipartisan group of governors also has announced opposition.
Yet Republican congressional leaders, goaded by GOP voters and the president himself, were determined to give it one last try. Trump spent much of August needling McConnell for his failure to pass a repeal bill, and Republican lawmakers back home during Congress' summer recess heard repeatedly from voters angered that after seven years of promises to get rid of “Obamacare,” the party had not delivered.
The House passed its own repeal bill back in May, prompting Trump to convene a Rose Garden celebration, which soon began to look premature.
After the Senate failed in several attempts in July, the legislation looked dead. But Cassidy kept at it with his state-focused approach, and the effort caught new life in recent weeks as the deadline neared. Trump pushed hard, hungry for a win.
Trump tweeted Friday morning that “Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as ‘the Republican who saved ObamaCare.'”
On the other side, late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose son was born with a heart defect, got considerable attention when he criticized the new repeal effort at length on his show and said the Republicans were lying about what their new program would cover. In a tweet Friday, he thanked McCain “for being a hero again and again and now AGAIN.”
The bill would get rid of unpopular mandates for people to carry insurance or face penalties. It would repeal the financing for Obama's health insurance expansion and create a big pot of money states could tap to set up their own programs, with less federal oversight. It would also limit spending for Medicaid, the federal-state program that now covers more than 70 million low-income people. Insurance rules that protect people with pre-existing conditions could be loosened through state waivers.
Over time, the legislation would significantly reduce federal health care dollars now flowing to the states. But McConnell had little margin for error in a Senate split 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats, and could lose only two votes, counting on Pence to break the tie.

Britain's booziest duck that became a celebrity for downing pints in his local pub has been seriously injured - in a brawl with a DOG.
The bird - called Star - is well known for waddling around his favourite inns wearing a bow tie and swigging ale from a glass.
The booze-loving duck and his handler Barrie Hayman are a regular sight in their local taverns - some of which even give Star his own stool.
But Star's drinking days could be over after an altercation with a dog after returning from his favourite watering-hole The Old Courthouse Inn.
Star came to blows and lost out to pooch Meggie - which also belongs to Star's owner Barrie.
They had a Mexican stand-off and stared each other out before the hound pounced - leaving the duck with his bottom beak split down the middle.
Barrie, 69, says that the dog tired of the Indian Runner duck's drunken antics and Star finally ''pushed his luck too far''.
He rushed the beer-loving avian to the vets where he was put on painkillers and said he was praying his beloved duck would make a full recovery.
Barrie, of Chulmleigh, Devon, said: "Star pushed his luck too far and Meggie snapped - splitting Star's bottom beak right down the middle.
"He gave her a stare, then promptly stood on her back. It was not pretty and not nice. We were so scared we would lose Star."
Grandfather-of-one Barrie, a former scuba diving instructor in Australia, lives with wife Sue, and plucked Star from the incubator in 2011 when he was just days old.
As a chick Barrie walked round with Star in his top pocket but after he grew up he developed a taste for real ale and now often goes down to the local with his owner.
But Barrie said Star's drinking days were almost numbered.
He said: "He had to be rushed to the vets and go under anaesthetic, which is always risky and could go either way with ducks and other small animals.
"Thankfully our Star is a tough cookie and it looks like he came out okay, not sure we came out quite as well.
"We had hours and hours of stress and waiting around.The vets are really pleased with his progress. He seems to be bouncing back nicely which is good."
Barrie was concerned the injury would leave Star with a lisp that would put his performance career in jeopardy - as the duo regularly team up to raise hundreds of pounds for charity with their unique street double act.
But vets have reassured Barrie that Star should be able to take to the stage again and the injury will not affect the duck's dulcet tones.
He said: "He just won't leave me and so we go everywhere together. I've not trained him to follow me. He just seems to like it and he is one fantastic duck.
"He loves to come to the pub, where everyone loves him. He is such a personality and attracts so much attention."
Star even has his own Facebook page under the name Star Hayman.
It reads: "I am an Indian Runner Duck. My daddy is my best friend. I love wriggly worms and I follow my dad everywhere. I watch TV with him, especially rugby, and I even share his beer."
The 1 through 4 drops are mostly for utility, defense, mana ramping, and harassing the opponent if they are moving slow. This deck is not designed to be used in a set with a lot of field wipes. Try to go as wide as possible as use the big beefy brawlers to secure the board position. Sideboard in a couple of removal spells only if the deck is getting overpowered. If the deck is getting outpaced, trade out a couple of the fatties for the smaller creatures.----Highlights----Best brawler in the deck. It's big and chops away at the opponent's board position everytime it attacks.Easy to protect since it regenerates itself. Also dramatically increases the number of creatures on the board and hits for a nice unhealthy amount. The blighted woodland comes in handy since we would rather not sacrifice a creature to regenerate this thing unless absolutely necessary.The one colorless mana ramping ability is far more valuable than it appears, especially since it can hit the field so early.Amazing board control and excellent blocker. Helps a lot if you are getting overpowered. Ironically, the 2 power makes her a decent attacker as well.2 drop 4/5 in many cases, otherwise he's still a good blocker with vigilance . I actually got the Awakening off of Sheer Drop which yielded a 5/5 land creature because of Sylvan Advocate Outstanding card in almost any creature deck. Gain 6 life at instant speed for 3 manas is broken on it's own, but that's not enough so grab one of your beatsicks out of your graveyard too.Outstanding combat trick in draft. Opponent rarely sees it comming because it untaps the creature as well. This card often causes the opponent to loose a creature while getting nothing in return.----Worth Mention----Figured i should explain why this little shithead is in here. She's a 1 drop which is imparitive for a deck that tries to go as wide as possible. She's one of the best 1 drops in white because she has a bit of late game potential as well. Let's not forget she's an ally for the Cohorts to use.Kor Skyclimber:In most games, against well built decks, she will either be the only one getting decent damage in, or another option for blocking flyers.Makes life rediculously hard for tempo decks. Cliffside lookout starts to look a lot better when this guy is on the field too.For those wondering why this is here: It's draft, I work with what i'm given. This deck doesn't exile a damn thing EVER, which makes his ability a massive buzzkill. However, he's still HUGE and I needed a big dumb knuckle cruncher to fill this slot, so there he is.Just an extra body to go against well made control decks. Hedron Crawler and Blighted woodland can supply colorless mana if they show up, otherwise, either make due with the 2/2 or sac' some eldrazi scions to get it's ability off.Great card to take advantage of the creature swarm if you get it.

WOULD-BE Mars colonist and space-flight entrepreneur Elon Musk often jokes that he wants “to die on Mars, but not on impact”.
He probably doesn't mean starve to death, though. He'll have to hope some horticultural research at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen pays off, in which case he and other off-planet pioneers will at least have plenty of salad to munch on.
Pictured here under the warm red glow of a water-cooled, LED-based lighting system, “space lettuce” is growing in an aeroponic greenhouse module designed for use on the moon or Mars. The plants are suspended from soil-free trays and their dangling roots sprayed with nutrients for 20 seconds every 2 minutes.

LEDs are needed because the sunlight on Mars is too weak to fuel photosynthesis. “On the moon we would most likely use artificial light too,” says DLR engineer Daniel Schubert. “It makes more sense that way because the lunar night is about 14 Earth days long.”
The plant's healthy root system is visible both in Schubert's hand and, below, in normal light.
For colonists, growing plants will be a key home comfort, but it's a two-way deal: astronauts will have to nourish their salad crops with their own waste fluids. Each greenhouse module will scavenge chemicals from astronaut urine to produce fertiliser. The system will be tested in the hostile wastes of Antarctica in 2016.

Ilya Kovalchuk is the latest, highest-profile person to opt for victim-blaming in the Semyon Varlamov case.
Kovalchuk told Russia's R-Sport (via the Denver Post) that Varlamov and Evgeniya Vavrinyuk, his ex-girlfriend and the woman who filed assault charges against him should patch things up.
"I hope to God it all pans out well and maybe he can somehow reach an agreement with his princess and finally she'd be given a green card, which she really wants,” said Kovalchuk, who's in his first season with KHL St. Petersburg after several years of stardom in the NHL.
Kovalchuk is entitled to support his friend (and presumed Olympic teammate), but facts are facts: Varlamov, a goalie for the Colorado Avalanche, has indeed been charged with domestic abuse by a district attorney, and will enter his plea in court on Jan. 22. The situation is not minor, and it shouldn't be minimized by Kovalchuk or anyone else.
It's also the latest instance of a Russian hockey figure slagging Vavrinyuk, which is pretty gross. National team general manager Alexei Kasatonov said last month that Varlamov is playing too well to be guilty.
“Semyon's in good form now, continuing to show that he's one of the best goaltenders in the NHL and showing with his game that the truth is on his side, Kasatonov said. "(Varlamov) is not that kind of guy and would not be capable of such a dirty deed."
Also, regardless of what happened, it seems like a bad idea for Varlamov and Vavrinyuk to get back together. But that's not anyone else's business, we suppose.
Varlamov could face a sentence ranging from probation to two years in jail and deportation if convicted. He is free on $5,000 bond and has been traveling and playing with the team. If the case is not settled (by a plea bargain, say) before the Sochi Winter Olympics start on Feb. 7, Varlamov could petition the court to allow him to travel to Russia for the games.
If he does make it to the Olympics—and boy, would that make Kovalchuk and Co. happy—he'd likely start in goal. He's 13-8-0 with a .922 save percentage and 2.46 goals-against average. Sergei Bobrovsky, Varlamov's chief competition for the job, will miss the next few weeks with a knee injury.
In the quest to produce nuclear fusion energy, researchers from the DIII-D National Fusion Facility have recently confirmed long-standing theoretical predictions that performance, efficiency and reliability are simultaneously obtained in tokamaks, the leading magnetic confinement fusion device, operating at their performance limits. Experiments designed to test these predictions have successfully demonstrated the interaction of these conditions.
These new findings will be presented at the American Physical Society -- Division of Plasma Physics 51st annual meeting, November 2-6, at the Atlanta Hyatt Regency Hotel.
Nuclear fusion energy has kept the sun burning for billions of years. When nuclear fusion occurs in a laboratory, power performance is determined by the temperature and density achieved by plasma, an ionized gas formed when hydrogen isotopes are heated to temperatures of over 10 million degrees Celsius. Because of these extreme temperatures, the hot plasma is confined by magnetic fields in a "tokamak", a donut-shaped device surrounded by powerful electromagnets.
Over the past decade, scientists have made tremendous progress toward realizing high pressures for increasingly long periods. A key element of recent experiments is the confirmation of theoretical predictions that one can rely on the walls of the tokamak chamber to improve plasma stability at high pressure.
Once plasma becomes sufficiently hot and dense, fusion occurs, producing large quantities of high-energy helium ions (known as alpha particles). For optimal efficiency, this self-generated heat must be well contained within the tokamak's "magnetic bottle." Models have predicted that the heat loss from the tokamak due to turbulence is quite sensitive to the exact details of the magnetic field configurations. Researchers recently found that turbulence is minimized in the same configuration necessary for achieving the highest pressures. Hence, performance and efficiency can be synergistic.
Interestingly, turbulent eddies in the plasma can also affect plasma heating by high-energy helium nuclei formed by the fusion of hydrogen atoms. Recent theoretical work suggests that these energetic particles not only feel turbulence differently, but can also stir up large eddies of their own. While these fine-scale turbulent eddies are predicted to cause negligibly small transport of energetic alpha particles, the new large eddies can increase this transport substantially. As the alpha particles cool, their transport becomes similar to the background level.
For high reliability, a tokamak needs to sustain the hot and dense plasma for as long as possible. Recent work has shown that tokamak plasmas can be induced to exhibit the following relationships: higher pressure => more self-generated electrical currents that help control the plasma => less reliance on external controls => longer pulse (including potentially steady-state) operation => higher reliability.
After decades of effort to improve the behavior and output of fusion plasmas, scientists are discovering that nature may actually be so kind as to simultaneously allow high performance (lots of electricity!), optimal efficiency (affordable!), and high reliability (the electrical outlet will always work!) in the design of future power plants.

Every little helps:
For years, clean energy developers could look to only a small handful of corporations as project partners or customers for their power. Mostly, there was Google, and a few other high-tech companies that worked directly with wind and solar developers to help green their energy use.
Now, that appears to be changing. On Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard announced a 12-year contract to buy 112 megawatts from a wind farm that SunEdison is expanding in Texas. That is enough, HP said, to operate its data centers there, the equivalent of powering 42,600 homes each year.
The deal follows a flurry of other recent agreements. In February, Kaiser Permanente announced a 20-year contract to buy 153 megawatts of wind and solar power from two California farms. A month later, Dow Chemical said that it would buy 200 megawatts of wind power in Texas.
And last week, Amazon Web Services said that it was contracting with Iberdrola Renewables to build and operate a 208-megawatt wind farm in North Carolina, the state's first at utility scale.
These days, Brian Cummins is riding high. The jittery, paragraph-long-sentence-slinging wonk of a Cleveland City councilman shows up to interviews on a red BMW motorcycle. He finally got his first committee chairmanship last year. He even has a pet project: getting government to solve problems with technology. That's a tall order in a city with a website that's as mid-'90s as a pair of wide-leg JNCO Jeans. But Cummins has seen the shining light of modernity.
He just had to meet Candace Faber, Seattle's first civic technology advocate, to find it. “She's got a wonderful title,” he says.
When Faber visited Cleveland last year, Cummins learned how Seattle was using publicly accessible data and a tech-friendly philosophy to deliver better city services. Faber, for instance, started Hack to End Homelessness, a hackathon that produced an app to help homeless youth find shelters.
“We don't have [that position],” says Cummins. “I frankly don't see us getting that unfortunately, until there's a major change in culture within the administration.”
Across the country cities are experimenting with opening up data to the public. In Pittsburgh, for instance, the University of Pittsburgh, city and county government partnered to put data such as 311 call lists and sheriff's sales online.
The message coming out of Cleveland City Hall, meanwhile, is one of shrugging Luddism and unresponsive bureaucracy. City leaders praise corporations like IBM, which signed a lease for downtown office space last year, while rejecting the very innovation those tech firms embody. They hold up Cleveland as a model of municipal government, even as workaday public records requests languish for weeks or months.
Ambitious civic hackers are working around the problems. But if that keeps up, those techies won't find their feet. Worse still, the city will miss a chance to show off an organically grown culture of innovation. Yet again we'll start the race 50 yards behind.
Cleveland's leaders, from the mayor on down, need to decide: Is Cleveland actually the 21st-century city they say it is?
As Cleveland dawdles, another Ohio city is leading. Cincinnati recently launched the CincyInsights hub, where citizens can view a map of all police, ambulance and fire calls, updated daily and tallied for the entire year.
To show the impact of the heroin epidemic, Cincinnati maps the location of every overdose publicly, every day. Want to see how much crime there is in a neighborhood or on your street? Just input the address. During snowstorms, residents can track where snowplows are working too with a live Google map, updated every 10 minutes.
By contrast, to build a map of potholes in his ward during a few months in 2014, Cummins had to make his own Excel spreadsheet. He and his assistant, Taylor Henschel, combined records of calls into his office with those to the city's 311 line. They ended up with 28 different spreadsheets which they compiled into one. With that hacked-together data, they managed to crunch out a map.
As far as Cummins can tell, it was the first time anyone in city government had tried to make a comprehensive data set of calls for pothole service. “Obviously, there wasn't any indication that this data was being used in any way, shape or form for performance measures,” he says. And figuring out when the snowplow will come? A snowball has better odds in July.
By necessity, Cleveland's civic tech movement is making headway outside City Hall. Hack Cleveland created a digitized version of the consent decree between the Justice Department and city. And Open Cleveland, a local affiliate of national civic tech nonprofit Code for America, began meeting in 2014.
Will Skora, co-founder of the volunteer group, was spurred to action after trying to find a recycling drop-off spot on the city website. “It was a pain to find,” says Skora. “The city's website, frankly, was atrocious.”
Within a week he had rallied about 12 Twitter followers. They quickly got to work.
In early 2015, Open Cleveland launched ClevelandLots, an online tool where residents could apply to buy vacant lots adjacent to their homes. Open Cleveland digitized the paper process. But the project fell apart when the city land bank couldn't accommodate it. “It ultimately wasn't adopted,” says Skora.
The group's next project was a map of where to get free flu shots. That fell apart too after the point person in the city health department left for another job, says Skora. They have since pursued projects that require less direct city involvement. The most fruitful one is an attempt to digitize the City Record.
Most of the city's legislative work, such as passing ordinances and allocating money, is summarized in the City Record, an arcane-looking publication available online as a massive set of PDFs with tiny type.
It's nearly impossible to find anything buried in the texts. Even the experts have trouble, which Open Cleveland discovered after staffers at the council clerk's office offered the group a how-to demonstration.
“For instance, if they wanted to find out when the LGBT legislation was passed, they had to go to Cleveland.com,“ says Skora. Staffers determine the date of when something was passed using such sources before manually looking it up in the record.
When even city employees use a jury-rigged system, the public doesn't stand a chance. So Open Cleveland is making an online tool to make the City Record searchable. It's due out in late February or March.
DigitalC, the descendent of local high-speed connectivity nonprofit OneCommunity, funded the City Record tool with $10,000 won as part of a contest. In November, DigitalC also launched the Civic Insights Hub, an online repository for Northeast Ohio data. It contains more than 500 data sets and resources, with more added at the suggestion of an advisory panel that meets monthly. It's publicly available.
The goal is to get the data into the hands of programmers and analysts to make apps and software that an average citizen could use, says Dean Trilling, senior vice president for data-driven solutions at DigitalC.
Likewise, providing data for community-oriented organizations and researchers is the driving force behind Cleveland's oldest data archive. The NEOCANDO system, run by Case Western Reserve University, has served up data from myriad sources since 1992. A quick registration gets you reams of useful statistics. But the data is raw and unintelligible to the average person.
“Most people don't want to have to figure out how to use advanced analytics and predictive modeling tools,” says Trilling. ”If we can get people simple applications that can help them make decisions, and everything's under the covers, that's great.”
We won't get the full range of those cool, useful apps if the city isn't willing to be an active partner. City leaders will have to buck decades of precedent, their own instincts and budgetary limitations. They'll also have to come to terms with the greater accountability that open data brings.
“Open data definitely facilitates a culture change,” says Skora. “And generally, in Cleveland, culture change isn't always welcomed or easy.”
Our leaders often speak glowingly of a revival Cleveland fueled by innovation. It's time they lived up to their words.
Wentworth Cheswell (11 April 1746 – 8 March 1817) was an American assessor, auditor, Justice of the Peace, teacher and Revolutionary War veteran in Newmarket, New Hampshire. He was of mixed race, one-quarter African and three-quarters European, and listed in the census as white. Elected as town constable in 1768, he was elected to other positions, serving in local government every year but one until his death.
Cheswell is considered by George Mason University to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States.[1] Around the time of his marriage, Wentworth purchased a plot of land from his father Hopestill. His grandfather Richard is believed to be the first African American in New Hampshire to own land. A deed shows that Richard purchased 20 acres from the Hilton grant in 1717. In 1801, Wentworth was among the founders of the first library in the town and provided in his will for public access to his personal library.

Early life and education [ edit ]
Wentworth was the only child born in Newmarket, New Hampshire to Hopestill Cheswill, a free black man of biracial ancestry, and his wife, Katherine (Keniston) Cheswill, a white woman. The senior Cheswill was a master housewright and carpenter who worked mostly in the thriving city of Portsmouth. Among other projects, Cheswill helped to build the Bell Tavern in 1743 on Congress Street and the John Paul Jones House, originally owned by Captain Gregory Purcell and now a designated National Historic Landmark. The Jones house was an example of classic mid-eighteenth century elite housing.[2] The Jones House for years served (and continues to) as the Portsmouth Historical Society Museum.[3] Cheswill also built the Samuel Langdon House, which was moved to Sturbridge Village; it is a central exhibit demonstrating 18th century construction technology.[3]
Hopestill Cheswill was born free to a white mother and Richard Cheswill, an indentured black laborer in Exeter, New Hampshire, who was the first Cheswill recorded in New England.[3] (Because his mother was free, the boy was free, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children followed the mother's status, which was incorporated into slave law in the colonies.) After completing his servitude, Richard Cheswill purchased 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land from the Hilton Grant. The deed, dated 18 October 1717, is the earliest-known deed showing land ownership by a black man in present-day New Hampshire. The land was located in what was to become the town of Newmarket. Hopestill was the only known child of this union.[2]
Hopestill Cheswill earned enough as a housewright to purchase a total of more than 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land between 1773 and 1749, which he farmed while working as a housewright. Later, he had part ownership of a sawmill and stream in Durham as well as "mill privilege" at another falls, to handle his need for lumber.[2] His prosperity helped provide for his son's education.[2]
He sent his son Wentworth to Governor Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts.[3] There the youth studied with the Harvard graduate William Moody,[2] who taught the classical subjects of Latin and Greek, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as swimming and horsemanship.
As Erik Tuveson noted in his master's thesis on the first three generations of Cheswills, the youth's education was
an unusual privilege for a country boy of that time. Few people of the colonial era were formally educated, mostly due to cost and lack of inexpensive public schooling. Education of any formal sort in colonial New England carried a significant degree of elite social status.[3]
Early career [ edit ]
After completing his education, Wentworth Cheswill returned to Newmarket to become a schoolmaster. In 1765, he purchased his first parcel of land from his father. By early 1767, he was an established landowner with more than 30 acres and held a pew in the meetinghouse.[2] By 1770, he owned 114 acres.[4]
Cheswill was first elected to public office in 1768 as the town constable, and later was elected to local offices every year (except for 1788) until his death in 1817, to positions such as town selectman, auditor, assessor, and others.[4] George Mason University in Virginia has recently (2008) declared Wentworth Cheswill to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States. He preceded Alexander Twilight of Vermont (1836), Joseph Hayne Rainey of South Carolina (1870), and John Mercer Langston of Virginia (1888) for the title.
Marriage and family [ edit ]
Cheswill married 17-year-old Mary Davis of Durham, New Hampshire on 13 September 1767. Eleven months later, the first of their 13 children was born.[5] Their children were Paul (1768), Thomas (1770), Samuel (1772), Sarah (1774), Mary (1775), Elizabeth (1778), Nancy (1780), Mehitable (1782), William (1785), Daughter {unknown} (1785), Martha (1788), Daughter {unknown} (1792), and Abigail (1792).
Son Thomas Cheswill attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire and later became a deacon. Thomas' wife and children remained in Newmarket, and are buried in Riverside Cemetery.[4]
Revolutionary War [ edit ]
During the American Revolutionary War, the citizens of Newmarket, including Cheswill, were unequivocally for the patriotic cause. In April 1776, along with 162 other Newmarket men, Cheswill signed the Association Test. Patriots collected signatures of people opposed to what they considered the hostile actions by the British fleets and armies. The abundance of the returns gave the signers of the United States Declaration of Independence assurance that their acts would be sanctioned and upheld by most of the colonists.
He was elected town messenger for the Committee of Safety, which entrusted him to carry news to and from the Provincial Committee at Exeter. On 13 December 1774, Paul Revere was dispatched to Portsmouth to warn the town that the British warships, frigate Scarborough and the sloop of war Canseau, were on their way to reinforce Ft. William and Mary and seize it's powder and arms. When Portsmouth asked for help from neighboring communities, Newmarket held a town meeting to decide on their response. Townsmen voted to send 30 armed men to Portsmouth. Cheswell rode to Exeter to receive instructions from the Provincial committee on where the men were to be sent. He was also with the party which built rafts to defend Portsmouth Harbor.
On the morning of 14 December 1774 John Langdon made his way through Portsmouth with a drummer, collecting a crowd to descend on the fort. Several hundred men responded to his call, setting out for the Castle by way of the Piscataqua River.The colonists removed 100 barrels of gun powder, light cannons, and small arms. These supplies captured by Patriots were later used by New Hampshire's forces against the British military, including at the Siege of Boston.
As a private Cheswill served under Langdon in a select company called "Langdon's Company of Light Horse Volunteers", which helped to bolster the Continental Army at the Saratoga campaign. Langdon's company of Light Horse Volunteers made the 250-mile march to Saratoga, New York, to join with the Continental Army under General Horatio Gates, defeating British General Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga, which was the first major American victory in the Revolution. Cheswill's only military service ended 31 October 1777. As with many other men, he served for a limited time, as his family was dependent on him for support.
Local leader [ edit ]
After his service in the war, Cheswill returned to Newmarket and continued his work in town affairs. He also ran a store next to the school house. Cheswill supported his family as a teacher, and was elected and appointed to serve in local government for all but one year of the remainder of his life, as selectman, auditor, assessor, scrivener, and other roles.[4] In 1778, Cheswill was elected to the convention to draft New Hampshire's first constitution, but he was unable to attend.[6]
He was interested in artifacts from the town and wrote about his studies; he has been called the first archeologist in New Hampshire for his work. The scholars W. Dennis Chesley and Mary B. Mcallister have said, "Cheswill's writings clearly contain the seeds of modern archaeological theory. His eighteenth century fieldwork and reports, limited though they were, justify calling him New Hampshire's first archaeologist."[7]
In 1801, Cheswill and other men established the first library in Newmarket, the Newmarket Social Library. Of the estates of men who started the library, Cheswill's was valued the highest at over $13,000. In his will he stated,
I also order and direct that my Library and collection of Manuscripts be kept safe and together…if any should desire the use of any of the books and give caution to return the same again in reasonable time, they may be lent out to them, provided that only one book be out of said Library in the hands of any one at the same time.[5]
Cheswill was a self-appointed town historian. As scrivener, he copied many of the town records from 1727, including two regional Congregational Church meetings. He collected stories and took notes of town events as they occurred. Jeremy Belknap, who wrote a three-volume History of New Hampshire, quoted Cheswell more than once at length in his work, and credited him for his local histories. They corresponded several times.
In 1805, he was elected as the Justice of the Peace for Rockingham County. In that position, he executed deeds, wills, and legal documents, and was a justice in the trial of causes. He served as Justice until typhus fever caused his death in 1817.[4]
In 1820, shortly after Cheswill died, the New Hampshire Senator David L. Morril used him as a positive example of the contributions of mixed-race persons in a speech to the United States Congress regarding the negative effects of discriminatory racial legislation. Morril opposed a bill to forbid mulatto persons to become citizens of Missouri. In his speech Morril noted,
"In New Hampshire there was a yellow man by the name of Cheswell [sic], who, with his family, were respectable in points of abilities, property and character. He held some of the first offices in the town in which he resided, was appointed Justice of the Peace for that county, and was perfectly competent to perform with ability all the duties of his various offices in the most prompt, accurate, and acceptable manner." Angrily, Morril added, "But this family are forbidden to enter and live in Missouri."[8]
(Note: Cheswell was listed as white on the census, but Morril's reference suggests he was considered mulatto by some contemporaries.[9])
On 8 March 1817, Wentworth Cheswill died from typhus fever, a month before his 71st birthday. In his will, he requested that "the burying place in the orchard near my dwelling house be fenced with rocks, as I have laid out (if I should not live to finish it) and grave stones be provided for the graves therein…."[citation needed]
His daughter Martha, as his last surviving heir, provided the following in her will:
the burying yard at my farm as now fenced in, for a burying place for all my connections and their descendants forever…on the express condition that they and their heirs and assigns shall forever maintain and support the fence around said burying yard in as good condition as it now is.[citation needed]
Legacy [ edit ]
Wentworth's grandfather, Richard Cheswell, a former slave of African ancestry, is the first known resident by that surname in New England; all descendants share his African ancestry, as well as that of his English wife. PBS Frontline discussed the Cheswell family as among mixed-race American families in Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, associated with its program Secret Daughter (1996), based on June Cross' memoir. [3]
associated with its program (1996), based on June Cross' memoir. In 2006, Cheswell descendants and other New England residents raised funds to restore or replicate the Cheswell gravestones. In addition, they and members of the New Hampshire Old Graveyard Association worked to clean up the old Cheswell gravesite.[10] Some Cheswell descendants, whose families have identified as white for many generations, discovered their connection to the Cheswells and African-American heritage due to publicity in 2002 and following years of research about Wentworth Cheswell done by Rich Alperin, a local resident.[4] He also brought notice to an unpublished master's thesis by Erik R. Tuveson about the first three generations of Cheswells and other people of color in New Hampshire. It is available at the University of New Hampshire.[4][10]

Over at The Daily Beast (disclosure: I'm a columnist there), Andrew Kirell struggles valiantly to make "the libertarian case for Bernie Sanders," going so far as to enlist some of the greatest minds of this and every other era and still coming up with bupkis.
The logic goes: With a Republican-controlled Congress—or one remotely close to its current makeup—President Sanders would have a tough time getting his most radical economic policies passed, leaving him to fight for the civil liberties causes that matter to liberals and libertarians alike: e.g., reforms to the criminal justice system, the ongoing drug war, and the government's surveillance efforts. In other words, backing a Sanders presidency would mean wagering that Sanders' most left-wing economic policies wouldn't come to fruition. And that he'd pull a conservative Congress to the left on civil liberties issues, with the help of cross-partisan allies like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee.
The Cato Institute's David Boaz notes that we've already got a Democratic president and a Republican Congress and this stuff isn't happening. True, true, but come on, Barack Obama is a barely contained drug warrior who insists against evidence that he can't reschedule marijuana, dragged his feet on criminal justice until recently, is quite hawkish (tripled troop strength in Afghanistan, bombed Libya, etc.), and ginned up a secret kill list while expanding Bush-era surveillance programs. Sanders is at least arguably not as equally bad on all those same issues.
Kirell then quotes me (accurately!) thus:
“You could do worse than having Bernie Sanders in the White House,” [Gillespie] admitted. “The things that he would be able to direct in the White House would accord with libertarian values. Being a commander-in-chief, he would minister our foreign policy much differently than Obama or Bush; he would be much more likely change the scheduling for marijuana, which the president can do; and he'd be in a much better position to push criminal justice reform.”
I stand by every jot and tittle! And for those of you who disagree (including the foul-mouthed bravehearts who have already contacted me via email, carrier pigeon, and pneumatic tubes), let me simply ask: Hillary Clinton would be worse, wouldn't she? Suffice it to say that noting you could do worse than Sanders is not an endorsement or an affirmation of the eminent flavored-deodorant critic from Vermont. By the end of his piece, in fact, Kirell even gives up on the idea that libertarians—that is, believers in limited government, economic freedom, and civil liberties—are going to feel the bern anytime soon unless they have the clap.
Which is all too true. As is this quote from Terry Michael, a former press secretary of the Democratic National Committee turned "libertarian Democrat" (and occasional Reason contributor):
“All we've got left are neoconservatives, social conservatives, and crony capitalists... I'd love to hear anyone tell me that any of the current crop of Republicans are actually libertarian on foreign policy or social issues or even many economic issues.”
Read the full article here.
So does this mean that libertarians are stuck twiddling their thumbs or voting Libertarian when it comes to the 2016 election? No (though there's certainly nothing wrong with going LP, as I've done for virtually my entire voting life).
In a recent Reason piece about Ted Cruz trying to gather up Rand Paul's supporters, Boaz notes
David Kirby and I found that 13 to 15 percent of American voters hold libertarian values on a range of questions. In three separate analyses Kirby found that libertarian strength among Republican voters had risen to between 34 and 41 percent by 2012. Paul's father, Rep. Ron Paul, garnered 21 percent in the Iowa caucuses and 23 percent in New Hampshire, not far off that mark.
How do we mass these votes, which are truly up for grabs in this and virtually every national election, and force major-party presidential candidates to pay attention to the top concerns of the libertarian electorate? The country is moving libertarian in terms of commercial life, cultural life, and personal life, where not only massive choice already exists but is growing stronger every day. As important, Americans are more comfortable with the idea of people having different choices and leading different lifestyles. Matt Welch and I document all these trends in The Declaration of Independents, which flowed from the observation that people are evacuating partisan politics as an identity and place of meaning in their lives.
In the near term—certainly in terms of major-party candidates still running for president this time around—the libertarian pickings are between slim and none. Which isn't to say that libertarian concerns aren't. At the state level, pot legalization, school choice, and public-pension reform proceed apace. At the national level, the wheels are coming off major entitlement programs and even with high levels of defense spending, the nation is in no mood to keep soldiering on in wars we've already lost. Once the Democratic and Republican nominees are selected and have locked in their party's faithful, that 15 percent (or more) of Americans who believe in social tolerance and fiscal responsibility will be the ones who decide November's election. And there's little doubt that the libertarian vote will force the Republicans to moderate their culture-war whoops and the Democrats to ease up on their redistrubitionist fantasies.
At the recent excavations at the Ptolemaic-Roman site in Quesna, Monufiya city, a group of researchers discovered two individuals' skeletons, who might have been eunuchs, in 151 interments, according to a report released by Forbes.
The team of archaeologists, comprised of Scott Haddow from the University of Bordeaux, Sonia Zakrzwski from the University of Southampton and Joanne Rowland from the University of Edinburgh, presented their "unusual" findings at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists conference last week.
The team said the method in which the two skeletons were buried and the skeletal irregularities, including above-average height, might indicate a congenital condition rather than castration.
According to the report, Haddow and his colleagues began to suspect these individuals that they were possibly eunuchs because castration before the onset of puberty typically results in people who are tall and slender with broad hips, narrow shoulders, and a sunken chest.
The first skeleton, named B21, was an adolescent of indeterminate sex from the Ptolemaic Era; its burial was oriented differently as the skeleton's head was directed south, rather than oriented north as was typical of that period of time. The researchers noticed that most of the skeleton's bones are extremely immature, including the growth plates of the limb bones which indicates that the person was taller than average, even though they were not fully grown.
The second skeleton B26 was also an adolescent and its sex was not known. It dates back to the Roman Era and was buried in a collective tomb; it was also much taller than average with completely unfused growth plates.
“Although there are few skeletal studies of individuals known to have been castrated, those that exist – such as of the Italian castrati Farinelli and Pacchierotti – also reveal incompletely fused long bones, tall stature, and osteoporosis,” the report said.
Haddow and his colleagues said B21's burial pattern was completely different to the norm, while B26's was smilliar to others. “Both the orientation of the grave and the artifacts included in it may 'reflect societal recognition of this individual's conspicuous intersex status,' which could be the result of pre-pubertal castration but might also reflect a condition such as Klinefelter Syndrome or aromatase deficiency,” the report said.
“Perhaps B26's condition did not result in visibly ambiguous sexual characteristics,” the researchers suggest.
Haddow and colleagues concluded that “the combination of eunuchoid body habitus, unfused epiphyses and osteoporosis can occur as the result of either genetic or culturally induced endocrine disorders. “Until DNA testing is done, though, “it is difficult to establish the etiology of the skeletal features observed in the affected Quesna individuals with any degree of certainty,” the report said.
Gas station won't post sky-high prices, so artist does
The owners of Sun Gas didn't give up their long-running fight with City Hall and post their $5.79-a-gallon price — an Orlando artist did it for them.
For about six hours Thursday, motorists near Orlando International Airport could finally see the prices charged at the most expensive gas station in the country.
Performance artist Brian Feldman, known for off-the-wall art, spent nearly six muggy hours in front of the station. Around his neck hung a gas station-style sign with Sun Gas' current prices for a gallon of regular, mid-grade and premium.
"This is an art installation, and I am playing the role of the sign. Hopefully, they'll do the right thing and post their prices. But if they don't, I'll do my best to make sure they get the attention they deserve," said Feldman, who was alternately cursed and praised by passing motorists trying to puzzle out his connection to the station.
Some gave a thumbs-up, and one woman called him a good Samaritan. But others didn't care for the prices and assumed he worked for Sun Gas.
"One guy pulled up and said, 'I'm going to report you guys, expletive, expletive,'" Feldman said.
Feldman, best known locally for jumping off a ladder 366 times in 24 hours in front of City Hall a few years ago, was wading into a feud involving city officials, Sun Gas and another station across the street with sky-high prices, Suncoast Energys.
After numerous consumer complaints, the city passed an ordinance requiring stations near the airport to post prices on signs visible to passing drivers. But the owners of those two stations have defied the regulation and are being fined $250 per day.
They've also sued the city. At the same time Feldman was standing in front of the gas station, lawyers for the city and the two stations were across town arguing the case before a judge.
Attorney Gus Benitez accused the city of exceeding its authority.
"We believe and we contend this is price control," Benitez said. "The city is doing this only to affect the price."
But David King, who represents the city, said the stations are welcome to charge whatever they want. They just have to post it.
"The consumer has a right to know. …They're the ones who are being preyed upon in this area," King said.
Circuit Judge Jose Rodriguez did not issue a ruling in the case Thursday.
Back at Sun Gas, Feldman said a manager didn't appreciate his art, asking where he had parked, perhaps with an eye toward having him towed.
But Feldman wasn't dissuaded. He doesn't own a car.

warns that the 'immense and hidden' crisis in biodiversity has been pushed from centre stage by the climate change debate. He spoke to environmentguardian.co.uk editor
This is an extended extract of a phone interview with biologist, author and conservation campaigner EO Wilson.
The problem of biodiversity loss has been "eased off centre stage" as the spotlight has focused on climate change, according to Professor Edward Wilson, the ecologist described as "Darwin's natural heir".
Biodiversity is one of the hot topics of conversation on this week's regular Science Weekly podcast.
Professor Wilson also discusses conservative religious attitudes to evolution in the US, which he calls "bible literalism".

Boomer Esiason caused quite a stir with his comments about Baltimore Ravens star Ray Lewis during CBS' Super Bowl pregame show on Sunday.
Esiason said he was “not so sure” Lewis “gave us all the answers” regarding a double murder case the linebacker was wrapped up in 13 years ago. His comments were made after CBS aired a taped interview with Lewis and pregame co-host Shannon Sharpe.
Esiason wouldn't back down from the remarks Monday during his WFAN morning-drive radio show with Craig Carton.
He said that Sharpe, who was signed by Baltimore less than one month after the Lewis incident, has “greater insight into that issue than anybody I know.” But Esiason had made his feelings known.
“Now, (Sharpe) will not share that insight with me because he doesn't feel like it's fair, and I understand that 100 percent. But I also told Shannon, I said, ‘I can't sit here again and just allow this to go — somebody has to be a voice of dissent and have the opposite viewpoint,' ” Esiason said.
In the wake of the meeting between the leaders of Russia and Japan, the United States has raised concerns over Tokyo's commitement to anti-Moscow sanctions imposed by G-7 nations.
WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The United States expects the other Group of Seven (G-7) nations including Japan to reject "business as usual" with Russia but would specify whether Tokyo would continue to impose economic sanctions, National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said in a briefing.
"There's a great deal of unanimity within the G 7 including with Japan that we have fundamental concerns about certain actions taken by Russian including its aggression in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea," Kritenbrink told reporters on Wednesday.

Kritenbrink was previewing outgoing US President Barack Obama's scheduled December 27 meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Hawaii, but he made no specific mention of whether Tokyo would continue to participate in imposing economic sanctions on Russia.
"We will not return to business as usual until Russia returns to its Minsk commitments," Kritenbrink stated.
Kritenbrink noted Obama and Abe would celebrate the achievements of the US-Japanese alliance over the past four years, but he gave no specifics apart from mentioning new guidelines on joint training between military forces that were approved last year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Abe held meetings in Nagato and Tokyo during Putin's visit to Japan December 15-16. During Putin's visit, Russian and Japanese companies signed 68 documents on energy, investment, agriculture and visa facilitation.
The changing facts in the Boston investigation Important details like the suspects' weapons, NYC plans and the shootout keep changing. It's fueling conspiracies
In the aftermath of massive, complicated crimes it's not uncommon for a bit of crucial information to be immediately put forward by police, only to be contradicted later on. While it's understandable that initial leads and assertions might end up being wrong in a dynamic situation like the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, wholesale contradictions can encourage skepticism of the motives of those releasing inaccuracies -- as with initial, false reports that Osama bin Laden hid behind his wife when U.S. forces shot him. Another effect of changing details can be to encourage conspiracy theorists who latch onto inconsistencies, and to undermine trust in authorities.
Now, almost a week after the Tsarnaev brothers fought a rolling street battle with dozens of heavily armed police officers, we learned Wednesday night that they had only a single handgun, according to sources who spoke with ABC News and the AP, something that directly contradicts what officials had previously said.
Advertisement:
Here are some of the biggest changes to facts released in this investigation:
Suspects' arms - After the manhunt, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said the brothers were "heavily armed" and numerous reports detailed a fairly extensive arsenal. According to a New York Times report from April 21 citing a law enforcement official, "The authorities found an M-4 carbine rifle ... two handguns and a BB gun." Now unnamed sources say there was only a single 9mm pistol between the two brothers. Indeed, photos of the shootout suggest only one brother had a weapon.

Now unnamed sources say there was only a single 9mm pistol between the two brothers. Indeed, photos of the shootout suggest only one brother had a weapon. Boat gunfight? - Police initially reported that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev fired on police when they found him hiding in a boat Friday night. “It was back and forth ... yes — he was firing," Watertown Police Chief Ed Deveau told CNN Saturday (though the FBI cautioned at the time that only federal authorities had official information). In its definitive "tick tock" of the events, the Washington Post reported that the suspect inside the boat "was shooting back." But later, the Washington Post and the AP reported yesterday that Tsarnaev was unarmed when police found him after what what was described as a gunfight. As it turns out, police may have been spooked by an errant shot, and fired into the boat, but apparently zero shots came out.

But days later, authorities revealed that the holdup was committed by different suspects and the confusion was caused by the close proximity of the two events. It's still unknown exactly why the brothers killed the police officer.

Carjacking - Some reports indicate that the person whom the brothers carjacked escaped while they inexplicably went into a store to buy snacks, while others say the brothers let the victim go because he wasn't American. It's also still unclear which brother stole the black SUV, and which drove the Honda that followed.

Trip to NYC - What the suspects did after the bombing remains a mystery, but one detail that emerged was that they were planning to head to New York City -- to party. That's what New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said yesterday. But today, NBC News reports the brothers discussed trying to detonate a bomb in Times Square, but that the plan was not well developed and “aspirational at most.”

But Commissioner Davis, of the Boston police, said this week that the boat had been inside the perimeter."
We'll update this post as more examples emerge.
Enlarge By Dale Zanine, US Presswire Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon, sporting a replacement jersey after his Hokies uniform couldn't be found, threw for 296 yards and two touchdowns. FROM THE GRIDIRON FROM THE GRIDIRON Game report Virginia Tech team page Georgia Tech team page Top 25 recap Scores from around the nation USA TODAY Top 25 poll ATLANTA (AP)  Sean Glennon wore a Georgia Tech jersey. There was no doubt he was playing for Virginia Tech. Wearing a replacement jersey provided by the home team when his own disappeared, Glennon threw two long touchdown passes and ran for another score to lead No. 13 Virginia Tech to a 27-3 win over Georgia Tech on Thursday night. "It was funny," Glennon said. "That was the jersey of a school I almost went to" coming out of high school. The Hokies (7-2, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) bounced back just fine from their shocking collapse against Boston College, when they squandered a 10-point lead in the final minutes. Glennon made his second straight start in place of freshman Tyrod Taylor, who was sidelined again by a sprained ankle. The replacement starter, who lost the job to Taylor after the second game, made the most of it by throwing for 296 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown pass to Justin Harper and a 71-yarder to Josh Morgan. Virginia Tech moved into a first-place tie with rival Virginia in the Coastal Division. The teams will meet in the final game of the regular season. "I think I've been playing well," Glennon said. "But the coaches will go with the option they think they will win with." Georgia Tech (5-4, 2-4) saw its slim hopes of making a second straight trip to the ACC championship game go down the drain. The Yellow Jackets were simply horrible after jumping ahead 3-0 on their second possession. Rubbing more salt in Georgia Tech's wounds: Glennon was among four Virginia Tech players whose jersey mysteriously disappeared before the game, forcing them to suit up in the Yellow Jackets' white road jerseys. Glennon's name was written in magic marker on the back, and the home team's nickname was blacked out across the front of the shirt, which was trimmed in black and gold instead of maroon and orange. "Branden (Ore) wrote it on there first in caps and lower case," Glennon said. "I then did it in all caps." Maybe Taylor Bennett should have worn a Virginia Tech jersey. The Georgia Tech quarterback threw four interceptions, and even a 35-yard completion to James Johnson went awry when the Georgia Tech receiver was stripped of the ball and the Hokies recovered. "I've never thrown four picks," Bennett said, shaking his head. "Not anywhere." Victor Harris had two of the interceptions. Freshman Josh Nesbitt also got a shot at quarterback, but he overthrew a wide-open Johnson on what would have been a certain touchdown. For good measure, Nesbitt threw the Yellow Jackets' fifth interception late in the game. By then, most Georgia Tech fans were already heading for home. Those who remained booed embattled coach Chan Gailey when he was shown on the video board making a public-service announcement during the fourth quarter. "That really hurt me," said Johnson, the lone bright spot for the Georgia Tech offense with seven catches for 136 yards. "I'm pretty sure it hurt every other player, too." Virginia Tech was primed for a letdown after squandering what appeared to be a sure victory against unbeaten Boston College. The Hokies dominated on defense nearly the entire game, but Matt Ryan led an improbable comeback with two touchdowns in the final 2:11 for a 14-10 victory that ruined Virginia Tech's of getting into the national championship race. Coach Frank Beamer kept reminding his team that they were still positioned for a run at the ACC title, and the players clearly took that message to heart. After Jud Dunleavy booted a 28-yard field goal that it at 3, the Hokies seized the momentum by surprising the Yellow Jackets with an onside kick. Dunleavy barely kicked the ball, ran along behind it for 10 yards and fell on it himself. "I told Frank after the game that was a gutsy call," Gailey said. Virginia Tech took advantage of the recovery by driving for the go-ahead touchdown, a 2-yard run by Glennon early in the second quarter. The Hokies made it 17-3 lead when Glennon went deep to Harper for another TD. Even though Georgia Tech blocked a field goal attempt just before halftime, giving the Yellow Jackets somewhat of an emotional boost, Virginia Tech wasn't going to let this one get away. Glennon sent most of the fans scurrying for the exits when he tossed up a long pass to Morgan, who leaped over Jahi Word-Daniels at the 30 to make the catch, then coasted to the end zone to complete the 71-yard play. Virginia Tech finally let up at the end, choosing not to run another play from the Georgia Tech 4 as the clock ran out. The Yellow Jackets struggled offensively without their top two running backs, including star Tashard Choice. Third-stringer Jamaal Evans got his first career start but managed only 10 yards on six carries. Freshman Jonathan Dwyer was more effective, rushing for 68 yards. "When your running game is not working, you've got to go to the air," Bennett said. "There's only two ways to score on offense." Neither worked for the Yellow Jackets.

What are the real predictions for BlizzCon? Most people have Fnatic slotted to take home the trophy after their performance at the Mid-Season Brawl earlier this year and their undefeated stomp through the most recent Western Clash.
On their way to California now, we spoke with the pros to understand how they measure the power level of Europe and the rest of the teams in contention at the HGC Finals.
“It is time to decide which region is the best of 2017,” said Tempest team captain Gyeong Hwan ‘Hide' Jin. “Europe was the strongest region just from this summer, but Korea is still the most powerful region in the world.”
Some Korean teams are a little humbler.
“I have always insisted Europe and Korea are in the same position,” said Ballistix (formerly L5) team captain Seung-Chul ‘sCsC' Kim. “I told Fnatic at BlizzCon 2016 that they could beat my team in the final. I always think we could lose to Europe teams in every global tournament. However, in the current meta, Korean teams have the advantage, but our metas are very similar during scrims between EU and KR teams.”
Fnatic, Team Dignitas, and Team expert are currently boot-camping in Korea ahead of the HGC Finals, although it's safe to assume that all three are avoiding the Korean teams they anticipate facing in the group stages or the playoff bracket. “We had some rest before they came. Now we will practice hard,” added sCsC.
When asked if Europe was the strongest region currently, MVP Black team captain Jung Hyuk ‘Sake' Lee responded simply, “Yes, I think so.” In fact, many of the other teams echoed a similar sentiment, including CE, BTG, Deadlykittens, and Team Freedom.
“I think overall Europe is probably the strongest region because they have many competitive teams,” said Roll20's Justin ‘Justing' Gapp. “I don't expect two European teams in the finals, but if there is, then they will be undisputed as the best region.”
James ‘Bakery' Baker believes that his region is the strongest, of course. “I think we are, but you can't be sure," he said. "We're still wary of what Korea can do, and we're planning around that, but I think all of the European teams are feeling strong.”
Fnatic team captain Dob ‘Quackniix' Engström was cautious in his answer. “I don't necessarily think Europe is straight-up the strongest region, but I do feel Europe always tends to have a better understanding of the meta, and I think we are better at creating a stronger meta if needed,” he said.
Meanwhile, some players and teams are firmly echoing the opposite regarding European dominance. “No,” said Super Perfect Team captain Zhou ‘misaka' Lizhong. “That crown belongs to Korea.”
One thing is for certain, sparks will fly at the HGC Finals as each region will aim to prove themselves to be the very best in the world.
Dozens of students and community leaders rallied at the fountain in Journal Square on Friday in support of the proposed New Jersey Dream Act.
The event, organized by members of the Hudson County Community College, Phi Theta Kappa:Beta Alpha Phi International Honors Society, was intended to help push state legislators to support tuition equity for undocumented students.
"We (Phi Theta Kappa) were asked to form a project [Honors in Action] on the culture of competition, and for our project we chose Economics: Too Big to Fail," said Melissa Ortiz, president of Hudson County Community College's, Phi Theta Kappa, Beta Alpha Phi. ""We learned that, economically, it makes no sense to deny an entire population the right to an education."
Undocumented immigrants in New Jersey are currently required to pay out-of-state tuition rates to attend state colleges. The New Jersey Dream Act -- also known as the New Jersey Tuition Equality Act -- would have state universities and colleges charge them they same as any other resident.
"We were the first (municipality) to introduce the resolution that supported and urged our legislation to pass the NJ DREAM ACT," said Rolando Lavarro, president of the Jersey City Council. "Hopefully, it will see passage by the end of the year."
Reversing his previously held position, Gov. Chris Christie, who heavily courted the Latino vote in his recent re-election bid, came out in October in support of the Dream Act.
Many students of Hudson County Community College chanted by the fountain, holding signs that read, "the time is now" and "no human being is illegal".
"I don't think that you should be denied certain things if you're trying to be a contributing member of society," said Christina Smallwood, 21, an education major at HCCC. "If you've been in this country for a certain amount of years, you are automatically entitled to certain amount of benefits, especially in relation to education."
Although this is their very first rally, the members of Phi Theta Kappa already have plans for future projects.
"We plan on going to Trenton next week and we're going to be pushing the legislation to let them know that there is pressure on them," said Ortiz. "We are collecting money now to let them know that there is a scholarship for students for transfer scholarship for undocumented students."
"It's nice to see it come to play because we didn't think that it was going to happen," she beamed.

We're not talking job security or safety, We're talking waterfront rackets.
It's not about jobs. It's not about safety. It's not about improving dockworkers' living standards. The looming, long-planned East and Gulf Coast port strikes are about protecting Big Labor's archaic work practices and corrupt waterfront rackets.
Are you ready for a fiscal cliff? The union bosses of an estimated 14,500 workers at 15 ports are preparing to send the economy plunging back into recession over changes in productivity and efficiency rules. You read that right. Much more on that in a moment. But first, here's what's at stake.

The grip of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) extends from Boston to Florida to Texas and all points along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The New York–New Jersey ports — which handle cargo valued at $208 billion a year — could come to a standstill. National Retail Federation executive Jonathan Gold issued a desperate statement: “The last thing the economy needs right now is another strike, which would impact all international trade and commerce at the nation's East and Gulf Coast container ports. This is truly a ‘container cliff' in the making.”
#ad#Retailers have begged Big Labor–lovin' President Obama to intervene. Good luck with that. The cozy White House powwow with union bosses immediately after Election Day tells you all you need to know about which side Obama champions.
The United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents 14 Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, has been bracing for a union-spearheaded shutdown since this summer, when labor negotiations fell apart. The ILA's current contract expired on September 30. Federal mediators granted a 90-day extension, which ends on December 29. ILA president Harold Daggett won a green light earlier this month from his membership to call a strike if the USMX doesn't give in completely to the union's demands. According to my sources, despite overwhelming industry concessions on wages and benefits, port watchers view the likelihood of a strike at “probably 70 to 85 percent now.”

Don't believe the union sob stories. ILA members are among the highest-paid union workers in the country. Starting pay for dockworkers is $20 an hour, with a top straight-time pay rate of $32 an hour. Seniority and overtime bonuses are generous, with ILA members earning an average of more than $124,000 a year in wages and benefits.
The sticking points of the heated ILA–USMX talks are “container royalties” (a fee per ton of containerized cargo that carriers pay to ILA members) and “custom and practice.” On the New York–New Jersey waterfronts, union racketeers have turned archaic work rules into a corrupt system of patronage tied to organized crime. Reporter Carl Horowitz of the National Legal and Policy Center broke down the container-royalty dispute this fall: “In 2011 these royalties amounted to $232 million or about $15,500 per worker at the Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. This arrangement was established in 1960 when New York Longshoremen sought to protect themselves against job losses resulting from the introduction of automated cargo container weighing. It's been a ticket for inefficiency.”

In other words, it's a ridiculously outdated surcharge on business to cushion the blow of modernity to workers. Unions, of course, siphon off a large chunk of the royalties — more than $20 million last year alone, according to the Supply Chain Digest. The trade publication points out that “ILA workers receiving those hefty checks today have no real connection to the perceived threat from container traffic to manually loaded freight and handling work that started the whole program in the 1960s.”
Advertisement
USMX hasn't even called for eliminating the outdated fees. It just wants to cap them. Under the industry's contract proposal, the ILA's average hourly rate would increase to more than $55, including overtime and container royalty. Workers would still not be required to pay premiums on their health-care plans, as most private employers now require their workers to do.

But the union won't budge, and it is screaming bloody murder over attempts to rein in other inefficiencies.
The additional “custom and practice” items that the ILA seeks to preserve are a recipe for corruption. Don't take industry's word for it. That was the conclusion this year of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. Decades of favoritism, nepotism, and Mafia-friendly hiring practices have bred inefficient and criminal conditions that benefit “a privileged few.” The union protects no-show and no-work jobs, 24-hour paid work for eight-hour-a-day-or-less clerks, and unlimited paid vacation for shop stewards. ILA has demanded that multiple crane operators be paid for the work of a single operator. And the commission's hearings exposed ILA bosses tied to mobsters and family members being paid more than $400,000 a year, often billing for more than 27 hours a day.
Union bosses and their Occupy Wall Street henchmen will be ratcheting up their rhetoric about “greed” and “fat cats” as they move to ring in the New Year by bringing the American economy to its knees. Now you know the rest of the story.

The Nintendo Switch has been criticized for it's expensive prize tag including all of it's accessories. But how does it really stack up against its competition? Is Sonys Playstation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One really that much cheaper? We are taking a look at what console offers the best value.
Let's begin by taking a look at the base console price. Currently the Nintendo Switch comes in at $299. Compared to the Playstation 4 Slim that is currently being priced at $249 on Amazon. The Xbox One remains in the same league as Sony, and also costs around $249. However, to make a fair comparison we will have to look at the official retail price, which is $299 for the PS4 as well as for the Xbox One. It is not surprising that the Switch is currently not on sale like the other two consoles, given the novelty of the console. Both the PS4 and Xbox One have been around for years, and have seen several price reductions since then. Still both consoles can often be found $50 cheaper than Nintendos hybrid console, and on top of that often come bundled with a game like Uncharted 4 on the PS4 or Minecraft on the Xbox One.
The Joy-Con controllers have frequently been highlighted for its innovative HD Rumble, but also been criticized for the high price tag. The two pack will cost you $79.99 while a single joy-con controller can be purchased for $49.99. Sony and Microsoft sell their controllers for about $50 each, which is on par with the single joy-con controller.
Getting the formalities out of the way, let's look at a break down at what a starter kit of each console would cost you. Let's assume you will buy one console with one triple-A video game, and an additional controller.
Nintendo Switch
Console (comes with 2 joy-con controllers) – $299.99
One Game – $59.99
Total: $359.98
Playstation 4
Console ( Comes with 1 Controller + Uncharted 4 ) – $299.99
One additional Game – $59.99
Optional second controller $50
total: $359.98
total with 2 controllers: $409.98
Xbox One
Console ( Comes with 1 Controller + Minecraft ) – $299.99
One additional Game – $59.99
Optional second controller $50
total: $359.98
total with 2 controllers: $409.98
While the Playstation 4 and Xbox One are nearly identical for the base models, the Nintendo Switch comes in a little bit higher when compared to the common sale price of the other two consoles. However it is important to note that the Switch already comes with two controllers. Many couch coop games can be played in multiplayer right out of the box. The PS4 and Xbox One would require the purchase of an additional controller, though they usually already come packed with one game – that you may or may not want to play.
The power difference between the PS4 and Xbox One is minor, while the Nintendo Switch clearly lacks the horsepower the other two next-gen consoles have. One could argue that based on this fact the Nintendo Switch should be a lot lower in price. But is horsepower really more expensive than innovation? Or is Nintendo just trying to make a quick dollar out some highly outdated hardware? According to a recent report, the Nintendo Switch cost $260 to manufacturer and $90 of that are the joy-con controllers alone. Which would mean that even though the controllers are considered overpriced, Nintendo is selling them at a loss. It's common practice in the gaming console business to remain competitive with the competition.
Either way, you are not just buying a piece of hardware, you are buying into an eco system. If you decide to go for the Playstation 4 you are ultimately deciding to buy into an eco system of games like Little Big Planet, Uncharted, Horizon Zero Dawn, the last of us and more. While going for the Nintendo Switch will offer you games like Smash Brothers, Animal Crossing, Pokémon, Mario, Splatoon 2 and many more games that can only be experienced on the Nintendo console.
Whatever system you end up getting, don't only look at the money it will cost you upfront, but look closer at the kind of video games you will be able to play on it.
Over the last year, there have been a ton of inquiries into the medical benefits of MDMA, the key ingredient in uppers you'll know as ecstasy.
From becoming a potential assistant medication in psychotherapy to what could be the one and only cure to tinnitus, old mate Molly has really been proving itself lately.
This week, across the pond in Bristol, researchers out of the Imperial College London are using the drug to treat patients suffering from alcohol addiction.
A Bristol based research team is investigating MDMA as a treatment for alcohol addiction, one of the most damaging mental health issues in Australia.
The basis of the research formed from the recently popularised information that a huge number of addicts are sufferers of trauma, and that said trauma is a major contributor to their addiction.
Since MDMA has proved to be a successful treatment method in trauma psychotherapy, the Imperial College researchers are hoping to extend those benefits into alcoholic addiction.

Canada hoping to keep green house gas emissions in check with new regulations for fuel efficiency in newer model vehicles.
Environment Minister Peter Kent announcing today that passenger vehicles for model years 2017 to 2025 will be subject to greater fuel efficiency requirements, In hopes of establishing more stringent GHG emission standards.
"These new regulations improve fuel efficiency so that by 2025 new cars will consume 50% less fuel and emit 50% less GHGs than a similar 2008 model, leading to significant savings at the pump," said Minister Kent. "At today's gas prices, a Canadian driving a model year 2025 vehicle would pay, on average, around $900 less per year compared to driving today's new vehicles."
The proposed regulations are expected to reduce greenhouse gases by 162 mega-tonnes in the 8 year period.
Canada has committed to reducing GHG emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by the year 2020, but nationally we have only reached the half-way point.
On a Global scale, current greenhouse gas levels are hovering 14 per cent above the benchmark set for 2020.
When Vicki Parry's highly trained Siberian husky nudges forcefully into her leg, she knows it's time to do a diabetes test of her blood-sugar level.
When Vicki Parry's highly trained Siberian husky nudges forcefully into her leg, she knows it's time to do a diabetes test of her blood-sugar level.
Twenty-month-old Ada has been trained as a diabetes response dog and she usually detects that Mrs Parry's blood-sugar levels are getting dangerously low before she has realised it herself.
"She firmly nudges her nose against my leg. She has given me a bruise, she's very persistent. It's a trained response," said Mrs Parry, 29. "We have also trained her that if I don't respond at all, she's allowed to get up on me and paw me."
It is not known how dogs detect humans' blood-sugar levels, but trainers believe it is scent-based. Ada was trained using freezer-stored saliva swabs collected from Mrs Parry when her blood-sugar levels were high or low.

Mrs Parry, a technical writer, of Beach Haven on Auckland's North Shore, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, a disease of unknown cause, when she was 7.
Although her blood-sugar levels were well controlled before Ada arrived, they are even better now.
Long-term elevated blood-sugar levels can lead to diabetic complications such as blindness and kidney disease. Very high and very low levels can cause confusion and coma. Mrs Parry and her husband, Simon, an electrical goods salesman, got Ada for a pet when she was seven weeks old.
They took her to sessions with dog trainer Flip Calkoen and saw him teaching German shepherd Uni to be a diabetic response dog. Uni, featured in the Herald in 2012, did not reach the required standard and is now a family pet.
"He was too active," said Mr Calkoen, a board member of Kotuku Foundation Assistance Animals Aotearoa, a charity. "It would have been too difficult for a recipient to manage him.
"I was explaining about what we were doing and at the end of the class they said Vicki was diabetic; would it be possible for Ada to do that [Uni's training]. I said from what I had seen in her temperament, yes."
That was a year ago. Ada has now passed her good-manners test, specialist diabetes training and public-places test. Her training so far has focused mainly on low blood-sugar levels and is now switching to highs.
"Highs and lows are equally dangerous," said Mrs Parry.
Mrs Parry takes Ada most places she goes, including supermarket shopping, but is still talking with her employer about taking Ada to work.
Mr Calkoen said Siberian huskies were not typically trained as service dogs and as far as he knew Ada was the first of her breed to become a diabetic response dog.
The Parrys had paid some of Ada's training costs and he had covered the rest.
Helper dogs
Dogs are trained to help people who have conditions including:
• Diabetes
• Epilepsy
• Cerebral palsy
• Blindness
• Impaired hearing
The cost
$20,000 to $50,000 per dog

Hong Kong is at a gentle boil. As of this writing, tens of thousands of students have been politely demonstrating, calling for the Beijing-appointed chief executive, C.Y. Leung, to resign and be replaced through free elections.
Politics don't often divert Hong Kong's manic obsession with business and finance, but the upsurge of youthful discontent has presented China with one of its biggest popular challenges since the 1989 Tiananmen uprising – which China insists never happened.
So far, China's Communist Party and its tough new boss, Xi Jinping, have stood back and taken no serious action to curb the peaceful demonstrations. Now, however, protest leaders are threatening to seize government buildings unless Beijing drops plans to select Hong Kong's new government in 2017. This is a direct challenge to Beijing's national authority.
Considering that Beijing is ruthlessly crushing protests by Uighur Muslims in its strategic westernmost province of Xinjiang, Hong Kong's demands for true autonomy and self-rule come at a particularly difficult time for the Communist Party which is feting its 65th anniversary of taking over China.
Western media, often hostile to China, is portraying the uprising as a struggle by democrats against party dictatorship. Reality is rather more complex. Hong Kong never had democracy under British Imperial rule: it was run by an autocratic British colonial governor – and run pretty well.
When China assumed control in 1997 of long-lost Hong Kong, it vowed to maintain its special self-governing status for 50 years, except for defense and foreign affairs. China appointed the former colony's chief executive, but locals were given some latitude.
This “one state, two systems' worked well. But a new generation wants democracy and real political power. Beijing is unlikely to ever accept such a development. Hong Kong is isolated from the rest of China and self-contained, but Beijing fears the internet and social media will spread the virus of democracy – even chaos – to the rest of China.
China's leadership has a deep-seated fear of uprisings. Though largely unknown to westerners, China endured a cataclysmic revolt from 1850 to the late 1860's, the Taiping Rebellion. A nobody named Hong proclaimed himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ and launched a peasant rebellion against the doddering Manchu Qing dynasty that eventually cost over 20 million lives. Western forces led by Gen. Charles Gordon – henceforth known as “Chinese” Gordon – finally crushed the Taiping Heavenly Army.
Beijing's deep fear of today's eccentric Falun Gong religious movement reflects the lasting danger of another Taping-style uprising. Gordon went on to fight another religious-nationalist movement, the Dervishes of Sudan. He was killed in Khartoum.
The authorities in Beijing are also on the lookout for western machinations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. A number of US-financed non-government organizations (NGO's) operate in Hong Kong. Similar groups, notably the US National Endowment for Democracy, were involved in attempts to overthrow the governments of Georgia, Ukraine, Iran and Russia. They very effectively used social media to stir up discontent and spark large anti-government rallies.
ORDER IT NOW
As a result, China's security police are cracking down ever harder. Beijing also knows that among the so-called “terrorist camps” in Afghanistan when the US invaded in 2001 were CIA-run bases training Uighurs to fight in western China. The US public was never told about these camps. Most of the other supposed “terrorist camps” in Afghanistan were actually being used by Pakistani intelligence to train guerilla fighters for use in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
Meanwhile, Beijing is also warily watching US efforts, that began under the Bush administration, to draw India into a military alliance and further widen its huge market for arms.
Secret talks are underway between Washington and Delhi for India to take a more extensive economic and new military role in Afghanistan.
New US-supplied weapons systems have strengthened India's military capabilities against main rival, China. At this moment, Indian and Chinese troops are in a confrontation in the high mountains of Ladakh, carefully watched by Pakistan, a close ally of China.
Indians are too smart and independent-minded to become mere native troops (sepoys) for Washington. But they will certainly use their new influence in the US to promote their power vis-à-vis China. Beijing is sharply aware of this development; it tends to overestimate the threat of the US-India strategic alliance. Chinese hardliners darkly suspect the US of planning to break up China, starting in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
On a more prosaic level, Hong Kong and Shanghai have long been bitter rivals. Years ago, Hong Kong was the only gateway into Communist China. Today, most of China's trade doors are open, considerably reducing Hong Kong's commercial and financial importance. The Party has long favored more reliable Shanghai over too-westernized Hong Kong.
The slow decline of Hong Kong and rise of Shanghai and Shenzen are producing economic stress inside the former colony. Interestingly, many of Hong Kong's original movers and shakers came originally from Shanghai.
China would be most unwise to send its army into Hong Kong at a time when it is trying to become the world's epicenter of commerce and finance. So a backroom deal may be likely in which Beijing makes some concessions without loosing much face. Otherwise, the tempest in the Hong Kong teapot could become a political tsunami for the rest of always restless China.
The 7,000 teaching assistants, sessional instructors, lab technicians, writing coaches and others in the Canadian Union of Public Employees 3902 are seeking a raise, but say the university has refused any increase, citing the province's wage freeze for public sector workers.
Teaching assistants and contract professors at the University of Toronto are poised to strike Feb. 27, which would affect two-thirds of all face-to-face teaching at Canada's largest university.
The U of T is “actively involved in negotiations and is committed to reaching agreements . . . that are responsive to the issues CUPE has raised and responsible in light of the university's challenging fiscal realities,” said spokesperson Althea Blackburn-Evans Wednesday night.
“I'm concerned the parties are still too far apart and there aren't enough meetings (with the U of T) scheduled to be hopeful of reaching a settlement,” Culpepper said Wednesday night.
“Our teaching assistants have been making $15,000 a year since 2008 without an increase, and we think they should be moving towards $23,000, which is the low-income cutoff in Toronto,” said Ryan Culpepper, a PhD student, teaching assistant and chief union negotiator.
If there is a strike, professors outside the union warn that a new U of T policy giving administrators control over how they tweak their courses to keep classes running — from marking to course load — would violate their academic freedom.
“It's like an Emergency Measures Act that applies in the event of a pandemic, natural disaster or labour disruption, that would allow the provost to make fundamental changes to our courses just to make sure the trains run on time,” said geography professor Scott Prudham, president of the University of Toronto Faculty Association (UTFA), which represents full-time and tenured professors, who don't have the right to strike.
Prudham said he will meet Thursday with university officials to discuss professors' concerns about the Policy on Academic Continuity, which some believe U of T launched to prevent the kind of campus shutdown that happened at York University in 2009, when a three-month walkout by teaching assistants and contract staff halted classes for 45,000 students.
“I hope there's not a strike at U of T, but if there is, you can't have the provost telling you what you can and cannot teach, and how to mark, and whether to replace a final essay (which could require teaching assistants to mark) with a multiple-choice evaluation (marked by a computer),” said Prudham.
Fourth-year biology student Abdullah Shihipar, president of the Arts and Science Students' Union, which represents 23,000 students, said “students don't want a strike at all — the whole nightmare of York comes to mind.
“But we can see the working conditions of our TAs are bad, and when we're paying $7,000 a year in tuition, you expect some of it to go to the people who teach you.”

Problems introduced by “Nested” library projects in a Git Repository
Often it is the case I find myself building out a project and incorporating another library I have been working on (such as a custom control) as a dependency. The library in question may, in fact, be consumed by other projects as well (that IS the purpose of creating such libraries, right?). Equally often, the project I am referencing as a dependency in my main project will itself be in a state of evolution. A problem arises related to either or both of the following:
The newly introduced dependency (the “sub-project” e.g. custom control or such) is also being actively developed, and I will want the option to pull in any changes as that library evolves.
I may, in the course of working on my “main” project, make some modifications to the sub-project, some or all of which I decide should be incorporated into the main line of development of the shared library.
John on Google CodeProject
I was aware of only three ways to manage dependencies on shared libraries:
Set a reference to the binaries of the shared library from within my main project, perform all modifications to the shared library from within that project, and re-build so that changes are reflected in the binary outputs.
to the binaries of the shared library from within my main project, perform all modifications to the shared library from within that project, and re-build so that changes are reflected in the binary outputs. Use Git “Sub modules” to refer to a specific commit within the library project, and manage the updating of these commit pointers as the library project evolves.
to refer to a specific commit within the library project, and manage the updating of these commit pointers as the library project evolves. Copy the dependency project source into the main project. Yuck. Isn't the whole idea of libraries to avoid this type of thing?
I have not used Git sub modules much, but my limited experience with them indicates to me that outside of certain circumstances, they are a pain. Equally unsatisfactory under the conditions I described in the first paragraph is the managing of a standard binary reference (especially in cases where I may need to customize the shared library within my main project, while keeping it up to date with the development repo. The third option is not even worth considering.
Sub-tree Merge – The best of Both Worlds, with Only Half the Pain
In searching for an optimal way to handle the “nested libraries” problem, I came across a few articles on the Sub-tree Merge workflow in GIT. In this workflow, we accomplish the following (this represents my understanding of what is going on – if you know differently, please let me know in the comments!):
Maintain a tracking branch which tracks the remote shared library project, from which we can pull in changes made in mainline development of the shared library. This remote tracking branch tracks and represents the history of the shared library, distinctly form the history of the main project.
From this remote, create a “subtree” as a subdirectory within the master branch (or whichever branch we designate) of the main project. The new sub-directory contains a copy of the shared library source code. This subtree does not bring with it the history of commits in the actual shared library. Instead, it joins and shares history with the main project.
Once this is done, we can pull new change sets down from the shared library remote as needed, and merge them into our sub tree (there's a trick to this, though, so keep reading). Likewise, we can also merge changes we make within our subtree directory out to our remote tracking branch, and push them up to the shared library remote.
Confused yet? It makes sense in a minute.
Essentially, we will have told Git to read the contents of the remote tracking branch into a sub-directory on branch master, and remember that this sub-directory represents a subtree based on the remote tracking branch. Graphically, I think of it a little like this:
This is How I Picture the Git Subtree Merge Workflow:
Walk Through:
Let's walk through the process of creating a subtree within an example project, and then we'll discuss some things to pay attention to when it comes to merging changes to and from the subtree remote.
I have created an example project as the “main” project for use in the following examples. I will be using a Pdf Merge utility project created for another post on this blog as the “shared library.” The main project is called, unsurprisingly, “MainProject.” The shared library is my oh-so-useful iTextToolsExample. We will assume I have already created MainProject, created a local repository on my development machine, and a remote repo on Github.
Step 1: Create a Remote that Points to the Shared Library Repo
From the Git command line, we set up a remote that points at the repository for the shared library project. I will be using an example project as the main project, and adding a shared library I created for another post as a subtree.
Git Add Remote Syntax:
$ git add <local_remote_name> <remote_location>
e.g:
$ git remote add itext_remote https://github.com/xivSolutions/iTextToolsExample.git
Step 2: Fetch Shared Library into the Working Tree:
Next we need to fetch down the shared library into our working directory using the remote we just created. Note, we want to use “fetch” here, as we don't want to commit what we add to branch master:
Git Fetch Syntax:
$ git fetch <remote_name>
e.g:
$ git fetch itext_remote
Note the warning after we fetch about “no common commits.” That's ok – we wouldn't expect there to be an common history here, we are importing a library for that very reason!
Step 3: Checkout Out a New Tracking Branch Based on the Shared Library Remote
Now, in keeping with the illustration above, we want to get the contents of the shared library tracked in their own remote tracking branch, so we can keep things in sync separate from master:
Checkout to New Branch Syntax:
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> remote_name/branch_name
e.g:
$ git checkout –b itext_branch itext_remote/master
Now, the new tracking branch points to the root of the shared library project. We can check this by examining the directory contents here in itext_branch:
Directory Listing in iText Branch:
And then checkout master and compare:
Directory Listing in Master:
Step 4: Read the Library Project into master as a subdirectory
Now is when we perform the magic. We will use git read-tree to read the contents of itext_branch into a subdirectory of master . This will be essentially the same as copying it all in, with on small exception: Git knows and remembers that this is a subtree related to the remote tracking branch itext_branch.
Git Read-Tree Syntax:
$ git read-tree --prefix=<subdirectory_name>/ –u <shared_library_branch>
e.g:
$ git read-tree –-prefix=itextTools/ –u itext_branch
In the above, <subdirectory_name> can be anything you like – it is going to be the name of a new “folder” or subdirectory within your mater branch. The --prefix flag tells git that this will be the name of a directory. I usually use the same name as the original shared library project. Note it is important to include the forward-slash after this. The –s flag tells git to go ahead and update the working tree with the new changes. Also note, we execute this command from within branch master :
Running Git Read-Tree From Branch Master:
Now, if we run git status, we can see that a bevy of new files have been added to our master branch, in a directory named (not surprisingly) “iTextTools:”
Status of Branch Master After Read-Tree Operation:
Step 5: Commit The New Sub-Tree
After you have performed the read-tree operation, the files have been read into our master branch as described above. The important thing here is that the history they share with the remote source repository (as referenced by the itext_branch) has NOT. We can commit this as a single commit:
Commit the New Directory and Files:
We have now added the shared iTextTools library as a subtree in our master branch. If we check the contents of our project directory on branch master now, we see the new iTextTools subdirectory:
Now, what if there are changes introduced to the main shared library source project? How can keep our sub-project in sync with mainline development on the shared library?
Updating the Nested Subtree Project with Changes from the Shared Library Remote
If we need to pull changes down from the original shared library source into our sub-project, we can simply check out the remote tracking branch itext_branch and use git pull , which will pull down and merge any changes made since we originally fetched the project. Say we (or whoever maintains the itextTools project) added a new class named SomeNewClass and solution file to the main development repo for the itextTools library:
Pulling Changes down from the Shared Library Remote:
While the above pulls the changes down, we need to be careful with this next step – merging the new change set into our subtree in master. The changes we just pulled down bring with them all of the history from the iText remote repository. In almost all cases, we do not want to merge this history with that of our main project, so we can't simply do a merge or rebase to get the new changes into master. Instead, we want to use the following:
Squash and No-Commit Change Sets into the Subtree (Syntax):
$ git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit <source_branch>
e.g:
$ git merge --squash –s subtree –-no-commit itext_branch
In the above, the --s flag indicates that you are going to specify which merge strategy git should use in merging changes. This is followed by the strategy itself, which in this case is the subtree strategy. We are also telling git to squash the commits from <source_branch> into a single change set, and to not automatically commit when the merge is complete.
So, now that we have pulled the changes down into our remote tracking branch, we check out master , and execute the above command:
Merging Changes from Remote Shared Library into Subtree (from branch master):
If we check the status of master again, we see the changes from the remote iText library repo have been merged into the appropriate subdirectory, and staged for commit:
Status of Master After Subtree Merge Strategy with –Squash and –No-Commit:
From here, simply commit (with a descriptive commit message!).
Updating the Shared Library Remote with Changes made in the Subtree
If you made some changes to the shared library code within your subproject and decide you want to push them out to the main development repo, the process is essentially the same, in reverse. You merge from the subtree directory within the main project (again, explicitly specifying the Subtree Merge strategy), out to the tracking branch that points to the shared library remote. Then push the changes up to the remote.
Say we made some changes to SomeNewClass while working in MainProject and we decided they should be incorporated into mainline development for the itextTools project main repo:
Once you have made changes to the shared library from within branch master of your main project, commit the changes as normal. Then, checkout the tracking branch that points to the shared library remote.
Now, we use the same basic merge command from before, in the opposite direction:
Syntax to Merge from Subtree to the Remote Tracking Branch:
$ git merge --squash -s subtree --no-commit <source_branch>
e.g:
$ git merge --squash –s subtree --no-commit master
Merging the itextTools Subtree into the Remote Tracking Branch:
As in the previous example, we can check Git status and see that the changes we made in our sub-tree project have been merged into the remote tracking branch and are now staged for commit:
Now commit the changes. I usually state clearly in the commit message that these are changes from <project>/subtree so that, when added to the shared library, I can clearly identify that this set of changes came from the sub-project. Now it's time to push the changes back up to the main shared library repo.
Pushing from Tracking Branch to Shared Library Remote Syntax:
$ git push <shared_library_remote> <library_tracking_branch>
e.g:
$ git push itext_remote itext_branch
Pushing to the Remote Repository:
Note that using the syntax above will push the changes into a new branch in my remote repo , named (not surprisingly) itext_branch . This will allow me to apply the changes to the master or production branch of the shared library using a merge or pull request (in the case where I am not the maintainer of the shared library).
There is More To It
I have brushed through the basics here. There are numerous ways to condense some of the commands I used here, and like most things, there are probably dozens of different viewpoints on how to best manage project dependencies in source control. The Subtree Strategy has been working best for me, in my working context, but I welcome your feedback, and especially, corrections where I might have it wrong, or have missed seeing a better way.
Thanks for reading.
Additional Resources
I am not going to pretend there aren't any number of good resources from which I learned the above. Most of the information here I assimilated from elsewhere. Here I have striven to simply present my own understanding, in a way which might have helped *ME* when I was trying to figure it out. Here are some of those sources:

South Africa's government has announced it is reopening an inquiry into a 1999 arms deal that has been surrounded with corruption allegations.
President Jacob Zuma's office announced a commission of inquiry would be set up, but gave no further details.
Mr Zuma's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik was jailed for soliciting bribes from a firm linked to the deal.
Mr Zuma was investigated for corruption over the deal, but the case was dropped before he took office in 2009.
His supporters have always maintained that he had been the victim of a political smear campaign.
The multi-billion dollar deal - post-apartheid South Africa's largest such transaction - was intended to modernise its national defences.
It involved companies from Germany, Italy, Sweden, Britain, France and South Africa.
But corruption allegations swirled around the deal from the start.
Shaik was jailed for 15 years in 2005 for soliciting a bribe from Thint, the local subsidiary of French arms company Thales.
Another official, Tony Yengeni, who was the chairman of parliament's defence committee at the time of the deal, was convicted of fraud in 2003.
Allegations that British firm BAE had a slush fund used to bribe politicians have been widely reported in South Africa.
BAE has consistently denied the claims, and said it would co-operate fully with the new inquiry.
Why now?
Thursday's statement from the president's office said Mr Zuma had "taken into account the various developments around this matter and also the fact that closure on this subject will be in the public interest".
The opposition Democratic Alliance urged Mr Zuma to give the commission a "full scope to investigate any and all aspects of the arms deal and have the powers to subpoena witnesses and documentation".
BBC Southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen says that although the inquiry is being broadly welcomed by the opposition and campaign groups, many question the timing.
ANC youth league leader Julius Malema, once an ally but now an irritant to Mr Zuma, is mid-way through a disciplinary hearing and had threatened to re-open the arms deal question, she says.
There is also a pending constitutional court challenge pushing for an independent inquiry into the arms contracts.
Recent events have put German citizens at the center of the global terrorism scare. In July, American forces in Afghanistan detained a German citizen, Ahmed Sidiqi, 36, said to have ties to the men who helped plot the Sept. 11 attacks. Then just after Washington issued the terrorism alert based on information from Mr. Sidiqi, Pakistani officials said that several German citizens were killed in a drone strike.
The United States military also recently issued an alert for a 23-year-old Berlin man suspected of joining a group called the German Taliban Mujahadeen. Federal law enforcement authorities here followed suit with an arrest warrant for the man identified as Hayrettin Burhan Sauerland amid concerns that he might try to return here from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region to stage an attack, possibly against the United States military personnel.
German officials said that the alerts did not add up to a specific threat, and that the intentions and capabilities of those arrested remained unclear. They have publicly criticized the decision by the United States to issue a travel alert for its citizens traveling to Europe, saying that such announcements play into the hands of terrorists and scare people needlessly.
“No one should doubt that Germany is a target for terrorists, but on the other hand there are no concrete, immediate attack plans that we are aware of,” Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said on German radio.
Even so, the intelligence official in Hamburg said Germany did face the “intense abstract danger” of homegrown radical Islamic terrorism. And this week, the Interior Ministry also said it had assigned an additional 200 investigators to focus on terrorism.

German officials said that hundreds of their citizens and legal residents had over the years traveled to the lawless border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that more than 100 had returned to Germany. There has been a deluge of statistics coming from Germany's intelligence and police operations illustrating the growing concern of radicalized young people heading off to terrorist training camps — and then returning home to strike.
The newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported that federal officials identified 131 individuals as possibly prepared to carry out violent acts. The federal security services said that over the last two decades, about 215 citizens or legal residents of Germany received or intended to receive paramilitary training, that 65 completed the training, and that of the total group, about 105 are in Germany, including 15 in prison.
Those precise-sounding numbers, however, belie the fact that German officials are struggling to get a handle on how susceptible their large and mostly peaceful population of Muslims is to the lure to radicals in far-off places.

“These are the so-called known terrorists, the suspicious people,” said Rolf Tophoven, the director of the Institute for Terrorism Research and Security Policy in Essen, of the statistics. “But the unknown people, they don't go to the mosque to pray because they are afraid to be detected; they don't have meetings in religious institutions, maybe they come together in a private house. That is a big concern.”
Germany first awoke to this reality in 2001, when three men who worshiped at a Hamburg mosque were identified as leaders in carrying out the Sept. 11 plot including Mr. Atta, who flew one of the planes into the World Trade Center.
Memories of that case resurfaced when the American military arrested Mr. Sidiqi, a German citizen of Afghan heritage who once worked at the Hamburg airport. The Hamburg intelligence official that said Mr. Sidiqi had been under surveillance for years and that like Mr. Atta, he had attended Al Quds Mosque in Hamburg. The official said Mr. Sidiqi was also a friend of Mounir el-Motassadeq, who was convicted in 2006 for his role in aiding the Sept. 11 hijackers.
The Hamburg official said Mr. Sidiqi was one of 11 Hamburg residents who traveled to Pakistan in 2009 in order to fight on behalf of radical Islamic groups abroad, not at home.
In Hamburg, the decision to close the mosque was made to deny radicals a symbol to rally people to the cause. But the intelligence official and German experts on terrorism also acknowledged that closing the mosque did not get rid of those already radicalized but instead drove them underground.
“There is some unrest in the Germany intelligence community that they have overlooked a community of Islamic militants they didn't realize was here inside Germany, an existing group of terrorists, a sleeping cell of terror,” said Mr. Tophoven, of the Institute for Terrorism Research and Security Policy. “They are concerned it could exist.”

The prospect of freer trade with European nations is generally popular among Canadians. And why shouldn't it be? Doesn't the Canadian left repeatedly point to the advantages of many European social and economic institutions? Who could argue with lower prices for European cheese, wine, or chocolate?
After all, we've been waiting for years for the Canadian economy to pivot to export-led growth, and how can we do that without free trade deals. This is the government's line. (Even though classical economic theory would say that trade deals are meant to benefit consumers, not exporters).
Well, there are a number of reasons to be concerned about the Canadian-European Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). The first one is that it isn't just a trade deal. Sure, it eliminates the already low non-agricultural tariffs between Canada and the EU.
And if it stopped there we wouldn't be having this conversation.
But when advocates think a major selling point of the agreement is that:Â â€œItâ€™s not just a trade agreement. It reaches into other regulatory areas and areas of social and economic policy”, we're going to want to have a chat with some policymakers.
The CCPA has gathered analysis of CETA's leaked text from a wide range of experts, to help make sense of the CETA. I've summarized some of the key issues below.
Investor State Dispute Resolution
The most problematic element is the level of protections that investors receive under the CETA. These investor protections effectively constrain the ability of governments at all levels to introduce new regulations or new public services. Scott Vrooman, a comic who also happens to be a trained economist, humorously summarizes the problems with Investor State Dispute Mechanisms nicely in video and written formats, suggesting thatÂ Countries are Second Class Citizens under modern international trade agreements.
Under CETA an international body bypasses national courts, and can make decisions that apply retroactive financial penalties to governments. Compare this to the labour and environment chapter, which allows for a transparent but completely unenforceable dispute resolution process. This process is little more than high-level peer pressure, which we know to be a super effective tactic with our current Conservative government.
Food Security
One of the wins for Canada under CETA is increases in the quota of pork and beef that Canadian producers can sell into Europe. There remains considerable doubt about the ability of Canadian beef producers, in particular, to make use of the higher quotas. Canada is not able to fill our current quota of hormone free beef to the EU, let alone be in Â a position to take advantage of expanded quotas.
On the other hand, rules around procurement may threaten the increasingly popular “eat local” programs in many municipalities, schools, hospitals, and prisons. Local procurement of food is considered to be an important driver of local food security, as well as a key regional development policy, and part of reducing Canada's carbon footprint. The threshold for ‘sub-central' entities is $330,000 CDN, much lower than current restrictions under NAFTA.
Indigenous Rights
Since Canada has pledged to endorse the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), the federal government must consult with Indigenous Peoples. There is no question that an agreement as all-encompassing as CETA requires the government to receive Free, Prior, and Informed Consent from Indigenous Peoples whenever Indigenous rights may be affected. The level of secrecy around the process in negotiating CETA makes it very difficult to determine if any effort has been made by the federal government to even consider their responsibilities to Indigenous Peoples.
Maritime Services
Trade agreements are notoriously dense and difficult to parse, even when one has access to the official text and supporting documents. Maritime services is one example of a “surprise” found in the leaked final text of CETA.
During CETA negotiations, maritime industry players were assured that ‘cabotage' would be left untouched by the agreement. Cabotage is a technical term that means “the movement of goods or passengers between two ports or places within a single state”. Effectively, ships carrying goods between two Canadian ports must be registered in Canada and adhere to Canadian labour and safety standards. CETA starts to dismantle this, in allowing European shipping from Halifax to Montreal.
As the official text of CETA is released there will certainly be more surprises.
Public Services
Trade deals are about tariffs, right? The benefits are lower prices and better choices for consumers.Â If that is true, then why would a free trade agreement handcuff future governments in their ability to introduce new public services?
The CETA is negotiated under a ‘positive' list rule, which means that any exclusions must be specifically listed. If you forget to list something, or something ‘new' is created, then it automatically comes under the full weight of CETA. The ‘positive list method is new to Europeans, and touted as ‘modern' by Canadian and American trade negotiators.
This means that if a future federal government wants to introduce a public pharmacare or childcare program, they may face investor challenges under CETA. Or worse, future governments may abandon the idea of useful regulations and new public services altogether, because it will simply be too difficult.
This is what the CETA is meant to do – tie the hands of future governments to implement the will of the people. That's not what a trade agreement is should be allowed to do. No one is afraid of trade. We're afraid of corporate rights superseding democracy.
Amid all the bleakness, there is a bit of good news: The Good News Club, which aims to “save” children, is having a hard time in Milwaukee.
The Good News Club wants to convert your children using a combination of fear, tasty snacks and the public schools. The club employs food, games and prizes to entice children into their fundamentalist Christian bible study, where the children — as young as 4 years old — are then taught that they are sinners deserving of eternal punishment. The club tells the children that the only way to escape this terrible punishment is to believe what it tells them to believe and to do what it tells them to do. And all of this happens inside our public elementary schools.
See FFRF's FAQ to understand why these Good News Clubs are in public schools.
But things aren't going the club's way in the Upper Midwest.
This summer, the Child Evangelism Fellowship, which is the group behind the Good News Club, brought hundreds of evangelical Christians to Milwaukee to convert children as part of its annual evangelical “blitz.” The fellowship recently posted the final statistics from the first phase of their invasion, which consisted of establishing week-long clubs in parks, day cares and outside of public schools throughout the Milwaukee area. It partnered with 20 local churches, set up clubs in 60 locations across Milwaukee, evangelized 1,838 children and “counseled” 88 children. “Counseled” is the fellowship's term for conversion, meaning that a child has now been “saved” and follows the “correct” strain of Christianity.
While it is appalling that religious groups can have any success targeting and converting young children in public parks and outside of public schools, when you compare these results with the group's most recent invasion, two years ago in Indianapolis, it's clear that the Child Evangelism Fellowship has had trouble converting children in the Milwaukee area. Perhaps, this is partially thanks to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's press release warning parents that these folks were coming.
In Indianapolis in 2015 , the fellowship partnered with 31 local churches, set up clubs in 92 locations across Indianapolis, evangelized 3,406 children and “counseled” 322 children. Even if you adjust for Indianapolis' larger population, the numbers there are still better for the group. Compared to 2015, the Child Evangelism Fellowship was only able to partner with two-thirds as many churches, set up two-thirds as many clubs, evangelize half as many children, and convert just a quarter as many children to their fundamentalist form of Christianity in Milwaukee.
Despite this positive news, the struggle to protect Milwaukee's children is still far from over. Now, the 20 churches that partnered with the Child Evangelism Fellowship will each be tasked with starting a Good News Club at one of 17 different public schools in the Milwaukee area. They are hoping to convert public school children into evangelical Christians and new church attendees. Here's a list of the schools that they are targeting, listed by district:
Hopefully, as information about the Good News Club continues to spread, parents will ensure their kids are not participating in these clubs. We must remind the Child Evangelism Fellowship that parents are responsible for the religious or nonreligious upbringing of their kids — not evangelical Christians obsessed with converting children. As the old saying goes, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Milwaukee is proving this truism to be correct.

President Trump on Thursday fumed about the discredited opposition-research dossier that first linked his campaign to Russia, after executives from the firm that created it invoked the Fifth Amendment right not to testify in Congress' Russia probe.
“Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?” the president tweeted.
On Wednesday, Fusion GPS executives Peter Frisch and Thomas Catan invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in a private meeting with the House Intelligence Committee.
Fusion GPS helped create the Russia-fed dossier written by former British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele. The dossier contains a series of unverified charges of lewd and criminal actions by Mr. Trump and his campaign aides, including extensive connections with Russians coordinating Moscow's hacking of Democratic Party computers during the presidential race.
The dossier has been traced to both the Democratic Party and the FBI.
Joshua Levy, a lawyer representing Mr. Frisch and Mr. Catan, said Republicans on the committee were acting in “bad faith” and more concerned with the financing of the dossier than Russian interference in the election.
In an exclusive interview earlier this year with The Washington Times, Mr. Trump said it would be a “disgrace” if the FBI offered Mr. Steele money to continue investigating him.

Hood, Army suicides hit record mark At least 22 confirmed last year in and around Fort Hood, doubling the post's total from 2009.
Sgt. 1st Class Gregory Giger was one of at least 22 Fort Hood GIs to commit suicide in 2010. Sgt. 1st Class Gregory Giger was one of at least 22 Fort Hood GIs to commit suicide in 2010.

KILLEEN — Sgt. 1st Class Gregory Eugene Giger was a “tall quiet Texan” even after his wife filed for divorce while he was in Iraq, his mom says.
Still, he was devastated.
“The only thing that I know is when she sued for divorce, she charged him with $2,000-a-month child support and insisted that he pay half of the house,” said Helen Giger, 71, of Chandler, east of Dallas. “And by the time she got through charging him with various things, he had very little money left over, not even hardly enough to pay for his rent.”
Authorities found Giger, 42, of Houston dead in his apartment near Fort Hood, hanging by necktie. He was one of at least 22 GIs from the post to commit suicide in 2010.
The Fort Hood mark is a new record for the post and contributed to the Army's worst year for suicides. There was, however, a sign of hope in the grim tally. Slightly fewer active-duty soldiers died by their own hand compared with 2009. But there was bad news, too: The number of suicides in the National Guard and Army Reserve rose sharply.
The Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. Peter Chiarelli, told the San Antonio Express-News that suicides at or near Fort Hood have increased as more soldiers have returned from combat.
Fort Hood's 22 confirmed suicides, meanwhile, doubled its 2009 mark and was eight more than Fort Bragg, N.C., which had the second-largest tally.
And the Fort Hood mark could grow since some deaths haven't been resolved. Others will remain mysteries, like that of Sgt. Bradley Dale Penman, 34, of Punxsutawney, Pa. Justice of the Peace Garland Potvin of Killeen said that Penman's body, found last summer, was so decomposed no cause of death could be determined.
The Pentagon has launched mental health and suicide-prevention programs and created an Army task force in hopes of turning the tide. In 2008, the Army began a five-year study with the National Institute of Mental Health. That research effort examines risk and resilience factors associated with suicides. A new military research consortium will test and develop interventions.
So far, however, little has changed. The vast majority of the victims were men, with the bulk of the soldiers coming from lower enlisted ranks.
Eighteen of last year's 301 suicides were women, prompting Chiarelli to tell reporters on Wednesday that resiliency among females in some cases “seems to be higher” than for men. That could explain “why we have a lower suicide rate in women based on the number that we have deployed,” he said.
Time in the war zone is one factor in the deaths. Roughly two in three active-duty soldiers committing suicide have gone to war, while nearly half of all guardsmen have fought. But other issues also are in play, including depression, alcohol and drug abuse, failed or failing relationships, financial woes, and legal or disciplinary troubles.
The Army Reserve's chief, Lt. Gen. Jack Stultz, said his troops often are far from their units when not on duty. Leaders now must maintain greater contact with their troops, he said.
“Dwell” time at home is another factor. Chiarelli predicted that “when we put more time between deployments, that is going to be a huge factor in helping us get at these problems.”
Giger had spent close to a quarter-century in the Army and been to Iraq three times since 2004, receiving two Bronze Star medals for valor. If he felt stress from the divorce and financial problems, he didn't let on.
“I think he probably had a lot going on that he just stuffed down inside of him,” Helen Giger said.
Chiarelli told reporters that he believes the programs instituted by the Army in recent years have saved lives, but Col. Carl Castro, director of the medicine research program that established the suicide consortium, said no one is sure of their effectiveness.
“We think they're effective,” he told the Express-News, “but we haven't done the research to demonstrate that they may in fact be effective.”
Chiarelli pointed to the Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program, which offers screening tests for soldiers, family members and Army civilian workers, as one successful effort. He said research comparing soldiers who committed suicide against a control group showed that, “broadly speaking, resilient soldiers do not complete suicide.”
The Army has pocket guides on suicide awareness, and Fort Hood has started its own stress-reduction programs and a soldier “resiliency campus.”
The post's senior commander, Maj. Gen. Will Grimsley, ordered commanders to inspect soldiers' cars and on- and off-post homes after four GIs committed suicide over three days in September.
A trend of increasingly public suicides last year, one in the restroom of a Killeen sandwich shop and another at the end of a police chase near Waco, was a concern for Grimsley, who sought to identify GIs who might be suicide risks.
“I worry about the trend,” he said in October. “The violent nature of it concerns me only because the potential is that it's bad enough if a soldier chooses to kill himself by violence but the potential impact on others, that that notion of violence could spread to somebody else either by accident or by design.”
SHAUN Wane admits he may have had to make some “sacrifices” if clubs hadn't approved the marquee player plan.
Warriors had already struck a deal with Sam Tomkins to return to his hometown club in 2016.
And after Super League outfits gave the green-light to a change to the salary cap rules, Wane has been given more room to manoeuvre to shape next season's squad.
Under the new rule, only £100,000 of Tomkins' salary will count on the £1.85m wage-bill - presuming the Warriors nominate him as their chosen ‘marquee' player.
And Wane hinted he may use the extra flexibility to take a chance on a player from another sport, saying he has cast his net as far as Canadian rugby union and American Football.
Had clubs voted against the plan for a Marquee Player Allowance - which removes a chunk of an A-list player's salary from the cap - then Wane admits Tomkins' return may have forced them to make some difficult decisions.
“Probably yeah,” he said. “But I wanted to sign Sam and if there were sacrifices, we'd have had to bite the bullet.
“But this has changed that.”
The change gives all clubs the chance to retain, or recruit, one ‘marquee' player each. A homegrown star will have £100,000 count on the cap; a recruit from elsewhere will have £175,000.
The move means, for example, that a cashed-up side Warrington could offer NRL superstar Cooper Cronk £350,000 a year, but only half of that amount would count on the cap limit of £1.85m.
“If it lifts the profile of our game and gets more great players here, I'm all for it,” said Wane.
The Wigan coach may use the extra flexibility to recruit a player, admitting he is keeping tabs on potential recruits... from the unlikeliest of locations.
“”I'm always looking at every sport, trying to get someone special,” he said.
“NFL, Canadian rugby union, I look at a range of sports on the internet,
“We may get them into trial, we'll take risks and have a look at people, cast the net.
“If we can get someone who will benefit our sport I will do.
“It's important you keep your eye open.
“Anthony Gelling came from nowhere and it's paid off.”
Wane confirmed yesterday that forward Liam Farrell may return from injury to face Huddersfield on Sunday, in the only expected change to his squad. Farrell has missed the last two games.
REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to the media after talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Minsk on Aug. 27. In another dark twist to the West's standoff with Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, a pro-Kremlin deputy has submitted a draft law that would allow the government to seize foreign assets in the country in response to Western economic sanctions.
The law, submitted after Italian authorities seized €30m worth of shares and bank accounts belonging to the Russian businessman Arkady Rotenberg, would also allow for oligarchs to get compensation from the state in the case of an "unjust judicial act of a foreign court." The full (Russian language) text of the draft law can be found here.
Given Russia's parlous economic position — GDP grew only 0.8% this year — the concept of using state funds to bail out multimillionaire businessmen may be received poorly in the country. Already opposition leaders are rounding on the government with Boris Nemtsov, co-chair of the RPR-PARNAS political party and outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin, writing on Facebook:
What is [the benefit of] a strongman's friendship? It's when you have 4 villas, apartments and a hotel seized in Italy and your accomplice in the Kremlin immediately introduces a bill for damages from the Russian budget.
As Business Insider previously noted, earlier this month US President Barack Obama unveiled new sanctions against Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors. The move dealt another heavy blow to the country's fragile economy with its own central bank bemoaning "a nemic economic growth" caused by a combination of "external uncertainty" and domestic chokes (in particular low levels of investment and weak labor productivity).
RUB USD More
Bloomberg The ruble continues its collapse against the dollar.
With the new sanctions set to impose an even greater cost, the ruble has continued its free fall this year against the dollar, becoming the second-worst performing currency in the world, ahead only of Argentina's peso.
Earlier this week the World Bank gave its stark assessment of Russia's prospects (emphasis added):
Over the medium term, growth will continue to be determined by slow progress in structural reforms and policy uncertainty emanating from geopolitical tensions ...
The effects of weak growth for a second consecutive year, an increase in household debt burden, and continued high inflation expectations, are likely to depress consumer demand further, slowing this main engine of growth in Russia. These effects are expected to persist for the next two years.
With no major structural reforms planned, and microeconomic fundamentals unchanged, investment will remain subdued and there will be only a limited positive effect from import substitution.
Last week Russia passed a new budget in which the government committed to a generous social spending program and promised to control borrowing. With capital outflow from the country expected to hit $100 billion this year, these will be extremely difficult promises to keep unless policymakers can halt the country's economic decline.

Drinking beer to save ocean life? Cheers to that. Saltwater Brewery in Florida has partnered with the New York-based ad agency We Believers to create a plastic-free six-pack ring that feeds marine life, rather than choking or ensnarling them.
Edible six-pack rings were created by fisherman, surfers and people who love the sea, according to Peter Agardy of Saltwater Brewery.
The Edible Six Pack Ring is made from byproducts of the brewing process such as wheat and barley, making it the first 100 percent biodegradable, compostable and edible packaging implemented in the beer industry.
Creativity reported that 3D-printers were used to manufacture the first batch of 500 edible and biodegradable six-pack rings for Saltwater Brewery's main brand IPA.
The plan is to produce 400,000 edible six-pack rings per month, enough for the current monthly production of Saltwater Brewery.
The rings are 100 percent biodegradable, made with byproducts of the beer making process such as barley or wheat.
The product, designed with a team of engineers at a small startup in Mexico, is as resistant and efficient as the current plastic six-pack ring option, according to We Believers co-founders Marco Vega and Gustavo Lauria.
The first mass-produced batch will cost between 10 and 15 cents per unit, for craft beer that costs more than $10 for a six-pack, Lauria said.
The developers admit that the price of their product is currently a downside. The hope is that if more brands or investors hop onboard the prices will fall.
“We hope to influence the big guys and hopefully inspire them to get on board,” said Saltwater Brewery president Chris Goves.
Americans drank 6.3 billion gallons of beer in 2015, with 50 percent of that volume sold in cans that often come in those pesky plastic rings. The material either ends up in landfills or in the ocean, and can end up in a bird's stomach or around a sea turtle's body.
Plastic trash and marine debris is a growing crisis in our oceans.
The six-pack ring problem is not as bad as it used to be—many of us already instinctually cut them apart before throwing them away. In fact, the Plastics Industry Trade Association calls it an environmental urban "myth" that six-pack rings are hazardous to wildlife, pointing to federal regulations that have required six-pack rings to be 100 percent photodegradable since 1989.
However, while it's true that these rings are designed to "photodegrade," or disintegrate into small pieces within 60 to 120 days, that's still plenty of time for a bird or turtle to get trapped in one or choke on a piece of it. Also, something that's "photodegradable" doesn't mean biodegradable, so no matter how small it breaks down it will always be plastic. You may have heard of our oceans' microplastic crisis, where massive clouds of microplastics are emanating out of the five subtropical gyres.
The plastics industry also says that the onus is on us to recycle the six-pack rings, saying "concerns about beverage binders and wildlife could be eliminated if humans would dispose of the rings properly." However, not all curbside recycling programs accept them and let's not forget that Americans, as a whole, are pretty terrible at recycling, with a 34.3 percent recycling rate.
Plastic pollution is devastating our ocean ecosystems, with 8 millions tons leaked into the oceans every year. The waste is routinely found inside the stomachs of many species of aquatic life, from the tiniest plankton to giant whales, and that's not the mention the dangerous, hormone-disrupting chemicals leaching from the plastics.
"If most craft breweries and big beer companies implement this technology, the manufacturing cost will drop and be very competitive compared with the current plastic solution, while saving hundreds of thousands of marine lives," Lauria said.

It's a scary statistic: less than 50 percent of people in the Puget Sound region have actually taken steps to prepare themselves for a disaster, according to the American Red Cross.
"We have found specifically last year after we did a very large exercise, multiple states looked at what would really happen if the big one hits, the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake, something of that scale. And the reality is that it's going to take more than three days potentially for first responders to get to people, Said Colin Downey with the American Red Cross.
The June 2016 Cascadia Rising drill highlighted that concern and prompted a new recommendation that calls for a 14-day emergency supply kit for every member of your family.
But emergency officials stress that building that supply kit doesn't have to break the bank. KING 5 reached out to the American Red Cross for tips on how to start preparing your family without spending a lot of money.
"That's a question we get a lot," said Deb Crosby, a preparedness educator with the American Red Cross. "Start at home. Look at the checklist and see what you have at home that's already available to you. And things you may not have thought were part of an emergency kit, they may already be part of your normal every day life."

The recommended list of supplies includes a two week supply of food, a can opener, a flashlight, personal hygiene items, cash, toilet paper, a two-week supply of medications, identification and important documents, a fire extinguisher, warm clothes, extra batteries, sturdy shoes, and a first aid kit.
Crosby says families shouldn't let that list overwhelm them. For instance, she says a lot of people likely already own some of those items, like can openers and flashlights.
Next, she says, focus on water. Your emergency supply kit should include one gallon of water per person, per day. But that doesn't mean you have to go to the store and buy dozens of gallons of water.
You can bottle water yourself without spending any money.
"If you have a container, if you have a juice bottle, an empty soda bottle, you can put water in it. That's a start. It didn't cost you anything. If you wash it appropriately and store it, and if it's city water it is already treated with chlorine, so it's going to be safe in that bottle," said Crosby.
Another money-saving tip, when looking at the suggested list of supplies: shop around. Crosby tells people to look for coupons, and when you find a good deal on an item, buy it.
"I go to the discount stores. I went to dollar stores, and everything there is a dollar or less," said Crosby. "An emergency blanket, and a rain poncho, I found these for less than a dollar. You can dive them at Big 5, Walmart, sporting goods stores, everyone has them."
By far, her biggest message is that you don't have to purchase everything all at once. What matters most is that you start building it soon.
"You don't have to have that whole kit today. You can build it over time. You can build it as you have funds. You can say okay I can go out and spend $3 this week, what can I get for $3. So just start small, and grow your kit over time," said Crosby."

Story highlights A new video by Gingrich's campaign depicts Santorum as a big spender
Santorum urges Alabama voters to help push Gingrich out of the race
Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi are among the next states to vote
Mitt Romney holds a growing lead in the delegate count
Republican front-runner Mitt Romney declared himself a bit of an outsider Thursday in the upcoming GOP primaries in Mississippi and Alabama, while Rick Santorum battled to emerge from the heart of Dixie as the surviving conservative challenger.
The two states are holding their presidential primaries Tuesday, along with caucuses to be held in Hawaii and American Samoa. Voters in Kansas and the Virgin Islands weigh in on Saturday.
Mississippi and Alabama have the potential to play a key role in the race. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, running well back of Romney and Santorum so far, recently canceled plans to stump for votes in Kansas and is focusing all of his attention on the two Deep South states.
Gingrich campaign spokesman R.C. Hammond told reporters Wednesday the former speaker -- who has only won South Carolina and his home state of Georgia so far -- needs to carry both states to remain a credible candidate.
The Gingrich campaign took aim at Santorum on Thursday with a new web video that depicted the former Pennsylvania senator as a big-spending Washington politician.
"Sen. Santorum poses as fiscally responsible, but he's the one who broke the bank while in Senate leadership," Joe DeSantis, the communications director for Newt 2012, said in a news release. "... As the poster child of the big government Republican Party that the American people rejected in 2006 and 2008, Sen. Santorum ... cannot offer the stark choice we need between President Obama's big-spending record."
Santorum, campaigning in Huntsville on Thursday, urged Alabama voters to help turn the contest into a two-man race between himself and the more moderate Romney, who has a big lead in delegates but continues to have trouble winning strong conservative support.
In many races so far, combining the support for Santorum and Gingrich would exceed the support for Romney, causing increased calls for one of the two conservative challengers to drop out.
"If you go out and deliver a conservative victory for us on Tuesday, this race will become a two-person race," Santorum said. "And when it becomes a two-person race for the Republican nomination, the conservative will win that nomination."
A pro-Santorum super PAC -- the Red, White and Blue Fund -- launched a Mississippi and Alabama ad buy Thursday worth as much as $600,000. The ad criticizes both Romney and Gingrich for their past stances on the politically contentious issue of health care reform.

Despite his primary wins and growing delegate lead, Romney has repeatedly shown weakness with Southerners, evangelicals and other voting blocs that make up the GOP base.
The former Massachusetts governor acknowledged during an interview Thursday with an Alabama radio host that the state's upcoming contest is "a bit of an away game."
But "I am confident we are going to get some delegates," he said "That's, of course, what this is all about."
He later told a crowd in Pascagoula, Mississippi, that he was starting to become more of a Southerner.
"I am learning to say 'y'all' and I like grits, and things, strange things, are happening to me," Romney joked.
According to CNN's latest count, Romney now has 429 delegates, compared with 169 for Santorum, 118 for Gingrich and 67 for Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. A candidate needs 1,144 delegates at the Republican convention this summer to secure the nomination to face President Barack Obama in November.
Romney significantly expanded his margin in the delegate hunt this week, carrying six of the 10 states up for grabs on Super Tuesday.
"Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of Gov. Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination," said Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director. "As Gov. Romney's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person's odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama's."
Among other things, Beeson noted there are now few major delegate prizes remaining, and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegates -- a reality that makes it hard to narrow Romney's lead.
"We think that will get done before the convention," Romney said in a CNBC interview Wednesday. "One thing I can tell you for sure is there's not going to be a brokered convention where some new person comes in and becomes the nominee. It's going to be one of the four people that are still running."
For their part, Santorum and Gingrich insist there is still an anti-Romney majority within the Republican Party that can unify in the weeks ahead.
"What Romney is trying to do is call the game before it's even halftime because he has a lead," Santorum adviser John Brabender said Wednesday, reacting to Beeson's argument about the delegate tally.
Romney wants to "disenfranchise Republican primary voters," Brabender asserted.
Former candidate Herman Cain, who has campaigned with Gingrich in recent weeks, also said it was premature to talk of anyone pulling out.
"Folks, only ⅓ of the delegates have been allotted! It's too soon to call on a candidate to withdraw from the race!" Cain posted on Twitter.
A 60-year-old cyclist has died after he was struck by a vehicle in the municipality of Clarington on Sunday morning.
Durham Regional Police say the accident happened just before 11 a.m. at the intersection of Bloor Street and Solina Road.
According to a police news release, a group of eight cyclists had been heading west along Bloor Street and intended to turn left onto Solina Road.
A westbound Pontiac Vibe attempted to pass the group in the adjacent eastbound lane. As that was happening, police say that one of the cyclists "suddenly turned" into the path of the Pontiac.
Police say the cyclist died en route to hospital. His name has not been released, but police say he is from Bowmanville.
The 21-year-old woman driving the vehicle was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
The collision remains under investigation. No charges have been laid so far.
Police say road conditions were favourable when the cyclist was struck.

Dejan Stankovic to join MLS. He will sign for Seattle or Toronto, according to Sky Italy — Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) June 7, 2013
Just a simple tweet from a decently reliable source suggesting that Dejan Stankovic could be trading in his place at Inter Milan for a club in MLS. Palmeri's tweet comes from a report that originated from Sky Italia. There are other sources reporting a similar story (primarily in Italian) with at least one outlet adding the Montreal Impact to the mix along with the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.
It is pretty clear that Stankovic's time at Inter Milan has come to an end. He only managed to make three appearances for the club this season even with Inter struggling to find results. It was not that long ago that he made 36 appearances in Inter's treble winning 2010-2011 campaign but since then he has seen his minutes dwindle and his role in the team become almost non-existent.
At this stage it does not seem that many clubs in Europe are interested in securing the services of the 34 year-old Serbian so MLS looks like a serious option for him to continue to his playing career. With his ability to play a variety of different positions in the midfield he could be a good option for a number of clubs including Toronto FC.
Stankovic could bring a fair bit of additional quality to Toronto's midfield but the problem for a lot of fans will be his age. At 34 years of age he likely only has a few years left in his playing career at best and TFC are not in a position to be bringing in players that will only help them in the short-term.
Heading to Montreal or Seattle would make a fair bit more sense because both clubs consider themselves to be among the contenders for this year's MLS Cup so adding quality in the short-term could be what puts them over the top. They are in a more competitive position than TFC and with Seattle's slow start behind them both clubs could be serious contenders. The Sounders might not have the cap space to make the move happen unless they make some moves out during the summer window as well.
If the list of possible destinations are TFC, Seattle, and Montreal than the name that immediately jumps out from the bunch is Montreal. It would be TFC if we were talking about a former Premier League player but since Stankovic is coming from Serie A he fits right into the model of the kind of player that the Impact have been signing this past year. They already have a collection of big named players from the league in Marco Di Vaio, Alessandro Nesta, Daniele Paponi, Andrea Pisanu, and Nelson Rivas all with the club already so adding Stankovic would just seem to fit with their approach to building a roster.
So Stankovic has been linked to Toronto FC by a couple of sources and it could prove to be something but the initial reaction is that it is not a move that makes a whole lot of sense for the club at this point in time. The resume on the player is nice with over 100 appearances for Serbia and over 360 Serie A appearances between Lazio and Inter Milan. He has been among the top players in the league for a long time but that is no longer the case.
Stankovic almost certainly still has the quality to be a contributor in MLS but the question would be how long he can keep going at a high level. If Stankovic can come in an turn back the clock like Di Vaio has with the Impact than he could contribute for a handful more years but that is probably the exception to the rule rather than the norm.
The last time Toronto went with an experienced but aging midfielder it was Torsten Frings who proved he could make a contribution when he was fully fit but injuries are always a concern with any players getting well into their thirties. Fans in Toronto saw that with Frings as he went from being a midfield general early in his time with the club to being injured more often than not. Fans also saw that one player, even one as good as Frings or Stankovic, is not going to be enough to turn a terrible squad around and turn them into a winner.
So the rumour is out there and it may well be true but at this point it is hard to see why bringing in Stankovic for a few seasons at most makes sense for Toronto FC. The club has left fans scratching their heads before though and it is clear they are still looking for midfield help so it is too early to rule anything out.
One of Ballard's most beloved restaurants is closing. But only temporarily.
“Our building is being sold,” Volterra co-owner Michelle Quisenberry told My Ballard. “We are actively looking for a new Ballard-area home.”
Volterra's last night will be New Years Eve, and every night until then, co-owner and chef Don Curtiss will be cooking.
“Please pop in to say hello and sign our legacy photo of Ballard Avenue that we'll hang in the new location,” Michelle and Don explain in a note to customers. “We've enjoyed watching Ballard Avenue and the surrounding community grow and thrive which is why we are excited to continue the Volterra legacy in a new Seattle home.”
On New Years Eve, Volterra will be serving three seatings: 5 p.m., 7 p.m. or 9:30 p.m.
Volterra opened in Ballard 13 years ago in a prime location on Ballard Ave., and it's received a variety of acclaim for its food, drinks and service. Rachael Ray even stopped by in 2008 to film an episode there. Michelle and Don opened another Volterra restaurant in Kirkland in 2012.
In an interview in Eater in 2015, Michelle looked back at 10 years in the neighborhood.
“We were really one of the anchor restaurants on Ballard Avenue, there was us and some of the old favorites like Bad Albert,” she said. “We were really the first kind of finer dining restaurant to make its way to Ballard. Over the past 10 years it's been amazing to see the growth and now there's, I can't even remember, I think there's a hundred restaurants in that area. So, it's becoming extremely popular and to watch the neighborhood transform has been really exciting.”
While Volterra moves to a new location, Michelle and Don invite their Ballard customers to join them at Volterra Kirkland. “You'll find the same menu and warm service that you've enjoyed in Ballard,” they write.
(This story originated from a post in the Ballard Facebook Group, which any current or former Ballard residents can join.)

We want to run this Impeachment ad on Tuesday, April 29 in Roll Call, the Capitol Hill paper ALL members of Congress and their staffs read avidly:
The ad answers House Speaker Pelosi's argument-echoed by many House members (perhaps your Representative)-that President Bush and Vice President Cheney will be out of office by January 30 “so why bother with impeachment?”
If House members don't “bother” with impeachment, they are permitting all the “high-crime precedents” that Nixon and Bush and Cheney have put in place to be used by future presidents. And those “Presidential Precedents” will nullify Congress, overthrow the Constitution and democracy-and set up a “unitary executive” dictatorship.
Impeachment NOW will stop these high-crime precedents-cold!!
This 1/4th page ad emphasizes “Presidential Precedents” to Congress. But it will cost $3,715 to appear in Roll Call. We need contributions NOW to cover that cost so your Congressional Representative will see it on Tuesday, April 29.

Alison Bender explains It's all about Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi ahead of Real Madrid and Barcelona's clash in El Clasico.
Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or in January, and since then his form has only gone even further off the scale. Thus he's currently the world's No. 1 player by a still greater distance.
Just as a matter of interest, his record in Clasicos is: played 21, won five, drawn six ... lost 10.
His former Manchester United teammate, Gerard Pique, on the other hand, can boast a ridiculously good stat. Since returning to Barcelona, the 27-year-old World Cup-winning defender has lost only four of his 20 matches against Madrid. He's won 11 and drawn five.
It appears he's the Clasico specialist.
Nevertheless, it has become fashionable not to recognise that after a tremendously debilitating hip fracture last season, and a faulty World Cup, Pique's fitness, athleticism and form are all on the rise. It's equally en vogue to put his every minor error under the microscope, to attribute opposition chances that stem from teammates' poor positional decisions to him -- it feels like open season.
"C'est la vie," says the Catalan.
It's the price one pays for being high-profile, for having played to the highest standard for years and then relaxed a little; it's the price of a personality who drives his competitive edge to reassert himself for club and country. And that gets him into the occasional situation on and off the pitch that he'd have done well to avoid.
In anticipation of the Clasico, his favourite day of the footballing year, he talks to ESPN FC about all of it: Madrid, Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo, his critics and the "Golden Manager" online football game he designed, which now employs 30 people during Spain's economic crisis.
Gerard Pique brushes off the criticism directed his way in the past 12 months, instead focusing on challenging himself to improve every day.
But first, the Clasico itself.
ESPN FC: The highest-profile new boy is Luis Suarez. How will the Clasico compare to what he's experienced in the Premier League?
Pique: In England, there are big games but nothing like the Clasico. Manchester United versus Liverpool is a really great match, probably the best over there. But Barcelona-Madrid is different to any other game in the world. This country just comes to a stop. There's such pressure. Everyone's talking about it for weeks before it happens and then for a week after it's played. It's brilliant that Suarez is free to play just when this match arrives. I don't know what he's expecting but he'll enjoy it.
ESPN FC: When it was Pep Guardiola versus Jose Mourinho, this match was immensely controversial. Did you enjoy that?
Pique: To be honest, I did. I think it's possible that [Madrid] crossed the line ... but we probably crossed it, too. It's just a game. If you know how to control your emotions then everything which happens on the pitch can stay on the pitch. It's vital to maintain your relationships because we all get on together for the national team. However, I love the competition. The historic rivalry. Playing Clasicos is exciting.
ESPN FC: Can you remember a time when the teams have had so many great strikers?
Pique: I think we are talking about the best ever. There was a time when Barcelona had [Brazilian] Ronaldo and Madrid had Raul, both at their peak, but even then you were talking about just a couple of super-talented strikers. To have three of those each at this level [speaking before Gareth Bale's injury] is amazing.
ESPN FC: What have the last few months been like for Suarez and the squad during his ban?
Pique: When he arrived, he'd not trained and wasn't playing -- he was "dead" after 10 minutes of training and I'd be like, "What's happened to you, man?!" But after two or three weeks he was fit and now he's really in shape. He showed that with his goals against Oman. But in training he's unbelievable. Luis has this thing ... let me put it like this: there'll be two or three rebounds off players when he dribbles in the box and suddenly the ball is still at his feet and he scores. He creates goals from absolutely nothing. This is a different style of player from what we have here. Guys like [Andres] Iniesta and Xavi are really sweet on the ball. You enjoy watching them. With Luis it's the opposite style -- he's fighting, he's working, but finally he scores the goal. Always.
ESPN FC: Football dressing rooms usually have a wicked sense of humour. Has he been teased?
Pique: Oh, yes! When we are jockeying for the ball, for example today in a training drill when I had to defend a cross and he had to attack it, I'll give it: "Hey! Don't bite me!" He just smiles. Luis knows it's not right to bite in a football match. It's happened, he apologised, he has to accept it and move on. In training he's so competitive, though. He gets a kick and he won't go down. Never. He just continues trying to score even if you kick him or pull his shirt.
ESPN FC: Not quite the reputation he had in England.
Pique: That's not surprising to me. In England if you "fall" one time then you carry that reputation. He's a fair player. All I can say is that in training he'll never go to the deck, he's always fighting to get a goal even if you foul him.
ESPN FC: Were you worried about his baggage when he signed?
Pique: I was really happy! I don't care if he bit someone in the past. He knows that is not the way and he's promised not to do it again. As a player, he's in the top three or four in the world so I'm really happy to have him in my team.
ESPN FC: He's reminiscent of Samuel Eto'o at his best with Barcelona?
Luis Suarez has slotted into Barcelona's squad with ease, earning high praise from numerous teammates.
Pique: Yes, because he pressures the defenders a lot, making it hard for them. If you are trying to find a good pass and you have this striker snapping at you all the time ... He tries to recuperate the ball as quickly as he can and, at the same time, he gives you a lot of goals. A really good signing.
ESPN FC: What about Madrid's attackers? Karim Benzema and Ronaldo are on terrific form right now. How do you play them?
Pique: They are really quick and powerful. If you are not alert they can destroy you. They really need Benzema because he drops to receive the ball and distribute it to Cristiano and Bale. Above all we must be really careful when we have possession. That moment you lose the ball you must be in the right position because if not they'll break, run powerfully, use the long ball and it's very difficult to catch them.
ESPN FC: Barcelona have only lost five of the last 17 Clasicos in Madrid, winning eight. In sports psychology terms, is it easier avoiding the pressure of the home game?
Pique: Maybe you are right. Perhaps [Madrid] prefer to play in the Camp Nou ... We like the away Clasicos and we get a lot of good results at the Bernabeu. The crowds here in Spain are not the same as in England, where they are very loud throughout the whole match and it makes a big difference to you ... even if you are losing. Here they show you their frustration, which isn't very helpful. I know they are just telling you what they want to see. That's perhaps why it's better to play away from home. If you are losing 1-0 you don't feel the same pressure.
ESPN FC: How are you coping with the fact that manager Luis Enrique is rotating you more than you are used to?
Pique: Nobody wants that. All I can do is show the coach that I don't need it, that I can play well every game. However, I like a challenge. There's a huge amount of competition at centre-back: [Marc] Bartra, [Jeremy] Mathieu, [Javier Mascherano], [Thomas] Vermaelen. I'm sure it will improve me.
ESPN FC: It's a testing moment for you.
Pique has not enjoyed as much playing time this season as in years past, accepting rotation among Barcelona's strong defence.
Pique: I've had a really good career. I had a great time at Manchester United, except that Rio [Ferdinand] and [Nemanja] Vidic never got injured, never got a damn red card! But right now I am facing a big challenge, yes. However, I'm happy with my performances this season, despite the fact that some people are saying, "Pique isn't fit, he's not playing well." The problem, I think, is that people assume I'm not fit because I'm on the bench so much. After the World Cup I admitted that perhaps I'd not been on my peak form. But I worked really hard from preseason training onwards and I'm happy with my form. I left a lot of friends in Manchester and was happy there. However, I've always said that I want to retire at the Camp Nou and right now I've no thought of leaving.
ESPN FC: Have Barcelona finally rediscovered their identity under Luis Enrique?
Pique: For the first four years after I returned, we played the best football I can remember. Now it's a bit more difficult because we haven't played as well. It's really difficult to keep that level. But with Luis Enrique we've changed the mentality and we are pressing really high again. The first two, three seconds when the opposition takes the ball off us they have to suffer a lot because our strikers really press them. This helps the back four, in particular. It's not the same when the other team have time to think so that they can put a good ball in behind us. It's what happened the last couple of years. Now when we press as a team it's much easier for the defenders.
ESPN FC: So for all the talk about the quality in the teams, it's pressing that really counts?
Pique: Obviously when you win titles the stars are the strikers, then when you don't win a title it's because of the defenders, not the strikers! Football works like this!
ESPN FC: This is your first season since your partner in crime, Carles Puyol, retired. You must miss playing with him.
Pique: The whole team misses him. He was the captain for a lot of years. One of the most important players in the history of the club, and to not have him is difficult. But "Puyi" has stayed at the club to help [director of football Andoni Zubizarreta]. I see Puyi every two or three days. He watches training. I find it helpful to speak to him.
ESPN FC: You are a businessman now, employing more than 30 people via the "Golden Manager" online football game that you created and designed. Is it important for you to have diverse interests outside football?
Carles Puyol was Pique's wingman since returning from Manchester United in 2008 until the former captain retired after last season.
Pique: When I moved here I had a great relationship with Puyol, who had been 100 percent football -- no life, just football 24 hours per day. I always had a lot on my mind -- ideas like "Golden Manager." We became great friends and took a lot from each other's personalities. It's essential to have equilibrium in your life. After a bad game, for example, you're stuck at home just thinking about your mistakes, and that's not good for you. "Golden Manager" now has 4 million people playing it, it's a year and a half old and in November it'll launch for mobiles and tablets rather than PC. I'm in my office twice or three times a week putting time into the company.
ESPN FC: OK, then, who do you put in your "Golden Manager" starting XI? No evasiveness. Name names!
Pique: Yes, I have Cristiano! It doesn't matter if he plays for Madrid! If my players give me wins and good results, that's all that counts. Leo [Messi] is in, obviously. I'd pick Leo and Cristiano for sure. I had [Wayne] Rooney in the team but now I have Luis Suarez. So Rooney is on the bench. He'll play sometimes; I make rotations.
ESPN FC: Cesc Fabregas, as a close friend, is another loss for you. But he's flying at Chelsea.
Pique: He loves London and he's playing well. I don't know if he loves Mourinho but he must do because he's playing every game! He hates missing playing time, and here at Barcelona it was difficult for him. It was one of the toughest decisions of his life to leave for a second time, but Arsenal told him, "We don't need you," and now it's obvious he's made the right choice.

Look! It's an extra cuddly edition of God Seven! XD (aka Luciel/707/Saeyoung)
Seven's by far the most popular RFA boy so I really hope I did him enough justice! (my poor Jumin! 80% comments on him was about Seven T_____T")
He was quite fiddly to plush with all his accessories and like Zen, a big messy mop of hair xD. Regardless, I still had a blast making him. My favourite part was working with all those bright and vivid colours.
Anyway, that completes the RFA boys! (... well... except V...) I'd love to do a group photo of them all together sometime ^____^
Details:
Material - cuddle 3 shannon minky, 40% wool blend felt
Height - about 10" tall
Machine embroidered details
Plush pattern and embroidery designed by me (sorry, I don't distribute my plush patterns publicly)

The next guy I'd been planning to plush was Saeran (time to whip out that airbrush!), but his design is quite similar to Seven so I'm thinking of plushing Jisoo from Dandelion first instead...? Or Jiwoo? Hmm...

Also there's the commission opening that I've been promising everyone... LOL! There's been a lot of interest in these dolls, but I suspect a lot of the demand will die down once I announce my pricing.
Just some food for thought, I put a lot of effort and time into these dolls. Each doll takes at least 30 hours to design and sew, so the pricing will reflect that. I'm thinking at least $300-400NZD depending on complexity.
My current plan is to open 1 slot per Mystic Messenger RFA boy (Yoosung, Jumin, Zen, 707)
I will also open 1 slot for any human character (doesn't have to be from Mystic Messenger)
That makes 5 total slots
Expected wait time per plush is 6-8 weeks, so I will need to put everyone down on a list
If there's too much interest for one character, I will need to do a random draw.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price made two claims about opioid addiction that are contradicted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of the department Price heads.
Price made his claims on May 9 while in West Virginia, the state with the highest rate of opioid-related overdoses in the country.
Price said, “Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society.” But there is currently no cure for addiction to opioids, or any other drug. The NIDA says “addiction is treatable and can be successfully managed.”
Speaking about treatment, Price claimed, “If we're just substituting one opioid for another, we're not moving the dial much.” But using opioids such as buprenorphine to combat addiction to more dangerous opioids including heroin is effective, say experts and the NIDA.
While there is no cure for opioid addiction, medication-assisted treatments, including other opioids, “save lives” and “help to stabilize individuals, allowing treatment of their medical, psychological, and other problems so they can contribute effectively as members of families and of society,” says the NIDA.
Nationally, the rate of opioid-related deaths increased from around 3 per 100,000 people in 2000 to more than 10 per 100,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 33,000 people died of opioid-related overdoses in 2015 alone. This includes both illicit opioids such as heroin and prescription opioids including oxycodone and hydrocodone.
Cure for Addiction?
Price visited Charleston, West Virginia, on a “‘listening tour' that aims to gather solutions to the nation's opioid drug crisis,” reported the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The newspaper said that Price “touted faith-based programs, while showing less support for medication-assisted programs,” when asked about drug-treatment options.
Price, May 9: If we're just substituting one opioid for another, we're not moving the dial much. Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.
According to experts, including the HHS' own drug abuse agencies, substance use disorder can be successfully treated, but it can't be cured. This is because of the way addiction affects the psychology and brain of an individual.
First, to be diagnosed with opioid addiction, or substance use disorder more broadly, an individual must meet at least two out of 11 criteria, including developing a tolerance to a drug, experiencing withdrawal symptoms after not taking a drug and not fulfilling responsibilities because of drug use.
Developing a tolerance to opioids means the same amount of the drug will produce less of a euphoric effect. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, sweating, muscle aches, diarrhea and vomiting.
After a person develops a physiological dependence on a drug, tolerance and withdrawal make it difficult to quit, Hilary Smith Connery, an expert in the treatment of opioid use disorders at Harvard Medical School, told us over the phone. But drug addiction is also a psychological disorder.
“We have no cure for substance abuse disorder in general” because it “lives” in a person's “memories,” she told us. Even after they've stopped taking a drug and withdrawal symptoms subside, people have “triggers associated with the addiction process” that might cause an otherwise drug-free person to use again, she added. Triggers might include seeing a drug-using friend or a specific place where drug use took place, or being in an emotional state, such as stress or depression.
In other words, there's “no cure” for drug addiction, “because you can't undo memories,” Connery said.
Chronic drug-use, including opioid use, also changes the brain, experts have found.
To produce their euphoric effect, opioids affect the levels of dopamine in the brain, a chemical vital to what scientists call the reward circuitry. These neural pathways regulate a person's motivation and incentive to repeat a certain act, let it be eating a particular food, doing a drug or having sex.
Over time, drug use can change how these neural circuits function, making it more difficult for individuals to experience pleasure without the drug, manage stress and control impulses, says the NIDA. “These changes can remain long after you stop using the drug,” adds the Mayo Clinic.
Connery also drew parallels between substance use disorder and type 2 diabetes — a comparison other researchers have made as well.
For one, like type 2 diabetes, substance use disorder doesn't come about solely because of a person's choices or environment — an individual's genetics may make him or her more susceptible to addiction. Researchers have linked multiple genes to opioid addiction.
Type 2 diabetes, like substance use disorder, is also a chronic condition that can be successfully treated, but not cured.
Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can't produce enough insulin, a hormone, or becomes resistant to insulin. But by eating healthy, exercising and potentially taking medication, the level of insulin in the body can be kept “closer to normal,” says the Mayo Clinic.
Similarly, “Overcoming an addiction and staying drug-free require a persistent effort,” explains the Mayo Clinic. As we'll discuss in the next section, treatment for drug addiction includes taking medications, seeing a therapist or joining a support group.
Medication-Assisted Treatment Works
Connery, who treats opioid addicts, said both type 2 diabetes and substance use disorder are “lethal,” yet doctors don't “withhold life-saving medications” from diabetics. Access to medications for addiction patients, however, is limited.
The NIDA points out that less than half of “privately-funded substance use disorder treatment programs offer” medication-assisted treatment and a third of “patients with opioid dependence at these programs actually receive it.” The agency adds, “Nearly all U.S. states do not have sufficient treatment capacity to provide [medication-assisted treatment] to all patients with an opioid use disorder.”
Yet “the science is so clear — addicts have at least double the chance of becoming opioid-free” with medication, in particular methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, Connery said.
But these three medications are different. For one, methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, while naltrexone is not.
However, methadone and buprenorphine are long-acting opioids. Heroin, on the other hand, is a short-acting opioid, especially when injected intravenously.
This means methadone and buprenorphine stave off withdrawal by delivering patients a smaller amount of the opioid over time, instead of causing a strong euphoric effect by activating the dopamine pathways in the brain quickly.
In this way, doctors can ease addicts through withdrawal slowly with these medications, Connery explained.
Doctors also use methadone and buprenorphine over the long-term to prevent addicts from returning to illicit opioid use, which poses greater health risks.
For example, the NIDA cites studies that show medication-assisted treatment decreases “opioid use, opioid-related overdose deaths, criminal activity, and infectious disease transmission.”
One study, conducted by Robert P. Schwartz, the medical director of Friends Research Institute in Baltimore, and others, showed that lethal heroin overdoses decreased after buprenorphine became available in Baltimore in 2003. The average annual number of overdoses in the city was 37 percent lower for 2003 and 2009 compared with 1995 to 2002.
Published in the American Journal of Public Health in May 2013, the study's results paralleled a study conducted in France in 2004, which also found reductions in opioid overdose deaths after the introduction of buprenorphine.
Naltrexone, which is not an opioid, helps addicts fight addiction differently than methadone and buprenorphine. It prevents a person from feeling high, even if the person does take an opioid. For this reason, it's mainly used to prevent relapse after an addict becomes clean. As Connery explained, it “helps breaks the psychological process” because an addict knows there's “no chance I can get high today,” even if he or she tried.
In a comment to STAT News, Alleigh Marre, Price's spokesperson, said that in West Virginia, Price highlighted vivitrol, which is a form of naltrexone, and not an opioid, as a potential treatment. Marre said that Price supported “expanding access to treatment and recovery services, including medication-assisted treatment.” Marre also said Price was generally making the point that “what's right for one person isn't necessarily right for another person” when it comes to treatment for opioid addiction.
Connery agrees with Price that choosing treatment entails “looking at a particular individual, and asking questions like: Are they motivated to change? Do they have a support system? Are they court mandated to attend treatment?”
In other words, while some patients may only use behavioral therapy, other patients might use multiple medications in the course of their recovery. But overall, “it's really not good practice, actually it's unethical, to not offer someone” medication-assisted treatment, including methadone and buprenorphine, Connery said.
Connery elaborated on the point of individualized treatment in a review paper published in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry in March 2015.
If there is a high risk that a person will drop out of treatment, given his or her individual circumstances, the “evidence … significantly favors” using methadone because it has the “highest patient retention rates in all studies comparing methadone to buprenorphine,” Connery wrote.
On the other hand, an individual who is addicted to both opioids and alcohol “might benefit most” from naltrexone because the Food and Drug Administration has approved it as “preventing relapse to alcohol use,” in addition to opioids, she added.
But these drugs do have their downsides, Connery explained to us over the phone.
Since methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, when patients eventually decide to come off them, they could re-experience withdrawal. Some individuals might also try to “override” naltrexone's blockage of the effect of opioids and risk overdosing, she added.
This is why treatment for opioid addiction can't just involve these medications.
“[O]pioid abuse and dependence are most effectively treated through a set of comprehensive medical, social, psychological and rehabilitative services that address all the needs of the individual,” write Thomas F. Kresina and Robert Lubran in a review paper published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in October 2011.
Kresina is a senior public health adviser at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, while Lubran is the former director of the Division of Pharmacologic Therapies at SAMHSA. Like the NIDA, SAMHSA is a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, which Price heads.
The NIDA agrees that “[m]edications should be combined with behavioral counseling for a ‘whole patient' approach” to treating opioid addiction.
In short, Price's claim that “substituting one opioid for another” doesn't move “the dial much” runs counter to the scientific evidence backing the effectiveness of methadone and buprenorphine in treating opioid addiction — evidence cited by agencies within his own department. However, Price is right that non-opioid medications such as vivitrol can help addicts recover as well.
Price also was inaccurate when he said, “Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.” There is no cure for drug addiction. Medication-assisted treatment, on the other hand, can “help to stabilize individuals,” eventually allowing them to “contribute effectively as members of families and of society,” writes the NIDA.

Financial Impact of the Ray Rice Situation
With new video surfacing amidst the Ray Rice domestic violence saga, it's looking more and more like the best case scenario for the Baltimore Ravens will be to cut ties with the once All-Pro running back. We'll take a look from the financial side of things how this might turn out for both parties.
2014 marks year three of his 5 year $35 million contract with the Ravens. The deal contained $15 million in initially guaranteed money which came entirely in the form of a signing bonus (paid in 2012). Last season, a $7 million option bonus was exericsed. To date Rice has been paid $25M of the $35M associated with this contract.
The 2-game suspension cost Rice $470,588 from his $4 million 2014 base salary, a figure that is subtracted for both cash and cap purposes this year. This leaves $9,529,412 in remaining salary to be earned from 2014-2016 – NONE of which is guaranteed.
Implications For Releasing Rice
Should the Ravens bite the bullet and release Ray Rice in the coming days, as it currently stands they would be on the hook for $14,250,000 in un-allocated cap dollars from the signing and option bonuses. This dead money would be split up as $4,750,000 in 2014 and $9,500,000 in 2015. Keep in mind these figures represent salary cap only – not cash to be paid to Rice. These bonuses have both been paid in full as of last season.
The remaining room for wiggle comes from the $15 million signing bonus paid in 2012. Article 4, Section 9 of the current CBA allows teams the option to recoup a portion of a player's bonus money should they commit a “forfeitable breach” to their current contract (by way of retirement, suspension, etc.). However, this only applies to the Signing bonus – NOT the option bonus (one of the reasons fewer teams are utilizing option bonuses in their recent contract extensions).
The CBA states that the Ravens can recoup up to 25% of the unallocated dollars for a given season. With Rice currently suspended just two games, mathematically this means 2/17th of his $3 million pro-rated signing bonus for 2014 – or $352,941. Again, this isn't a required pay-back, simply an option the Ravens have (and will most likely exercise).
Ravens Salary Cap Going Forward
Accounting for the dead cap releasing Ray Rice will incur, the Ravens will clear the $3,529,412 in salary from their 2014 salary cap. The $9.5M added to the 2015 salary cap is an increase of $1.75M to Rice's current 2015 cap figure – a tough pill to swallow. The Ravens' 2016 salary cap will not incur any charges, meaning the $7.75M currently allocated to Rice will be removed in its entirety.
Regardless of what happens in the coming days, Rice has already earned $28,194,000 on the field in with the Ravens, a figure that may be a final total for his NFL career going forward.

Microservice pitfalls from Mite Mitreski
The conference
As for the full conference it was great to meet up with BG-JUG folks like Ivan St. Ivanov, Mihail Stoynov, Martin Tosev and improve the cooperation between JUGMK and BG-JUG.
There were also the standard visitor's Josh Long and Andrew Lombardi who are there to stay :
I got to meet with John Davis and learn how others use archaic tuple space technologies and how the banking world functions. Overall it was a great experience and even though at time some of the conference topics were overly light or outdated for my taste but the social aspect of it was more than sufficient to cover any shortcomings on the technical side.
For example Mani Sarkar had a great talk on "Learning the two Ts", it was great to meet up with him as well.
One other positive trend that is happening this year is we had the record number of JUGMK speakers and participants on Java2Days. The same trend is also on other conferences and is a great thing to see.
The JUG Factor
I know I'm forgetting someone to mentions, but overall an interesting social experience and a great meetup.

This my 5-th year in a row where together with jugmk attend Java2days , a conference in Sofia, Bulgaria. While not so obvious from the name it is a 2-day java conference and currently the biggest one near us that we can take a bus to go to.This year I had a talk titledor buzz words and hate words all in one.My talk this year was about microservices even though it had a long title with lots of strange words it was more of a concepts talk.I gave a basic introduction into what reactive programming means for different people, the reactive manifesto and of course Microsoft Excel.Next part was to define what microservies are and what they can be for different organization.The Unix aspect of microservices had to be covered so I did just that.My goal with the talks was not really to compare frameworks for this or that, but I just gave a short overview of what ideas are behind the development of some libraries.The last major section was the real conclusion phase called how not to fail at microservices.I gave some recommendations from my personal experience as well as references to important books on the subject.One of them available on early access:And also the famous Release It books which covers some of the scenarios that are essential for microservice development.My main take out from the talk was:Here are the full slides of the talk:
THE TINY Raspberry Pi computer is being employed along with music streaming service Spotify to power a "Twitter Jukebox" put together by carmaker Volvo.
The project is part of Volvo's promotion of its in-car voice activated Spotify feature at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, and is allowing visitors to tweet songs and artists with the hashtag #VolvoConnected so the track will then automatically be added to a playlist and boomed out at the company's stand.
The technology works via the Raspberry Pi Foundation's mini PC, with a server pulling in tweets using the hashtag and then matching the song selection through Spotify. An external monitor is hooked up to display the artist, song choice and the name of the person who made the request.
@VolvoCarUK is updating the #VolvoConnected hashtag regularly on Twitter, posting "now playing" to let entrants who aren't attending the festival know if their track has been imposed on the ears of attendees.
So far the service has seen quite a varied collection of requests such as Pink Floyd, Jamie Cullum and Rick Astley.
#VolvoConnected Dani Tzukerman Of Dilogent Souls With hairy Balls — Dave McInnes (@DaveMcInnes) July 12, 2013
Those attending Goodwood without a Twitter account are able to add a song selection to the playlist via a touchscreen display, and the tune will be played through speakers at the stand.
Those who make use of the device will also be placed into the drawing for a Spotify premier membership, worth a tenner a month.
Below is a video showing how the project is set up and how it works at the festival, with some people awkwardly dancing alongside it. µ
Athlon's College Football top 25 countdown for 2012 continues with No. 14 Nebraska. The Cornhuskers return 14 starters, including running back Rex Burkhead and quarterback Taylor Martinez. The defense returns most of its core, but must replace linebacker Lavonte David and cornerback Alfonzo Dennard.
Is Nebraska's Taylor Martinez One of the Big Ten's Top Quarterbacks?
David Fox (@DavidFox615)
Letâs consider the field for a moment: Denard Robinson is a clear No. 1 in the Big Ten. After that, who should we consider? Iowaâs James Vandenberg is the next best passer. Ohio Stateâs Braxton Miller has the most potential. Northwesternâs Kain Colter was a supersub for Dan Persa. Minnesotaâs MarQueis Gray is a fantastic runner but still struggling as a passer. Wisconsinâs Danny OâBrien was last seen losing his job at Maryland. Although Martinez struggled to remain in the conversation for the second tier of Big Ten quarterbacks last season, he is poised for a better season in 2012. His numbers regressed in some areas as a sophomore, but thatâs not a shock. He was dynamic early in his freshman season in 2011 against weaker competition before returning to Earth in a second half hampered by injuries. In 2012, Martinez will have two years of starting experience under his belt, one year of experience against Big Ten opponents, one of the Big Tenâs the best receiver groups, plus all the ability to be one of the nationâs best dual-threat quarterbacks. All the pieces are in place for Martinez to have a breakout year. Still, Nebraska doesnât necessarily need Martinez to be an All-America quarterback, since running back Rex Burkhead is the likely centerpiece of this offense. Martinez simply needs to be very good, limiting mistakes and turnovers. That might not be enough to be a national superstar, but it will be enough to keep Nebraska in contention for a Big Ten title. By his junior year, Martinez should be up to the challenge.

Will he be the Big Ten's best quarterback in 2012? No. Can he lead his team to a Big Ten title by playing efficient and composed football within the framework of the offense thus making him one of the best? Absolutely. He had mental toughness and maturity issues in his first season under center back in 2010. And Martinez possibly took too much blame for the public dust-up with head coach Bo Pelini against Texas A&M considering he was a redshirt freshman â and that Pelini has a tendency to blow a gasket. Martinez also showed flashed of brilliant athletic ability and play-making skill. It appears he conquered those woes, as well as mastering the playbook, in year No. 2 as the starter in Lincoln while still exhibiting one of the quickest first five yards of any signal caller in the nation.
Now he faces his biggest challenge yet: Refining his accuracy in order to consistently and efficiently complete key passes in key situations. Easier said than done. T-Magic has never completed 60% of his passes and has dedicated his off-season work to honing his throwing motion and developing proper footwork. No one expects Martinez to be a pocket-passer with perfect drops, but should he simply improve his accuracy and protect the football, year No. 3 under center will easily be his best. It is the next step in his development process and it isn't an unreasonable expectation. Nebraska features one of the nation's elite tailbacks and arguably the Big Ten's top pass-catching corps, so, with his ability to make game-changing plays on the ground, there is no reason Martinez can't simple manage games through the air. If he can do this, Nebraska could be headed to Pasadena.

Thereâs not a lot of turnover among Big Ten quarterbacks, but some of the conferenceâs best (Kirk Cousins, Russell Wilson and Dan Persa) are gone. Denard Robinson should be the Big Tenâs preseason first-team all-conference quarterback, but after that is where the debate gets interesting.
Ohio Stateâs Braxton Miller is going to emerge as a star in Urban Meyerâs spread offense and even though he didnât turn in an overwhelming performance last year, he has to be considered for the No. 2 spot. Outside of Miller, Iowaâs James Vandenberg, Martinez and Minnesotaâs MarQueis Gray could be the top options to rank No. 3 among the quarterbacks for the 2012 season. Vandenberg is coming off a solid season, but the offensive line is a question mark, while top target Marvin McNutt is gone. Gray showed progress last season, but needs to develop as a passer.
When you look at the field, itâs easy to see why Martinez should be one of the top quarterbacks in the Big Ten this year. Sure, heâs had his ups and downs, but Martinez is entering his third year as the starter and threw only one interception over the final five games of last season. His rushing ability makes him one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks in college football, but how much he can improve as a passer will determine how high Nebraska can climb in the Big Ten standings.
Martinez is putting in extra work on his passing skills and drew positive reviews throughout spring. Nebraska also returns one of the Big Ten's top receiving corps for 2012. The lack of other options certainly help Martinez's case, but all of the pieces seem to be in place for the junior to have a career year.
Mark Ross
In terms of where we stand and what we know right now I would say yes, but in Martinez's case, that distinction is due more to the lack of quality quarterbacks in the Big Ten more than anything else. Michigan's Denard Robinson, Ohio State's Taylor Braxton and Martinez are probably considered to the top three signal callers in the Big Ten this season. All three are similar in style in that they can beat you with their arm or their legs, although with varying degrees of success.
Robinson finished ahead of the other two last season and fourth in the Big Ten in passing efficiency with a completion rate of a little better than 55 percent and despite throwing 15 interceptions compared to 20 touchdowns. Miller completed fewer passes and had a much better touchdown-to-interception ratio (13:4), but he also attempted the fewest passes of the three by far. Martinez had the best completion percentage of the trio (56.3) and attempted the most passes (288 to Robinson's 258), but had 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Of the three, Miller is in a position to make the greatest leap in production this season as the sophomore will be running new Buckeyes' head coach Urban Meyer's spread system, the same system that helped Tim Tebow develop into a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback during Meyer's tenure at Florida.
That said, Martinez also could continue to improve in his own right, but in the end, the fact he is considered one of the Big Ten's best under center in 2012 is probably more an indication of who's no longer around, namely Wisconsin's Russell Wilson, Michigan State's Kirk Cousins, and Northwestern's Dan Persa. That also doesn't mean that Martinez won't be outplayed at his position this season by Illinois' Nathan Scheelhaase or Iowa's James Vandenberg or someone else, showing just how precarious the Nebraska junior's top-tier "status" in the Big Ten is, and it's only May.
Patrick Snow (@AthlonSnowman)
I think itâs fair to say that Martinez is one of the best signal callers in the Big Ten, but he will have to become a more efficient passer to reach elite status in the conference and nationally. T-Magic is at his best running the ball, and his speed and athleticism have produced an outstanding 1,839 yards and 21 touchdowns on the ground over the last two seasons. However, the NU quarterback had a meager completion percentage of 56.3 without enough big plays during the 2011 campaign. If coordinator Tim Beck puts less emphasis on quarterback runs due to schematic decisions or to protect Martinezâ 6-foot-1, 200-pound frame, the Nebraska offense could become extremely predictable.
As good as tailback Rex Burkhead is, the Huskers need their quarterback play to improve to contend for the league crown and/or the BCS. In double-digit losses to Wisconsin, Michigan and South Carolina last season, Martinez completed a combined 30 passes and ran for less than 150 yards total. The NU staff and others have worked with the California native on his passing and mechanics, and marked improvement could lead to big results for Bo Peliniâs team. Martinez will always be a threat on the ground, and I think heâll become an effective enough passer to be among the Big Tenâs the best QBs.

Al Pacino is back on Broadway, or so I hear. I wouldn't know from firsthand experience. Unlike the many thousands of theatergoers who have seen Mr. Pacino in the revival of David Mamet's “Glengarry Glen Ross,” making it the highest-grossing straight play currently on Broadway, critics have not been invited to attend until later this week, more than six weeks after the show began previews.
It was not supposed to be this way. Originally the production, which also stars Bobby Cannavale (or so I've heard) and is directed by Daniel Sullivan, was scheduled to open on Nov. 11, after a little more than three weeks of previews, which is generally the norm for play revivals on Broadway.
Then along came Sandy, and suddenly the opening was postponed — not for a day or two, as you might expect, given that Broadway shows missed only a couple of performances because of the hurricane. Instead the producers announced that the official opening would be bounced back almost a month. The new opening is this weekend. Afterward, critics will finally weigh in with their opinions on what is without question one of the most highly anticipated shows of the fall season.
By that late date, you may reasonably ask, who will care what the critics have to say?
I suspect that the producers asked themselves that very question before announcing the postponement.
The show will have played a full half of its run — it is scheduled to close at the end of January — without having to face any official critical scrutiny, an extremely rare, if not unprecedented, situation on Broadway. (That's discounting shows that close quickly in response to critical brickbats.)
I am not the only Broadway watcher to smell a rat in this highly unusual delay. Jeremy Gerard, the theater critic and editor for Bloomberg, decided to go ahead and file a review shortly after the show's first announced opening date, reasoning that with orchestra tickets running $167 a pop (the top price is a staggering $377), it was in the public interest to allow theatergoers the benefit of some critical advice. (While praising some aspects, he said that over all the production was “stilted and self-conscious.”)
Not that theatergoers seem particularly interested in heeding critical advice when it comes to star-driven vehicles. As Michael Riedel in The New York Post and Mr. Gerard both noted, on the strength of the Pacino name, “Glengarry Glen Ross” had already been selling tickets at a fast clip, racking up an advance of several million dollars — almost unheard-of for a straight play on Broadway.
A couple of seasons ago, you may recall, a similar brouhaha erupted over the opening date of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” the troubled musical that pushed back its official opening more than once. In that case, there were legitimate technical problems that I think warranted giving the producers the benefit of the doubt — at least until the second (or was it the third?) postponement, when most publications (including The New York Times) decided that enough was enough, and sent their critics to cover the show before its last opening date.
But it seems to me that the case of “Glengarry” is an even more egregious attempt to avoid critical scrutiny for mercenary reasons. The explanations given for the delay — the necessity for more rehearsal time — ring pretty hollow, considering that the show had already been in rehearsal for weeks before it began previews, and had been open to the public for three weeks already.
Sure, shows are always in the process of refinement during previews, and casts are rehearsing changes during the day that are incorporated into the show at night. But “Glengarry” is not a new play; Mr. Sullivan is a highly proficient director; and the show's cast is made up of sterling stage performers. In theory, all artists would probably like the luxury of running for a couple of months before opening their doors to critics, but few to none have the comfortable cushion of cash that “Glengarry” has amassed.
The decision to postpone was, in my view, a cynical move inspired by the knowledge that good critical notices couldn't possibly make the show a hotter ticket — it was a hot ticket already — and while bad ones might slightly have dampened sales, more crucially, they might also put the actors in a bit of a funk.
(Jeffrey Richards, the show's lead producer, denied that quality was an issue. He also pointed to the absence of viable opening dates in the period between the originally scheduled opening and this weekend, an argument that seemed spurious to me.)
And why do that to the cast, after the trauma of Sandy? After all, Mr. Pacino is reportedly making only $125,000 a week, so he's practically doing pro bono work here. Why not keep the star philanthropist coddled, free from the burning wounds of reviewers' potentially unkind words?
What's most galling about the postponement: the crass attempt to attribute a decision that I suspect was inspired by other factors to the disruption caused by the hurricane — a calamity that claimed many lives and caused billions of dollars in damage across the Eastern seaboard. In a word: tacky.
I won't be reviewing the show, by the way, so I don't really have a dog in this fight. But it's dispiriting that producers seem so determined to marginalize the voices of reviewers. Although artists and critics are hardly natural allies, a vigorous public discourse about theater — and that necessarily means an assessment of its quality — is vital to the health of the art form that supports them both. The “Glengarry” postponement moves Broadway one step closer to a state of celebrity-fueled decadence that may not be reversible.

Why lumberjacks really more manly than footballers: Chopping wood 'produces 15% more testosterone than competitive sports'
Research carried out by anthropologists Ben Trumble and Michael Gurven
They found that a physically demanding task critical to farming and food production results in greater levels of testosterone
Football resulted in a 30.1 per cent increase in testosterone compared to chopping wood which resulted in a 46.8 per cent
Chopping wood makes you more manly than playing football, according to new research.
Anthropologists Ben Trumble and Michael Gurven from the University of California have been studying a group of forager-farmers in central Bolivia.
They found that a physically demanding task that is critical to successful farming and food production, results in greater levels of testosterone compared with playing competitive sports like football.
Chopping wood makes you more manly than playing football, according to new research
With football, there was a 30.1 per cent increase in testosterone but chopping wood resulted in a 46.8 per cent increase.
The research appears in an early online edition of the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour.
According to Trumble, testosterone levels are closely related to the availability of food energy.
When young men skip even a single meal, their testosterone levels can drop as much as 10 per cent.
Fast for a couple of days and they decrease to castrate levels.
Researchers found a physically demanding task critical to successful farming and food production, results in greater levels of testosterone compared to activities like football
An infection from a pathogen or parasite and even injuries such as burns or surgery also decreases levels of testosterone.
The body uses food to build muscle mass and maintain a healthy immune system.
When food energy is low, the body must choose between one or the other.
Trumble said: 'I can go to the grocery store and gather 20,000 calories in 10 minutes without breaking a sweat. I don't have to worry about a deficit.
Savers are being lured into lending cash through money-exchange loans websites just as losses from other customers start to climb.
Zopa, the UK's largest money exchange ‘peer-to-peer' website, has seen a sharp rise in the number of borrowers failing to repay debts.
For every £1,000 a saver lends to a borrower, £9 will go unpaid — up from £7 18 months ago. This cuts into the returns of the lender, who offers their money at rates of around 6.5 per cent.
Peer-to-peer lending: Savers are lending more cash then ever - just as number of borrowers failing to repay debts rises
And smaller sites have seen much higher rates of default. Yes-Secure's average bad debts are at 7.22 per cent, which leaves investors running the risk of losing more than £70 for every £1,000 lent.
Peer-to-peer websites allow borrowers who might not be able to get cheap loans from banks to borrow money directly from other consumers.
Instead of placing your cash in a deposit account, you ‘lend' your savings to online borrowers at an interest rate of your choice, from 6 per cent to as high as 25 per cent.
Last month, we revealed how peer-to-peer website Quakle closed down, leaving hundreds of lenders in the dark over whether they had lost their cash.
But while concerns are growing about the returns given by these companies, some are seeking alternative ways to encourage new customers to lend.

Who am I?
I'm a dude with a dope ass beard, that's who I am. 2 years ago, I began my journey when I crossed paths with a patch of daisies. I picked those daisies and gently placed them in my beard. Little did I know, those daisies would some day change my life.
Day 1
I started thinking...what else can I stick in this thing? (That's what she said)
If you haven't seen my work, please check some of it out below. You'll see that I've got a pretty unique approach to the beard game. I try to keep it fresh and lighthearted. And silly. And dangerous. And sexy.
Beardsgiving
Why I Need You Guys:
Recently, it's been getting more attention and people have been requesting that I do certain themes for them. I would absolutely love to fulfill all those requests but as you can guess, every photo costs money and they can get pretty time consuming.
Happy Bearday!
The thing is, I know I'm on to something. In a little over 3 months I've garnered several thousands of followers on social media and have been written about on BuzzFeed and MTV. All of this was accomplished with just a simple idea and a supporting girlfriend with a camera.
People are really liking what I'm doing. And personally, I've never felt so good about a project. Every holiday, I wake up with a huge grin, and an enormous sense of optimism.
Beardster Bunnies
So I need to keep going. I genuinely believe that this thing can become huge, on a national level. You know what, maybe even on a global level. I bet all of Europe would go nuts over this shit.
But to continue, I'm going to need funding. And to evolve and grow as an artist, everything needs to be elevated. I need a way to increase my production value, both creatively, and in the quality of the photo. Every photo has been made in or around my apartment standing in front of something that happens to match or laying down on the grass and throwing in a couple of relevant ornaments. I can only imagine what access to more creative freedom would do for me.
Beardy Halloween!
So I'm coming to you. Together, I know we can pull this off. And I know it will be awesome.
What are you funding?
You are letting me continue my quest to change the beard game forever.
I want to make a high quality Coffee Table Book with a different holiday or themed decoration on every page.
Happy New Beard!
Inherent in making this book are costs. Here's a brief look at what I mean.
Production - These will unquestionably be the biggest costs. I want to create some of the most unforgettable photos in the history of beards. To do that properly, it's going to require some serious resources. A coffee table book will cost me money in acquiring necessary equipment, paying my photographer, editing, printing, and publishing.
Creative - I'll need to hire an art department to collaborate with me in handling the ornament shopping and the creative decorating. I also want to have a few more bearded gentlemen so my face doesn't get super annoying.
Beardependence Day!
The more money I get, the more photos I can take, and the CRAZIER these photos can become. We live in America, people. So with ample funding, there's really nothing that can't be done. What do you guys want to see? I'll make it happen.
Trust me, I'll make my next round of photos unforgettable if I can get the funding to do so.
Target Corporation issued an apology after using an unflattering descriptor to note the color of a plus-size dress available for purchase on its website—an oversight that blew up on Twitter.Target shopper and self-described “digital maven” Susan Clemens was apparently shopping on the Minneapolis-based retailer's website on Tuesday when she noticed that the same style of dress in the exact same color was labeled differently depending on the size. The color was called “manatee grey” for the plus-sized version and “dark heather gray” for standard sizes.Clemens tweeted her finding, which had generated 161 retweets as of mid-day Thursday.On Wednesday afternoon, in response to Clemens' Tuesday tweet, Target told her via Twitter that the company had passed along her comments to the appropriate team and would review them.Later Wednesday, Target then tweeted: “We apologize for this unintentional oversight & never intend to offend our guests. We've heard you, and we're working to fix it ASAP.”Target spokesman Joshua Thomas told Forbes that “manatee gray” is a color found on many products across a range of categories on the retailer's website—including some in women's regular sizes and others in petite sizes.In the case of the dresses that Clemens found, Thomas said there were two different teams of buyers responsible for the “missy” and plus-size product lines, and the teams didn't coordinate when they inputted the product information for the site.“We apologize for any discomfort this might have caused and are working to update the name of the dress to reflect Dark Heather Gray,” Thomas told Forbes. “This was an unfortunate oversight and we'll take it into consideration moving forward.”Target is Minnesota's second-largest public company based on revenue, which totaled $71.9 billion for the fiscal year that ended February 2—up 5 percent from the prior year. It operates 1,784 stores across the United States and opened its first 24 Canada stores last month.

Slabs are half-versions of their respective blocks.
Obtaining [ edit ]
Stone-type slabs and smooth blocks require a pickaxe to mine. Wooden slabs can be mined with anything, but an axe is quickest.
↑ Times are for unenchanted tools in seconds.
Natural generation [ edit ]
Smooth stone slabs can be found naturally in villages lining the roof of blacksmith shops and inside the Butcher's Shop and the Blacksmith where they form counters. They are also found in strongholds where they are used in some of the stairs, ledges and torch pillars. Sandstone slabs can be found naturally in desert villages, desert wells, and desert pyramids. Double stone slabs can be found in villages, in the butcher's shop and in blacksmiths. A spruce wood slab serves as a table in igloo basements. Oak, birch, spruce, stone and cobblestone slabs can also be found in mansions.

Crafting [ edit ]
Usage [ edit ]
Placement [ edit ]
Slabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half:
Pointing at the top of a block or the bottom half one of its sides will place the slab in the lower half.
Pointing at the bottom of a block or the top half of its side will place the slab in the top half.
Slabs cannot be oriented sideways.
Crafting ingredient [ edit ]
Behavior [ edit ]
An example of how upside-down slabs can make redstone travel compactly "upstairs".
Slabs do not block a vertical redstone connection as it is a transparent block.
Slabs are treated as a whole block by other blocks and liquids. Two slabs can be piled on top of one another to make a full-size block, but different slab types cannot be mixed in this way.
Double slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one will destroy the whole block and drop two slabs, as opposed to only breaking one slab within the block. "Double slabs" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually.
Redstone can be connected to the wire on the side of the slabs. Redstone placed on top of an upside-down slab can receive signals from an adjacent block of redstone one block lower, but cannot transmit signals to it. This is why "ladders" made from upside-down slabs, as pictured to the right, can transmit redstone signals up, but not down.
Mobs see a slab as a full block. Mobs can also spawn on the tops of upside-down slabs and double slabs, but not on lower slabs.
In Bedrock Edition, mobs standing on right-side up slabs fail to pathfind correctly. They seem to perceive the slabs beneath them to be unwalkable, and will often end up spinning around in a small circle when they try to move. The block directly beneath the slab must be air or another right-side up slab to disturb pathfinding. Also in Bedrock Edition iron golems will not spawn on a slab even if it is the top half of a block.
Due to the way blast rays propagate from an explosion, bottom-half slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them.
Sneaking only reduces the player's hitbox height to 1.65 blocks, and so does not allow the player to walk over a single slab with one block of air above it, which is 1.5 blocks of space. A player cannot walk from a block of soul sand directly up to a slab without jumping – this applies not just to soul sand, but to any block 7⁄ 8 of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a slab while sneaking, because the sneaking only prevents falling when the distance is higher than one half block.
If a slab is placed underwater, the empty half of that slab's block will be waterlogged if the block it is in was a source block. If the slab is placed in flowing water upside down, not only can the player grab a quick breath of air there, but the player can see as clearly as if they were above the surface.
Minecarts on powered rails will not be repelled from a slab. They will, however, be repelled by a slab with a minecart on top.
Falling block entities (like sand, gravel, and concrete powder) will turn into their dropped form if they land on a slab, exactly like what occurs when they fall on a torch.
Slabs do not block light.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
Fuel [ edit ]
Wooden slabs can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.75 items per slab in the Java Edition and Legacy Console editions, and smelting 1.5 items per slab in Bedrock Edition.

Trivia [ edit ]
Slabs let a small amount of light pass through their edges. This light is only visible when Smooth Lighting is turned on, and does not affect mob spawning or other light-dependent processes. [ until JE 1.14 ] The exception of this is that any light directed through a slab does not affect any block's light values north of the source.
Whereas 1×1 dents in a flat floor using slabs are darkened as one would expect, 1×1 dents created using 2×1 or 2×2 stairs will darken less, due to having fewer surrounding solid blocks. [3]
When water or lava are on top of an upside-down slab, the water dripping particles will appear in midair below the slab instead of from the slab itself, this was fixed in Java Edition 1.13-pre7[4], but is an intentional feature in Bedrock Edition.[5]

The US government has drawn a big sigh of relief. After decades of being on the retreat, Iran's pro-democracy forces have regained momentum and are once again moving their country in a more liberal direction. The historic 2015 nuclear deal, which benefited Iran's moderates, appears to be holding ground. In turn, Washington has decided to double down on diplomacy in order to further move Tehran toward reconciliation and reintegrate it into the global community. Engagement has paid off, and the United States is recommitting itself to the path that's proven to be the only effective policy toward Iran. Ad Policy
Just kidding. The above would hold true in a parallel universe, one in which US policy toward Iran was characterized by rationality. In the universe we live in, however, Washington's approach is motivated by an irrational fear of losing Iran as an enemy. Instead of welcoming the country's courageous democratic steps—which Washington for decades has claimed it desires—President Trump clenched his fist and doubled down on enmity by calling for regime change and Iran's isolation. Only Saudi Arabia and hard-line elements of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet in Israel welcomed this belligerent move—the same two countries that also opposed the nuclear deal.
But it isn't just the path to US-Iran reconciliation that Trump is blocking by outsourcing Middle East policy to Saudi Arabia and Israel. He also risks jeopardizing Iran's path toward reform and democratization. And it wouldn't be the first time the United States stood in the way of the Iranian people's yearning for democracy. In the 1950s, Britain and the US overthrew Iran's embryonic democracy in order to seize the country's oil wealth.
In the early 1950s, Iran was an embryonic democracy. The 1906 Constitutional Revolution had replaced the millennia-old absolute monarchy with a constitutional monarchy—the first of its kind in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia still doesn't have a constitution). Iran had a Parliament that was directly elected by the people, which in turn elected the country's prime minister. The Iranians had fought hard for these pivotal steps toward full democracy. However, Great Britain, then still a dominant Middle Eastern power, stood in the way. Ever so hungry for Iran's vast oil reserves, London interfered incessantly in the country's internal affairs to keep it weak and incapable of fending off British theft of Iran's riches.
Led by Mohammad Mossadeq, a nationalist member of Parliament who was elected prime minister in April 1951, the Iranians began demanding that the country's oil industry be nationalized so that the wealth from it would benefit their own country rather than end up in British coffers.
But Britain was in no mood to share Iran's oil wealth with the Iranians. And the Shah—Mohammad Reza Pahlavi—was wary of the increased power and popularity Mossadeq was gaining from whipping up nationalist sentiments. Even an illegal naval blockade imposed by London, which almost entirely cut off Iran's oil sales, failed to diminish Mossadeq's popularity.
As Stephen Kinzer describes in his indispensable book All the Shah's Men, London concluded that it needed to get rid of Mossadeq and expand the power of the Shah. However, vastly weakened by World War II, Britain needed America's blessing and assistance; earlier attempts to draw Washington into the conflict in support of Britain had failed. But as political deadlock gripped Iran, Winston Churchill's government began using a new argument, to which Washington was exceptionally vulnerable: If Mossadeq wasn't removed, he would eventually move Iran into the Soviet camp. This would be a significant blow to the United States at the height of the Cold War. Although there was no evidence that Mossadeq had communist sympathies, the British argued that he could develop such inclinations and that Washington couldn't afford this risk.
The argument worked. The Eisenhower administration ordered the CIA to team up with the British MI6 in what became known as Operation Ajax. With a $1 million budget, the Near East and Africa division of the CIA, led by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., grandson of former US President Theodore Roosevelt, went to work. Propaganda against Mossadeq was disseminated, and Iranian CIA operatives pretending to be pro-Mossadeq threatened Iranian clerics in Mossadeq's name, in order to turn the powerful religious community against the prime minister. The Shah brutally clamped down on dissent and democratic demands—with the approval and assistance of Washington.
As CIA-engineered protests swept Tehran (the CIA paid protesters on both sides in order to maximize the chaos), the Shah's military stormed the capital on cue and took over the city. Mossadeq was arrested and many of his associates were imprisoned. The Shah quickly moved to negotiate a deal with foreign oil companies that gave Washington and London the lion's share of Iran's oil, while strengthening his grip on power, reducing the role of Parliament, and brutally clamping down on dissent and democratic demands—all with the approval and assistance of the United States.
The United States and the United Kingdom killed Iran's democratic experiment in its infancy. Washington, which under previous administrations had opposed colonization and British intervention in Iran, switched sides and became the ultimate power behind the Shah's dictatorship. To many Iranians, Pahlavi became known as “the American Shah.”
In recent years, the struggle for democracy in Iran has regained momentum. But it is not Iran's political system that is impressive—indeed, it is fundamentally flawed and undemocratic. Rather, it is the maturity of Iranian society that holds the promise for a more democratic future. While most countries in the region don't even hold elections, Iranians have now—in three presidential elections in a row—voted for the most moderate candidate on the ballot (including the controversial 2009 elections, when the Green Movement's victory was stolen from the people). Iran is one of few countries in the world where an anti-populist message wins you a landslide election victory. Women made significant gains throughout the country, especially in city-council elections.
And perhaps more importantly, it is in local elections—which tend to be more free, with less government vetting, than presidential and national parliamentary voting—where the potency of Iranian society's democratic values are most evident. Reformists won landslide victories in the city-council elections of Iran's six largest cities, giving them electoral gains in both local and national elections. Even in the conservative city of Mashhad, the birthplace of Iran's conservative Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as well as the main conservative presidential candidate, Ebrahim Raisi, reformists swept all of the city-council seats. A female candidate in Mashhad even got elected on a platform of fighting the patriarchy. Her campaign slogan read: “Let's vote for women!”
Women made significant gains elsewhere as well. In the Tehran city-council elections, women grabbed six out of the 21 seats—the highest number yet. In the Sistan and Baluchistan province, women won 415 city-council seats—an increase from 185. There were even council elections in which no men were on the ballot at all. Ready to Fight Back?

What we are witnessing is the promise of democracy manifesting itself. In this struggle, now more than a century old, the driving force has consistently been Iran's own moderate society. This society has incessantly pushed for democratic change, and whenever external threats and internal strife have been absent, Iranian society has moved the country in that direction.
None of this seems to have registered with Trump. Standing in a room in Riyadh, where the overwhelming majority of leaders standing with him were unelected autocrats, Trump not only called for Iran's isolation, he fully joined the Saudi side in the region's increasingly dangerous Saudi-Iranian rivalry.
Just as the Iranian people sent an unmistakable invitation for further engagement and dialogue, Trump took the United States back to the Bush-era policy of confrontation. It's a policy with only one clear winner: Iran's hard-line elements, who oppose both Iranian society's desire for more democracy and closer relations with the United States.
The hard-liners' attempts to reimpose a repressive security atmosphere inside Iran, as it did in the Ahmadinejad era—with a clampdown on civil society and the NGO sector—has been decisively rejected by the Iranian electorate. But now Trump is giving the hard-liners a second lifeline by opting for confrontation.
Whether intended or not, we may very well see a repeat of 1953, with the United States once again strangling the Iranian democratic baby just as it is about to take its first steps out of the cradle.
Palestinians and Israeli Arabs aren't the only ones playing catch-up in Startup Nation. Israel's ultra-Orthodox (haredi, in Hebrew), who for decades have cut themselves off from larger society, are jumping in. Like those first two groups, the haredim have long been exempt from Israel's compulsory military service, which has served as an entrepreneurial springboard for the region's secular Jews. And similarly, these communities, which have long stressed large families and Torah study over conventional work, remain desperately poor.
For Intel , which has 8,500 employees in Israel and generates 10% of the country's industrial exports each year, the haredim are yet another untapped resource. Over the past five years the company has been slowly assimilating them into its workforce--of the 1,000 workers in the Jerusalem office more than 100 are ultra-Orthodox.
Intel takes great pains to work with the sect's rabbis to ensure traditions are respected, notably segregating haredi women, who are forbidden to touch men who aren't their husbands. "It's getting to know one another," says Yishai Fraenkel, a general manager at Intel's Jerusalem operations. "It's really creating within the workplace a microcosm of full Israeli society."
Unexpected problems have arisen. Fraenkel says it's a battle to give the haredim raises, since they are brought up to express modesty at all times. Employee reviews are even more complicated. "They didn't want to do it," says an ultra-Orthodox woman named Sari, who has risen to manager level. "There is something in Hebrew called lashon hara--that you cannot talk bad things about another person."
Still, Fraenkel says, it's worth the effort: "We do it because they're good people, they're bright people, they're driven people. They are already driving innovations." And if you tour the facility, it's clear that the women, who hail from a culture that encourages families of ten or more, enjoy the independence. In Sari's case her mother looks after her four children, while her husband studies Torah at a yeshiva all day. Who cooks for him? "I don't know," she says with a giggle. "He finds some food somewhere." When asked whether haredi women might someday start their own companies, Sari lights up. "I'm sure it will happen," she beams, and then adds: "Of course, the wives don't talk inside the home about it."
Tellingly, haredi men are increasingly seeking positions. One of them, a senior design engineer named Ariel Malamud, tells FORBES he had a dilemma. He was torn between finishing his Torah studies and accepting a job offer from Intel.
So he did what all good haredim do: He consulted his rabbi. "I remember we walked around," says Malamud, and the rabbi asked, "Who is Intel? Is it a serious company?" Ariel told him yes. "Go to Intel," advised the rabbi. "Seriousness is a good trait."

Last week, there were three significant homeless-related fire or fire hazard incidents around critical bridge infrastructure in Seattle: the RV fire under the Spokane Street viaduct/West Seattle Bridge on April 6, a propane tank explosion and fire underneath I-90/Edgar Martinez Way near Airport Way (across from the Field) on April 5, and removal of 26 propane tanks stacked around the base of a Magnolia bridge support column adjacent to a homeless encampment on April 4.
Camping under low bridge structures can present a hazard for the City's essential infrastructure, especially when there are concentrations of flammable materials such as pallets and mattresses, and a likelihood of open flames or vehicles with mechanical issues. SDOT engineers are particularly concerned about the concentration of approximately 30 RVs underneath the western most end of Spokane Street where the structure is the lowest because RVs are composed of a combination of chemicals and flammable materials that burn very hot and present a significant danger to bridge infrastructure. According to SDOT, RVs include many of the same chemicals that brought down I-85 in Atlanta last week.
“Safety is our priority and having encampments and recreational vehicles under the West Seattle Bridge poses public safety risks especially if there are flammable/volatile materials being used to cook and heat inside the vehicles,” said Scott Kubly, SDOT director. “We are working with other City agencies to ensure maintenance access under our structures by keeping the area clear of potentially hazardous materials.”
“The Seattle Fire Department has responded to a number of fires under the Spokane Street viaduct, including one last week where two RVs were destroyed and another in January where a man died in an RV fire. The concentration of occupied vehicles, tents, pallets, furniture and debris under the low bridge structure has created a specific fire hazard that needs to be addressed for the safety of the vulnerable people living there and the bridge itself,” said Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins.
The City is addressing the immediate hazard where the RV fire occurred last week, clearing that area of any RVs, vehicles, tents and other materials. SDOT has set a perimeter that encompasses the median along Spokane Street, from under the base of the West Seattle Bridge to Colorado Street on the east, that must be cleared. That area will then be fenced off to allow SDOT and Seattle City Light to perform repairs and maintenance, including following up on necessary lighting system repairs.
On Friday, April 7, the City provided notice to individuals who were on site that clearing of the area within the perimeter described above would begin on Tuesday, April 11. Recognizing the large number of RVs and other vehicles present, many of which are not operational, the City expects this effort will take several days, possibly into next week. The Navigation Team has also been offering services and alternative shelter to these individuals, outreach that will continue as long as necessary.
Additionally, on Friday the City began notifying RVs and vehicles parked all along the median under the Spokane Street viaduct to the east of the perimeter at Colorado Street that the City will be focusing enforcement of the 72-hour parking law. SPD is assisting with notification and will be leading that enforcement effort as the Navigation Team focuses its outreach efforts on people living in tents in that area.
In general, the City has been focusing its efforts to address the homelessness crisis on working with individuals in tent encampments, especially the ones with the greatest public health and safety concerns for the individuals and the surrounding community. The Navigation Team has been finding success with many individuals, finding solutions that fit their needs and helping move them into safer living situations. Other City crews are addressing the trash related to encampments and illegal dumping in general around the city. In addition to these efforts, we will be assessing these low bridge structures around the city and will prioritize efforts to address immediate hazards.
Taxi driver Mohamed Salim says he was attacked by a passenger who called him a terrorist. A recording of their contentious ride was captured on Salim's cellphone. (The Fold/The Washington Post)

An Army reservist and Iraq veteran who works as a cabdriver says a passenger he picked up early Friday at a Northern Virginia country club accused him of being a terrorist because he is Muslim, then fractured his jaw in an attack being described by Islamic activists as a hate crime.
Mohamed A. Salim says the passenger compared him to the men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing 11 days earlier and threatened to kill him.
“Because I'm a Muslim, he treated me like a piece of trash,” Salim said. “I love this country. I didn't deserve this.”
Ed Dahlberg of Clifton, who has been charged with misdemeanor assault, denied hitting Salim in a statement released by his attorney.
Muslim rights workers said Salim's account is supported by medical records and an 11-minute, obscenity-filled video of Dahlberg's remarks leading up to the alleged assault. Salim, a 39-year-old from Great Falls, provided The Washington Post with a copy, which his attorney described as evidence of the prejudice that others sometimes face but rarely document.

The video, which Salim took on his phone, appears to show physical contact between the men but does not capture the alleged punch that Salim said fractured his jaw, the Boston bombing reference or the threat to kill. Salim said that those happened after he stopped recording so he could call the police.
On the video, a middle-aged businessman can be heard asking Salim if he is Islamic and then asserting that most Muslims are terrorists. He says the Koran directs Muslims to kill nonbelievers and then repeatedly and loudly demands that Salim denounce the Sept. 11, 2001, attackers. When Salim asks if the passenger is threatening him, the passenger uses an obscene phrase to respond in the affirmative.
“If you're a Muslim, you're a [expletive] jihadist,” the passenger says. “You are just as bad as the rest of them.”
The video ends with a blur of motion and audio of Salim asking, “Why are you punching me? Sir, why are you punching me?”
The passenger replies: “You're a [expletive] Muslim.”
The insult is followed by the sound of a car door slamming. In an interview, Salim said Dahlberg left briefly but returned, struck him and ran into the woods.
Dahlberg's attorney, Demetry Pikrallidas, said Dahlberg did not assault Salim. Even so, he said, Dahlberg wanted to apologize to anyone offended by his remarks. Dahlberg was profoundly affected by the Sept. 11 attacks, Pikrallidas said, and misunderstood Salim's response to his questions.
Dahlberg “became rather emotional as the discussion turned to jihad and 9/11, and especially heated on the subject of jihadists who want to harm America,” Pikrallidas said in a statement.
Pikrallidas described Dahlberg as a “hardworking family man and a church-going person” who had been drinking but was not intoxicated. He stressed that Salim's video shows the ride began with six minutes of friendly conversation.
The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations on Monday asked Fairfax County prosecutors to designate the attack a hate crime. “The prosecutor has a clear opportunity to send a message that anti-Muslim crime will not be tolerated, ” said Gadeir Abbas, an attorney for CAIR.
Fairfax prosecutors said they will review the video to determine whether to prosecute the case as a hate crime, which would elevate the charge to a felony. Prosecutors would have to show that Dahlberg attacked Salim because of his religion, race or national origin.
CAIR said it has documented two suspected hate crimes elsewhere since the Boston bombing. Hours after the April 15 explosions, a Bangladeshi man reportedly suffered a dislocated shoulder when beaten at a New York City restaurant. In Malden, Mass., a woman wearing an Islamic head scarf allegedly was assaulted April 17 by a man shouting anti-Muslim slurs.
On the video, Dahlberg describes himself as the owner of a local brokerage that sells large business jets internationally.
Salim said he has had a headache since the incident, has lost hearing in one ear and has blurred vision. Medical records provided by Salim show that he was treated for a fractured jaw and a head injury.
Salim, a married father of four who emigrated from Somalia 15 years ago, said the incident was particularly painful because he is a naturalized U.S. citizen and an Army Reserve sergeant who served in Baghdad and the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He has worked in intelligence and as a linguist, he said.
“I'm real angry,” he said. “I served my country. I fought. I sacrificed.”
Salim said he was dispatched to the Country Club of Fairfax about 2 a.m. Friday to pick up Dahlberg. When he arrived, he said he told Dahlberg he could not enter the cab with an open beer, so Dahlberg finished it.
Dahlberg then began complaining about the time that had expired on the taxi's meter, Salim said. As a precaution, Salim said, he started the video recorder on his phone. For most of the ride, it recorded audio but the camera was obscured.
Dahlberg can be heard asking where Salim is from and whether he's Muslim. Then Dahlberg demands to know Salim's view of jihad and the 9/11 terrorists, growing progressively louder.
“If you're a Muslim, you are [expletive] on that same page” as the Sept. 11 terrorists, Dahlberg says at one point. “Denounce those [expletives] that flew jets into the World Trade Center. . . . Tell me that they are pieces of [expletive], or you are with them. . . .
“If you're a [expletive] Muslim flying jets into the World Trade Center, then [expletive] you, I will slice your [expletive] throat right now.”
Salim tries to calm the situation by saying, “Okay, just peace, and sit, please. Cut off. Cut off.”
Then, about 10 minutes into the ride, Salim aims the phone over his shoulder, informs Dahlberg that he is being recorded and says he is calling the police. The camera shakes, and there are sounds of an apparent scuffle.

Some celebrities walk the red carpet at fund-raisers to give a charitable boost to their public personas, or because they know that there will be cameras there. Not Emily Blunt, who showed up at the American Institute for Stuttering 5th Annual Benefit Gala at the Tribeca Rooftop last night because she's got a very personal connection to the subject: She used to be a stutterer, too. It may be hard to believe that an actress so facile with accents could ever have had a speaking problem, but as Blunt told Vulture, stuttering was a major issue for her while growing up — and in a way, she's got her acting career to thank for helping ease her out of it.
This cause has been a personal experience for you?
Very much, yeah. I'm actually on the board for the American Institute for Stuttering. They honored me about two years ago, and since then I've really been a very active member for it, because I think they're using revolutionary techniques to help people get through this really anguished struggle of having a stutter. I think they've had huge success with the methods that they've used. I wish to God I'd known about them as a kid, because I maybe would have avoided eight to nine years of it not being an easy time.
Up until what age?
I think it started to eke itself out; between the age of 7 and 14 was when it was really bad. And around 12 it was at its worst. Not an awkward age at all to be unable to speak. Some people can grow out of it. It's easier for girls, funnily enough. Genetically, it's more common in boys.
So what happened? Did you grow out of it?
It was a combination of a few things. One was just growing out of it. Another one was gaining some kind of confidence. I had a really amazing teacher at that age, when I was 12, and he was really kind and helpful and encouraged me to be in the class plays, which previously I had no interest in being in ‘cause I couldn't talk. He said, “Well, why don't you try it in a different voice? Try to do a funny voice or an accent. Maybe that would help.” But it really did, I was actually able to speak fluently. Once you're able to hear yourself speak fluently, albeit in a ridiculous accent, you gain the confidence to think this could happen again and again. It was easier after that night, of that school play. It all became a bit easier.
You saw The King's Speech, no?
I did. I absolutely loved it. It was the most authentic portrayal of a stutterer I have ever seen. I spoke to Colin about it and was in wonderment how he managed to do it. Apparently the screenwriter had also had a stutter, which was really helpful. He really managed to capture that hesitancy, that vocal-cords-locking-out syndrome that happens. What's exciting about what Colin did was he actually put a face to stuttering, actually opened up people's minds around the world to the plight of someone who has one. So I think a lot of stutterers are very grateful to that film and the awareness he brought.
Anything in particular you could relate to?
Yeah. Public speaking, that kind of thing. In a smaller way, I was asked to read out a poem to my class, which was terrifying. And it's all relative. I wasn't reading a speech to the entire country, but I was reading a poem to my class. But, equally terrifying, in a way.
And you're about to make a dark comedy with Colin?
This autumn, yeah. It's a very strange, beautiful film. Just me and him, effectively. [Laughs.]
What's it been like filming Five-Year Engagement in Michigan?
I like it! I mean, we're filming in Ann Arbor, which is a college town, so there's lots of fun restaurants and bars, and it's a sweet little place. I've actually really liked it. Midwesterners are very friendly. They're nice peeps.
Someone on Twitter saw you on a moped earlier today.
Out on what? Yes, yes! God, Twitter is terrifying. It terrifies me in that way! We did. We went and got meatballs on our Vespa. This place is amazing, we've just discovered. The Meatball Shops. The Lower East Side. The best. So good.
Minnesota coach Tracy Claeys was fired on Tuesday after his first full season with the program. Claeys guided the Golden Gophers to a 9-4 record in 2016 and was 2-4 as the program's interim coach after Jerry Kill stepped down due to health reasons last year. While Claeys led Minnesota to a nine-win season and a Holiday Bowl victory over Washington State, there was a lot of turmoil surrounding this program at the end of the year. A player boycott over suspensions threatened to derail Minnesota's appearance in the Holiday Bowl, and Claeys later supported the boycott over Twitter. The boycott and Claeys' tweet did not sit well with many in the fanbase or administration, and the overall turmoil – not on-field performance – prompted athletic director Mark Coyle to make a change.
6 Coaching Candidates to Replace Tracy Claeys at Minnesota
Craig Bohl, head coach, Wyoming
Bohl agreed an extension through 2023 at Wyoming earlier this offseason, but Minnesota should at least inquire about his interest in the job. The Nebraska native worked as an assistant with a handful of FBS programs (Rice, Duke, Wisconsin and Nebraska) before landing the head coaching job at North Dakota State in 2003. Under Bohl's watch, the Bison went 104-32 and claimed three consecutive national championships (2011-13). Additionally, North Dakota State only had one losing season (2009) during Bohl's tenure. After a 4-8 mark in his first year at Wyoming (2014), Bohl went 2-10 in 2015 but improved to 8-6 in 2016. Bohl's style and track record of player development would fit in well at Minnesota.
Troy Calhoun, head coach, Air Force
Calhoun was connected to this job through the rumor mill in 2010 before Minnesota hired Jerry Kill. Considering Calhoun coaches at his alma mater and has a good run going in Colorado Springs, it would take a lot for the former AFA quarterback to leave. Calhoun is 77-53 at Air Force since 2007 and has guided the Falcons to bowl appearances in nine out of 10 seasons. He also spent time in the NFL with the Broncos and Texans and coached as an assistant at Ohio and Wake Forest.
P.J. Fleck, head coach, Western Michigan
Fleck is one of college football's rising stars in the head coaching ranks and it's only a matter of time before he gets an opportunity at a Power 5 program. After a playing career at Northern Illinois, Fleck had a short stint in the NFL before becoming a graduate assistant at Ohio State in 2006. Fleck quickly worked his way through the coaching ranks with stops at Northern Illinois (2007-09), Rutgers (2010-11) and with the Buccaneers (2012). He was hired as Western Michigan's head coach in 2013 and went 1-11 in his debut. However, the Broncos have three consecutive winning seasons and finished 2016 as the top Group of 5 programs with a 13-1 record and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl. Fleck is 30-22 in four seasons with Western Michigan. He's the early favorite for this job.
Bryan Harsin, head coach, Boise State
Harsin worked for current Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle at Boise State, so there's a natural connection between the two parties. However, since Harsin is from Boise and coaching at his alma mater, it's probably safe to assume he's in no hurry to leave for a different job. Harsin worked as an assistant at Boise State from 2001-10 before taking over the offensive coordinator duties at Texas from 2011-12. He spent one year as the head coach at Arkansas State (7-5) before jumping to Boise State to replace Chris Petersen in 2014. Over the last three seasons, the Broncos are 31-9 under Harsin's direction.
Chris Klieman, head coach, North Dakota State
Klieman has picked up where Craig Bohl left off at North Dakota State. Over the last three years, the Bison are 40-5 under Klieman's direction and claimed back-to-back national championships in 2014-15. North Dakota State finished 12-2 in 2016 and lost in the FCS semifinals to James Madison. The Iowa native also has stops as an assistant on his resume from stints at Northern Iowa, Kansas, Missouri State and Western Illinois.
Greg Schiano, defensive coordinator, Ohio State
Schiano returned to the college ranks in 2016 and called the defensive signals for Ohio State's standout defense. Prior to joining Urban Meyer's staff in Columbus, Schiano was out of football for two seasons after an 11-21 record as Tampa Bay's head coach from 2012-13. Schiano has a better track record as a college head coach, going 68-67 at Rutgers from 2001-11. Under Schiano's direction, the Scarlet Knights went from one of the worst teams in the Big East to a consistent bowl team. From 2005-11, Rutgers made six bowl appearances. Prior to that run, the school had just one previous trip to a postseason game.
'There are a lot of double standards in the international level,' says professor who is to probe Israel's Gaza campaign.
Professor William Schabas did not deny Wednesday, in an interview with Israel's Channel 2, that the international community has a double standard regarding Israel's conduct of war.
Channel 2's anchor, Danny Kushmaro, asked Schabas if there is not a double standard involved when that thousands of innocent civilians were killed in Chechnya by the Russians, and by NATO forces in Libya, yet there was “not one international investigation,” whereas Israel acted in self defense in Gaza and two investigations have been launched in the course of six years.
“There are a lot of double standards in the international level,” answered Schabas. “This is explained by the relative strength of the powers,” he added, and noted that some claim there is a double standard in Israel's favor in the UN Security Council, where anti-Israel resolutions are vetoed.
Schabas calimed that there has been “a great exaggeration of some of the statements” he made in the past regarding Israel. When he suggested that he would like to see Binyamin Netanyahu in the dock at the International Criminal Court, he was just “echoing what was in the Goldstone report, which is that the International Criminal Court should deal with the conclusions of the Goldstone Report concerning the possibility that war crimes were committed in Operation Cast Lead,” he argued.
When Kushmaro asked him about a second statement in which he said that President Shimon Peres should stand trial in front of the ICC, he defended himself by saying: “I expressed opinions about political leaders in the past. Is there a human being in Israel who has not expressed opinions about political leaders in Israel?”
Schabas's clear anti-Israel slant can be clearly seen in his statements at the Russel Tribunal on Palestine in New York last year:

Comment from Kotaro Uchikoshi
Morning comes, noon comes, then afternoon passes, and it becomes night… all because the earth rotates on its axis. Spring comes, summer comes, autumn passes, and winter arrives… all because the earth rotates around the sun. This sun rotates around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, spinning, and spinning, and spinning…
If you think about it, DNA is spinning, and electricity is spinning as well. Wouldn't it be possible that even time itself is spinning? Maybe our lives – and the history of this world – is something that continues to loop over and over again.
That isn't to say life is futile. Just like how yesterday and today are different, and this year and next year are different, there's a chance that each loop is completely different from one another. But, that's only if one takes action.
This game is the same. You and your teammates have the choice to not do anything, but history will keep repeating itself. History will only change as long as you take action. This may result in a different tragedy, but in that moment you may be able to discover a clue that you would otherwise never have stumbled upon.
In my image, everyone will collaborate as they progress deeper into the “time dungeon.” At first you can only reach the first level, but as you repeat loops, you slowly but surely get closer to the true “depth of time.” This game provides a different style of intellectual stimulation from the typical Real Escape Game.
This event came to life when Takao Kato (CEO, SCRAP Japan) exclaimed, “I want to make a time loop game!” and reached out to me. The main shape of the game was planned by Takao, and I assisted in solidifying the timeline (within the loops). The final polish was done by the elite team at SCRAP, so the quality is guaranteed!
I had always wished for this game to be brought to the US, so it's great to see that it's finally happening! Concerns about the cultural differences between Japan and the US were voiced, but I was confident since this game's experience is universal, the fun will translate into any language! Everyone in the world will enjoy this game.

The new map, Gallery, is out in the latest build! The design goal for this map was to make it long and narrow with a lot of dynamic occlusions caused by the partygoers.
It seemed to work pretty well, we played it during the release notes stream, where I did two different “birthday games”, the first set with scientist for his 5k birthday, and then smash10101 for his 1k birthday.
I made a few subtle behavior changes for this new map:
I made paintings more attractive on this map, and to do that I had to slightly change their probabilities on Ballroom. I think it won't be noticeable, but we'll see.
Due to restrictive local ordinances, open containers of alcohol cannot be consumed or served on the sidewalk. Some people flout these ordinances, but most partygoers are responsible citizens.
The conversations are a little less crowded now. People will still stand close to each other, but they won't all jam into a tiny conversation circle, so you have to be a little more aware of how the NPCs behave around crowded conversations. I had to be careful with this code so I didn't break the delicate balance of Balcony, but I think I was successful. I'm sure the beta players will tell me if I screwed it up!
Also in this build, I worked around a bug in Wineskin so macOS beta testers should have their replays directories updated properly now.
If you're a beta tester already, come try out the new map, it'll be there after you auto-update. If you're not, what are you waiting for?

A Maryland police officer was suspended Tuesday after a woman snapped a photograph of a hat promoting the Oath Keepers militia group displayed on the rear deck of his police cruiser.
“The officer has been suspended because, flat-out, it's a violation of our rules and policy to have anything political in your police car,” Anne Arundel County Police Lieutenant Ryan Frashure told local Fox News affiliate WBFF. The department has not released the name of the officer, claiming the incident is a personnel matter that will be investigated internally.
Gillian Thompson told WBFF that she saw the hat inside a parked police car near a Whole Foods in Annapolis Monday, and took photographs because she was familiar with the controversial patriot group. She filed a complaint at police headquarters.
“I knew what the Oath Keepers were from Cliven Bundy, from Ferguson,” Thompson told the news station.
Gillian Thompson speaks to WBFF.
The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized anti-government group composed of current and former law enforcement officials and members of the military. Organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League classify the Oath Keepers as an extremist branch of the militia movement.
The group drew headlines in 2014 for sending heavily armed members to keep watch over businesses during protests in Ferguson after the fatal police shooting of Mike Brown, and for supporting Cliven Bundy's standoff against the Bureau of Land Management at his Nevada ranch.
Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare told WBAL that he suspended his officer for promoting the group while on duty less than a day after receiving Thompson's police report.
“Good Lord, it's 2016. Every one of my cops should know better,” Altomare told the station.
Watch WBFF's report below.
A Pakistani-Canadian man wanted for leading a mob attack on a Mosque in Pakistan has found refuge in Canada.
In December 2016, Rasheed Ahmed, a dual citizen of Pakistan and Canada led a 3000-strong mob which attacked a historic Mosque in the town of Dulmial, northern Pakistan. The Mosque which dates back to 1860 has been at the center of a property dispute between Ahmadis and Sunnis. In 1996 the local Sunnis claimed ownership of the Mosque, a claim which was subsequently dismissed by the court.
Rasheed who is in his early 80's and has lived in Canada for over 40 years traveled to Pakistan from his home in Missausaga and revived the decade-old campaign to grab hold of the Mosque property. Rasheed along with local clerics also filed an application with the Police requesting assistance in the “take over” of the Mosque.
An application filed with the local Police department by Rasheed and a dozen other clerics stated:
“The Qadianis (Ahmadis) are using the Mosque as their worship place which is illegal under the law, We request that you free the Mosque from the Infidels and save Muslim interests by saving the Mosque from these Infidels, If these steps are not taken we will be forced to take extreme measures in order to liberate this Mosque”
The Ahmadis are followers of the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam which is considered heretic by mainstream Muslims. In 1974 Pakistan amended the constitution to declare the Ahmadis “non-Muslims”.
On December 12, 2016, a mob of roughly 3000 armed with automatic weapons and led by Rasheed attacked the Mosque leaving two dead and a half-dozen injured. During the attack which lasted several hours, the Police stood by as the mob ransacked the Mosque and set fire to property. The violent episode came to an end after the Army was called in and imposed a curfew in the town.
Days after the attack, Pakistani authorities named Rasheed Ahmed as the main suspect in the Mosque attack. On December 17th, five days after the attack, the Provincial Government requested the Federal Government that Rasheed should be barred from leaving the country for his role in the attack.
On January 15th, Dawn News reported that Rasheed had managed to flee the country before his name could be added to the Exit Control List (ECL).
While talking to Stewart Bell of National Post, Rasheed acknowledged that he was wanted for “terrorism” in Pakistan and said that in addition to terrorism charges police had also charged him with 10 to 12 more crimes.
Describing the events of December attack, Rasheed said, Fearing arrest, he phoned the Canadian high commission for help but it was closed. He went on to say:
Luckily I escaped, Thank God. It's all work of God, I believe, because had I been caught it would have been not good for my health at all.
Rasheed said upon his return to Canada, he was questioned by Canadian authorities but “they were satisfied and said that I can go.” He claimed the Canadian Intelligence also cleared him of any wrongdoing:
“CSIS (the Canadian Security Intelligence Service) came and asked me questions and they said, ‘Okay, no problem.'”
Since the attack, Pakistan has arrested up to 80 people involved in the attack and more are being looked for, But Rasheed has managed to escape prosecution as there is no extradition treaty between Canada and Pakistan.
A deadly border incident this month that drew a threat by Egypt to recall its ambassador to Israel has starkly revealed the changed political terrain in the relationship between the two countries.
Israeli officials who relied on former president Hosni Mubarak as a partner in upholding the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty are now contending with the newly assertive voice of public opinion in Egypt and its influence on that country's leadership.
There is a growing realization in Israel that maintaining ties with post-revolutionary Egypt no longer depends solely on cultivating the relationship with its leaders. Adopting stances that are more acceptable to ordinary Egyptians and the various political forces emerging in that country after Mubarak's ouster has become important as well.
“There's a new factor now, the masses, who are setting the pace and dictating moves,” said Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a veteran politician and former defense minister long known for his relationships with Mubarak and senior Egyptian officials.
The border incident on Aug. 18 was a case in point. After gunmen who crossed into southern Israel from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula killed seven Israelis near the border, Israeli troops who gave chase killed — according to Egyptian accounts — five Egyptian security officers in circumstances still under investigation by both sides.
In initial remarks after the cross-border attack, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak appeared to blame the deadly infiltration on Egyptian authorities, saying that it showed “the weakening of the Egyptian hold on Sinai,” where lawlessness has surged since Mubarak's ouster.
Barak's comments and the killing of the Egyptian security personnel drew a furious response in Cairo, where protesters gathered outside the Israeli embassy, presidential candidates jockeying for public support issued fierce condemnations, and the government threatened to recall the Egyptian ambassador to Israel.
To avert a crisis, Barak expressed regret for the deaths of the Egyptian officers and appreciation for Egypt's role in the bilateral relationship with Israel. He also promised a joint investigation of the border incident, and an Israeli military delegation later flew to Cairo to share preliminary results of the Israeli army's inquiry.
Sensitivity to the Egyptian response was also evident in Israel's handling of a subsequent flare-up along the border with the Gaza Strip, where several days of Israeli air strikes and rocket attacks by militants threatened to trigger wider military action. However Israel's security cabinet decided against a broader military operation, largely out of consideration for the impact such a move would have in Egypt, where public sympathy with the Palestinians runs high.
The new calculations reflect the overriding interest in Israel in preserving the relationship with Egypt and the peace treaty, which Barak said had “great importance and great strategic value for stability in the Middle East.” Egypt, the most populous Arab state, shares a long border with Israel, and the peace accord has for decades been a key component of the strategic balance in the region.
That balance could shift with the upheavals in the Arab world and a souring of Israel's relations with Turkey following a deadly Israeli raid last year on a Turkish ship leading an aid flotilla to Gaza.
“If you do a balance sheet at the end of August 2011, obviously there is a worsening in Israel's strategic balance,” said Oded Eran, a former ambassador to Jordan and director of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. “Turkey is not what it used to be in terms of relations with Israel, nor is Egypt.”
Nevertheless, Egypt's military leadership has a history of contacts with Israel. It has committed itself to upholding the peace treaty and kept lines of communication open to the Israelis during the recent crisis.
“The fact is that the two sides, on the level of leadership, on the professional side, continue the dialogue, and we continue to use Egypt as a go-between with Hamas, so the channels are still open,” Eran said, referring to the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza.
But with elections scheduled this fall in Egypt, popular sentiment could be a significant factor in the stance of a new civilian leadership toward Israel. And Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, which have angered many Egyptians, could well affect the public mood.
“Basically, the interests [of both countries] remain the same,” said Elie Podeh, an expert on Egypt and its relations with Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He noted that the peace treaty has strategic and economic value for both sides and is backed by generous aid to Egypt from Washington — a strong incentive for it to maintain the accord.
At the same time, Podeh argued, the changes in the region should prompt Israel to put forward a “substantive peace initiative” to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians, which has fueled popular anti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt and other Arab countries.
“If we want to somehow soften the criticism in the Arab world, and specifically in Egypt, we should adopt a different policy,” Podeh said. “Sometimes we don't understand the depth of their commitment to the Palestinian issue.”
Anger at Israel stoked by the border shooting is still simmering in Egypt. Hundreds of people demonstrated Friday near the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, demanding the expulsion of the ambassador.
Ben-Eliezer, the former defense minister, said that given the new realities in Egypt, Israel should go out of its way to smooth over differences with its neighbor, despite genuine concern about security along their shared border.
“We have to make every effort to keep our relations with the Egyptians as normal as we possibly can,” Ben-Eliezer said. “This is an Arab superpower. Who knows what the next government there will look like? We should try, as much as possible, to keep it business as usual.”

On August 12, when a coalition of white-nationalist groups scheduled a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, it was intended to demonstrate their strength. The actual event instead demonstrated the opposite, at least in its initial effects. Despite drawing upon supporters nationwide, attendance topped out in the mid–three figures. The attacks on counterprotesters that killed one and injured dozens horrified the nation. But what transmuted the failed rally into a rousing success was the response by President Trump, who, in a pair of rage-addled rants before the news media, drew the white-nationalist movement into the Republican coalition and gave it a legitimacy it could never have dreamed of.
The rally's marchers were summoned by posters depicting marchers in Confederate uniforms with Nazi eagles; they chanted “Blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!” Still Trump insisted, “Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me”; some of them were “very fine people.” He parsed the ideological definitions presented to him. (“When you say ‘the alt-right,' define ‘alt-right' to me. You define it.”)
It is hardly novel for Republicans to get mixed up in racism. Whatever the abstract merits of small-government conservatism, its political prospects have long required the exploitation of white racial resentment. What is new and even shocking is the intermingling of Republican politics with open white supremacy.
The GOP's “southern strategy,” from Barry Goldwater's states'-rights-based opposition to civil-rights law to Ronald Reagan's story of the “strapping young buck” on food stamps, operated at a symbolic remove. Racism was the unmistakable subtext, but explicit white supremacy was politically verboten. Even while they won votes by convincing white Americans that government was a vehicle for transferring resources to undeserving minorities, Republicans kept the Ku Klux Klan at arm's length. Nazism, too, had no valence in electoral politics, and Nazis have served as the ultimate representation of evil in American culture for decades. Nazis served as villains in countless movies — ­Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Blues ­Brothers — that were not seen as remotely political.
The political imperative of severing modern conservatism from outright white supremacy is (or at least was) serious enough that a long-standing genre of right-wing polemic is dedicated to insisting that fascism and racial segregation have no ideological relationship to the political right at all. Five years ago, Kevin Williamson argued in a National Review story that it was an “outright lie” and “utter fabrication” to believe that the Republican Party had “switched places” with the Democrats in “protecting the rights of black Americans.” Jonah Goldberg's 2008 book, Liberal Fascism, and Dinesh D'Souza's new one, The Big Lie, both define Nazism as a left-wing ideology rather than a right-wing one. Trump has rendered these rationalizations absurd. D'Souza's argument was particularly ill-timed: He published his book dedicated to the case that Nazis are a movement of the left less than two weeks before actual Nazis held a national rally called “Unite the Right.” He explained away this development by seizing on a rumor that one of the rally's organizers, Jason Kessler, was “an Obama guy,” thus concluding that “the whole rally may have been staged to feed the mainstream media's big lie that racism & fascism are on the right.” (The “evidence” of Kessler's ties to Obama consisted of rumors on white-nationalist message boards and a crude Photoshop of Kessler's head onto the body of Oval Office visitor Will Ferrell.)
Trump almost certainly does not believe Jews are masterminding a global plot to pollute the white race. (Yes, it would be nice if the previous sentence didn't need the almost.) In 1999, when he was mulling a presidential run with the Reform Party, he assailed Pat Buchanan, a rival candidate, as a “Hitler lover.” His overriding ideology is narcissism in general, and, in particular, he has a tendency to gravitate toward anyone who praises him while lashing out at any critic. His initial foray into Republican politics, as a prominent purveyor of the birther hoax, gave him a market share of the party's most racist voters. As Trump's advisers steered him toward nativist themes, white nationalists glommed onto his candidacy, which they saw as an entry point into a two-party system that had previously ignored them completely. Their love of Trump made Trump love them back. The process of running for and becoming president seems to have made Trump more racist.
In that sense, he mirrors the drift of the Republican Party, which is not to excuse its leaders for their increasingly audible dog whistles but merely to explain how it is possible that the party's elite spent a week in the summer of 2017 clarifying their relationship to Nazis and Klansmen. The famous “autopsy report” Republicans conducted following the 2012 election insisted that the country's growing diversity required the party to expand its appeal to nonwhite Americans; 2016 proved that assessment premature, as disillusionment with Hillary Clinton and a favorable electoral map allowed Trump to win what he and his advisers still call a “landslide” victory with a margin of negative-2 percent.
Still, the Trump presidency has only accelerated the ticking of the demographic clock. A majority of the public as a whole disapproves of Trump's remarks. The mainstream news media, most Republican Party professionals, and business and military leaders have all treated the president's defense of the “Unite the Right” march as an extinction-level event. But, as with most things, the party base has mostly stuck with the president — two-thirds of Republicans approve of what he said. The departure of Steve Bannon from the White House will change very little, given that the president has proved utterly unadvisable. Trump and his party continue to creep ever closer to a destination that once seemed unthinkable. And three and a half years of his term remain.

*This article appears in the August 21, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.
This started out as a reaction to Stephen Bush's election day Morning Call. Then I started hearing horror stories about our knocking up operation in Bristol West (TL;DR most of the people who told canvassers they would definitely vote Green, actually voted Labour). Then it became apparent that YouGov's seat by seat prediction model was basically Mystic Meg, and I went to bed knowing that we had been routed in Bristol West.
Fast forward to Friday, and the Green voteshare had halved nationally (though Caroline Lucas increased her majority to take a 52% voteshare in Brighton Pavilion, possibly securing that constituency as the Green Party's first safe seat). So I have built on my previous notes to better represent the full mish mash of thoughts and feelings I'm left with now that the Bristol West dream is so convincingly shattered.
If you're musing on the future of the Green Party in Corbynite era, then maybe this will help give shape to some of your own thoughts.
~ ~ ~
Morning Call: The Loser Now, Will Be Later To Win?
(Firstly, bonus points to Stephen for good use of a Dylan lyric!)
And then, ouch:
“The story of the contest was of four failures and a success. The failed campaigns: the Greens, Ukip, the Liberal Democrats, and Theresa May's. The success: for Jeremy Corbyn. The Greens thought – and full disclosure, so did I – that the greater exposure that the short campaign and the debates would give to Caroline Lucas would see them soar in the polls. Instead, that the only message that has got out from that party is the “progressive alliance” means that the only time most people have heard from the Greens is when they've been telling people they'd probably be better off voting for someone else, a remarkable failure given the almost non-existent presence of climate change in either of the big two's manifestos.”
Serious Green soul searching will be needed if we come out of this election with still just the one MP. I think it's too early to call the Green campaign a failure, because Stephen is judging it by the wrong criteria. The aim wasn't to soar in the polls which, as we know, don't translate into seats. I think we need to judge the Green campaign on what (in my view) it was trying to achieve:
– a formal Progressive Alliance (failed)
– informal Progressive Alliances in the form of local electoral pacts (partial success)
– positioning Greens as Labour's critical friend (on balance, I think success)
– increasing Green representation in Parliament (tbc!)
The problem with national voteshare is that it doesn't tell you anything about how that voteshare is distributed. 1% may look pretty pathetic, but what the percentage point says is that the public would like the Greens to have 6.5 MPs (ie, 1% of 650 seats). Voteshare isn't (primarily) what counts; seats are what counts. The caveat here being that voteshare counts in so far as the raw number of votes affects how much Short money Parliamentary Parties receive.
In short, if Greens return 2 MPs, then doubling our representation in Parliament is more than worth a dip in the polls, even if that means a drop in Short money.
But (and this should be a massive, 78pt bolded Times New Roman but), if we come out of the election having dropped in voteshare AND not increasing our representation in Parliament, we need to stop and ask ourselves what our Party is actually for.
If, when push comes to shove, we are saying to the electorate, “you can't risk voting for us when there's the threat of a Tory Government, we'd rather you vote for Labour”, then we are a pressure group, not a Party. And if the Tories emerge with a small majority, and we discover that had Green votes in key marginals gone to Labour then Corbyn could have been Prime Minister (albeit in a Hung Parliament scenario) then we will be hoisted on our own petard by the fact that we used the risk of that eventuality our central argument for forming a Progressive Alliance.
Now, if what we want to do with the Party is influence the Labour Party, then we could enter into a conversation about a Co-Operative Party type arrangement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_Party) that allows people to stand under the description Labour and Green Party. It can then fall to Greens to ensure that candidates with strong green credentials are put forward, and that pressure is applied internally to shape policy and so on.
That may sound like heresy, but we just spent an election campaign standing aside and telling people to vote Labour in order to keep the Tories out. If the aim of our Party is to put climate change at the heart of Government policy, then it may be time to consider that the most effective way to do that could be by helping Corbyn re-align the left, and joining forces with Labour.
Which comes first, Party or Planet?
~ ~ ~
Back to now…
I know the above makes it sound like I am advocating an attempt to join Labour en masse, and there is certainly a big part of me that feels that pull. However, that is not my final conclusion; at this point, I simply don't have a final conclusion, just a painful process of reflection and wound licking. The important question is:
What is the point of the Green Party?
I don't mean that bitterly or ironically. I ask it in the same way I ask my therapy clients to consider the point of what they are doing; it's about raison d'etre and having primary objectives around which all other priorities and action can be meaningfully arranged.
This is healthy in the wake of an existentially impactful event. And it is entirely valid to conclude that the point of the Party at this time is to address the environmental emergency of climate change through political means. And it is entirely valid to conclude that the most effective way to do that in the Corbynite era is to stop trying to beat 'em, and join 'em, Co-Op style.
But there are other paths to consider too:
Target Councils and Mayors, not constituencies (Brighton Pavilion excepted)
Our pushing of the Progressive Alliance has bought us a lot of goodwill among Corbynites who have voted Labour to support Corbyn. These are people who could well be convinced to “reward” the Greens with a vote at the local level, where we are able to pitch ourselves as Labour's critical friend. That's not stretching things either, we can argue convincingly that where Labour is under electoral threat from the Greens, they pay more attention to environmental issues, and are forced to tack left.
It is entirely feasible for Bristol Greens to start positioning ourselves as the natural successors to Marvin Rees' administration. Probably not in 2020, but arguably by 2024; and that can only happen if we invest in winning a lot of seats in 2020, which means starting to develop the Party across the city from as soon as possible, preferably yesterday.
In short, instead of planning a full throated national election campaign at the next General Election, what if we identified a target list of Councils we want to control, and put resources into developing local Parties, and funding proper local campaigns?
This would also help us address “the Brighton question”, whereby our opponents derail us with “look what the Greens did in Brighton!”. The best way to remedy that reputational blow is to demonstrate that we're learning from it.
And that means preparing local Parties for the possibility of local Administration, as well as equipping Councillors with an effective rebuttal list detailing the many and varied failings of Labour Councils up and down the country.
Rebuild the centre ground in Tory territory
With hindsight, it should be clear that targeting a sitting Labour MP backfired massively in Bristol West. In particular, the “why elect just another Labour MP” line was a mistake. Say what you want about Thangam Debbonaire, but she is not just another Labour MP. She is a woman of colour who has come out the other side of cancer via chemo, with enough tenacity to take part in the attempted coup against Corbyn, return to the front bench as whip, then defy Corbyn again (and, amusingly, herself) by voting against triggering Article 50 and getting away with it. All whilst chairing the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees (of which Caroline Lucas was a Vice-Chair).
The point being that going up against a Labour MP was always going to be difficult, but was made especially so by Thangam Debbonaire actually being a skilled and apparently indefatigable politician.
But there is another approach the Greens can take, and that is to venture into the kind of Tory territory that Labour can't touch.
I'll need to expand this idea in another post, but in my opinion the collapse of the centre ground represents a rejection not of any and all possible political centres, but of the particular kind of political centre that found its apotheosis in Blairism. In short, I differentiate between a triangulated centre, and a grounded centre.
The triangulated centre is the simple end result of political triangulation. In simple terms, you take your position, and you take your opponent's position, then you say (in a very reasonable sounding voice) “here is the midway point between these two positions, clearly this is a sensible compromise”. It's a clever tactic, because it can easily take the wind out of your opponent's sails.
The problem with the triangulated centre is that, used excessively over a long period of time, it results in the political Establishment grounding itself in a political consensus that is increasingly far removed from, and unable to communicate with, the actual political views of every day people.
Hence why the political Establishment can scream hysterically about rail nationalisation being the height of communism, whilst polling consistently demonstrates that most people would quite like a nationalised rail service thank you very much.
When I talk about the grounded centre, I mean constructing a politics that is rooted in what actual people say they support, and doing the hard work of negotiating an agreed coalition of common interests among those competing views.
Now, this isn't something Corbyn has done. The particular left wing programme he offers is a popular tonic after 7 years of unrelenting austerity, and much of it can actually be considered centre ground considering the policies people say they support. Crucially, Corbyn is a relentless campaigner, and much of his success in the election is the demonstrable fruit of putting significant effort into building a movement.
We must learn from this, and I think we can.
Because the Green Party's unique selling point is environmentalism, it may be possible for us to take on a unique role in traditionally Tory voting rural areas. These are places where the Tory voting identity makes switching to Labour impossible, but where the Green Party could make significant headway by focusing more on our deep Green policies.
These are places vulnerable to flooding that will now be places willing to listen to the risks of climate change and how they can be mitigated. Many rural areas are now vulnerable to fracking by a Tory Government, and whilst fox hunting might enjoy the support of the rural rich, the rural poor are no friends of the hunt.
But in order to do that, we would need to stop competing with Labour on the left, and instead turn our attention to constructing a new centre ground. Not by triangulating, but by working at a community level to construct a grounded centre. Which does mean competing with the Lib Dems, who consider themselves the natural centre ground Party. But I think our environmentalism actually gives us the edge here, as the centrism of the Lib Dems is still largely triangulated.
If the grounded centre is the area of politics where most people agree, then ever since the Paris Agreement, the need to tackle climate change can be held up as the grounded centre policy of choice.
In other words, small g green issues are where most people already agree. Whether rich or poor, most people agree that air pollution must be dealt with, and that climate change is an urgent existential threat.
And we don't need to reinvent our Party to lay claim to that centre ground, we just need to be willing to put the effort into building it.
~ ~ ~
So, lots of food for thought there, and I don't know what's for the best for us as a Party.
All I know is that we need to talk about it, and half a million voters still want us to.

Fox News' “Outnumbered” co-host Andrea Tantaros said on Thursday that Eric Holder is “an attorney general for the criminal” while arguing that the Obama administration is at least partially to blame for the shooting of two police officers in Ferguson, Mo., early Thursday.
“Eric Holder has proven, time again, he is an attorney general for the criminal, by the criminal, and of the criminals in the United States of America,” Tantaros said.
Fox News guest host Lou Dobbs sparked the “Outnumbered” debate by saying that Holder and President Obama have hurt the community of Ferguson. He said that while there are many factors that have contributed to issues in Ferguson, “chief among those, in my opinion, are the president of the United States and the attorney general and the way in which they have handled this community's crisis.”
“We have seen far more charges and denigration originating from the Justice Department itself, rather than support and help,” Dobbs said.
But co-host Kirsten Powers disagreed.
“I don't think this has anything to do with the president or Eric Holder. This is a tragedy that happened. Police officers tragically do get shot and they got shot long before Barack Obama was ever in the White House,” she said, adding that she believes the Ferguson Police Department had a lot of problems.
Tantaros jumped in to disagree with Powers.
“But the administration felt like they had to do something,” Tantaros said. “You did say that cops get shot all the time. It is not a coincidence that last night…”
Powers cut Tantaros off to say, “I didn't say cops get shot all the time.”
After more back and forth, Tantaros launched into her criticism of Holder and the Justice Department.
“Last night, the police chief resigned. This was on the heels of the report that the Department of Justice put out. The Department of Justice has been inflaming this, as Lou points out, for a long time. And they couldn't bring charges against Darren Wilson because the physical evidence of Darren Wilson's testimony corroborated and matched up. So they had to do something because they intervened and they flamed the racial tensions,” she said. “They have taken this country back 50 years in terms of race relations.”
“How do you explain police officers who have been shot before Barack Obama was president?” Powers asked in response.

The past weekend was predicted to be filled with big storms, rain, wind, all grey and no sun. The forecast models were not entirely correct though, so we had some rain, some wind and some sun too. No one is complaining :). The temps are dropping however and the only thing I want to do is a curl up with a bowl of soup and listen to some holiday theme novels (audio books).
MY LATEST VIDEOS
This Laksa curry is super flavorful, anti inflammatory and delightful. The paste can be made at home and used whenever you want a bowl of the soup or a quick stir fry. Use whatever ingredients you have in the paste and make this curry laksa with noodles or more veggies or crisped up panfried tofu. The spices are toasted then blended or processed with herbs, aromatics, fresh turmeric root and some cashews. The paste is roasted in a little oil to release the flavors, then mushrooms and veggies and cooked for a few. The broth, coconut milk and noodles are brought to a boil and simmered until the noodles are tender and the soup thickens a bit to preference. Fold in some greens, mint and cilantro and serve. Fresh turmeric root adds the bright color to this laksa paste. Use ground turmeric if you cannot find the fresh root. Also try this turmeric root ginger root tea for the fall blues. Turmeric stains, so work carefully whether using fresh or dry.

Fox News host Eric Bolling is leaving the network on the heels of a report that he had sent lewd text messages to female colleagues.
In a statement on Friday, Fox said that it was canceling "The Specialists," the late afternoon talk show co-hosted by Bolling that launched earlier this year, and that it had agreed to part with him "amicably."
"We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck," the statement said.
The news arrived on the same day that Charles Payne, a host on Fox's sister network Fox Business, will return to his job following an investigation into his own alleged sexual misconduct. Payne has denied the allegations against him.

Bolling's alleged behavior was detailed last month in a story published by HuffPost. He denied those allegations and later sued the reporter who wrote the HuffPost story, Yashar Ali.
Bolling did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bolling is just the latest high-profile Fox employee to leave the company amid damning allegations. In April, Fox sacked its top-rated host Bill O'Reilly after dozens of advertisers fled his show over the revelation that he and the network had paid millions in settlements to women who accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. (O'Reilly, now hosting a show that is broadcast on his website, has consistently denied those allegations.)
Nearly a year before O'Reilly's ouster, the late Fox co-founder Roger Ailes was forced out of the network amid an avalanche of sexual harassment allegations, which he denied.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book—and movie—in J.K. Rowling's series. That means there's a lot I love about the third Harry Potter installment, including the moment when Remus Lupin and Sirius Black are reunited in the Shrieking Shack.
The scene reveals a history that adds so much to the franchise and made Harry Potter feel like an even bigger, richer world. It quickly changes from Professor Lupin seemingly rescuing Harry, Ron, and Hermione from alleged murderer Sirius Black to a reunion between two old best friends. Like the trio, the reader at first might not understand the questions Lupin asks Black in the beginning but as the conversation unfolds their history, and by extension Harry's parents' history, is explained. We learn it wasn't Black who betrayed them, but Peter Pettigrew. With Pettigrew and James, Black and Lupin made up the Marauders who created the map and the other three became Anamagi to help Lupin whenever he transformed into a werewolf. They all fought Voldemort, until one of them betrayed the rest.
It's the little moments between Black and Lupin scattered within this sudden deluge of new information that always captivated me. The moments where they said just enough and yet left so much more unsaid! Things like Black silently confirming Lupin's realization that they switched who was Secret Keeper without telling him and it's clearly dawning on Lupin that for 12 years everything he thought about what happened with his friends was wrong. Black explaining what happened after over a decade with the anger of knowing his suspicions were incorrect and his choice led to his friends' deaths as well as his imprisonment. The two asking each other for forgiveness for thinking the other was Voldemort's spy.
Learning about all this built on what little we knew at this point about the first war with Voldemort and in doing so shifted how you thought about that time. It wasn't just a clear-cut good versus evil conflict. Friends suspected friends, friends betrayed friends, and a group as close as Harry, Hermione, and Ron was torn apart trying to make the world a better place. I always felt this was the start of the series really opening up into a more complicated story where things get just that much darker than we'd seen before, leading the way for things to get darker for Harry and the others.
It was a great small bit of world building that would continue to be expanded on as the series continued and leaves you wishing Rowling would just write a Marauders book already! The scene isn't as emotional in the movie and doesn't go into quite as much detail as the book, but it's still worth a watch as it manages to convey the core of the scene. Just promise me you'll also check out the book version after watching it!
The pro- and anti-gun lobbies are at it again, with neither side being reasonable. Senator David Leyonhjelm and the gun lobby are making an unnecessary fuss to overturn a temporary ban on Adler A110 lever-action shotguns (that have a seven round magazine capacity). The anti-gun lobby, on the other hand, wants to ban the A110 permanently for most shooters, and some even want to ban all lever-action shotguns and rifles. While most of the misinformation is coming out of the anti-gun lobby, Leyonhjelm et al should have left well enough alone.
The A110, in a scare campaign by its opponents, has been variously described as "rapid-fire", "capable of firing up to eight cartridges (seven from the magazine plus one from the chamber) in as many seconds", and "easily convertible to an 11-shot firing capacity". Activist group Gun Control Australia is claimingthat "due to improvement in firearm technology, the Adler is now a faster more lethal weapon than ever".
The reality is a bit different.
Advertisement
The public are not widely aware that the Adler A110 is already available in Australia from most gun shops for about $850. The qualification is that it is the five shot magazine version that is available. What's more, broadly similar shotguns (with five shot magazines) have been available in Australia since the late 19th century, originally from Winchester, and subsequently from the Italian firm Chiappa,and the American firm Interstate Arms Corporation(IAC), all without much fanfare.
The Adler and other lever action shotguns are based on the Winchester Model 1887 invented by John Browning. Browning later designed the Model 1893 pump-action shotgun, which was a more robust and user-friendly action. Subsequently pump action shotguns and (later) semi-automatics largely replaced lever action shotguns in most parts of the world, and Winchester stopped making the Model 1887 in 1920.
Lever-action shotguns are only significant in Australia because the Howard Government banned (for most people) pump action and semi-automatic shotguns by giving them (restricted) Category C and D classifications. Thus the lever action became the most viable alternative shotgun that facilitated more than two shots. I myself bought an IAC Model 87 lever action shotgun following the introduction of Howard's gun laws. (As a primary producer I could legally buy a pump action but wished to avoid the bureaucratic aggravation.)
There are only minor (quality) differences between the latest Adler and other (IAC and Chiappa) lever action shotguns. The actions are broadly the same in all these guns. Lever-action shotguns are inferior to many other shotgun types insofar as each actioning of the lever requires the shooter's finger to be removed from the trigger, and, if they are not well made, they are prone to jamming on eject. 12 gauge shotguns are well known for heavy recoil and are only a short range weapon, so the idea of firing off "up to eight cartridges in as many seconds" (an exaggeration anyway) and actually hitting anything (especially a moving target with the later shots) is farfetched. Bolt action guns (shotguns and rifles) are only a little slower in their potential speed of fire.
I supported the ban (for most shooters) on military style semi automatic rifles with large magazine capacities. Along with most other shooters, however, I also believe that pump action shotguns of up to five rounds magazine capacity should never have been banned. Be that as it may, it is clear that most States and most gun-owners don't have the energy to re-open the divisive gun debate again, so that core regulations are unlikely to change much.
In respect of lever action shotguns, essentially there is little practical difference in utility between the currently available 5 shot magazine lever actions and the currently banned 7 shot magazine version, so I can't understand why Leyonhjelm is making such a fuss. It is also noteworthy that the main shotgun used in crime actually is the common break-action shotgun (because the barrels can easily be sawn-off for concealment purposes). Most other shotguns (including lever actions) cannot be shortened without destroying the action or the magazine. It is possible for a handy metalworker to lengthen the tube magazine on a lever action, but then again, it is not that difficult for a skilled metalworker to make a gun from scratch.

The whole Adler debate is a storm in a teacup. Much of the demand for the gun is the result of publicity following activists' efforts to ban them. On the other hand David Leyonhjelm is not helping the shooting fraternity by rekindling emotions and effectively putting the whole issue of gun control back on the agenda.
Personally, I am fed up with this debate and think we should let sleeping dogs lie.
Fernando Alonso's hospitalisation following his accident in pre-season testing has certainly occupied the headlines this week, though thankfully the Spaniard seems to be uninjured beyond a concussion, for which he is still under observation for.
With the latest from McLaren suggesting he will go on to fight another day sooner rather than later, attention has now firmly turned to why he crashed in the first place... and speculation has certainly been rife, even after McLaren's very blunt statement that Mother Nature was probably to blame.
Indeed, many people continue to speculate that perhaps there is more to the accident that was first apparent - did the Spaniard get a severe electric shock from the car, thus making him lose control? Were his injuries more serious than first claimed by the team? Did the suspension fail?
A dismissal of the rumours by McLaren has done nothing to dampen down the speculation and, in some ways, simply ramped it up further. So here I hope to take a look at the various conspiracy theories and what the reality of them could actually be.
Part of the reason for this slew of questions is partly down to the fact testing isn 'televised', even to those at the track. We are reliant on CCTV feeds only, which are only placed sporadically around the circuit. In this case, there is no feed at turn three, which means the only witness to the accidents were those who saw it live. Even then there weren't many stationed there and photographers tell me few uses that place for shots.
One person who did get a view - and inadvertently fuelled the speculation - was Sebastian Vettel who was following Alonso at the time and described what he saw: 'The speed was slow - maybe 150kph. Then he turned right into the wall. It looked strange.'
Looking at the evidence after the fact, Alonso's accident was indeed a strange one on face value. His McLaren went out of control in turn three of the Circuit de Catalunya, and hit the retaining wall on the inside at high speed. Turn three is a fast uphill right handed curve, and an unusual place for the car to go off on the inside, though it has happened before (ask Pastor Maldonado).
But what caused it? Well the first port of call in this scenario would be a right rear suspension failure, which could easily cause the car to turn hard right. One image posted online appears to show the car with an upper wishbone failure before it hits the wall, but in reality this picture is either cropped or from a sequence of shots taken just after the car had made its first impact with the concrete. McLaren has also stated that initial investigations show that the car had suffered no mechanical failure before it hit the wall.
So if the suspension had failed why could Alonso not steer away from the wall? Some have suggested that he was somehow incapacitated, something which was seemingly backed up by comments apparently made by a photographer who witnessed the accident, saying 'his head was bent to one side before he hit the wall.'
This has led to speculation that something in the car's hybrid system had gone very badly wrong. Honda had been struggling with the cars electronics throughout the test and two different designs of seal on the MGU-K had apparently failed. The high voltage systems on current grand prix cars are extremely potent and could render a serious injury to a person in certain circumstances.
Some conspiracy theorists point to the fact that a carbon fibre chassis is probably quite a good conductor of electrical energy and that if the high voltage circuit from the MGU-K (which we know was having issues) to the battery which is located just behind the driver shorted against the monocoque it could give the driver an extremely serious shock.
But to get an electric shock while sat inside the car would be highly unlikely (though not impossible) because the car is sat on four perfect insulators, the tyres. A quick Google video search of 'Faraday cage car' will show you how good tyres are at insulating from very high voltages indeed.
Others have speculated that an overheating battery emitted toxic gasses that knocked Alonso out briefly. McLaren went out of its way to deny that there was any fault with the hybrid system, after rumours appeared in some publications;
"No electrical discharge or irregularity of any kind occurred in the car's ERS system, either before, during or after the incident," the team claim in a statement. "That last point refutes the erroneous rumours that have spread recently to the effect that Fernando was rendered unconscious by an electrical fault. That is simply not true. Our data clearly shows that he was downshifting while applying full brake pressure right up to the moment of the first impact - something that clearly would not have been possible had he been unconscious at the time."
Indeed when a battery failure has occurred in a car, and gas has been released, the driver has never suffered any ill effect. Kimi Raikkonen suffered just such a failure in 2009 during free practice at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Despite being exposed to the gasses in the cockpit he was able to drive back to the pits and jump out of the car (standard practice in a hybrid failure scenario), but he suffered no ill effect. The batteries in the 2009 Ferrari and the 2015 McLaren do not differ that greatly in terms of chemistry so it's unlikely that a mystery 'knock-out gas' could have overcome Alonso so suddenly.
After the accident it took some time for the Spaniard to be extricated from the car, and McLaren team members were on hand to assist when he was. Additionally all of the marshals involved were wearing their 'marigolds' - special gloves to insulate them from potential electric shocks. Again conspiracy theorists point to this as evidence of a hybrid system failure, but in fact this is just standard practice in crashes involving racing cars using hybrid systems. It was the same with Loic Duval's crash at Le Mans last year, and Anthony Davidson's a few years ago.
Alonso was said to have suffered a concussion in the crash but pictures and video of the aftermath of the incident seem to show little or no damage to the cockpit area. Something McLaren later confirmed 'after the initial impact, the car slid down the wall for about 15 seconds before coming to a halt. All four wheels remained attached to the car, but no damage was sustained by the bodywork or crash structure between the front and rear wheels.'
The car had hit at an almost side-on angle, striking the wall first with its front-right wheel and then with its right-rear. 'It was a significant lateral impact, resulting in damage to the front upright and axle' McLaren claims.
With no damage sustained to the driver safety area it may seem strange for a driver to suffer a concussion, though - ask the right people - and they will tell you that this is seemingly possible.
I am not a medically minded person so I have spoken to some people who are and they tell me that a high deceleration could cause a concussion even if the head did not make direct contact with anything other than the cockpit surround. In addition, though the skull is restrained by the cockpit soft wall and the helmet linked to the head and neck restraints, the brain can move inside the skull and that is what causes concussion in some cases like this' I was informed.
Alonso was said to be fully conscious following the crash even though he did not get out of the car. This, however, is justified by today's grand prix cars being fitted with a warning system which lights up if a car has an impact of over a certain G level. When that is activated after a crash, the driver is instructed not to get out of the car unassisted if he does not have to, and that's exactly what happened in Barcelona with Alonso.
"Alonso was taken from the scene of the incident to the circuit's medical centre, where he was given first aid and, as per normal procedures, was sedated in preparation for an air-lift to hospital," continues the team statement. "In hospital, a thorough and complete analysis of his condition was performed, involving CT scans and MRI scans, all of which were completely normal. In order to provide the privacy and tranquillity required to facilitate a peaceful recuperation, he is being kept in hospital for further observation, and to recover from the effects of the medication that successfully managed his routine sedation following the crash.'
With Alonso looking in doubt for the second of the two tests at Barcelona, and his picture tweeted from his hospital bed in a Spanish intensive care unit hooked up to an IV line it may seem like this was more than a mere concussion. Those more in the know medically than myself tell me that actually this is not unheard of and for a sportsman of Alonso's level, actually quite likely.
One example McLaren used to prove that Alonso was conscious and trying to control the car during the crash was that he was downshifting before he hit the wall. Experienced drivers like Martin Brundle have pointed out that this is actually a slightly odd thing at first glance as most drivers when they lose control do not downshift they just brake and steer.
However, Alonso is well acknowledged to be something of a special talent in a car, so he may have tried to decelerate the car not only via the brakes but also via engine braking, though this is certainly something of an anomaly. Additionally faced with a high speed impact with a solid object drivers sometimes do strange things, Jules Bianchi for example had 100 per cent brake and throttle demand at the same time as he headed towards the recovery vehicle at Suzuka, nobody knows why.
So perhaps there is no great conspiracy about electrics shocks, secret injuries or anything else. Perhaps things are just as they seem. But then what did cause Alonso to lose control of his McLaren?
After reviewing the data from the car and its accident data recorder (all F1 cars have aircraft style black boxes) McLaren has detailed what it believes caused the crash.
'The car ran wide at the entry to Turn Three - which is a fast uphill right-hander - allowing it to run onto the Astroturf that lines the outside of the track. A consequent loss of traction caused a degree of instability, spitting it back towards the inside of the circuit, where it regained traction and struck the wall side-on. Our findings indicate that the accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly (eg, Carlos Sainz Jnr)' the same team statement read.
Lots of people on social media have openly rejected this saying that it is a 'weather balloon' theory (in reference to the Roswell UFO conspiracy theory) and that wind simply cannot blow a car off the track, and to an extent they are right. The wind did not blow the car off the track, but then McLaren never claimed as much.
What happened is a gust of wind at just the wrong moment caused Alonso to make a small mistake on the way into turn three, where drivers typically run right up to the edge of the track anyway, so even a 30mm wider deviation from the normal line due to a strong gust of wind could indeed result in the rear wheel going onto the Astroturf and the car spearing off to the inside of the track. Exactly as McLaren says it did.
So Alonso's crash at Barcelona was the result of bad luck it seems, so why all the secrecy and denial? That's just McLaren's way.
Unfortunately for the team, it will no doubt face a barrage of questions from expectant media F1 testing resumes on Thursday. Perhaps only then will it perhaps put the theories to bed... or create a whole load of new ones.

Continuity Edit
Some of the information in the biographies became outdated after the release of the 1997 re-release and the prequels. It identifies Owen Lars as Obi-Wan Kenobi's brother (which originated in the Return of the Jedi novelization and has since been contradicted), and is the only source listing Beru Lars' maiden name as Beru Weth (later revealed to be Beru Whitesun). It also includes alternate names for some Mos Eisley Cantina patrons, many later revealed to be aliases in other sources. The biography of Darth Vader includes details of his past that are very similar to the plot of the prequels, still years away. This is also the original source of Grand Moff Tarkin's first name, Wilhuff, which has since become canon.

0 Trial date set for DragonCon co-founder
GWINNETT COUNTY, Ga. - A December trial date has been set for DragonCon co-founder Edward Kramer, who is accused of child molestation.
Kramer entered the courtroom in a wheelchair, equipped with an oxygen tank and hearing aid.
"He's in terrible shape in our judgement," said Kramer's defense attorney McNeill Stokes.
The defense team spent about 90 minutes laying out his numerous medical conditions – a neck injury, thyroid problems, diabetes, staph infections, sleep disorders and COPD.
Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said Kramer is fit to stand trial. Porter said he believes Kramer has spent years misleading the court.
"He's not faking it," said Stokes. "You all heard the testimony."
Dr. Lloyd Jacobs, head of the infirmary at the Gwinnett County Jail, has examined Kramer weekly since January.
Kramer's criminal case began in 2000 when he was charged with molesting three children. He was released on bond, but re-arrested in
Connecticut in 2011 after being accused of having unsupervised contact with a 14-year-old boy in a hotel room.
"He wants to go to trial," said Stokes.
Stokes said Kramer will need reasonable accommodations to make sure he can make it through the trial each day.
Jacobs testified he believes Kramer could do two four-hour sessions with an hour and a half break in between.
But it is expected that more medical experts will testify before a final decision is made about accommodations.
The World Health Organization director general said on Monday that the Zika virus outbreak shows the danger posed by dormant diseases that can "wake up".
Watch: In blunt assessment, WHO director warns of global failure to prepare for infectious disease
The world is not prepared to cope with what appears to be a dramatic increase in new and reemerging infectious disease threats, the director general of the World Health Organization warned Monday.
Dr. Margaret Chan issued that blunt assessment in a speech opening the 2016 World Health Assembly, the annual general meeting of the WHO's member states.
Characterizing her own remarks as a “stern warning,” Chan laid out various threats from West Africa's Ebola outbreak, which has continued to flare, to Zika virus and urban outbreaks of yellow fever in Africa, which are increasingly the source of global concern.

“In an interconnected world characterized by profound mobility of people and goods, few threats to health are local anymore,” Chan warned.
She suggested the Zika virus — which causes microcephaly and other devastating brain defects in infants born to women infected during pregnancy — has shown how impotent the world is in the face of disease threats.
“To protect women of childbearing age, all we can offer is advice. Avoid mosquito bites. Delay pregnancy. Do not travel to areas with ongoing transmission,” Chan said, adding the crisis has also brought to the fore the consequences of not offering global access to family planning services.
The weeklong World Health Assembly will be asked to consider a number of proposals for shoring up the global response capacity for infectious disease threats.
One would involve creating a new mechanism, an international public health alert, to signal to countries that a disease outbreak risks becoming a global public health emergency.

The proposal to allow the WHO to declare international public health alerts is contained in a review of the International Health Regulations. The review was requested as a postmortem of how the IHR — a global treaty aimed at mitigating the risks of international spread of diseases — fared during the Ebola crisis.
The report concluded the problem wasn't the IHR, but a failure to put the regulations into effect.
The assembly will also be asked to approve and fund an overhaul of the WHO's health emergency management system. Chan called it the item on the agency's agenda with “the most sweeping consequences.”
“Anything short of full political and financial support for the program will handicap the WHO response, right now and into the future,” she said.
Saying that the current federal government shutdown and tensions between Republicans and Democrats have made Texans ready for a change in leadership, Libertarian Kathie Glass on Wednesday officially announced her candidacy in the 2014 governor's race.
"We're going to be active in every aspect of this race,” said Glass, a Houston lawyer who also ran for governor in 2010. “We are getting out there a lot sooner.”
Glass said she plans to visit every county in Texas during her campaign and will talk to Texans about their frustrations with the current state of affairs.
“This shutdown is just a glimpse of what might happen,” Glass said at her Austin news conference, at which several other Texas Libertarian hopefuls also announced their candidacies. “Voters know that what they want they are not going to get from the two other parties, so we are looking forward to offering them this alternative from the Libertarian Party.”
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Glass said her campaign would focus on the idea of nullification, a legal theory that a state can invalidate federal laws it finds unconstitutional. She said that if she doesn't win, she hopes her election will instill that idea into the public and the winning candidate.
“I want to make nullification a household-known concept,” Glass said. "This is our way out of this federal overreach."
She said she would nullify the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and federal regulations on companies that lead them to ship jobs overseas to nations with laxer regulations.
"In the current environment, if we keep doing what we have always done, voting within the two-party system, we won't be able to keep what we have got," Glass said. "We have got to chart a new course."
Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced his campaign for governor in July. He faces former Texas Workforce Commissioner Tom Pauken in the GOP primary. State Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, is expected to announce her candidacy Thursday. Glass said she was not aware of any Libertarian challengers.
Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, said he did not think Glass' run would have a decisive impact.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
“Libertarians regularly run candidates, so they will get a small percentage of the vote, but I don't see it affecting the gubernatorial race,” Munisteri said.
Glass received 2.2 percent of the vote in her 2010 run.
Her husband, Tom Glass, the vice chairman of the Texas Libertarian Party, announced at Wednesday's news conference that he will be running for attorney general in 2014.
He said he is running to battle unnecessary restrictions from the federal government.
“I will use the force of the office to stop unconstitutional federal acts in Texas,” Glass said, citing Obamacare, privacy laws, prison regulations and spending.
Republicans Dan Branch, a state representative from Dallas; Ken Paxton, a state senator from McKinney; and Barry Smitherman, the chairman of the Railroad Commission of Texas, are also running to succeed Abbott as attorney general.
Other Libertarians who announced their candidacies Wednesday include journalist Brandon de Hoyos and Allen businessman Ed Kless, who are running for lieutenant governor; Lago Vista City Council member Ed Tidwell, who's running for land commissioner; rancher Rocky Palmquist, who's seeking to become agriculture commissioner; and Austin businessman Mark Miller, who's running for railroad commissioner.
Texas Libertarians wishing to run for statewide office in the 2014 election must file with the party by Dec. 9 and receive a majority vote at the party's state convention in April.

When Kane Zipperman's ex texted him to ask if the relationship was actually over, his response was a carefully thought out series of witty insults and internet memes.
Since posting the conversation on his Twitter @KaneZipperman has received over 71, 762 re tweets and 90, 434 favorites.
Kane Zipperman, 17, got revenge against his cheating ex by being hilarious in a series of texts that he later posted to his Twitter
Kane posted his entire text exchange between him and his ex on Twitter
'So Um...I still like you...alot,' said Kane's ex.
'I like meth,' he wrote as a witty comeback.
As the text exchange progressed his ex wrote, 'It was just one guy. Cmon Kane...Please...I miss you...No guy has ever treated me as good as you...You are literally the sweetest and cutest guy on the planet. Will you please be mine again...?'
Kane charmingly replied with a meme of Mila Kunis saying, 'No. Go f**** yourself.'
Later in the conversation when Kane's ex calls him a 'douche' for posting their conversation on Twitter, he spins her 'It was just one guy' line into 'It was just one tweet.'
'Can you actually say something to me please?.' she begged .
Kane pointed out that at one point in their conversation his ex was quoting Hitler
Kane then humorously texted back with the infamous meme of the 'I like turtles' kid being interviewed by a news reporter.
'Why do you hate me?' his ex inquired a few minutes later.
'Despite the fact that you cheated on me with my best friend, I don't hate you. I just strongly dislike you.'
His ex then responded, 'Hate is more lasting than dislike.'
Kane then pointed out that his ex was actually quoting Hitler.
The conversation continued with Kane saying he'd rather listen to a Jonas Brother's song over and over again that go back to his ex. He then told her not to text him again.
Even though he doesn't want to hear from his ex he's joyfully been re tweeting messages from adoring female fans like @jennegrearr who wrote,'I actually cried when @KaneZipperman followed me,' along with hearts and smiley faces.
This is not the first time Kane has made internet news. Last year Kane was spotted wearing a tiger T-Shirt standing behind Tiger Woods as he played the Masters game.
Kane told a reporter from Back Nine in an interview in April that he's been following the masters game for the past 7 years.
It seems as though Zipperman's fans will be following his tweets for years to come.

We have already reported about Graco child seat recall in one of our previous articles. Now, Graco Children's Products has announced about the expansion of the recall with nearly 1.9 million infant safety seats. The problem is that the latches in these seats may become hard or even impossible to open. If this happens, the parents may not be able to take children out of the child seats during an emergency situation.
Now, the total number of the affected child seats is roughly 5.6 million units. The thing is that the buckles are hard to open especially when beverages are spilled on them. It should be noted that child seats manufactured between the years 2010 and 2013 are affected.
Following are the car seats affected by the recall:
SnugRide and SnugRide Classic Connect
SnugRide 30 and SnugRide Classic Connect 30
SnugRide 35 and SnugRide Classic Connect 35
SnugRide Click Connect 40
Aprica A30
The previous recall involved nearly 4.2 million units:
Cozy Cline
Comfort Sport
Classic Ride 50
My Ride 65
My Ride 70
My Ride 65 with Safety Surround
Size4Me 70
My Size 70
Head Wise 70
Smartseat
Nautilus 3-in-1
Nautilus Elite
Argos
The child seat maker will replace the buckles and offer and updated mechanism to those owners who are not affected by the recall, but who want to change the old design with the new one. Owners with questions may contact Graco at 800-345-4109 for more information about Graco child seat recall.

Pyramid no longer depends on or configures the Mako and Chameleon templating system renderers by default. Disincluding these templating systems by default means that the Pyramid core has fewer dependencies and can run on future platforms without immediate concern for the compatibility of its templating add-ons. It also makes maintenance slightly more effective, as different people can maintain the templating system add-ons that they understand and care about without needing commit access to the Pyramid core, and it allows users who just don't want to see any packages they don't use come along for the ride when they install Pyramid.
This means that upon upgrading to Pyramid 1.5a2+, projects that use either of these templating systems will see a traceback that ends something like this when their application attempts to render a Chameleon or Mako template:
ValueError: No such renderer factory .pt
Or:
ValueError: No such renderer factory .mako
Or:
ValueError: No such renderer factory .mak
Support for Mako templating has been moved into an add-on package named pyramid_mako , and support for Chameleon templating has been moved into an add-on package named pyramid_chameleon . These packages are drop-in replacements for the old built-in support for these templating langauges. All you have to do is install them and make them active in your configuration to register renderer factories for .pt and/or .mako (or .mak ) to make your application work again.
To re-add support for Chameleon and/or Mako template renderers into your existing projects, follow the below steps.
If you depend on Mako templates:
Make sure the pyramid_mako package is installed. One way to do this is by adding pyramid_mako to the installation_requires section of your package's setup.py file and afterwards rerunning setup.py develop : setup ( #... install_requires = [ 'pyramid_mako' , # new dependency 'pyramid' , #... ], )
Within the portion of your application which instantiates a Pyramid Configurator (often the main() function in your project's __init__.py file), tell Pyramid to include the pyramid_mako includeme: config = Configurator(.....) config.include('pyramid_mako')
If you depend on Chameleon templates:
Make sure the pyramid_chameleon package is installed. One way to do this is by adding pyramid_chameleon to the installation_requires section of your package's setup.py file and afterwards rerunning setup.py develop : setup ( #... install_requires = [ 'pyramid_chameleon' , # new dependency 'pyramid' , #... ], )
Within the portion of your application which instantiates a Pyramid Configurator (often the main() function in your project's __init__.py file), tell Pyramid to include the pyramid_chameleon includeme: config = Configurator(.....) config.include('pyramid_chameleon')
Note that it's also fine to install these packages into older Pyramids for forward compatibility purposes. Even if you don't upgrade to Pyramid 1.5 immediately, performing the above steps in a Pyramid 1.4 installation is perfectly fine, won't cause any difference, and will give you forward compatibility when you eventually do upgrade to Pyramid 1.5.
With the removal of Mako and Chameleon support from the core, some unit tests that use the pyramid.renderers.render* methods may begin to fail. If any of your unit tests are invoking either pyramid.renderers.render() or pyramid.renderers.render_to_response() with either Mako or Chameleon templates then the pyramid.config.Configurator instance in effect during the unit test should be also be updated to include the addons, as shown above. For example:
class ATest ( unittest . TestCase ): def setUp ( self ): self . config = pyramid . testing . setUp () self . config . include ( 'pyramid_mako' ) def test_it ( self ): result = pyramid . renderers . render ( 'mypkg:templates/home.mako' , {})

As 2008 is slowly moving toward its end, we start taking a look at the most pirated titles in various categories. First up are games. As expected, Spore is by far the most downloaded game on BitTorrent, in part thanks to the DRM that came with the game.
Traditionally, games can't compete with the most pirated movies and TV-shows in actual download numbers, but Spore came very close this year.
Only 10 days after the game's launch date, already half a million people had downloaded the game. During the months after that, another million people obtained a copy of the game via BitTorrent. According to our estimates, Spore was downloaded 1.7 million times since early September, a record breaking figure for a game.
When we posted about the impressive download rate on Spore – inflated due to the DRM that was put into the game – EA doubted our statistics. EA's Mariam Sughayer said that every BitTorrent download was not a successful copy, and that several downloads didn't work, were buggy, or contained viruses. We wont deny that on badly moderated torrent sites, malicious torrents probably can be found. However, this constitutes less than 1% of the available torrents, and they are not added to our statistics.
Below is the list of the 10 most downloaded (PC) games on BitTorrent in 2008, with an estimated download count for each. In second place we see The Sims 2, also from the hands of Spore creator Will Wright. Assassin's Creed completes the top 3 with just over a million downloads.
Among the rarer late-Sixties Pony cars was Ford's Mustang Boss 429. When a bright red, perfectly-restored example finds itself in Jay Leno's garage for his eponymous web series this week, Leno's beyond eager to drive it. But first, a quick history lesson on how this throaty muscle coupe came to be.
When Semon “Bunkie” Knudsen became Ford's president following his departure from GM, Blue Oval engineers had been working on the Boss 429 engine for the Galaxie. Knudsen told them to scratch that and instead figure out a way to cram that massive NASCAR V-8 into the Mustang. Carcraft, a Dearborn, MI, outfit that worked closely with Ford in the same vein as AMG worked with Mercedes-Benz, was responsible for getting that prodigious drivetrain in the ‘Stang, and oversaw the entire build of the 1969 and 1970 Boss 429s. Those models were underrated in terms of competitor power. Mopar Hemis were cranking out 420-plus horsepower; the Boss 429 had 375 and 450 lb-ft of twist.
Marcus Anghel, of AnghelRestorations.com, who oversaw the rebuild, says they were written off because they “were detuned for the street. There were issues with insurance and smog,” among other things. This car featured a smog pump, which Anghel points out after popping the hood to reveal a sparkling clean engine. Anghel indicates some of the mods Carcraft had to make to shoehorn that V-8 in the smaller bay, such as moving the shock towers.
Rogue Factor and Focus Home Interactive have teamed up once more, this time to bring Necromunda to the digital world.
Necromunda: Underhive Wars, as the adaptation is named, will be a turn-based tactical RPG in which gangs fight it out over resources, power, and ancient technology in the hellish sub-city of the Underhive. And considering that Necromunda is set in the Warhammer 40,000 universes, “hellish” really does take on a very particular meaning.
That, unfortunately, is basically all that's currently known; there isn't even any confirmation of whether this'll be a PC release or not. If it follows in Mordheim‘s footsteps, Necromunda will wind up with an Early Access release before probably making a transition to other platforms, but… well, for all I know, it's going to be an iOS game. (Please don't be an iOS game.) Edit: It's confirmed for PC, yay.
We'll apparently be hearing more from a Focus event taking place on the 1st and 2nd of February. Until then, all I can really do is wonder is what the hell took so long for this game to get adapted… and maybe debate whether to play Escher, Delaque, or another house.
Cleveland Indians

When you're on a team with guys like Francisco Lindor, Carlos Santana and Jason Kipnis, it's easy to go unnoticed. Since joining the Indians, Brandon Guyer has been one of the best fourth outfielder's in baseball. Between the Rays and Indians last season, he put up a .795 OPS (.372 OBP) and played every outfield position. He also hit nine home runs in 293 at-bats. On almost any other team in Major League Baseball, Guyer would start every day.
The Indians are lucky to have such a dynamic presence in a platoon role and off the bench.
Detroit Tigers

While the majority of the Tigers relief corps hasn't been great the last two years, Alex Wilson has been a constant out of the bullpen. He's been so reliable, in fact, that a lot of people are perplexed as to why he hasn't been given a more important role; at the moment, he pitches mostly in middle relief. In 2015, Wilson pitched to a 3.53 FIP (2.19 ERA), and in 2016 he compiled a 3.60 FIP (2.96 ERA). He's also thrown the most innings out of the Tigers ‘pen, totalling 143 between 2015 and 2016.
Hopefully the Tigers give Wilson a chance to thrive in high leverage situations this season.
Kansas City Royals

Normally, I like to stay away from players who haven't proven themselves over multiple seasons, but Matt Strahm was outstanding last year and is virtually unknown outside of the AL Central. In 2016, Strahm compiled a 2.06 FIP and 12.3 K/9. He was good throughout his time in the Minor Leagues, too.
He's off to a rough start this season, but like last year, it's a small sample size.
Chicago White Sox

In March, I watched Nate Jones pitch for team USA in the World Baseball Classic and took notice of his success. I was amazed I hadn't heard more about him, especially after I looked up his stats. I mostly recognized him because of his funky motion. Last season, Jones was arguably the White Sox most reliable reliever. He led the team in innings pitched (70 ⅔) and sported an excellent 2.93 FIP.
The White Sox have a great combo at the back-end with Jones handing the ball to Robertson.
Minnesota Twins
Robbie Grossman

After a few unexciting years in Houston, Robbie Grossman got released and picked up by the Minnesota Twins. A bargain for the, Grossman has thrived since arriving in Minnesota. Last year, in 389 plate appearances, he put up an .828 OPS (.386 OBP) and hit 11 home runs. He's off to a solid start this year, too.
Grossman was bad in the outfield in 2016, compiling a pretty awful -2.6 dWAR. I think it's a blip, though, as his previous seasons were nowhere close to that (-0.7 career dWAR excluding 2016).

Protesters are gathering in support of Michael Brown in and around St. Louis as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no-indictment vote in the coming days by a grand jury for the officer who shot him.
Demonstrators held a ‘die-in' Sunday to mark 100 days since the unarmed Ferguson, Missouri teen was killed. They also convened to, among other things, prepare for the imminent court decision by issuing ‘rules of engagement' for police there for crowd control, the New York Times reports.
Many of the the high-profile protesters met with President Obama and discussed the matter November 5, including Reverend Al Sharpton. It was a meeting the Gateway Pundit notes was not included on the president's daily schedule.
Sharpton told the Times that Obama urged the group to ‘stay on course.'
‘[Mr. Obama] was concerned about Ferguson staying on course in terms of pursuing what it was that he knew we were advocating. He said he hopes that we're doing all we can to keep peace.'
A crowd of a couple hundred demonstrators, angry about the fatal August shooting took to the streets of St. Louis on Sunday, briefly blocking a major intersection in protest.
Dozens of people lay down in the street outside of a downtown theater hosting a film festival, pretending to have been shot by other demonstrators playing the role of police officers in an action intended to evoke the memory of 18-year-old Brown, who died 100 days ago in front of his home in the suburb of Ferguson.
Marchers went on to briefly block a major intersection near Washington University and the event ended without any of the violence that was seen in Ferguson following Brown's shooting death by police officer Darren Wilson.
{snip}
‘We've decided not to wait for that decision. We've decided to get started,' said Rockit Ali, a 22-year-old organizer of Sunday's demonstration, who marched in a Spider-Man mask.
While Sunday's event had been planned as a nonviolent action, Ali said that violence could not be ruled out if the grand jury finds Wilson without fault.
‘Rioting and looting are the tools of those without a voice. The rioting and looting, while I didn't participate in it, was necessary. Without it we would not be standing here today,' Ali said. ‘There is no revolution without violence.'

Authorities in Las Vegas are searching for a murder suspect who managed to escape from a police department interrogation room, reports CBS News.
According to NBC News, Alonso Perez, 25, was taken into custody on Fridaymorning in connection to a homicide that occurred at an area fast food restaurant on August 27.
After roughly two hours of questioning at the North Las Vegas Police Department, the interrogating detective left the room.
Perez was somehow able to break out of his handcuffs. He then exited the room and ultimately fled the building, notes FOX News.
Once outside, he allegedly stole a white pickup truck, which has since been located and returned.
Police are still searching for Perez and authorities consider him to be armed and dangerous.

Good pick, omg_its_a_sushi. I took a bit of a break, but I hope to get back on track this week. Still accepting suggestions in the r/Dota2 thread for hero suggestions for tomorrow.
Everyone's favourite fey creature, Aiushtahsdahfjghaf. Loved Impetus, but I'm sorely disappointed that it's her ult now. I suppose it was necessary, because it could just end up being way too much damage in the early game. But, man was it ever satisfying to land the perfect Impetus hit. Attack, animation cancel, run away… only to find that your target has also run away. Hit for +10000000 damage. Prosper.
I don't know if you guys consider Impetus a skill-shot, but let's talk about them anyway. What's your favourite skillshot in the game? Do you think that without the limitations of the WC3 engine that we'll eventually see some new targeting mechanics in Dota 2? Fall like leaves in fallpaper. 1920×1080.

Someone posted scans (well, photos) of the Bakemonogatari Key Animation Note on /r/anime the other day, mentioning that “There's an afterword by the visual director, Nobuyuki Takeuchi, at the end if anyone wants to translate it.”
Well, here we are. Let's do this.
The Artistic World of Bakemonogatari
Bakemonogatari Visual Director Nobuyuki Takeuchi
On the subject of creating the artistic world of Bakemonogatari, I had some reference material in mind when I asked Ryubido's Mr. Hisaharu Iijima to create the very first storyboards. It was just a book that I happened to own myself, a photo collection called Under Construction: The Nippori Toneri Line, 13 March 2001 by Sadahiro Koizumi (pub. Little Gallery, 2001). The atmosphere of the photos printed there matched my image of the town that Bakemonogatari's characters lived in. I had a meeting in the stairwell where I showed the book to Director [Akiyuki] Shinbou and Mr. [Tatsuya] Oishi, and they both liked it as well, so I asked Mr. Iijima for a few storyboards based on the photos.
Mr. Nisio Isin's original novel doesn't describe the town where Araragi and the other characters live in very much detail, so I was anxious about how to depict it on screen. Araragi mentions that it's in the “countryside,” but I wondered if that couldn't mean less of a vast pastoral landscape, and more of an emotional “countryside.” Araragi is a bit oblique, so I thought that he might have been looking at the town he lives in from a more interpretive angle, and seeing it with all its modern buildings as having the features of an emotional “countryside.”
Thinking of it that way, we no longer had to depict a literal country town, so I tried to visualize the kind of scenery that you can see in every city in Japan, no matter the region. The one common point that I thought of was the sight of something under construction, and I felt that this photobook overlapped with the world that Araragi lives in.
I thought a contrast with large buildings under construction, and the cold inhumanity of concrete, would emphasize the feeling of alienation that leads Araragi to dismiss the town where he lives as “countryside.” Back in the old days, I went on bicycle tours, and I'd spend nights camping out in places like the old National Railway terminal and Sapporo's office district. There were always so many people passing by, but I had no connection to them, and I had a strong feeling of being alone, which I think came from that contrast with all the huge, artificial concrete buildings. Looking at Mr. Koizumi's photobook was like a flashback to that time.
From that overlap between Mr. Koizumi's photobook and the world of the work, I asked for the storyboards using the photos as a reference, and had Mr. Iijima fill in the details of textures and so forth. I made him pledge to stick closely to the photos when drawing the boards to preserve realism in the contrast. When I laid out each cut, I made calculations to bring out that realism by deepening the difference between the characters and the contrasting objects. One technique I used was to place electric poles, posts, and such around the screen to use as an easy basis for comparison.
Moreover, although the buildings under construction shown on-screen don't have any meaning in themselves, I wanted to use their size and inhuman feeling as a substitute for the mob characters (the people passing by in the background). Ordinarily, there would be secondary characters in the background serving as the mob, but in Bakemonogatari that role is taken by the buildings.
Although I proposed using the photographs as a basis for the entire world in this way, I left their translation onto the storyboards to Mr. Iijima. The interesting things that Mr. Iijima thought up, like the colorings of the sky, probably set a direction for the rest of the work. I think it's thanks to him that we were able to create an artistic world that doesn't exist in any other work, something different from any anime up to this point.
DeKalb County schools must provide training at middle and high schools to stop harassment of students against others because of their religion or nationality, according to an agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice and announced Tuesday.
The agreement came after the Counsel for the Sikh Coalition filed a complaint that a Sikh student at Peachtree Charter Middle School was being harassed by three other students last fall and eventually got into a fight with one of his tormentors.
The complaint said school officials did nothing to help the boy, who had allegedly been subjected to verbal and physical harassment because of his Sikh faith by another student. According to the complaint, a student had tried to cut the boy's hair, he was called “Aladdin” because he wore a turban, and he was told by a peer he could go back to his country.
The coalition said the school district's response to several incidents was not appropriate and disciplining the students failed. The boy was afraid he would continue to be harassed.
According to the Justice Department, the district agreed to the settlement but denied it had done anything wrong.
In the 2013-14 term, the school district must work with a consultant to develop and implement anti-harassment training at Peachtree Charter and Dunwoody High School, where the boy is expected to enroll next term, that addresses bias based on religion and national origin. The district also must immediately implement a plan to keep the boy safe when he is at school and is harassed.
The agreement goes so far as to specify where the three boys accused of harassing the other will sit on the bus and where the boy who was their target will sit.
One of the boys and his target will be in separate classes, according to the agreement. If they must be in the same classes, the agreement also says where they will sit in relation to each other. Another student has been removed from the classes they share for the rest of this term.
Staff will be assigned specifically to help the boy if he is harassed at his new school.
The school also has suggested offering “voluntary mediation” between the boys in an attempt to resolve their differences.
“Every student should be able to attend school without fear of being harassed and bullied because of his skin color or religious beliefs,” U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement.
A DeKalb schools spokeswoman reached late Tuesday was unaware of the allegations or the agreement.
The Federal Reserve noise machine is back at work, in the form of new testimony by Chairman Ben Bernanke, grimly warning the Senate Budget Committee of a future crisis. Needless to say, the Washington Post, which loves these tales, slapped it on the online front page.
And what, or should I say who, is the source of this crisis? Is it Osama bin Laden and the cost of the War on Terror? Is it the ghost of Saddam Hussein and the two trillion dollar war in Iraq? Is it George Bush, Dick Cheney, the past Republican Congress and their tax cuts? No, Bernanke mentioned none of these.
So who's the villain? Why ... I am! I'm a Baby Boomer. My mother and dad did the deed - or so anyway my brothers told me - sometime in the backwash of the second world war. And there I've been, a demographic disaster, a ticking time bomb, a walking road to ruin, ever since.
This is news? Bernanke should check with the Census Bureau. They will advise, I think, that the tale of the Baby Boomers isn't exactly new. The last of us was born, so they say, in the early 1960s. We've been counted and schooled. We marched against Vietnam: the FBI knows about us. We pay taxes: the IRS knows about us. We do email: the NSA knows about us. Hell, Google knows about us. Nobody in the history of the universe is better documented than we are.
Or Ben might ask Alan Greenspan. Did he know about the Baby Boomers when he chaired a commission on Social Security back in 1983? I was already 31 years old at the time; Alan and I had actually met. I'm fairly sure he was aware, in general terms, of my existence. And his commission, back then, knew exactly how old we'd all be when 2008 came around and kids born in 1946 started to retire.
The Greenspan commission put the Social Security system into a pay-in-advance mode. Payroll taxes were raised and the Social Security trust fund built up an enormous surplus, held as US government bonds, ever since. That surplus exists today. Social Security assets are over four times costs right now - and are expected to remain above three times costs for at least the next twenty years. That means interest payments will be coming in, to supplement payroll taxes and meet the bills.
Is there a Social Security financing crisis? No. And there won't be one, either.
Bernanke says that our "problem" is an aging population, plus rising health care costs. The inference is that we, as a society, cannot afford to keep our elderly in modest comfort, or to pay their medical bills. He implies (without quite saying it) that the solution must be cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And that, of course, is what the press picks up.
Here's the truth: By any measure of living standards, we're richer now than ever before. By any projection, we will be richer still in twenty or thirty years. By any measure, we can afford the Social Security program we've got now. And we can afford health care too, although costs are a problem, and getting insurance to those who don't have it is an even bigger problem.
The "fundamental decision" isn't over how much to spend on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The fundamental decision is: what should happen to today's working Americans, when we get old? For just as my generation didn't appear yesterday, we won't disappear, either, when pensions and health care are cut. We'll just lead poorer, sicker, and shorter lives.
Cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid should be off the table. Now. After that, we can talk, if we must: about letting Bush's tax cuts expire, or reforming health care, or about the money we could save by getting out of Iraq; or, for that matter, about whether there really is, or really will be, a federal deficit problem.
Hillary Clinton has a 9-point lead over Donald Trump in a recent poll in Wisconsin. | Getty Poll: Clinton leads Trump by 9 points in Wisconsin
Hillary Clinton has a 9-point lead among likely voters in Wisconsin, an advantage driven by increasingly enthusiastic Democrats and depressed Republicans, according to a new poll out Wednesday.
The Marquette Law School poll, considered the gold standard in Wisconsin, shows Clinton leading Trump among likely voters, 46 percent to 37 percent.
But the poll shows an interesting divergence: Clinton's lead is larger among likely voters than among all registered voters. Clinton has a smaller 5-point advantage among registered voters, the poll shows, 42 percent to 35 percent.
In the previous Marquette poll, back in March, Clinton led Trump by 10 points among registered voters, 47 percent to 37 percent.
The same phenomenon is apparent in the closely watched Senate race. Former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold leads GOP Sen. Ron Johnson among likely voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. But Feingold's lead is smaller among all registered voters: 45 percent to 41 percent.
Polls that survey registered voters but also screen for likely voters typically show the Republican candidate doing better among those most likely to vote. But only 78 percent of Republican respondents said they were certain to vote in the new Marquette poll, compared to 84 percent of Democrats. That's a reversal from June 2012, when 90 percent of GOP voters described themselves as certain to vote in the fall, compared to only 80 percent of Democrats.
Marquette pollster Charles Franklin warns that the likely-voter results could change moving forward. “The decision to vote doesn't really firm up until the late summer and the early-fall campaign,” said Franklin. “At that point, the likely-voter number is a little more stable, a little more reliable.”
The poll, like others, shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders leading Trump by much wider margins than Clinton. Among those Sanders voters, two-thirds back Clinton, with just 4 percent choosing Trump. Nearly a quarter, however, say they will vote for neither candidate.
The poll was conducted June 9-12, surveying 800 registered voters and 666 likely voters. The margin of error, including both sampling error and design effect, is plus or minus 4.4 percent for registered voters and 4.9 percentage points for likely voters. The survey included one day of interviews conducted following this weekend's shootings in Orlando, Fla.; the results on Sunday weren't statistically different from responses earlier in the survey.
Microsoft today announced that going forward, it will not turn on the “Do Not Track” feature in the upcoming versions of Internet Explorer and Spartan by default.
The “Do Not Track” setting in many popular browsers tells websites and their advertisers that you want to opt out of third-party tracking for advertising purposes. All of the major browser vendors, including Google, Mozilla, Opera, Apple and Microsoft, support this feature, but whether advertisers honor the user's request — and it's no more than a request sent by the browser — is up to them. And most probably don't.
Microsoft started enabling “Do Not Track” as the default setting with the launch of Internet Explorer 10. Unsurprisingly, this created a bit of a controversy. Previous to Microsoft's decision, advertisers had agreed to honor Do Not Track, as long as it wasn't the default setting. They argued that the decision not to be tracked should be made by the user and not the browser vendor. Microsoft stuck to its guns saying users could always opt out during the setup process, and “Do Not Track” remained the default — until now (and the number of advertisers that honored it remained low).
Chrome and Firefox leave “Do Not Track” off by default.
Today, the company is reversing its stand. Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer Brendon Lynch argues that it's doing so in order to comply with the latest draft of the official W3C standard for “Do Not Track.” This new draft explicitly notes that “the signal sent MUST reflect the user's preference, not the choice of some vendor, institution, site or network-imposed mechanism outside the user's control; this applies equally to both the general preference and exceptions.”
“Put simply, we are updating our approach to DNT to eliminate any misunderstanding about whether our chosen implementation will comply with the W3C standard,” Lynch writes today. “Without this change, websites that receive a DNT signal from the new browsers could argue that it doesn't reflect the users' preference, and therefore, choose not to honor it.”
Given the voluntary nature of “Do Not Track,” it probably doesn't matter all that much whether you turn it on or off anyway. If you want to make sure you aren't tracked, using tools like Disconnect and add-ons like Ghostery, uBlock and the EFF's Privacy Badger is more effective anyway — at least on the desktop.
Ghazal­a Sharif has been appoin­ted the SHO of the Rang Mahal Police Statio­n
LAHORE ': A female sub-inspector was appointed the station house officer (SHO) of a regular police station in Lahore on Friday.
DIG Operations Dr Haider Ashraf promoted Ghazala Sharif to the post of the Rang Mahal Police Station SHO – making her the first woman to have been appointed to this position in the city after 17 years.
Besides, sub-inspector Nabila Kausar has been appointed the SHO of the women's Race Course Police Station (RCPS).
The Punjab CM ‘s Strategic Reforms Unit (Law & Order) tweeted:
Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, a city of approximately 15 million people, has 84 police stations. However, there is only one woman's police station in the city. The RCPS is used to keep female suspects behind bars. Cases whereby both the suspect and the person who has filed a complaint are female are registered at the RCPS.
Police detain 60 people for questioning
The DIG's step to appoint a female SHO came as a result of new officers receiving training specifically for this post. A refresher and training course of over 100 inspectors and sub-inspectors including women was conducted at the Qila Gujjar Singh Police Lines.
There are five more female officers who are going under training and doing refresher course for SHOs. They would also be considered to be posted as SHOs.
The purpose of the refresher course was to bring forth new officers who could be posted as SHOs.
For many years, the police department, because of a shortage of trained officers, have had to persist with a certain pool of officers to fill the SHO slots.
Apart from Ghazala, other female sub-inspectors are also taking the refresher course so that they can be considered for appointment as SHOs.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who was captured on videotape torturing an Afghan grain dealer has reportedly been detained, a senior U.S. State Department official told CNN Saturday.
Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, pictured here, allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape.
The official said the government of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi as one of its seven emirates, told the State Department that Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is under house arrest pending an investigation, but that the United States has not independently confirmed the development.
The videotape emerged last month in a federal civil lawsuit filed in Houston, Texas, by Bassam Nabulsi, a U.S. citizen, against the sheikh. Former business partners, the men had a falling out, in part over the tape. In a statement to CNN, the sheikh's U.S. attorney said Nabulsi is using the videotape to influence the court over a business dispute.
The tape of the heinous torture session is delaying the ratification of a civil nuclear deal between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, senior U.S. officials familiar with the case have said. The senior U.S. officials said the administration has held off on the ratification process because it believes sensitivities over the story can hurt its passage.
On Saturday, Human Rights Watch called the sheikh's reported detention "a significant development" but said the UAE government needs to do more to restore confidence in its judicial system.
"The videotape of this episode shocked the world," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "The report of the arrest was reassuring, but now the government needs to make the details public. Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses and torture."
On the tape, Sheikh Issa appears to burn with rage. Apparently believing he was cheated in a business deal, the sheikh was trying to extract a confession from the Afghan grain dealer.
With a private security officer assisting, Sheikh Issa is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan's mouth.
As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is literally poured on his wounds.
The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three-hour-long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi. It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself.
The tape has been viewed by CNN. Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story »
After international concerns over the tape mounted in late April, Abu Dhabi's government issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and planned an immediate and comprehensive review of it.
The sheikh, who holds no official government position, is the half-brother of the UAE's ruler, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
Human Rights Watch sent a April 28 letter to the president imploring him to form "an independent body" to probe both the torture and and the "failure" of the UAE's Interior Ministry "to bring those involved to justice." The group reiterated that call Saturday.
As for the grain dealer, UAE officials say he survived the ordeal, and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against each other.
However, Nabulsi's attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said the grain dealer can't be located and it is not known whether he is alive.

MAY 19--Driving without her glasses, a 21-year-old Florida woman early today struck a pedestrian walking on the side of the road. But it was only until Brittanie Wagner was pulled over by a cop for leaving the scene of an accident, that she realized the victim was her own father, according to a police report.
Wagner told investigators that she initially thought she hit “an animal or a garbage can” while driving along a Bradenton street around 1 AM. But when her passenger said that a person was actually struck, Wagner arrived at an unfortunate realization.
“Oh my God I hit my Dad,” Wagner exclaimed to her friend.
Wagner, pictured in the mug shot at right, told cops that she came to that conclusion “not because she recognized him but because she knows he always walks on that particular roadway.” According to Wagner's fiancé, Kevin Rodriguez, she was serving as designated driver for a friend who was intoxicated. Rodriguez added that victim Oliver Wagner, 42, frequently walks along the roadway to a billiards hall where he shoots pool.
Oliver Wagner, who was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries, was helping to arrange his daughter's release this afternoon from the Manatee County jail, said Rodriguez.
A sheriff's deputy noted that the accident left the car Wagner was driving with a “web shaped crack on the passenger side of the windshield” and a broken rear view mirror. In addition to the leaving the scene of an accident count, Wagner was charged with failing to obey a restriction on her driver's license requiring her to wear eyeglasses while operating a motor vehicle.

“INNOCENT” PHOTOGRAPHS OF Irish teenage girls are ending up on pornography sites without them realising.
A special report due to be aired tonight will show the RTÉ Investigations Unit revealing how thousands of photos of Irish teenage girls end up on hardcore pornography sites without their knowledge.
It says that the photos are being taken from social media websites and then uploaded to adult sites.
The programme makers describe the photos found as “typical, innocent pictures, taken in social settings”.
But it says these images “are being copied by individuals who upload the pictures in their thousands to photo-sharing websites and in many cases to extreme hard-core pornography sites”.
Teenage girls
The pictures are mainly of young girls in their very early teens.
On some sites, members are able to comment on the photos, with the investigation showing that many of these comments are threatening and abusive.
The investigation will even reveal that personal information related to the individuals in the photos is also shared online.
It says it also discovered that some of those misappropriating the pictures were also involved in attempting to groom teenagers online.
‘Amy'
A CGI image created by RTÉ Source: RTÉ Investigations Unit
RTÉ's graphic design department created 14 year old ‘Amy', a computer generated image (CGI) girl. ‘Amy' joined a social media account at the beginning of October, using a public account.
The researchers said that in less than 30 days, the fictitious girl had accumulated over 1,000 ‘friends' on the site.
Within a week she had started receiving private messages from teenage boys of a similar age who were encouraging her to exchange messages of a sexual nature.
The approaches Amy received then quickly intensified, including contact from adult men here and around the world who engaged her in extreme and sexually explicit conversations.
The programme will show that the messages it observed between one middle-aged man and ‘Amy' were “alarming”.
The story of ‘Amy' and the teen photos will be explored on Prime Time – Online and Unprotected, Thursday, 9.35pm on RTÉ One, RTÉ News Now and worldwide on the RTÉ Player.
President Barack Obama was heckled by a protester during his historic swan song speech before the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night in Philadelphia.
"No more TPP!" a protester shouted, in reference to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.
Others held anti-TPP signs as the president delivered his remarks.

The trade deal, supported by Obama, is unpopular with a large contingent of Democrats who have loudly voiced their opposition to it throughout the DNC.
Hillary Clinton previously supported a version of the deal, but reversed her position after the final details were made available.
The deal is unlikely to clear Congress during the election season, but some political observers think it might have a chance to pass during the lame-duck session of Congress.

While I was on my daily ambulation through the equivalent of the basement archives at Baseball Reference (the manager pages), I came across a strange fact: Kevin Cash, rookie manager of the Tampa Bay Rays, has challenged nine times this season and has not won a single time. That seems very strange, given the fact that managers generally have a good idea of when they're going to win challenges nowadays: it's why they stand at the top of the dugout steps while someone looks at video before they actually challenge.
We've had just over a year of the challenge system in major league baseball, and already we have a good idea of the types of challenges managers are most likely to win, the ones they're likely to lose, and the ones that still seem to go either way for reasons that haven't been and might never be fully established. That understanding is engrained in managers to varying degrees, and we now have enough data on the subject to identify the ones that seem to get it and the ones that don't.
So, how and why exactly has Cash gone 0-9 so far this year? Does it matter that he seems bad at winning challenges? It also got me thinking: how have other managers fared, and are we thinking about this in the wrong way?
Needless to say, challenges are a tiny part of the massive equation of manager evaluation, but they're certainly an interesting one. There was some great work done By Jesse Wolfersberger at The Hardball Times on when managers should and should not challenge that can inform our discussion today. This is the main part of the article that interests us, on the frequency of challengable plays (though you should certainly read the whole thing):
“So, should a manager challenge a one-on, one-out play in the first inning? According to my analysis, the likely answer is ‘yes.' I found that the expected number of any over-turnable plays in a given game is less than one. Further, the expected number of over-turnable plays that go against your team in a medium-to-high leverage situation is far less than one. Bottom line for managers: If there is a call that you have even a 50/50 chance of reversing, you should probably challenge, no matter the inning or the game situation. The odds are, there won't be a better time to use that challenge later in the game.”
That final point is the kicker — when faced with half a shot at winning a challenge at any point in the game, do it. First, let's take a look at every manager's tendency to challenge, and their success rate in doing so. I've charted out all of the managers using the data from Baseball Reference's pages, with new managers from 2015 at the bottom of the chart to avoid small sample size confusion. Managers who were replaced mid-season last year are grouped together as one:
Joe Girardi is great at winning challenges, and the same could be said for embattled Marlins manager Mike Redmond. John Gibbons and Walt Weiss not so much, especially the former, who has one of the highest overall number of challenges and also the lowest rate of winning them. Down in our new manager section, we have three out of five off the mark with at least one overturn, then we have Paul Molitor and Kevin Cash. Molitor has only challenged once, so let's key in on Cash, and his glaring 0-fer.
I've compiled the nine challenges he's initiated this year below to try to see what's behind his challenge strategy. I've also put the win probability shift for the team that eventually won the challenge, which is the team that isn't the Rays in every circumstance.
#1: 4/6/15 vs. Baltimore, bottom 5, 2 out, down 0-3. Winning team win probability shift: 3%
James Loney was clearly out at home on a single to right field to end the inning, but this is one of those gray area calls that isn't bad to challenge — the home plate collision rule still seems to be misunderstood, or rather it's still subjective and ill-defined. Still, through most of 2014, home plate collisions were overturned only 15% of the time, one of the lowest rates of all types of plays. If won, the Rays would have been down 3-1 with a runner on first. However, Loney was obviously beaten by the throw, so unless the umpires thought Caleb Joseph was blocking the plate, it would stand. And it did.
#2: 4/8/15 vs. Baltimore, bottom 4, 2 out, score even. Winning team win probability shift: 1%
This was an incredible play by Manny Machado (it is one of the few plays labelled “remote” by our advanced metrics at 3B this year), and Logan Forsythe beats the throw. However, he was called out, and he steps in front of the bag without touching it, which is clear from many of the replays that were shown immediately afterward. Something that would become a recurring theme as I went through these challenges is that Kevin Cash pops straight out of the dugout after the play; there's no waiting at the top of the steps while someone watching video tells him if he should challenge. There was no evidence that this out call should have been overturned, so it wasn't, which is something the bench coach should have relayed to the manager.
#3: 4/14/15 vs. Blue Jays, top 6, 2 out, score even. Winning team win probability shift: 3%
Here is where Cash should've gotten his first overturn. This was Desmond Jennings getting called out stealing second base with a tag that clearly missed. In a tie game in the sixth inning, a runner in scoring position is pretty valuable, and this was a no-brainer. Even though the tag looked like it missed from multiple angles, New York sided with the original call, and Cash was spurned again.
#4: 4/15/15 vs. Blue Jays, top 2, 1 out, down 2. Winning team win probability shift: 3%
Another day, another Desmond Jennings out call at second base. The play was very close, but again, this is not a call that gets overturned unless there is clear evidence against the initial ruling, and there isn't from the replays. This was another play that Cash popped out of the dugout on before having a chance to be briefed on video from a coach or staff member.
#5: 4/16/15 vs. Blue Jays, bottom 8, 0 out, down 4. Winning team win probability shift: 9%
The third day in a row Cash would lose a challenge, this high and tight pitch was judged to hit Josh Donaldson on the hand with two men on base. These are also difficult to overturn — FiveThirtyEight puts them at 43% overturned through most of 2014 — especially when the pitcher almost hits the batter in the head. Cash was ejected immediately after the call was confirmed, citing “frustration with the process” in a postgame interview. He also did not appear to wait for video review on this play in the dugout before deciding to challenge.
#6: 4/18/15 vs. Yankees, top 7, 0 out, down 2. Winning team win probability shift: 0%
Another play at the plate. Chase Headley was ruled safe, and is obviously safe on replay. Even the Tampa Bay announcers sounded resigned on this one:
“The way the Rays track record has been going…” “The track record has been nil.”
The call stood, like home plate/clear tag calls usually do. This wasn't a bad point in the game to challenge given the circumstances, even if there wasn't much hope for this one.
#7: 4/19/15 vs. Yankees, bottom 6, 1 out, down 2. Winning team win probability shift: 2%
Did Mark Teixeira come off the first base bag before he caught the ball? The initial ruling said he stayed on, and there wasn't evidence to say otherwise. However, in the sixth inning with a leverage index around 1, it's not a bad idea to challenge.
#8: 4/21/15 vs. Red Sox, bottom 6, 1 out, down 1. Winning team win probability shift: 5%
We'll talk about the opportunity costs of challenges following the recap, but this was a good place to challenge, even if Cash wasn't confident of winning. With a leverage index of 2.13 on the play, this runner being safe instead of out in a one out, one run game would have been huge. The Tampa Bay announcers picked up on a theme of Cash challenges: “This is another one of those where… is there enough there to have it overturned?” The answer to that was no, and the call stood.
#9: 4/22/15 vs. Red Sox, bottom 8, 0 out, up 2. Winning team win probability shift: 2%
This final challenge seems like a good point to start talking about those opportunity costs. The runners were ruled out at both first and third base (there was initially a runner on first that tried to get to third on the groundout). Every manager in the game should challenge this play if they still have one available, mostly due to the fact that it's the eighth inning and they almost certainly won't get another play to challenge in the game. Even if both runners were clearly out (which was slightly unclear from the replays), it would probably still be a good time to challenge, because you gain nothing from holding onto your challenge after the game. The opportunity cost for a challenge late in the eighth inning is very, very low.
This is also where the dominant unwritten guidelines for manager challenges come into play. Here's a strange thought: Kevin Cash might actually be utilizing the challenge system better than other managers, simply because he's not afraid to be wrong. If we grade Cash's challenges by Jesse Wolfersberger's method (leverage, which inning they were initiated, and possibility of winning), most of these plays are certainly worthy of a challenge. That they weren't overturned is unrelated to whether they should have challenged, and we can see that at least one of them definitely should have gone Cash's way. The issue isn't that Cash has challenged often and lost; the issue is that other managers probably don't challenge often enough.
So, does it matter that Cash is 0-9? Considering he probably shouldn't be, and considering challenges are only a small part of a manager's job, it matters very little. The issue for Cash is the public perception of him being wrong on the field so often, something that can have a way of growing against a rookie manager. Could Cash do a better job at having a bench coach look at video before he challenges? Probably, but that's also in line with the dominant thought process — that challenges should only be made on plays a team thinks they have a very good chance of winning. As it turns out, the trigger for challenging should probably be much lower than it is across the league. To his credit, Cash seems to get that; but he still has an 0-9 next to his name, which has its drawbacks.
Earlier this year, home energy received its biggest jolt since rooftop solar when Tesla Motors announced a home battery dubbed the Powerwall. Immediately useful for backup during power outages, the Powerwall also open a broader doorway into a world of home energy storage. When paired with rooftop panels, the availability of storage brings us closer to a future in which homes could be generating much of the energy they need during the day, and then storing some of the remainder for use overnight.
But on Wednesday the Rocky Mountain Institute, a noted energy think tank, released a new report suggesting that there's a less noticed change under way in how we use energy at home — and pay for it — that could have similarly dramatic potential.
The institute calls it “demand flexibility” or the potentially catchier “flexiwatts.” Both terms refer to the growing ability, through the use of a variety of timers and controls, for homeowners to determine precisely when during the day (or night) their home's energy hogs – like, say, the hot water heater or the electric car charger – draw their power.
Why does the timing matter? Because it allows you to take advantage of increasingly prevalent time-based electricity pricing schemes, in which your power company charges you more for using electricity at peak hours and less at times when there's less demand, like the middle of the night. The Chicago-based utility ComEd, for instance, offers a program in which prices change hourly, based on demand, and customers receive alerts about what they'll be.
So if you match up when you're using the most power with when power costs the least…well, the result is obvious. Moreover, this trend also helps out utilities and the grid itself. If there is less electricity demand at peak times, then that obviates the need for a number of investments and costs, including as many so-called peaker plants, which kick on when demand escalates.
“In the residential sector alone, widespread implementation of demand flexibility can save 10–15% of potential grid costs, and customers can cut their electric bills 10–40% with rates and technologies that exist today,” says the Rocky Mountain Institute report. “Roughly 65 million customers already have potentially appropriate opt-in rates available, so the aggregate market is large and will only grow with further rollout of granular retail pricing.”
Key to enabling demand flexibility are in-home “smart devices” — notably smart thermostats and programmable timers for dryers, hot water heaters, electric vehicle chargers, and other large consumers of energy. Some already exist, like Google's Nest Thermostat.
The Rocky Mountain Institute isn't the only outlet to notice this trend — the president of the United States himself has. As President Obama said Monday, speaking at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, “New appliances and smart devices can tell when energy prices are cheapest, and do laundry, or wash the dishes, or charge our car at those times.”
In other words, the news is not that there is some new invention; rather, it's that we can transform domestic energy usage by getting smarter about options that already exist. “Demand flexibility need not complicate or compromise customer experience,” says the Rocky Mountain Institute Report. “Technologies and business models exist today to shift load seamlessly while maintaining or even improving the quality, simplicity, choice, and value of energy services to customers.”
Let's take a closer look at the key enabling technologies:

Smart thermostats. This is a device that can — among other abilities — potentially modulate the home temperature based on the hour of the day and, thus, the price of electricity. This matters a great deal because home heating is the single highest residential electricity user, and home cooling (air conditioning) comes in third.
Nest, perhaps the best known smart thermostat, can already work with time-of-use pricing. As the company explains:
….a common summer peak time is from 3pm to 7pm. Since electricity is more expensive at this time, teach your Nest Thermostat to cool your house down between 1pm and 3pm, so that your home will stay cool until 6 or 7. Then resume cooling at 7pm.

Timers for major appliances. For some time, devices have been on the market that allow you to time when your electric hot water heater is running. What's new is pairing those with time-of-use rates. As Duke Energy explains:
If you are on a “day/night” or “time of use” electric rate and you set the timer so the water heater only operates at night or during “off peak” hours, you should save money. You can do the same thing with an “on/off” switch, but the timer will do it automatically and never forget.
Similarly, there are already ways to program your clothes dryer – another energy hog — so that you don't use it at peak times. As Rocky Mountain Power advises, to take advantage of its “time of day” power pricing option: “Do most of your laundry at nights or on the weekend. Or better yet, set your delay start on your clothes washer, dryer and/or dishwasher to start and finish anytime between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.”

Electric vehicle charging. Charging electric vehicles can use up a heck of a lot of electricity, so doing it overnight makes a great deal of sense. California's three major utilities, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric, all offer plans to allow electric vehicle owners to have time-of-use electricity rates and thereby save money. Some advanced charging equipment for EVs also includes timers as a feature.
There is one drawback here, though – research has suggested that charging electric vehicles overnight may mean that the electricity you are actually using to power your “green” car is more likely to come from coal, which tends to be the baseline power source in many regions.
The Rocky Mountain Institute report finds that to buy the timers above and a smart thermostat, customers might need around$ 1000 — making demand flexibility cheaper than Tesla's battery ($ 3,000). Granted, savings depended, not surprisingly, on a particular power company and its precise rate structures, which can vary considerably across the country.
And not only can these kinds of changes can save people money, the research found that they potentially make rooftop solar more economical as well. “Demand flexibility helps customers consume more PV output on-site, leading to larger cost-effective PV arrays as well as more customer demand met by rooftop PV rather than by utility sales,” the report notes.
Granted, there are at least three outstanding problems with a shift towards demand flexibility.
First, people have to take the conscious step of opting in to time-of use electricity rates. Although 65 million American households already have access to those rates, only 4 million have so far signed up, according to the report.
Second, because people are not computers, they need some help with coordinating all of this strategic timing of energy consumption. Yes, some geeks might figure out how to run an ever growing number of devices on timers that helps ensure that they save a lot of money – but most of us won't have time to do this. We'll also worry that making a mistake – for instance, forgetting the switch to or from daylight savings time — could lead to a very big electricity charge.
What's needed, then, is some type of “smart controls.” “What we think needs to happen is business solutions similar to how solar is sold, where a third party is going to come in, sell technology either through a lease model, or some kind of financing, and optimize it for you,” Jamie Mandell, one of the authors of the report and a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, said in an interview. “I think what we haven't seen is anyone pulling those sorts of technologies together as a business model to save customers money using these time varying rates.”
Finally, there's the matter of convenience. Yes, people will be able to save money by timing how they use energy – but for a lot of folks, feeling immediately cool when you want to feel cool, warm when you want to feel warm, drying your clothes when you need them dry, and so on may be hard to give up. In other words, there's a behavioral barrier here that may go considerably beyond the technical potential of technologies.
Still, the Rocky Mountain Institute researchers think more and more of a shift towards “flexiwatts” is coming, simply because it makes so much economic sense.
“It's much cheaper to put your demand reduction on your home, than to do it with a battery,” says the Rocky Mountain Institute's Jesse Morris, another of the report's authors. “These smart controls are a knock out of the park from an economic perspective.”
Image copyright NRK Image caption Having broadcast a seven-hour train journey and a knitting marathon, NRK now has its eye on reindeer
Norway pioneered the concept of "slow TV", and now its national broadcaster is eyeing a new subject for one of the marathon live events - migrating reindeer.
NRK is hoping to broadcast the animals' movements in real time for a whole week, as they're herded from the highlands to grazing land on the coast, the DPA news agency reports. "It's going to be hardcore slow TV," project leader Thomas Hellum tells the agency. "Everything moves extremely slowly and takes you back to nature." Mr Hellum earlier told Norway's Aftenposten newspaper that the migration is a "unique and important" aspect of life for Norway's indigenous Sami people, who herd their animals each spring.
The broadcast won't be straightforward, as the migration period varies from year to year depending on the weather. NRK also needs to work out whether satellite coverage is strong enough to transmit live images from Norway's far north to the rest of the country. A test run is being planned for spring 2016 to see if the idea is feasible, with the live event pencilled in for the following year.
While the reindeer herds could, can take several weeks to make their journey, Mr Hellum says it's likely only seven days would be broadcast for television audiences. "Anything else would be too slow even for slow TV," he says.

The American clothing giant Target is celebrating Pride despite an ongoing anti-LGBT boycott.
Last year more than a million people pledged to ‘boycott' Target over its trans-inclusive bathroom policy, after a campaign from the anti-LGBT American Family Association.
The store had confirmed that transgender people could use the store's bathroom corresponding with their gender identity no matter what was written in their documents.
Despite the boycott, which Target denies had a significant financial impact on the company, its Pride range relaunched this month.
With the hashtag #TakePride Target is promoting a line of rainbow-themed merchandise ahead of June's Pride Month.
The line includes tee-shirts, swimsuits, flip-flops, headphones and iPhone cases, all featuring LGBT logos.
The store first launched its pride products in 2015 to show their support towards the LGBT community.
“We're making our message loud and clear: Target proudly stands with the LGBT community, both as a team member and team player through all that we do,” said Laysha Ward, executive vice president and chief corporate social responsibility officer.
The latest move has not impressed the activists who led the initial boycott.
A writer for anti-LGBT news site WorldNetDaily claimed: “Despite the drastic financial blowback Target Corporation has been weathering since announcing its plan last year to allow men to enter women's bathroom facilities, the retail giant is continuing full-speed ahead in its pursuit of LGBT social activism.”
The scale of Target's losses from the boycott are hotly disputed.
While Target's stock value has tumbled by more than 35 percent since the boycott began, execs say nearly all of this is due to competition with Amazon and other online stores.
Evaluating the cost of the boycott specifically, Target execs asserted that the losses were not significant enough to be reported to the investors.
Despite the boycott, Target CEO, Brian Cornell said the store would keep implementing its inclusive policy.
He said: “We took a stance, and were going to continue to embrace our belief of diversity and inclusion and just how important that is to our company.”
“We had a lot of tough feedback,” Cornell added. “But sitting here today, I know we made the right decision.”
Target policy was criticised as anti-LGBT activists claimed it would allow paedophiles and sex offenders to freely enter the opposite-sex restroom.
Last August the store announced an investment of over $20 million to install single-stall bathrooms in all its stores.
At least, the Maine potato growers association seem to think so.
It was a early morning on April the 5th in 1943 that the O'Bannon was returning from when the sailors spotted something.
It was a Japanese submarine, the Ro-34 to be exact. Once the Japanese sub was spotted, the ship's captain made the order to ram it at full speed. However, at the last minute, the order was changed, instead to run along side of the ship, in the fear that it could be a mine layer. Ramming a mine layer would result in the destruction of the O'Bannon as well as the Japanese vessel.
This brought the American destroyer to extraordinarily close proximity to the Japanese sub. At this time the Japanese sailors started to man a 75 millimeter deck cannon which could be fired at the O'Bannon. By this time, the destroyer was too close to use their own guns, and the sailors did not have any weapons available to fire at the Japanese sailors, now preparing to fire at the ship. So, the men of the O'Bannon grabbed the only thing they could find – Potatoes. They began throwing as many as they could at the Japanese. Lucky for the Americans, the Japanese thought the potatoes were hand grenades and started to throw them in the water. This took their attention from arming the deck cannon, and occupied them with throwing potatoes in the water. Within a short time, the American destroyer was able to position itself so that it could fire its own cannons at the sub.
The O'Bannon made relatively quick work of the Japanese sub, forcing it to submerge after being hit several times from the O'Bannon's guns. Once submerged, the O'Bannon dropped depth charges, killing the Japanese sub.
That day, the O'Bannon found itself victorious through the use of heavy firepower and potatoes.

Just after the damning Access Hollywood tape dropped last week, my mom called from my family home in Sydney to tell me that Donald Trump was a “sleaze.” Such was the power of the tape: My polite and lovely mom never uses such strong language in referring to political figures.
She's not alone. Along with the rest of the world, Australians are fiercely monitoring the US campaign for signs of impending global apocalypse. Every morning I awake to an antipodean surge of concern from friends and family on social media, built up over the previous night. But the outrage isn't restricted to Facebook or private conversations.
Trump creates drama everywhere, even halfway around the world in Australia, where issues of race, immigration and the threat of terror are equally divisive and galvanizing for the electorate. Australian politicians have been forced to declare their views on Trump in media appearances. This week, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a conservative, appeared to defend Trump, telling a radio show that Trump's policies were “reasonable enough” and his supporters were “decent people.” But the current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull (who replaced Abbott in a dramatic intraparty leadership coup) called Trump's behavior on the Access Hollywood tape “loathsome.”
Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg called Trump “a dropkick.”
Brutal.
But perhaps the most eloquent condemnation of Trump came from one of the houses of state parliament in New South Wales, which, according to BuzzFeed Australia, just passed a unanimous motion to declare Donald Trump a “revolting slug.” The motion—a symbolic declaration of sorts with no real legislative heft—was tendered by a member of the Greens Party:
“I move that this house condemns the misogynistic, hateful comments made by…Mr Donald Trump, about women and minorities, including the remarks revealed over the weekend that clearly describe sexual assault…and agrees with those who have described Mr Trump as ‘a revolting slug' unfit for public office,” the motion read.
Read the full story over at BuzzFeed. This from their Facebook page sums it up:
It wasn't immediately clear which “revolting slug” the legislators had in mind. Australia is home to an array of mollusks. Perhaps I could suggest the giant bright pink slug—Triboniophorus aff. graeffei—found in the Mount Kaputar National Park in northern New South Wales:
Meanwhile, in contrast to the US, both Prime Minister Turnbull and his parliamentary opponent, the opposition leader Bill Shorten, recently backed a bipartisan declaration in favor of immigration. “Australia is an immigration nation,” Turnbull said. “Everyone sitting in this chamber and every Australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation.”
Not a big surprise that Disney Channel has picked up a second season of Girl Meets World. Since its June premiere, the comedy has ranked as TV's No. 1 series among kids 2-11, kids 6-11 and tweens 9-14. Rowan Blanchard, Sabrina Carpenter, Ben Savage, Danielle Fishel, August Maturo, Peyton Meyer and Corey Fogelmanis star in the Boy Meets World spinoff series created by Michael Jacobs and April Kelly. Jacobs also exec produces.
“The series swiftly became a favorite of kids and their parents, many of whom grew up with Boy Meets World,” said Adam Bonnett, EVP Original Programming at Disney Channels Worldwide. “We're looking forward to watching Riley Matthews and Maya Hart make the world their own, as Cory and Topanga teach them life lessons along the way.”
Season 1 introduces best friends Riley and Maya as they navigate the ups and downs of junior high. Girl Meets World is produced by It's A Laugh Productions and Michael Jacobs Productions. Production resumes in Los Angeles in November.
The Lock & Key TV series that was developed by director Mark Romanek and produced by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci will not be showing up on TV anytime soon. FOX dropped the project to focus on American Horror Story, but it's not dead yet!
According to Latino Review, Universal Pictures has picked up the IDW published comic and they plan on bringing it to the big screen instead, as a trilogy!
The comic was created by Joe Hill, son of Stephen King, and the story follows "Nina Locke and her three children as they move to Keyhouse, the family home in Lovecraft, MA to recover from an unspeakable horror. Keyhouse is a mysterious New England mansion with fantastic and transformative keys that are hidden inside its walls. The keys are being sought after by a sinister and relentless creature with ties to the family's past who will stop at nothing to accomplish its goals."
I was looking forward to the series, but now I can look forward to the movie! The movie will also be produced by Kurtzman and Orci, but there's no word on if they plan to bring the director and cast of the TV series over to the film, but I doubt it.
This will be the second haunted house type movie being developed at Universal next year. They are also developing a Guillermo del Toro scripted movie called Crimson Peak, that he is also set to produce, but not direct. According to the site, the movie "does for Haunted Houses what Wonder did for bread." Del Toro has got a lot of great stuff going for him right now.
Lock & Key should make for a solid movie, and I'm excited to see how it turns out and who they bring on to develop it!
Here is the official synopsis from the publisher:
Locke & Key tells of Keyhouse, an unlikely New England mansion, with fantastic doors that transform all who dare to walk through them…. and home to a hate-filled and relentless creature that will not rest until it forces open the most terrible door of them all…! Acclaimed suspense novelist and New York Times best-selling author Joe Hill (Heart-Shaped Box) creates an all-new story of dark fantasy and wonder, with astounding artwork from Gabriel Rodriguez. Hill has received the Bram Stoker Award for Best Fiction Collection, the British Fantasy Award for Best Collection and Best Short Story, and the Sydney J. Bounds Best Newcomer Award-2007, among his growing collection of critical accolades.
Locke & Key was nominated for Best Limited Series and Joe Hill was nominated for Best Writer at the 2009 Eisner Awards. Check out the trailer for the graphic novel below.
After a day of debate in Spain's lower house, Socialist Party (PSOE) chief Pedro Sánchez was unsuccesful on Wednesday night in his bid to be voted in as the country's next prime minister.
In the wake of inconclusive general elections, held on December 20, Sánchez needed the support of other parties if he were to win the vote. But in the end, from a total of 350 seats, he only counted on 90 from his own group and 40 from emerging center-right group Ciudadanos, with whom the PSOE signed a policy agreement last week paving the way for tonight's bid to form a minority government. There were 219 votes against and one abstention.
Sánchez needed 176 votes for an absolute majority.
At the start of the investiture process, Sánchez laid out his plans for a potential government during a 90-minute speech in Congress on Tuesday evening, during which he called on opposition groups such as left-wing anti-austerity group Podemos to at least abstain in the vote to make way for a “government of change.”
But during Wednesday's day of debate, during which all parties were able to respond to Sánchez's proposals, the Socialist chief was roundly attacked and derided by the incumbent Popular Party, led by acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, as well as by Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.
A second vote will now be held on Friday night, at which Sánchez will just need more yes votes than no to be successful. If Sánchez fails to win that vote, another two-month period will begin during which the parties can seek a new agreement to form a government. If that fails, Spain will be forced to hold fresh elections later in the year, most likely in June.

Lena Waithe has made Emmy history as the first African-American woman to win for comedy writing.
Waithe won for co-writing the “Thanksgiving” episode of “Master of None” with series co-creator and star, Aziz Ansari. Waithe has also had a recurring role on the Netflix comedy.
The widely acclaimed episode was based on her experience of coming out as a lesbian.
Waithe called out the importance of diversity in entertainment and the culture at large in accepting the award. She was clearly overcome with emotion.
“The things that make us different — those are our superpowers,” she said. She made special mention of her “LGBTQIA family” and urged viewers who feel outside of the mainstream to don a superhero cape every day “and go out there and conquer the world. It would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren't in it.”
Waithe herself is in the midst of a big career move. She's about to launch an autobiographical Showtime series, “The Chi,” about her coming of age years in Chicago. She's also developing other TV projects.
Waithe told reporters backstage that she hopes her career trajectory inspires other people to strive for careers in entertainment.
“It says that it is possible,” she said. “There are so many other funny women of color. I hope they will now have an opportunity because this door has been opened.”

A photographer has said he had his page banned for 30-days by Facebook for sharing a picture of two men, fully clothed, kissing.
The picture appeared to have been shared from Michael Stokes Photography's Facebook page, and shows a message reading that the page was banned for 30 days afterwards.
The screenshot of the image, which also seems to show that the page was blocked from posting anything, with the error message: “This feature is temporarily blocked”, was subsequently shared widely on social media.
The image was banned by Facebook
It was shared by porn actor Jessie Jackman, who wrote: “Since recently receiving a 30-day Facebook ban for posting a photo of two fully clothed gay police officers, Michael Stokes Photography has received many, many messages of support. But he can't reply to any of them.
“Let's put an end to anti-LGBT discrimination on Facebook.”
A petition has also been started at www.facethehate.org, which calls on Facebook to change the policy for reporting pages and people's profiles, in order to prevent harassment and bullying.
The petition has been signed over 13,000 times.
Facebook has not yet returned a call for comment from PinkNews.
In the first presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt dropped a torch into the right wing fever swamp and set off a bombastic explosion.
The NBC anchor stated that stop-and-frisk had been ruled unconstitutional in New York, and the response was instantaneous: Donald Trump bleated that he was wrong, wrong, wrong; Rudy Giuliani fired off an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that included punctuation and everything; and Chris Christie, flaunting his renowned urbanity, called Holt "an idiot."
Actually, Holt was mostly right, but it is irrelevant to Trump's solemn belief, which is that stop-and-frisk is essential in any society ruled by serious law-and-order people like him. And that argument is rubbish, for two reasons:
Stop-and-frisk doesn't work. There is a decade of empirical evidence that proves that it not only didn't reduce crime in New York, it alienated entire minority populations. And the only reason to make stop-and-frisk a national policy is that it targets, abuses, and imprisons citizens who would never vote for Donald Trump in the first place.
Team Trump isn't entirely wrong on the legal argument. Stop-and-frisk is constitutional and practiced in all 50 states - including New York. But in 2013, a federal judge found that it is unconstitutional in the way it is practiced by the NYPD - which was racist on a mathematical scale - and today there is a court-appointed monitor that ensures the NYPD isn't frisking people on vague precepts and violating the Fourth and 14th Amendments.
So New York has virtually abandoned the practice: There were 685,724 instances in 2011, but only 22,939 in 2015.
Don King endorses Donald Trump. That's almost perfect | Editorial
But if Trump's overarching theme is that stop-and-frisk works "tremendously well" in taking guns from bad guys, he cannot prove it. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which won the 2013 case, reminded us Tuesday:
"In 2011 in New York, with 685,000 stops, records show 106,669 major felonies," the CCR wrote. "There were dire warnings about how crime would soar if police were forced to cease using stop and frisk. Yet in 2015, with only 23,000 stops - just 3.36 percent of the number four years earlier - the records show fewer major felonies: 105,453, to be exact."
Murders also dropped in that period, from 515 to 356.
It was racial profiling by another name: At peak practice in 2011, 87 percent of those stopped in New York were black or Hispanic - even though they make up only half the population combined - and only 9 percent were white. That year, cops found nothing 88 percent of the time - not a gun, not a joint, not a sharp stick.
Most of the arrests had nothing to do with guns. Over an eight-year period of the Bloomberg Administration, the NYPD confiscated 6,000 guns in 4.4 million stops - or about one-tenth of one percent.
Nine reasons why Trump will not get the black vote | Editorial
Indeed, cops must be proactive in some circumstances, and they can't be seen as agents of oppression just for showing up and doing their jobs.
But the deterrent effect Team Trump promotes is "modest. . . .with a relatively small prevention gain," according to the last study of NYPD data. And it's troubling that Trump never considers how discriminatory and dehumanizing it is for those being policed.
So he will cling to the politics of Magic Bean-ism, an Elect Me And Crime Will Stop narrative - which, like the candidate himself, is a fiction.
The issue's real relevance is that he advocates racial profiling, which has created an insuperably divided country and an unjust system, the only kind where a candidate like Donald Trump can exist.

WACO, Texas, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Gulf War veterans suffering illnesses linked to their deployments were exposed to different toxins depending on where they served, a U.S. report says.
Forward-deployed troops show illnesses related to anti-nerve-agents pills they were given while pesticides were toxins most encountered by support personnel in the rear, the report by the Midwest Research Institute showed.
About a quarter of the veterans serving in the 1990 Gulf War have experienced symptoms including headaches, memory and concentration problems, persistent fatigue and mood disturbances, USA Today reported Sunday.
Veterans who served in combat zones took pyridostigmine bromide pills, small doses of a nerve agent intended to allow troops to build up resistance in case of a chemical attack.
Among support troops, symptoms of illness were most common in personnel who used pesticides on their uniforms or skin, the researchers found.
Nerve agents, anti-nerve agents and insecticides are in the same chemical family and affect the body in similar ways, lead study author Lea Steele of Baylor University said.
"Already, the evidence was mounting for these two exposures," she said. "When you pull all the research together, you start to see patterns that are very consistent."
# Who is NorseFenrir and why are we wishing him a Happy Birthday?

Three days later on June 9th /u/MisterWoodhouse kicks things up a notch by wishing Norse a Happy Birthday during the Destiny Rise of Iron Reveal Stream. This had an amazing rippling effect of causing the entire subreddit to start wishing him a Happy Birthday, not realizing the in-joke they are now becoming a part of. That same day we decided to get as much of reddit involved as possible, and received the support of multiple default subreddits including r/TIFU, r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/DestinyTheGame, r/botsrights, amongst many others to make major announcements wishing him a happy birthday, which lead to much confusion. The celebrations continued on Twitter with MisterWoodhouse getting The Division Reddit account to join in along with many other personalities.
The official Studio Wildcard account also joined in on wishing NorseFenrir a happy birthday. (need date alignment) The Destiny Reddit Twitter joined in on a few occasions.
/u/D0cR3d changed his Xbox Gamertag to 'Hapy Bday Norse' and continues to use it to this day.
When the Destiny Sherpa subreddits hosted a Christmas Charity stream for Child's Play in December, /u/MetalGilSolid pledged to donate a dollar for every donation of $10 or more with the comment 'Happy Birthday Norse'. A total of 66 people complied (and was rounded up) to an extra $75 donation.
For the Destiny 2 World Premier /u/D0cR3d and /u/MetalGilSolid had custom Norse Birthday T-Shirts made in celebration.
# When is NorseFenrir's actual Birthday?
Some say it is every day. His Mom and Dad believe it is on July 27th.
# What you can do:
What you can do is wish /u/NorseFenrir a Happy Birthday. Seriously! Any way you can imagine, get him the message. Whether it's via a PM on reddit, Twitter, r/DestinyTheGame (there will be a thread, you can't miss it), etc.
Want to celebrate the occasion for ever and ever? Well now you can with our shirts we've made available. The same shirts MetalGilSolid and D0cR3d wore on May 18th at the Destiny 2 World Premier.
All proceeds for the shirts go DIRECTLY to St. Jude Children's Hospital. If you are in the US you can purchase the shirt here and if you are in the EU you can purchase the shirt here.
So let's make this BIG! Make it a day he can't forget!
I regularly watch the Science Friday video podcast. This week they had an interesting piece on potamology (OK, I just learned that word and wanted to use it in my post: potamology is the scientific study of rivers). The podcast showcased the work Christian Braudrick and Bill Dietrich of University of California, Berkeley, who achieved what had not been done before; they were able to create a meandering river in a laboratory setting.
Such rivers lazily snake back and forth through a gently sloping field. They change shape over time by continually eroding the outer bank of each curve and depositing silt on the inner bank. Occasionally two bends in the river come together, changing the topology of the river, and ultimately leaving behind an oxbow lake.
In passing, the narrator mentioned a very interesting mathematical fact about meandering rivers. It turns out that the size of a river cannot be determined by its shape on a map. In particular, if you looked at an aerial snapshot of a meandering river, you would not be able to tell whether it is the Amazon or a small neighborhood stream! I had to investigate this stunning fact.
It appears that nature forces certain geometric relations on the features of the river. Let denote the length of a meander (the “wavelength”) and be the width of the river (see my drawing below). The curves in a meander are roughly circular (rather than sinusoidal, for example). Let denote the radius of curvature of a bend.
It turns out that these variables are almost always related in the following way:
.
I was stunned to learn this. What a beautiful fact. To see a remarkable scatterplot of the first relationship, see Figure 12.16 in The environment: principles and applications, By Chris C. Park (p. 374).
From what I can tell, the observation dates back to a 1960 paper by Luna Leopold, the Chief Hydrologist of the USGS.
I have no idea why there is a linear relationship between these variables, but it seems to me that if you know that such a relationship exists and you knew one of the constants, then you could estimate the other one. For example, suppose you knew that . In each cycle, a river winds clockwise around one circle of radius , then counterclockwise around another circle of radius . In doing so it will produce a wavelength of roughly .

Reel 1. Netley Hospital 1917 and Seale Hayne Military Hospital 1918.
01:00:01 Effect of treatment on shell shocked soldiers for various "hysterical" problems. Private Preston crawls under his hospital bed in fear when the word "Bombs!" is mentioned. Private Urand is filmed outside the hospital after "10 days re-education" for his jaw spasm. Two Hysterical "Stump Orators" are shown. Private King walks unsteadily towards the camera making an angry gesture. Private King and Private Sandall are seen walking and talking together. Private Sandall is then filmed two hours later: "As a result of treatment by suggestion he is now able to speak without moving his arms". Two months later Sandall is filmed at work "on a farm". We also see Private King at work - possibly Seale Hayne farm or hospital grounds. The improvement in Private Pudmore's "Hysterical shuffling gait" is filmed six weeks after his admission to the hospital. Improvements in Private Willis' "Hysterical pseudo-spastic gait" and Sergeant Peters' "wire spring gait" are shown. Private Williams' "slippery-ice gait" and the "ataxic gait" of Private Ashley are filmed. Sergeant Bissett's process of recovery is described.
01:09:30 Six weeks later all the men featured are cured or almost cured except Private Williams. We see them all walking normally. Private Richards is shown before treatment, after half an hours treatment then cured after an hour of treatment. Private Bradshaw is seen being attended to by a uniformed medical officer. He lies on a bed and lifts his legs. His legs are manipulated. He sits up in bed than stands and walks. Private Read's hysterical gait, swaying movement and nose-wiping tic are shown before and after treatment. He is shown two months later at work on Seale Hayne farm feeding chickens. An Intertitle in verse states that the cure for this ill is to do some hard work! Men are seen at work in the fields with horse drawn ploughs.

This year has been memorable for many reasons – some bad, and some good. But in the world of archaeology, a veritable smorgasbord of discoveries have been unearthed over the last 12 months, allowing us to dig deeper into our history. As 2016 comes to an end, we took a look at some of the most interesting archaeological finds in Britain.
Lindisfarne monastery
An amateur archaeologist stumbled upon an incredible find in Northumberland in July: a rare grave marker from the mid 7th to 8th Century believed to be evidence of Britain's most famous monastery, Lindisfarne.
One of England's earliest Christian monasteries, it was originally founded by in 635AD but was was ransacked by the Vikings around 1,300 years ago. The Lindisfarne monastery is home to one the most beautiful books in Europe, the Lindisfarne Gospels, which incorporates Celtic, Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon designs and is thought to be dedicated to Saint Cuthbert.
The women of Stonehenge
The origin and purpose of Stonehenge, one of the world's most famous prehistoric monuments, is an enduring mystery – but scientists are gradually finding out more about the rocks. In April, archaeologists discovered the cremated remains of 14 women at the site, revealing more about the status of women in thousands of years ago.
A recent excavation of "Aubrey Hole 7"– one of 56 pits dug outside of the circle of stones – uncovered the bodies of the women, who were buried between 3100 BCE and 2140 BCE. Archaeologists believe anyone buried at the site had a high social status, so the find challenges assumptions about the role of women in neolithic times.
Black Death plague pit
An extremely rare mass grave of plague victims in was discovered at 14th century monastery hospital in Lincolnshire by University of Sheffield archaeologists in November. The 48 skeletons – 27 of which were children – show how the small community was overwhelmed by the Black Death, one of the worst pandemics in human history.
The Black Death, which was most likely bubonic plague, claimed the lives of an estimated 75 to 200 million people across Europe between 1346 and 1353.
One of the archaeologists on the dig, Dr Hugh Willmott, said: "The finding of a previously unknown and completely unexpected mass burial dating to this period in a quiet corner of rural Lincolnshire is thus far unique, and sheds light into the real difficulties faced by a small community ill prepared to face such a devastating threat."
Earliest surviving fresco from Roman Britain
In February, archaeologists at the Museum of London found a wall painting dating back to the late 1st century AD – one of the earliest surviving frescos from Roman Britain.
The painting most likely to have been used to decorate a reception room where guests were entertained. Researchers are now studying the elaborate fresco further to find out more about the fashions and interiors favoured by London's first wealthy citizens.
Oldest handwritten documents
In June, archaeologists discovered the earliest-known handwritten documents in Britain among a haul of more than 400 waxed writing tablets, used by Romans for note-taking. The artefacts were discovered during excavations for Bloomberg's new London-based headquarters and reveal what life was like in the city under Roman rule. Some of the wooden tablets have been deciphered to reveal names, events and business transactions.
Latin expert Roger Tomlin, who translated the tablets, said: "The Bloomberg writing tablets are very important for the early history of Roman Britain, and London in particular. I am so lucky to be the first to read them again, after more than 19 centuries, and to imagine what these people were like, who founded city of London."
Why this veteran Marine and police officer went vegan.

I fall pretty squarely into the stereotype of an all-American tough guy.
I grew up on a farm in Iowa, where I helped my family raise and slaughter hogs and cattle before moving into a town of 50 people. For a time, we ran a restaurant that served standard greasy-spoon fare: bacon, burgers and fried chicken. At 19, I left home to spend four years in the Marine Corps, then joined the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. I worked on the MPD's Fugitive Task Force apprehending suspects wanted for murder, robbery and rape, and later supervised the presidential escort unit. I was eventually promoted to captain and retired after 25 years of service last fall.
For years I drank and smoked. I still pump iron and drive a big pickup truck I call Bruno. At work and at home, I've always been a strict disciplinarian.
So when my teenage daughter told me she was going vegan several years ago, I did what many tough parents would do when faced with the same situation. I gave her a simple choice: Either eat the food I cook for you, or get out of my house.
Robert Atcheson (Photo11: Handout)
Today, I have the same rule for everyone who enters my home. Except the food I now cook is 100% vegan — no meat, eggs or dairy. If I had things my way, everyone in America would make a similar choice. What prompted the change?
I'm a no-nonsense guy, the chief cook and bottle washer at our home. While I ridiculed her for it at first, my daughter's decision got me thinking. I started to read books on the subject, trying to find the flaw in her argument. It turns out that her facts were supported by experts on all sides: doctors, researchers, dietitians, fitness gurus — everyone except the meat industry itself.
And I thought of my own relatives. My dad had seven stents put in his heart and died of a heart attack at age 69. My mom, who has type 2 diabetes, had quadruple-bypass surgery in May. At family get-togethers, I cringe each time my family members pop pills and stick their sides with insulin needles while telling me — without missing a beat — that they could never give up meat and cheese.
Most Americans would say the same. The state of America's health today is, as I like to say, FUBAR (to put that more politely: fouled up beyond all recognition). We are now more likely to die from poor diet than from anything else. Rates of diet-related chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity are off the charts. So is the amount of money we spend treating these diseases: about 75% of the nation's $2 trillion health care bill in 2012.
The problem plagues not only American civilians but also our military and police forces. Obesity is the No. 1 cause of military ineligibility, and according to Mission: Readiness, a group of 300 retired military generals and admirals, it costs the Department of Defense about $1 billion annually. Chronic diseases also disproportionately affect veterans: One in four has diabetes, and nearly 80% are overweight or obese.
Cops are no better off. Law enforcement is the fattest profession in America, according to an analysis of data from the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Doughnut jokes aside, more than 40% of police, firefighters and security guards are obese. Police officers are 25 times more likely to die from weight-related disorders such as heart disease than from fighting crime.
I retired from the police force at age 50. If I had the same lifestyle and eating habits as most of my colleagues, I could expect to be dead in five to ten years.
It's ludicrous that those responsible for protecting the people of this country are themselves in dire need of protection — and from entirely preventable diseases, no less. Because I don't eat animal products, my risk of cancer is a fraction of the average. I weigh the same today as I did at age 21. I'd bet my life savings that unlike many of my family members — and fellow jarheads and cops — I will never get heart disease or diabetes.
As a police captain, I was known as a hard-ass, take-no-excuses kind of guy. Once I went vegan, I gave my officers a message I'd like the whole country to hear: When you eat meat and other animal products, you're playing a losing game of chicken with your health. It takes courage and discipline to ditch that crap and clean up your plate.
So do what I did, and what many of my best officers eventually did, too: Trade in that morning doughnut for a smoothie. Swap that chicken sandwich for a black bean burger. Your health — and your family — will thank you.

The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has delisted more than 1.3 million registered voters this year as part of its efforts to clean the voter's lists.
Comelec Chairman Andres Bautista said a total of 1,307,354 voters have been stricken off the lists from January to July 2015.
Of this figure, 879,927 were deactivated for failing to vote in two consecutive elections. The remaining 427,427 were deleted after their deaths were established by local election officers.
Bautista said that as of July 20, there are 52,336,844 registered voters in the Comelec's database. The poll body is expecting around 54 million voters for next year's presidential elections.
According to Bautista, they observed a significant increase in the number of new registrants since April, indicating the “No Bio, No Boto” campaign is working.
Records showed that from January to April, the number of new registrants rose by 10.2 percent or from 569,511 to 627,741. But the figure rose to 1,090,672 in July, representing an increase of 73.74 percent.
Bautista, however, warned that some 3.9 million registered voters would be disenfranchised in the May 2016 elections for not having biometrics. This includes 445,259 voters that were found to have incomplete biometrics data.
He added the public should validate their registration to make sure that they could vote next year.
This developed as the Comelec promulgated yesterday Resolution No. 9981, containing the calendar of activities for the 2016 elections.
Bautista said they decided to shelve their plan to extend the campaign period for national candidates from 90 days to 120 days and from 45 to 90 days for local bets since this would require an amendment of the elections laws.
Based on the calendar, the campaign period for president, vice-president, senators and party-list groups would be from Feb. 9 to May 7 while for local positions that include members of the House of Representatives, elective regional, provincial, city and municipal posts will be from March 25 to May 7.
The election period will run from Jan. 10 to June, during which some prohibited acts would be in effect. This includes alteration of territory of a precinct in establishment of a new precinct; transfer or movement of officers and employees in the civil service; bearing, carrying or transporting firearms or other deadly weapons “unless authorized in writing by the Commission.”
Also prohibited are the use of security personnel or bodyguards by candidates, unless authorized in writing by the Comelec; organization or maintenance of reaction forces, strike forces or other similar forces and suspension of elective local officials.
The filing of certificates of candidacy for all positions is from Oct. 12 to 16.
The calendar also shows that political parties can hold political conventions “to select and nominate official candidate for all elective positions” from Sept. 12 to 30.
