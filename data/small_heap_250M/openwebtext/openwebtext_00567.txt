Image caption Independents who once supported Mr Obama are now turning on him
Two polls released on Thursday suggest that America's independent voters are continuing to sour on the Democrats.
Independent voters propelled President Obama's party to victories in 2006 and 2008, but a majority of them now hold negative views of Democratic policies.
An Associated Press-GfK poll found only one third of independent voters want Democrats to control congress.
A Pew Research Center poll suggests Republicans have a 13 point advantage among independents.
In 2006, when Democrats took control of congress, Democrats had an 18 point lead with independents.
Pew also found that independents are now the largest group of voters. Their numbers have swelled in recent years as disenchantment with both major parties has grown.
Likely voters
Voter turnout is seen as a critical factor in November's elections. Mid-terms traditionally have much lower turnout than presidential year elections, and the party with the most energized base usually benefits.
The Pew poll found Republicans significantly more likely to vote than Democrats, while independents are more likely to vote in this election than any in Pew's data set, which dates back to 1994.
In the AP-GfK poll, only around 30% of independents think the country is headed in the right direction and more than half disapprove of President Barack Obama's performance.
The B.C. government is offering free online textbooks for post-secondary students who are taking the 40 most popular courses.
Advanced Education Minister John Yap says up to 200,000 students could save money next year.
"This new approach — open learning, free online textbooks — will help reduce the costs and help make education more affordable," he said.
The province will work with post-secondary institutions to implement the open textbook policy, with a plan to have the textbooks online as early as next year.
The province estimates students spend $900 to $1,500 each year on textbooks. The online textbooks will be free to view and can be printed for a fraction of the price of traditional texts.
Yap says B.C. is leading Canada in delivering free, open textbooks, and joins several other international jurisdictions in taking a leadership role in putting technology to work for students.
He estimates the program will cost taxpayers $600,000 to $1 million each year.
FORT WAYNE, IN—Explaining that his sole concern is serving and protecting his community, Fort Wayne police officer Vincent Turner told reporters Wednesday that he does not see any difference between black and light-skinned black suspects. “As an officer of the law, I am committed to administering justice swiftly and even-handedly, regardless of whether the suspect has dark skin or really dark skin,” said Turner, adding that he has no problem giving a full pat-down to any potential criminal or hauling them down to precinct headquarters in the back of his patrol car, even if they are more of a light mocha color. “When you're responding to reports of gunshots fired, or sprinting down an alleyway, you're not thinking about where the suspect falls on the spectrum of African-American skin tones—you're thinking about doing your job. Heck, the guy could be a very dark-looking Latino, for all I care—I treat every one of them the same. He's still just a suspect to me.” Turner added that his dedication to upholding the law stems from a belief that all local residents should be able to walk their streets without fear, whether they come from an affluent white neighborhood or a working-class white neighborhood.

49ers general manager Trent Baalke made an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio and naturally was asked about the Frank Gore contract situation. According to PFT's report, Baalke said:
The best thing we can say is we're doing everything we can to make Frank a 49er for life and whether that gets accomplished in the near future or not remains to be seen ... But Frank's a 49er. He's a heck of a football player, he's a heck of a young man, and he's a leader. You can't say enough good things about Frank.
Yesterday, much was made of Gore saying he had no comment about whether he would demand a trade. In the same interview, Gore said "Like I said before, I want to remain a 49er for my career. If that doesn't happen, hopefully I'll have a great year and test the market."
Anything can happen between now and the trade deadline (sometime fairly early in the season as I recall). At this point I don't see the 49ers dealing Frank Gore. Anything is possible, but my mind tells me no. I've been plenty wrong before, but taking the entire situation in context, I just am not seeing a deal happening.
At this point we're dealing with a whole lot of talk, and not much else. I think Trent Baalke has done a solid enough job that he is entitled to a certain amount of patience with his process. I know not everybody agrees with that, but it worked fairly well during free agency, so we'll just take it one step at a time.
And given all that, I thought we'd bring back an old favorite after the jump. Until something definitive happens, we'll include this in all future Frank Gore contract posts!
to celebrate doctor who being a hundred years old today i have gone and done a picture of him and his main enemy liam the dalek. i really love doctor who because it has got all of the things in it that i love the most like time travelling and shopping and screw drivers and i like doctor who because he always knows what outfits to have a wear of that suit his figure the most and he has got dark brown hair as well and my best doctor who is a episode is the one when doctor who is in town and he sees liam the dalek and his wife and his 2 children standing outside of marks and spencers and he goes over to them and he says really loudly god i am so thin and he starts smirking at the daleks and then he says oh god i would hate to be as fat as you daleks are and he points at all of the daleks in their faces and the daleks dont even know what to say and they just keep on looking at each other and shrugging their shoulders and then doctor who lifts up his shorts so that they go right above his thighs and he says look how thin my thighs are i bet that you wish you had a thigh gap like this one that i have got and then he lights a cigarette and he blows the smoke in to the wife daleks breathing tube and she starts coughing loads and he does a really deep laugh and he says watch you dont choke and then he walks off and he keeps on turning around and saying so thin and smirking at all of the daleks and i feel quite sorry for liam the dalek because he has been signed off work for almost a year now because of all of the stress that doctor who has caused him and his family but i still think doctor who is good because he always knows how save the day and he has got a kind heart even though he is so obsessed with losing weight and being thin.

About this report: Jeffrey Schweers pored over thousands of pages of public documents and corporate filings, including license applications that were mostly redacted to protect trade secrets and financial information. He also toured two cultivating/production operations, watched public hearings, and conducted dozens of interviews.
As the Florida Legislature gets ready to make rules to implement Amendment 2, the seven corporations exclusively licensed to grow and sell medical marijuana are raising and spending millions to expand their fledgling operations and protect their stake in what promises to be a lucrative industry.
Current licensees are concerned about protecting their share of the burgeoning market, while at the same time saying they want to make quality medical marijuana available to the people who need it most. All told they've hired close to 60 lobbyists to represent their interests before the Legislature, as it sets out to rewrite the rules governing medical marijuana in the state to accommodate what 70 percent of voters approved.
At the same time, patients and physicians depending on medical marijuana for relief from a host of ailments is clamoring for greater access, affordability and diversity of the cannabis curative.
Advocates behind Amendment 2 have employed their own fleet of lobbyists to see things go their way.
Patients and physicians tend to support a more competitive framework, as they've testified at rule-making hearings around the state held by the Department of Health. They complain that the vertical integration of the industry from seed to sale gives the seven licensees a monopoly that has created hurdles to access and affordability.
"Vertical integration harms veterans by limiting choice, limiting supply, and limiting competition which creates outrageous prices,” Bill Cody, a disabled veteran, said at one recent forum.
He and other patient advocates want availability as soon as possible. Several asked the state to eliminate the 90-day waiting period.
Millions of Florida voters in November approved an expansion of who can obtain medical marijuana and who can sell it — from a very limited base to hundreds of thousands of patients whose need for legal weed will feed a $1.6 billion industry within a few years.
More than 600 physicians and close to 4,000 patients were listed in the Compassionate Use registry. So far, six of the seven licensees were cleared to sell medical marijuana. The seventh was recently granted a license as the result of a court decision.
Two paths
The Legislature faces two paths — follow the status quo or start fresh.
Meanwhile, the state Department of Health has already begun its rule-making process to meet deadlines set by Amendment 2.
Sen. Rob Bradley of Jacksonville has offered a “status-quo-plus” that would chart a slow growth for expanding licensees.
Sen. Jeff Brandes of St. Petersburg would scrap the current regulatory scheme and open the market to hundreds of licensees at every level from grower to producer to distributor to seller.
"Both embrace the language of the amendment," said Ben Pollara, whose group Floridians for Care campaigned for Amendment 2's passage. The most important thing is that both respect the sacrosanct nature of the physician-patient relationship and provide a framework for safe, reasonable access to medical marijuana.
"There is enormous room for reasonable debate about those," Pollara said.
See a map of where medical marijuana doctors are in Florida. Search the list of doctors here.
But Bradley's bill doesn't go as far as Brandes's bill in providing access and diversity, he said.
Bradley's bill embraces current regulations to some degree while allowing for some modest expansion of vendors over the next several years. It would ultimately allow 20 new vendors six months after the registered patient population hits 500,000.
Bradley's bill calls for eliminating a 90-day waiting period for patients seeking marijuana. His bill also doubles the supply a doctor can order for a patient from 45 to 90 days. It also would cut required training for doctors from 8 to 4 hours.
"The Bradley bill is a good starting point for discussions," Trulieve CEO Kim Rivers said.
Brandes wants to throw out the existing regulations along with its vertical integration of the business model and the cap on licenses. Currently, each licensee has control over growing, processing, distributing and selling medical marijuana — a seed-to-sale scenario.
Brandes wants to get rid of that vertical integration, creating a framework for people to come in as qualified licensees at any level — growers, distributors, and retailers who could do business with each other. He said his model better “encapsulates the will of the voters.”

Licensees fear that could lead to thousands of retail marijuana shops across the state. But patient advocates point out there is no limit to the number of stores those licensees can open.
“What the people decided is that individuals, not just the seven licensees, should be able to qualify to grow, process, dispense, deliver and administer medical marijuana,” said Dr. Mark Moore, the first physician in Tallahassee to be approved to recommend medical marijuana for his patients.
Doing so would increase access and bring costs down, Moore said. Some of his patients are paying $1,000 a month for medical marijuana, which isn't covered by health insurance.
Amendment 2 introduces a new term to the state's medical marijuana lexicon: Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, which by definition could be any entity that acquires, cultivates, processes, transports, sells or treats patients with marijuana or products containing marijuana.
Licensees interpret that to mean them. Brandes and patient advocates interpret that more broadly.
Jodi Martinez has stage four kidney cancer. After her doctor dismissed the idea of medical marijuana treatments, Martinez sought a second opinion from Dr. Mark Moore. Here they pose with a baby goat Martinez is raising.

If Moore could become licensed as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center he said, “It would simplify things for my patients. They could see their doctor and receive their medication at the same location.” And he could provide medical marijuana at half the cost patients currently pay.
Jodi Martinez was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer three years ago. She started using medical marijuana in December to help her sleep and ease her discomfort. And her tumors have shrunk by 18 percent.
Martinez, a patient of Moore's, spends about $300 a month on her medical marijuana. That price tag will only increase over time.
“The more acclimated I get, the more expensive it's going to cost,” she said.
Opening the door to more growers, producers, sellers and distributors would bring down the costs and give patients more options, she said.
“More people need to be able to grow it so there are more strains available,” Martinez said. “That would be the ultimate if we can grow our own.”
Huge investments
The seven licensees are protective of their investment. They've each spent millions just to gain the right to sell medical marijuana. They've raised and spent additional millions more buying land, building their indoor growing and production facilities, hiring people and putting them through background checks, creating a distribution network and opening dispensaries.
The exact amount they've spent is a mystery because most of their financial information has been redacted. Estimates based on what information is available put the investment dollars in the hundreds of millions bracket.
None has been at it long enough see a return on their investments and are burning through money each month to meet patient demand.
"We have not broken even," said Trulieve's Rivers.
Trulieve's mothership is a 70,000-square-foot warehouse off U.S. 90 in Quincy that once stored tomatoes. Rivers said the company has created a duplicatable model for expansion and has already begun building on another site in Gadsden County, not far from the primary warehouse.
Trulieve was first to start dispensing medical marijuana in the state, from a storefront in Tallahassee. It has stores in Clearwater and Tampa; locations in Pensacola and Bradenton set to open in the coming months.

Surterra, which got the first license to cultivate, started dispensing about a week after Trulieve, said CEO Jake Bergmann. It has a "wellness center" in Tampa and is getting ready to open one in Tallahassee with other locations planned.
Its main facility is a 6,000-square-foot converted agricultural warehouse 15 miles east of Tallahassee in rural Capitola. A second growing and production facility in Ruskin, in Hillsborough County, is a backup in case of storms or other problems.
Surterra has raised about $25 million in equity for its current operations and expansion plans, he said. Plans are to build a high-tech, 100,000-square-foot "Dutch-style" greenhouse 30 feet tall with an all-glass ceiling.
McCrory Sunny Hills, doing business as GrowHealthy, has spent around $5 million buying and converting a mattress factory in Lake Wales into a state-of-the-art growing and production facility.
By contrast, Knox Medical spent millions building a high-tech operation in Winter Garden, CEO Jose Hidalgo said.
The first phase was to cultivate enough marijuana to make sure they had medicine, he said.
The second phase, almost completed is a 50,000-square-foot permanent cultivation and manufacturing facility.
"Ours was completely conceptualized from ground up to be a state of art medical cannabis facility," he said.
Knox got approval to dispense in December and already plans to open six stores in next 120 days, starting with Gainesville and Orlando. It has a permit to open a store in Tallahassee, too.
"We were not stressed about going to market," Hidalgo said. "We were sharply focused on executing our business strategy."
Friendly competition
The licensees are currently competing for a small group of potential clients — not nearly enough to bring in the cash flow to recoup their investments. And they are likely to have patient crossover.
But they are already prepared to meet future demand. One state estimate puts the number of patients who could qualify for medical marijuana under Amendment 2 at close to 500,000.
Trulieve has close to 1,400 customers, Rivers said. It has the capacity to supply about 67,000 people a year at an average dose of 20 milligrams a day.
Surterra has about 800 customers but could serve between 4,000 and 6,000 people a year at current capacity, Bergmann said.
Knox has a little over 300 customers, Hildalgo said. When fully operational it could meet the demand of 75,000 customers, Hidalgo said.
"This whole capacity thing is a highly subjective number," he added.

Modern Health Concepts in Miami has a current capacity of 17,000 patients per month, CEO Rick Young said and serves about 10 percent of the active patients on the registry.
"We've started an expansion project to serve up to 43,000 patients per month," he said, with room to expand to serve hundreds of thousands of patients per month.
The companies hold their growing processes and marketing plans close to their chests. And they try to portray their operation as unique and state-of-the-art to try to maintain an edge over their competitors.
Surterra stresses purity of product. Trulieve talks about its exceptional quality.
They all stress safety and quality control, too. The last thing they want is a product recall on their hands.
"We want a regulatory structure that protects patients," Surterra's Bergmann said. "If one person is harmed this whole industry goes away."
For that reason, they support legislation that ensures only the most qualified people enter the market.
"Unlimited licenses is irresponsible," Hidalgo said. "I don't want to get into a situation where we have more licenses than McDonald's. I don't think Floridians voted for that."

Former England captain David Gower has stoked the fires ahead of this summer's Ashes by describing Australia as a country with no culture and their cricketers of having an "animal mentality".
Gower's comments come ahead of a busy fixture list between the two old rivals, which begins with a Champions Trophy clash at Edgbaston on Saturday and continues with five Tests, two T20 internationals and five more one-day internationals in the coming months. The two nations then do battle again on Australian soil from November to February.
Asked if England's long-standing rivalry with Australia was a clash of cultures, Gower told the Radio Times: "I'm tempted to say, how can you have a clash of cultures when you're playing against a country with no culture? That would almost be sledging."
Gower, who played 117 Tests for England from 1978 to 1992 and captained his side to victory in the 1985 Ashes series, continued on the subject of sledging by saying: "If you're on the boundary you have to be very, very thick-skinned, because the Aussie crowd will try you with absolutely anything.
"The trouble is, if they've had 10 cans of lager, their ability to come up with something akin to Oscar Wilde diminishes. A lot of it therefore tends to be very stereotypical. But it's feral; if they sense weakness, they'll come at you.
"It's the same with sledging on the field. There's a certain animal mentality, and if they sense a bit of weakness, they'll try it on more.
"The great thing is just to smile, because the smile completely confuses them. But the best way to keep an Australian bowler quiet is simply to make runs. If you're 120 not out, they tend not to say much."
On England's chances of success over the Australians, the 54-year-old Gower said: "My glass is more than half full this year. Australia have lost the Ponting-Hussey axis that was vital to them.
"Michael Clarke is a super player, but so much rests on his shoulders. We've got every right to be optimistic, but no right to be overconfident. "
Europe wants reusable rockets, too.
European aerospace company Airbus has revealed its plans to develop rocket engines that fly back to a runway and a reusable upper stage that acts as a space tug — reusability concepts that mirror those being developed by American spaceflight companies SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA).
Airbus has been working on its Advanced Expendable Launcher INnovative engine Economy (Adeline for short) reusable-rocket conceptsince 2010 and wants it to be up and running by 2025. The technology could help enable huge satellite constellations that would require a dramatic increase in the number of launches per year, company representatives have said. [Reusable Rocket Launch Systems: How They Work (Infographic)]
Meet Adeline
As envisioned, Adeline detaches from its rocket's first-stage fuel tank and re-enters Earth's atmosphere at five times the speed of sound with its engines behind the wings and a heatshield. Once in the atmosphere, Adeline uses its wings to autonomously fly toward a runway and, once at subsonic speeds, uses deployable propellers to power its return to the landing site, where it touches down on skids.
Adeline is being proposed for the planned two-stage Ariane 6 rocket the European Space Agency is paying Airbus to develop. Ariane 6 could be flying in the 2020s. Adeline's engines use liquid fuel, such as kerosene and liquid oxygen, which other rockets also use. According to Airbus, this means Adeline could be used with other rockets.
Airbus is not the only company to propose a reusable propulsion module. In April, ULA announced its Vulcan rocket and the Sensible, Modular, Autonomous Return Technology (SMART) initiative, which will allow Vulcan's main engines to be recovered through air capture.
Airbus has become interested in reusability because it thinks the technology could help increase annual launch rates, which in turn would enable the lofting of enormous satellite networks.

"We have to be ready to increase our cadence capability to increase the tons lifted to space per year, while reducing our costs," Hervé Gilibert, Airbus space systems' chief technical officer, told Space.com. "Payloads in future will be smaller and cheaper. We think we are at the edge of a big evolution of our business. You see in our landscape huge constellations that will need a drastic increase in launches per year."
Airbus isn't the only company thinking this way. For example, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has spoken of launching a constellation of 4,000 broadband Internet satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO). A company called OneWeb has plans for a 650-satellite network. Other LEO business proposals since the early 1990s have proposed large numbers of telecommunication and imaging satellites.
Adeline vs. the Falcon 9
Since the dawn of the space age, engineers have wanted to return expensive launch vehicles to Earth for reuse, rather than let them burn up and be destroyed in the atmosphere. See our history of reusable rocket technology in this full infographic (Image: © By Karl Tate, Infographics Artist)
Up to 80 percent of a rocket's cost is in its propulsion module, which can also contain the flight-control electronics, according to Airbus representatives. Airbus is predicting 30 percent savings for its reusable system compared to existing rockets, as a result of reduced production costs, Gilibert said.
Airbus claims its concept is more cost-effective than SpaceX's ongoing effort to develop a Falcon 9 rocket with a reusable first stage.
Gilibert also claimed that, with Adeline, Airbus' partially reusable Ariane 6 would have a payload performance that is better than SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9. The first stage of the Falcon 9 releases its upper stage and then descends, engines first, to land vertically using legs that deploy outward from the sides of the stage. (The rocket's upper stage is expendable.)
The Falcon 9 first stage needs 44 tons of propellant to reach a vertical landing site, according to Gilibert, and Adeline does not weigh as much.
"My guess, with a given launcher, is that [Adeline's] impact on payload performance, which for SpaceX is huge because it is a loss of 30 to 50 percent of the mass of the payload for a given orbit — our loss will be much lower," Gilibert said.
However, whereas SpaceXhas been flight-testing its vertical landing system when launching customer payloads — and has twice nearly landed the Falcon 9 first stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean — Airbus has not yet developed the reusable rocket engine Adeline calls for. The company has made more progress with the deployable propellers, though. [SpaceX Rocket Crashes During Landing Attempt (Video)]
Gilibert said that Airbus patented the deployable propellers up to two years ago, and prototypes were wind-tunnel-tested six to eight months ago.
"The proof of concept has been done. This [deployable propeller] concept is now de-risked," he said. Airbus engineers have also flown a scale-model version of Adeline for landing tests.
Accommodating Adeline
The European Space Agency-funded rockets Ariane 5 and Vega are flown by launch provider Arianespace from a spaceport in French Guiana, in South America. Gilibert said that if Adeline is used with the Ariane 6, that rocket's launch pad will need "very limited adaptations" to make room for the wings.
He also claimed that, because Adeline's engines are protected by the heat shield on re-entry, their condition would be little different than those that have had a ground firing test, which all rocket engines experience prior to launch. As engines must be treated after the test fire to be ready for launch, Gilibert said engineers know what needs to be done, and he is not expecting a "lot of refurbishment" will be required to return Adeline to flight readiness.
The limited work could be carried out at the French Guiana spaceport, he added.
Whereas Adeline uses liquid fuel, Airbus' reusable upper stage/space tug concept employs electric propulsion and never returns to Earth. Electric propulsion involves accelerating electrically charged gas ions, typically xenon, using magnetic fields. The system requires relatively long periods of time to accelerate a spacecraft to high speeds, compared to traditional chemical propulsion.
Gilibert said the space tug would be left in orbit by the Ariane 6 and would be used "several times" to take payloads in LEO to a higher orbit. Each time the tug is used, an Ariane 6 second stage would rendezvous to deliver the payload and provide gaseous fuel resupply. Gilibert also suggested that other rockets, not just Ariane 6, could use the tug. Once the tug's operational life comes to an end, it can be sent on a remote exploration mission, Airbus representatives said.

Police arrested a woman they suspected was trying to hide crack cocaine.
A South Texas officer and another man have been indicted over what prosecutors say involved fake police reports to smuggle cocaine.
The federal indictment announced Tuesday names Rio Grande City police investigator Noel Pena.
Prosecutors in McAllen said Pena and Hector Salinas-Hinojosa of Roma are charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute as well as possession with intent to distribute cocaine.
The undercover investigation began last month, leading to both men arrested. Pena was assigned to the Starr County High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force.
Investigators said Pena worked with drug traffickers who would steal much of the cocaine they were holding for Mexican cartels.
Authorities said Pena accepted bribes to generate fake police reports saying the cocaine was confiscated during law enforcement operations he set up.

We have some information on two big Universal Pictures releases, thanks again to our astute readers.
First we have news on, Riddick, the upcoming entry in the Vin Diesel-powered (like that?) franchise. We had speculated Comic-Con would be a perfect venue to show off the film, which will be released in the U.S. this fall. News on its production has been conspicuously quiet, aside from a teaser trailer released last month.
Well, Comic-Con attendees may indeed have the first extended peak of this sci-fi actioner, as Riddick and Battlestar Galactica star Katee Sackhoff confirmed via Twitter she will be appearing to promote the film:
Nope! But I Will Be for #Riddick!!!! RT @gumballgary: @kateesackhoff Will you be at Comic Con in SD next month for #longmire? — Katee Sackhoff (@kateesackhoff) June 12, 2013
The other big Universal release is one that SDConCast guest and Slashfilm.com writer Germain Lussier said on our podcast was his most anticipated film of the year, Edgar Wright's The World's End. Well, we now have two reports which confirm the movie will have a panel and/or an event at SDCC this year.
First, Director Edgar Wright himself did confirm via Twitter that he would be at SDCC this year:
What's interesting and corroborates with another report we received from one of our readers, is that Wright lists Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in his reply, and the “We” in his statement indicates that both of his longtime leads will be joining him at SDCC.
Now about that other report. Although it's unconfirmed by the studio, our reader claimed his information came from a Universal Pictures “press source” and states that indeed Wright, Pegg and Frost will be presenting The World's End in Hall H on Friday, July 19, but also joined by Martin Freeman as well.
@SD_Comic_Con The World's End panel will be at Hall H on friday (press source Universal). With Pegg, Frost, Freeman, Wright. — Peter Breuls (@Breuls) June 13, 2013
Now it wouldn't be a stretch that Freeman would also be at SDCC, because he's also expected to be a panel guest during The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug at the Warner Bros. Pictures panel on July 20.
Lastly, Universal has a pretty big slate of geek-friendly films it's bringing to Comic-Con this year: The aforementioned Riddick and The World's End, and the previously-confirmed Kick-Ass 2. So perhaps all three would be under a Universal Pictures panel on Friday, July 19, or they could have their own separate panels or events. We'll see soon, when the programming schedule is announced by CCI, if not sooner by the studio itself.
Excited to see this slate of films in Hall H? Let us know in the comments.
Thanks to readers kerrydixon and breuls for the information.
When you swear the oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States in uniform you give up many of the rights guaranteed therein. Freedom of speech, particularly of the political variety, is gone. Search and seizure can be at the whim of the commander based upon probable because that would be illegal outside the gates of our forts. In the draft era, even the basic “life, liberty and property” was subordinated to the Spartan needs of service to the nation.
We accept these realities as part of our responsibility to the document we proudly defend. However, perhaps unknown to the general public, servicemembers' right to possess, store, and carry personal firearms, on and off post, is much more restricted than any American civilian's right to do so. In a time when American servicemembers are being specifically targeted at home and at military installations, limiting their right to keep and bear arms—a right still granted to every other citizen not in uniform—no longer makes sense.
Military servicemembers and their families are directly threatened by various permutations of Jihadi Islam. The threat is legitimate and demonstrable; Tennessee, Canada, New Jersey, Arkansas, and, of course, Fort Hood, Texas. The military's response to these attacks is sadly predictable. We will tighten security on the various bases and forts, which in turn makes them, and the soldiers within, increasingly inaccessible to the general public. The troublesome divide between the nation and the men and women who defend it will become wider and deeper. To the senior officers of the military who invariably live on these well-defended military installations, I am sure these actions will appear to do something to safeguard the men and women they command.
In what will become an iconic photo in the gun rights community, the bullet holes surrounding the gun-free-zone sign at the recruiting station in Tennessee perfectly illustrates the foolishness of such zones.
These assumptions would be wrong. Obviously these actions would have done nothing to protect the marines and sailors slaughtered unarmed in Tennessee. And it will do nothing to counter the insider threat personified by Major Hassan and Sergeant Akbar. Aside from the nearly one best online casinomillion reservists who, of course, live in the local community, a huge percentage of active military members live outside the fenced and guarded bases. No amount of passive defenses can protect our service members and their families from attacks emanating domestically. Only the active measure of arming our men and women, or, at the very least, allowing them to arm themselves will provide the requisite security to reduce the threat significantly that all of us who serve in uniform face every day at home.
To the officers and non-commissioned officers, the right to arm themselves against threats should be unquestioned. If incapable of carrying a side arm safely, they have no business being leaders in the profession of arms. To the junior enlisted, if qualified on the type of arm they wish to carry, they should, by definition, be qualified to do so at all times. If the level of training is insufficient, then that is the fault of the service that failed to qualify them properly. This does not mean they must be issued the weapon, though that would be preferable in some cases. Personally owned weapons should be sufficient.
In the past 20 years this country has undergone an experiment on the costs and benefits of letting Americans arm themselves discreetly. The concealed carry weapon (CCW) permit is becoming ubiquitous in our country. In some states, ranging from Maine to Arizona to Alaska, no permit is required at all. The predicted bloodshed that many said would result failed utterly to materialize. In fact, violent crime levels of all kind have dropped during this period. Whether this drop is from causation or correlation is unknown. What is known is that Americans have become safer at the same time more and more Americans have started carrying weapons in their own defense. The idea that trained professionals would present a higher risk than the general population they defend fails the common sense test.
Despite the obvious nature of this solution, it will be predictably attacked by the senior leaders in the military. This failure to trust the subordinates they trained highlights a different problem to be addressed at a different time. But senior leaders who use their command authority to disarm the men and women they are responsible for must be held accountable the next time our men in uniform are slaughtered; unarmed and defenseless.
In what will become an iconic photo in the gun rights community, the bullet holes surrounding the gun-free-zone sign at the recruiting station in Tennessee perfectly illustrates the foolishness of such zones. While the debate has often centered on schools, where the mix of children and firearms adds an understandably emotional concern, the idea that men and women who have trained in the profession of arms must be treated like children is indefensible. In the predictable absence of a call from our military leadership, it will be incumbent upon the civilians who thankfully wield ultimate power over the military to allow us the right to protect our families, ourselves, and our fellow Americans from the threats we tragically face at home.
The heatwave that engulfed southeastern Australia at the end of last week has seen heat records continue to tumble.
On Saturday 11 February, as New South Wales suffered through the heatwave's peak, temperatures soared to 47℃ in Richmond, 50km northwest of Sydney, while 87 bushfires raged across the state, amid catastrophic fire conditions.
On that day, most of NSW experienced temperatures at least 12C above normal for this time of year. In White Cliffs, the overnight minimum was 34.2, a new record for the state's highest observed minimum temperature.
Australia's heatwave continues with record temperatures forecast Read more
On Friday, the average maximum temperature right across NSW hit 42.4, beating the previous February record of 42.0. The new record stood for all of 24 hours before it was smashed again on Saturday, as the whole state averaged 44.0 at its peak. At this time, NSW was the hottest place on earth.
A degree or two here or there might not sound like much, but to put it in cricketing parlance, those temperature records are the equivalent of a modern-day test batsman retiring with an average of over 100 – the feat of outdoing Don Bradman's fabled 99.94 – and would undoubtedly be front-page news.
And still the records continue to fall. Mungindi, on the border of NSW and Queensland, broke the Australian record of 50 days in a row above 35, set just four years ago at Bourke airport, with the new record now at 52 days.
Meanwhile, two days after that sweltering Saturday we woke to find the fires ignited during the heatwave still cutting a swathe of destruction, with the small town of Uarbry, east of Dunedoo, all but burned to the ground.
This heatwave is all the more noteworthy when we consider that the El Niño of 2015-16 is long gone and the conditions that ordinarily influence our weather are firmly in neutral. This means we should expect average, not sweltering, temperatures.
Since Christmas, much of eastern Australia has been in a flux of extreme temperatures. This increased frequency of heatwaves shows a strong trend in observations, which is set to continue as the human influence on the climate deepens.
It is all part of a rapid warming trend that over the past decade has seen new heat records in Australia outnumber new cold records by 12 to one.
Let's be clear, this is not natural. Climate scientists have long been saying that we would feel the impacts of human-caused climate change in heat records first, before noticing the upward swing in average temperatures (although that is happening too). This heatwave is simply the latest example.
What's more, in just a few decades' time, summer conditions like these will be felt across the whole country regularly.
Attributing the heat
The useful thing scientifically about heatwaves is that we can estimate the role that climate change plays in these individual events. This is a relatively new field known as “event attribution”, which has grown and improved significantly over the past decade.
Australia's heatwave: some like it hot – but not this hot Read more
Using the Weather@Home climate model, we looked at the role of human-induced climate change in this latest heatwave, as we have for other events previously.
We compared the likelihood of such a heatwave in model simulations that factor in human greenhouse gas emissions, compared with simulations in which there is no such human influence. Since 2017 has only just begun, we used model runs representing 2014, which was similarly an El Niño-neutral year, while also experiencing similar levels of human influence on the climate.
Based on this analysis, we found that heatwaves at least as hot as this one are now twice as likely to occur. In the current climate, a heatwave of this severity and extent occurs, on average, once every 120 years, so is still quite rare. However, without human-induced climate change, this heatwave would only occur once every 240 years.
In other words, the waiting time for the recent east Australian heatwave has halved. As climate change worsens in the coming decades, the waiting time will reduce even further.
Our results show very clearly the influence of climate change on this heatwave event. They tell us that what we saw last weekend is a taste of what our future will bring, unless humans can rapidly and deeply cut our greenhouse emissions.
Our increasingly fragile electricity networks will struggle to cope, as the threat of rolling blackouts across NSW showed. It is worth noting that the large number of rooftop solar panels in NSW may have helped to avert such a crisis this time around.
Our hospital emergency departments also feel the added stress of heat waves. When an estimated 374 people died from the heatwave that preceded the Black Saturday bushfires the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine resorted to storing bodies in hospitals, universities and funeral parlours. The Victorian heatwave of January 2014 saw 167 more deaths than expected, along with significant increases in emergency department presentations and ambulance callouts.
Infrastructure breaks down during heatwaves, as we saw in 2009 when railway lines buckled under the extreme conditions. It can also strain Australia's beloved sporting events, as the 2014 Australian Open showed.
These impacts have led state governments and other bodies to investigate heatwave management strategies, while our colleagues at the Bureau of Meteorology have developed a heatwave forecast service for Australia.
These are likely to be just the beginning of strategies needed to combat heatwaves, with conditions currently regarded as extreme set to be the “new normal” by the 2030s. With the ramifications of extreme weather clear to everyone who experienced this heatwave, there is no better time to talk about how we can ready ourselves.
We urgently need to discuss the health and economic impacts of heatwaves, and how we are going to cope with more of them in the future.

NEW: In Febuary 2017, a study was published concerning the sustainability of biofuels. The author, Duncan Brack, who is a former special adviser at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, states that emissions from pellets are higher than coal, and that the UK's government substantial subsides for biomass should be reviewed urgently. For more information see this article by New Scientist.
Agrofuels (biofuels from intensive agriculture) are increasingly being burned as a supposedly 'green' alternative to fossil fuels. However, because of emissions from deforestation and intensive agriculture, they can be at least as damaging to the climate as coal, oil and gas.
Palm oil is one of the most notorious - as well as an ingredient in food, it is also being used in biodiesel in the EU, ironically in an attempt to lower carbon emissions, despite the devastation palm oil plantations have caused, being linked to mass burning of Indonesian forests which have made Indonesia the third largest carbon emitter in the world.
The climate impacts of wood burning are less well known, but can be significant, both because of the links to deforestation and because the rate of CO2 emissions are not matched by forest regrowth: it can take between thirty five to fifty years for new trees planted now to offset the carbon released by harvesting and burning the forests that preceeded them, nor is this regrowth guaranteed in many cases.
The largest burner of biomass in the UK, and in fact in the world, is Drax power station in Yorkshire, which burnt pellets made from 12 million tonnes of wood last year - a million more tonnes than the UK produces in a single year. Far from being offcuts, as Drax claims, most of the wood pellets are imported from North America, with a significant proportion coming from clear-cutting highly biodiverse coastal wetland forests. Others come from pine monocultures which have replaced what were once biodiverse and thriving forests.
Drax is only able to survive due to large renewable energy subsidies of over £1 million a day, which enables it to continue being the largest burner of coal and emitter of CO2 in the UK. Through their #AxeDrax campaign, Biofuelwatch are working to end these damaging biomass subsidies, campaigning for proper support for truly renewable technologies such as wind and solar, and energy efficiency.
For more information, see https://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/axedrax-campaign/
Biofuel burning is not a clean alternative to dirty energy production that it is so commonly argued to be, as this RSPB report explains.
In addition to Drax, Biofuelwatch continues to support local campaigns against proposed and existing biomass power stations in the UK. In recent months, they have supported campaigners in West Thurrock, in Andover, in Milford Haven, and in Norwich. They would love to hear from people who live close to other biomass power station sites, in particular anyone living in Anglesey or Neath and Port Talbot (where Orthios Energy are proposing two huge biomass power stations), in Teesside (where MGT Power wants to build a large plant) and near Lynemouth (where Czech energy company EPH is converting the mothballed Lynemouth Power Station to biomass). For a roundup of news on those campaigns, please see biofuelwatch.org.uk/local-campaigns-uk.

EU leaders seal bank plan to beat crisis
Posted
Sorry, this video has expired Video: EU expert discusses eurozone accord (ABC News)
Europe's leaders have agreed to start building a single banking union for the eurozone from the beginning of next year.
At a meeting in Brussels, the leaders agreed that the European Central Bank should have the power to intervene in any of the eurozone's 6,000 banks.
Legislative framework is to be in place by January 1 next year.
But questions remain over exactly when the scheme will start, whether non-euro countries can join, and exactly when any new rescue funds can be used to directly recapitalise banks.
Some believe German chancellor Angela Merkel wants to delay any prospect of using more funds to bail out Spain's banks before Germany's elections in September next year.
The bird's eye bank supervision is supposed to anchor a re-designed economic and monetary union that leaders are beginning to believe - after three years in full crisis mode - can make the euro more attractive to EU states still outside the currency bloc.
After an 11-hour session into the early hours to reach the bank supervision deal, Ms Merkel said it was not about "trying to bargain for extra days or months", but rather ensuring a "solid legal framework" could be found by year-end.
"We need democratic legitimacy," she said, plus further clarity on dealing with eurozone banks in non-euro territories, especially the global financial centre of London, and vice-versa.
Italian prime minister Mario Monti said a Merkel plan to create a "super-commissioner" with powers to intervene directly in states' tax-and-spending plans flopped.
French president Francois Hollande said the summit outcome was "a good deal" but he resisted a German push to change the EU treaty next year after a December summit that is meant to nail down "concrete" moves to tighten centralisation of economic policy.
Mr Hollande said he did not see the "utility of adding new mechanisms".
He did, however, suggest that the fruits of a financial transactions tax (FTT), which a group of EU states want to start next year, be "dedicated to youth training" to get a lost generation of young Europeans into employment.
After the summit, leaders also hailed a 120-billion-euro ($155-billion) package of measures to try to kickstart a climb out of recession as social and political unrest hits Greece and Spain.
Ideas included using proceeds from a proposed tax on financial transactions to tackle youth unemployment currently running in these two countries at more than 50 per cent.
Difficult decisions remain to be taken in two more summits before Christmas, as Britain's David Cameron threatened to veto the European Union's budget for the rest of the decade and snub the Nobel Peace Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo in December.
Conflicts in Syria and Mali, as well as Iran's disputed nuclear program also figured among their chief concerns.

Amal Al Kuwaiti, an electrical engineer with Abu Dhabi Distribution Company, said she believes citizens and residents should give back to society in the form of the 5 per cent tax.
DUBAI // The VAT is a welcome opportunity to pay back the country for all it has done, a young Emirati says.
“As an Emirati, I don't have any issue with paying this tax because it's my turn to help my country,” said Amal Al Kuwaiti, an electrical engineer with Abu Dhabi Distribution Company.
“My country has done a lot for me and, as there is a crisis, what's the point if I can't pay 5 per cent back?”
The 5 per cent tax on goods and services is expected to be levied across the GCC from January next year. It will boost government revenues at a time of falling oil prices.
Ms Al Kuwaiti said she is happy to pay it back to a country that has given her every opportunity.
“As Emiratis we have many opportunities,” she said. “I got a scholarship when studying for my bachelor's and I lived a good life where I had everything I wanted, even at 19 years of age.
“Most people who have good grades can get a scholarship and if they want to go to restaurants, shops and cinemas, then they should also be willing to pay a little more for the entertainment.
“If people buy cars or expensive cosmetics, they do so because they have the money. So the tax should not hurt.”
She hoped the tax would make people more prudent about how they spent their money.
“Maybe awareness will increase and rather than spending money on anything, they will think twice about what to own and when. It will make people think wisely.”
Ms Al Kuwaiti also believes the tax will not have a major effect on expatriates.
“Maybe some people will be shocked because this is new,” she said. “They are not used to a tax and some will disagree with it.
“Others will say they came here because they were suffering from tax in their own country and ask why the UAE and GCC are doing this. But people will soon see it as a requirement of living here.”

A United Nations diplomat charged with investigating claims of torture said Monday that he is “deeply disappointed and frustrated” that U.S. defense officials have refused his request for an unmonitored visit with Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accused of passing classified material to WikiLeaks.
Juan E. Mendez, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture, said his request for a private interview with Manning was denied by the Defense Department on Friday. Instead, he has been told that any visit must be supervised.
Mendez has been seeking to determine whether Manning's confinement at a military brig at Quantico amounts to torture, following complaints about his treatment and an incident in which the private was forced to strip in his cell at night and sleep without clothing.
“My request . . . is not onerous: for my part, a monitored conversation would not comply with the practices that my mandate applies in every country and detention center visited,” Mendez said in a statement Monday, noting that at least 18 countries have allowed unmonitored interviews.
Manning, 23, has been held at Quantico since July 29 and is awaiting a possible court-martial on charges that he endangered national security by allegedly leaking classified military and diplomatic information.
For most of this time, military officials have kept Manning under “prevention of injury” watch, asserting that he poses a risk to himself. That means he spends 23 hours a day alone in his cell, with one hour allowed for exercise, and has no contact with other prisoners. He is allowed visitors for a few hours on the weekends. He must give up his prison uniform at night, though jail officials have now issued him a smock to wear.
U.S. officials have denied that Manning is being mistreated and have said that the circumstances of his confinement comply with U.S. law and Defense Department regulations.
Last month, however, P.J. Crowley, then the spokesman for the State Department, said the conditions of Manning's confinement were “counterproductive and stupid” — a comment that angered the White House and prompted Crowley's resignation.
On Sunday, the New York Review of Books published a letter signed by more than 250 lawyers, professors and authors, including Harvard University constitutional law professor Laurence H. Tribe, that called the conditions of Manning's confinement “illegal and immoral.” The British government has also raised concerns about the issue.
In an interview, Mendez said that “at first glance,” Manning's case seems to be “of interest to my mandate,” which is to investigate cases of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment and report them to the U.N. Human Rights Council.
To do his job, he said, he needs to be able to speak to Manning without witnesses, including guards patrolling nearby. Otherwise, he said, “I cannot be sure Manning is being absolutely candid and honest with me if he knows that he's being monitored.”
He said he is willing to see Manning nonetheless, if Manning wishes to see him.
The Defense Department has also denied requests for unmonitored visits with Manning by a representative of Amnesty International and by Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio), according to the soldier's attorney.
Associate United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a longtime opera fan, and she finally made her proper stage debut at the Kennedy Center Opera House with the Washington National Opera Saturday. (She has appeared as a supernumerary on two other occasions.)
The WNO is presenting Gaetano Donizetti's The Daughter of the Regiment until November 20, featuring Lawrence Brownlee as Tonio and Lisette Oropesa as Marie for many of the performances. If you've always yearned to hear Ginsburg croon, sorry–she was there for the opening night only, in the non-singing role of the Duchess of Krakenthorp. In one scene below she says, to great audience enthusiasm, “Dropping traditions that have worked and continue to work is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”
In another she proclaims: “Quel scandale!”

Nearly two years after its Kickstarter campaign raised $1.2 million — a record for an English-language visual novel campaign — the final chapter of the Muv-Luv trilogy, Muv-Luv Alternative, arrived on Steam on September 18. But why is there so much love for Luv? This article will help you decide if the franchise with the weird name is for you.
What the Heck Is Muv-Luv Anyway (And What's With The Stupid Title)?
Muv-Luv is a long-running visual novel series that mashes up the romance and mecha genres by literally turning from one into the other overnight.
The first VN, simply titled Muv-Luv, was published by âge in 2003 and consists of two parts. Muv-Luv Extra is a borderline parody of the harem romance genre, with videogame enthusiast Takeru being pulled between girl-next-door/childhood-friend Sumika, and wealthy-girl/mysterious-transfer-student Meiya. To complete your harem bingo card, the player's choices can also lead to love with a pushy class rep, diminutive hyperactive girl, or deadpan snarking tsundere.
In the second part, Muv-Luv Unlimited, Takeru wakes in an alternate timeline, where humanity is 30 years into a losing war against man-eating aliens called the BETA (an awkward acronym for “Beings of Extra-Terrestrial Origin, Adversaries of the Human Race”), who have conquered half the Earth. His school is now a training academy for mechs called Tactical Surface Fighters (“TSFs”) and the former harem girls are all pilot cadets, except for Sumika, who seems not to exist in this world.
2006's Muv-Luv Alternative begins as a do-over of Unlimited, with Takeru trying to avoid the choices that led to humanity abandoning Earth. In doing so, he unleashes an epic tide of events that changes the course of the war, but at a staggering cost to himself and everyone around him.
As for the name, literally “Mabu Ravu”, it's a play on “mabudachi”, meaning “true friend”. The first release initially marketed itself as a silly harem game, hiding its sci-fi intentions almost entirely.
Why Should I Read Muv-Luv?
The final chapter, Alternative, is a worthy candidate for one of the best VNs ever made. It's currently ranked #1 on the Visual Novel Database and #3 on Japan's Erogamescape. The series as a whole was picked #2 of all time by members of the /r/visualnovels Subreddit.
That begs the question of why there's such love for Luv. Different fans will cite different things: the silly humor of Extra contrasted with the horror of Alternative, the detailed understanding of military life, the protagonist's agonizing search for answers and meaning (and a way home), the audacious plot twists, the believable politics and alternate history, the epic sweep of the war story, songs by JAM Project , and so on.
In fact, one such fan is manga creator Hajime Isayama . On several occasions, he has cited Muv-Luv Alternative as his inspiration for creating Attack on Titan . The screenshot above shows him second-from-right on âge's weekly livestream in August 2015, with Muv-Luv creator Koki Yoshimune at far left.
Why Shouldn't I Read Muv-Luv?
For starters, even in its all-ages version, there's no escaping the fact that this was originally an eroge. For all the technical hand-waving about the “fortified suits” worn by TSF pilots, it's as if someone said, “You know what would make the plug-suits in Evangelion even better? Translucency.” And while the sex scenes are few and far between, they're still a lynchpin of the story.
And then there's “that scene” in Alternative, morbidly referred to by fans as “Twizzlers” for reasons you probably don't want to understand. It's a scene of sexual violence so horrifying that many fans of the series question whether it should have been included at all. Still, it's anything but gratuitous, since understanding it helps explain the entire premise of the series.
Still, if this sounds like something you'd want to avoid, you probably should.
Should I Start With the Anime?
No, because there isn't one.
The main Muv-Luv story has never been adapted as an anime, in sharp contrast to other top VNs like Clannad , Fate/stay night , and Steins;Gate , which not only got anime adaptations, but saw their anime reach the English-speaking world years before their source VNs did. The lack of an anime for Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative has helped keep the franchise off the radar for many in the West.
And yet, several light novel spinoffs of Muv-Luv did get anime adaptations. Total Eclipse is roughly concurrent with Alternative and features TSF test pilots from the US, USSR, Japan, and other countries competing with each other (and fighting the BETA) in Alaska. Schwarzes Marken is set in East Germany 18 years earlier in 1983, focusing on Cold War tensions both inside and outside the Communist nation as it becomes Europe's eastern front against the BETA. Both of these stream on Crunchyroll, and Total Eclipse is available on disc from Sentai Filmworks.
And then there's the romantic drama Rumbling Hearts (aka, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ), to which Muv-Luv Extra is technically a direct sequel.
So Should I Watch Rumbling Hearts First?
Not necessarily. There are some intriguing connections between this series and Muv-Luv, like a tree atop the hill behind the school that becomes iconic throughout the franchise , and a videogame enjoyed by the boys in Rumbling Hearts that will redefine real-world TSF combat in Unlimited and Alternative.
Rumbling Hearts heroines Mitsuki, Akane, and Haruka all eventually appear in the BETA-verse timeline, and knowing their backstories helps inform their characterization as members of the “Valkyries” TSF squadron. But there's nothing about Muv-Luv that would be confusing if you weren't familiar with their original appearance. The best reason to watch Rumbling Hearts is simply if its angsty soap opera dramatics appeal to you in the first place. It's available streaming and on disc from Funimation.
What Else Is Out There?
Side-stories set in the Muv-Luv Alternative universe have been published for years in Tech Gian magazine, and side-story VNs were published under the the Alternative Chronicles banner. Some of these extras will go out to Kickstarter backers as the Photonflowers and Photonmelodies collections, which were originally released for the Japanese PS3.
Three related anime remain unlicensed in English. The OVA Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~ is a 4-episode Rumbling heart sequel that imagines a different final romantic pairing. The comedy Akane Maniax is a separate Rumbling Hearts sequel, featuring a buffoonish suitor courting Akane, and it exists primarily to explain why he transferred out of school the day before Muv-Luv Extra begins, thereby leaving a spot open in Takeru's class for Meiya to occupy. Both of these anime feature scenes with Muv-Luv class rep Chizuru, who was retconned as a gal-pal to Akane. Furthermore, Akane Maniax has cameos from practically the entire Muv-Luv Extra cast.
There's also the Ayumayu Theater web shorts, which continue the post-credit omake scenes from Rumbling Hearts with idiot waitresses Ayu and Mayu making a mess of the Muv-Luv universe.
Until artificial intelligence progresses to the point where intelligent machines take over our Westminster system (yes, I'm scared, too), we will continue to appoint flawed humans to important government posts.
Some of these people will come with pasts more fraught than others, but show me a closet without a skeleton and chances are there's a rug nearby with an ugly lump.
That's why I look at the expunged assault charge for governor general-designate Julie Payette, as reported Tuesday by iPolitics, with little more than a shrug.
It is newsworthy, certainly: there is hardly a compelling reason why the news that Canada's next governor general once faced a second-degree assault charge ought to be kept from Canadians, other than perhaps for Payette's personal privacy, though that's generally forfeited when assuming as high profile a role as representative of the Queen.
An 'unfounded' charge
If we take Payette at her word that the 2011 charge was "unfounded," then it should constitute a mere line or two in her biography, and certainly not disqualify her from her soon-to-be-assumed role. The charge was laid, quickly dropped and subsequently expunged, according to reports. See "flawed humans," above.
What makes the story exceptional, however, is the prime minister's reluctance to address the report with anything beyond a cursory "no comment." Indeed, when pressed by iPolitics, Kate Purchase, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's director of communications, said simply: "We've got no comment on this." She also would not confirm whether the prime minister was aware of the charge before appointing Payette (though it's difficult to imagine he wasn't, considering the way candidates for the post are vetted).
In a thoughtful column for iPolitics, Susan Delacourt posited that Trudeau's response might not have been so nonchalant had reports surfaced of a male governor general-designate with an expunged assault charge in his history.
"It brings up a thought-provoking question," she wrote. "Could the PMO simply say 'no comment' in response to reports about an assault charge involving a male appointee?"
"Probably not," she answers. "Let's all cast our minds back to Trudeau's delivery of swift justice against two former Liberal MPs accused of pressing unwelcome advances against two female New Democrat MPs."
Delacourt ends the discussion there, but I think it merits a more detailed comparison.
Massimo Pacetti, left, and Scott Andrews were suspended from the Liberal caucus in 2014. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)
In the case of those two former Liberal MPs — Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti — there were no actual charges levelled against them when the news broke back in November 2014. In fact, the internal investigation of the matter came only after Trudeau announced that the pair would be suspended from caucus because of "allegations of serious misconduct."
At the time, the MPs hadn't even been informed of the specific allegations against them. Nevertheless, Trudeau stood before cameras to declare that he would "give the benefit of the doubt to those who come forward."
Months went by and one of the original accusers gave a detailed account of a sexual encounter with Pacetti to Huffington Post Canada, while a Toronto human rights lawyer hired by Trudeau conducted an independent investigation into the allegations.
Finally, in March, Pacetti and Andrews were informed — via media leaks, not from their party, and before they had a chance to look at the final report from the external investigator — that they would be permanently booted from the Liberals. Trudeau confirmed the news shortly thereafter.
Liberal leader addresses decision to suspend two MPs over allegations of harassment. 11:55
There are obvious differences between the Payette case and that of Pacetti and Andrews, the most significant of which being that the allegations against the latter two concern their conduct while in office, not six years prior. But the chief point here is that when Trudeau made that first public statement back in November 2014, the allegations against them were unproven.
Yet instead of quietly investigating the matter before going public, Trudeau opted for what was likely the more politically expedient move: he talked about them publicly — remarking on the importance of individuals coming forward, and about power dynamics, and about safe workplaces — even if it helped prematurely convict the MPs in the court of public opinion.
It's not a perfect comparison, but the difference in approach is striking: a couple of men were treated as guilty before we knew the facts, and Trudeau jumped in front of the microphone at seemingly the first available opportunity. But now, with a woman at the centre of the controversy, he's totally mum. It's all the more bizarre considering that, in the eyes of the law, Payette's case is settled.
It's not far-fetched to think that if it was discovered that a male governor general had an assault charge in his past, Trudeau would seize the opportunity to evangelize about male aggression and domestic violence. Then again, I don't think Trudeau would appoint a male governor general with a past assault charge — even one that had been dropped and expunged — in the first place.
Payette's past shouldn't disqualify her from the role of governor general, but it shouldn't be ignored by the prime minister, either. Trudeau was eager to get his comments in before; he hardly has a good reason for staying quiet now.

Great white sharks are magnificent animals and it is truly an honour to work with them. They are top predators and probably the most studied shark in South African waters to date.
But one of the questions most often asked is: “how many of them are there?” Due to the lack of empirical data, the answer to this question is mostly based on gut feeling, belief and personal opinion. Because of this, authorities often fail to implement conservation measures in time.
This is the reason why in 2009 world-renowned conservationist Michael (Mike) Rutzen, and myself decided to do the obvious thing: to simply start counting them.
We undertook the data collection around the entire South African coastline. Considering that Dyer Island near Gansbaai – on the western coast of the country – is seen as the white shark's capital of the world, we were expecting the population number to be quite high.
Getting the numbers right
Mike is a South African, well known from international documentaries like “The Sharkman”. In these documentaries, he free-dives with large species of sharks to dispel the myth that these beautiful creatures are human killing machines.
Relying on his 20 years of experience with great white sharks, building the study and identification protocol for the counting was relatively easy.
Once the protocol was established, we set sail for the most comprehensive project to date on South Africa's white shark population. In and around Gansbaai we collected and, most importantly, analysed more than 5,000 photographs from which we could identify 426 individual white sharks by the unique notches of their dorsal fins.
We then performed a capture-mark-recapture analysis to ensure that we were not double-counting the same individuals. This works by building a re-sighting table, or a history-of-recapture matrix, in which the presence of each individual shark at a given time is recorded. To our surprise, we struggled to find new individuals to photograph once 400 white shark individuals were identified.

This means that most of the white sharks visiting Gansbaai were already in the database. The results from this part of the study indicate with 95% confidence a population estimate of between 353 and 522 individuals. This is 52% less than that estimated in previous mark-recapture studies.

Another four years of sampling
We needed to be sure that the white sharks we identified and counted in Gansbaai were representative of the entire white shark population along the South African coastline. So we set sail again and spent another four years sailing around the coastline collecting biopsy samples and photographs of dorsal fins.
The subsequent genetic analysis, performed under the supervision of Professor Conrad Matthee, from the Evolutionary Genomic Group at Stellenbosch University, proved that there is only one interbreeding population and that the same sharks are roaming the entire coastline.

Once we collected 303 genetic samples we took the analysis up another notch. With the genetic analysis we were able to estimate the population size and double-check the results of the photographic identification work. The biopsy samples came from 233 different white sharks. Analyses of 14 microsatellite markers revealed a contemporary effective population size of 333 individuals.
Genetic analysis is not the same as counting the sharks. With a genetic analysis we estimated the number of successful breeding individuals who generated the sampled population. The results can also be used to indicate the survival potential of a population.
It has been indicated that a minimum of 500 breeding individuals are required to prevent inbreeding depression for a species.
The results of our study paint a very gloomy picture, with an estimated 333 breeding white sharks, based on samples collected around the entire coastline, for the South African population.
Even more troubling is the fact that the genetic estimate of 333 breeding white sharks does not reflect the current situation, as this is an estimate of how many sharks successfully bred one generation ago. When looking at the number of adults counted with the photo identification work, we can conclude that South Africa's white sharks faced a rapid decline in the last generation. More concerning is that their numbers might already be too low to ensure their survival.
Future action for conservation
Our non-invasive study is the first of its kind. Not only did we sample known free-ranging white sharks, but we also built a database that links the genetic profile with the photographic identification of each individual shark. This combination of techniques provides a useful tool to double-check the results of each technique. It results in a stronger and more reliable output.
In the light of these results we should consider more drastic actions to ensure the long-term survival of this ancient species. But as white sharks can't be bred in captivity or relocated, we can only protect their environment and food resources if we want to conserve them.
In terms of legislation, making the regulation on their trade stricter could slow down the illegal trade in jaw trophies. Finally, in terms of immediate actions, we could halt the use of gill nets and baited hooks as shark-protection measures and hopefully move toward eco-friendly alternatives.
Our hope is that from now on white sharks will be monitored more closely and that better conservation measures will be put in place. We also hope that delicate arguments, like the estimate of a vulnerable population, will be based on acceptable scientific methods rather than the personal opinions of well-meaning individuals.

University of Nevada, Reno researchers discovered that used coffee grounds can be successfully converted into biodiesel for powering cars and trucks. The fuel even smells like coffee! Not only does this new process have the potential to keep all of those coffee grounds out of the trash, researchers Mano Misra, Susanta Mohapatra, and Narasimharao Kondamudi say that coffee-based biofuel is more stable, due to coffee's high antioxidant content.
Used coffee grounds contain between 11 and 20% oil, which is about on par with other biofuel sources such as soybeans. Scientists collected discarded grounds from a coffee chain and were able to convert 100% of the oil they extracted into biofuel.
The stability aspect is really exciting. Traditional biofuel gels or crystallizes in cold temperatures, making it a less viable option in winter and in areas with colder year-round climates. Would this new, more stable option withstand colder temperatures?
Growers produce more than 16 billion pounds of coffee per year worldwide. Rather than tossing the bulk of the used grounds into the waste stream, scientists estimate that spent coffee grounds could produce up to 340 million gallons of biodiesel annually.
They are planning a small scale testing program for the fuel within the next six to eight months.

More Bristol Palin Custody Case -- Straight to Video
has gone to court, demanding thatstep up as a dad and pay her some of the money he's raked in from his naked media blitz.Court documents were filed by Bristol's lawyer late Thursday afternoon in Alaska, demanding $1,750 a month infrom Levi, retroactive to the birth of son Tripp on December 27, 2008.According to the docs, obtained by TMZ, Bristol believes Levi has pulled in "in excess of $105,000 in 2009 through various media interviews and modeling related activities." The $105,000 figure is significant, because under Alaska law a non-custodial parent must pay 20% of income up to $105,000 a year -- which comes to $1,750 a month.Bristol says in her sworn statement, "I have received limited and sporadic financial assistance from Levi." Bristol says Levi has forked over only $4,400 over the 13 months of Tripp's life -- $3,000 on September 9, 2009, $1,400 on December 19.Bristol's request is for temporary support, pending a permanent child support order.Levi Johnston's manager, Tank Jones, tells TMZ Levi has paid Bristol more than $10,000 since Tripp was born. Jones also says Levi does not make money off of every interview he does, though he did not say exactly how much Levi has made.

For years I've grumbled about living in a one-party town, all Democrat all the time, where the range of acceptable opinion is “about this wide,” as a Democratic politician once expressed to me with his thumb and index finger. Maybe that changes. Maybe Seattle will have two parties: the Democrats and the Socialists.
That would not be my choice; it might be Seattle's.
Left-wing candidates run fairly often around here, usually for nonpartisan seats. Three socialists were on Seattle ballots this year in addition to Indian immigrant and college instructor Kshama Sawant. The difference is, she runs. She holds rallies. She is a sharp speaker and has a way of putting her opponents on edge. She challenged both mayoral candidates to promise a $15 minimum wage.
Her red signs are everywhere.
A rule of practical politics is that a novice should aim for an open seat or a damaged incumbent. Sawant defies that rule. This year she took on longtime City Councilmember Richard Conlin, Democrat, who was not damaged. Last year she took on state House Speaker Frank Chopp, Democrat, who has a safe seat in Seattle's 43rd district. Backed by The Stranger, Sawant made it into the top two as a write-in, identifying herself on the November 2012 ballot as “prefers Socialist Altern Party” — a Marxist party — and collected 29 percent of the vote.
Sawant appeared to be losing Tuesday night by a significant margin, not surprisingly because she had to run citywide. But if Charter Amendment 19, the districts initiative, passes, she can run next time from Capitol Hill, and maybe Seattle will have a socialist on the City Council.
And that would be a remarkable thing. Seattle has not been ill-treated by global capitalism. Its metro area has the headquarters of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Microsoft, Starbucks, Costco and Amazon. It has biotech. It has venture capital. It has sushi bars, craft distilleries and a Tesla dealership. Of the 39 counties in Washington, King County has the second-lowest rate of unemployment (San Juan is lowest) and the highest median household income.
The logical place for an anti-capitalist would be somewhere the economy left behind — downtown Yakima, maybe. But Seattle?
Sawant raised more than $100,000, most of it in the richest county in Washington. It was individual money. Among the $500-plus contributors, the most common occupation was software engineer. Her big donors included technical people who worked for Microsoft, F5 Networks, Google, Robbins and Boeing — all world-competitive companies. Sawant also went after endorsements. Who would endorse a candidate from a Marxist party? A former head of the King County Democrats did, as did an official of the Washington State Labor Council. Among donors is former state Sen. Eric Oemig, the Kirkland Democrat who in 2006 called on Congress to impeach President Bush.
Seattle has always had a left, though in the 20th century it learned to camouflage itself. Years ago, I wrote a profile of an activist who told me privately she was a socialist. If she were in Canada, she said, she could say it for publication. Not here. Later she won nonpartisan public office, where she was known as a progressive. I see her name among supporters of Kshama Sawant.
The candidate's doctrines are not mine, but I give Sawant credit for what she has done. Under the guise of nonpartisan government, Seattle is a one-party town. Sawant raised $100,000 in small donations and attacked the monopoly head-on.
I almost voted socialist.

Authorities believe the suspect is the sole person responsible for the Los Angeles International Airport shooting. At least one TSA agent is dead and a motive for the shooting remains unclear.
Clues on a possible motive for an armed assault at Los Angeles International Airport emerged Saturday, with reports that the suspect was carrying a “manifesto” associated with the antigovernment “patriot” movement and a note saying he intended to murder at least one Transportation Security Administration officer.
NBC News Paul Anthony Ciancia, in a photo from his California driver's license.
The Associated Press, quoting a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, reported that suspect Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, said in the note found in the duffel bag he carried into the airport on Friday that he wasn't targeting a specific TSA employee.
“Black, white, yellow, brown, I don't discriminate,” the note read, according to a paraphrase by the law enforcement official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
Ciancia was charged Saturday with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence at an international airport. A federal criminal complaint said that Ciancia also shot at least two other uniformed TSA employees and a civilian passenger.
It was not immediately clear why Ciancia wanted to lash out at the agency, but a leading organization that tracks U.S. hate groups and extremist organizations reported Saturday that the suspect may have been influenced by propaganda of the antigovernment “patriot” movement and fringe conspiracy theories.
As reported Friday by NBC News, the suspect was carrying anti-government literature outlining an alleged conspiracy to create a single global government, possibly prepared by a group known as the "New World Order," when he opened fire on workers with the Transportation Safety Administration, killing one and injuring several others.
A source involved in the investigation said Ciancia carried a handwritten note, a "manifesto" in essence explaining the motive behind his assault. A blog post by Mark Potok, an expert on U.S. hate groups with the Southern Poverty Law Center, added new details about the “manifesto,” which he said included references to the Federal Reserve and “fiat currency.”
Citing a knowledgeable source with ranking law enforcement contacts, Potok said Ciancia also had a note containing derogatory comments about former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.
“Ciancia's language and references seemed to put him squarely in the conspiracy-minded world of the antigovernment ‘Patriot' movement,” Potok wrote. “The New World Order refers to a longstanding conspiracy theory that today, in its most popular iteration, claims that global elites are plotting to form a socialistic 'one-world government' that would crush American freedoms. Often, the root of the alleged conspiracy is traced to the 1913 creation of the Federal Reserve and the adoption of fiat currency — paper money that is not backed by gold, as it was once was in the U.S.”
People associated with the patriot movement “see the DHS … as an enemy and even a collaborator in the New World Order conspiracy,” he added. The TSA is an agency of the DHS.
Potok said that the Southern Poverty Law Center has no records of Ciancia, and that he is not known to have "joined or participated in the activities of any radical groups."
Authorities have not indicated whether they have determined a motive for the attack.
Ciancia lived in southern New Jersey before moving to California in 2009. The source involved in the investigation said Ciancia became estranged from his father after the father became involved with a woman Ciancia did not find acceptable, and the estrangement was completed when Cicancia moved west.
Authorities said the gunman entered the secure area of the airport through a gateway normally used by travelers exiting the terminal, pulled out a semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle and opened fire on unarmed TSA workers at a checkpoint.
The criminal complaint says that Ciancia shot the TSA agent who was killed, then began walking up an escalator but returned to shoot the agent again.
Still firing, he continued walking through Terminal 3 of the airport, where police shot him several times in the chest. He was taken into custody in critical condition.
The TSA confirmed the identity of the slain officer as 39-year-old Gerardo I. Hernandez, according to an agency official. Hernandez is the first officer to have been killed in the line of duty in the agency's 12-year history.
Terminal 3 of the Los Angeles International Airport remained a crime scene Saturday as police and investigators attempted to get answers to why a 23-year-old suspect allegedly entered the airport Friday and opened fire. NBC's Miguel Almaguer reports.
Ciancia had sent a suicidal text message to his brother before the shooting and was carrying anti-government material critical of the federal government and the TSA, police said Friday.
FBI agents armed with a search warrant scoured Ciancia's home in the L.A. area late Friday, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told Reuters.
Federal officials told NBC News it was unclear whether the gunman was targeting the TSA workers or was trying to shoot his way farther into the airport. But a witness said the shooter, calmly walking through the terminal with his weapon, approached him with a one-word question.
"All he said was, 'TSA?' Just like that," Leon Saryan told MSNBC.
The shooting started about 9:20 a.m. (12:20 p.m. ET) at Terminal 3, which serves Virgin America and other airlines.
When the gunfire erupted, travelers who were waiting to snake through the security line abandoned suitcases and hit the ground.
"We were just standing there in line, and somebody started shooting," said Nick Pugh, a witness, who told NBC Los Angeles that he heard eight to 10 shots. "Everyone dropped to the floor and started crawling along the ground."
The airport said that seven people were injured in all but that the nature of all injuries wasn't clear.
Initial analysis shows that first responders arrived at the scene just 60 seconds after the first shots rang out, airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.
The shooting brought one of the nation's busiest airports to a standstill.
The Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights at LAX, where 1,500 flights take off and land every day. Passengers heading there for departing flights were stuck in colossal traffic jams. Some abandoned their rides and rolled their suitcases the last distance to the airport.
Three survivors of the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport told TODAY's Erica Hill of chaos in the moments after a man allegedly entered the airport and opened fire.
According to the LAX official Twitter account, 724 scheduled arriving flights were affected, with an estimated 67,850 passengers impacted, while some 826 scheduled departure flights were affected, with an estimated 99,200 passengers impacted.
The rest of the flights were held on the ground in Los Angeles or at their originating airports, said Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports. The ground stop applied to airports roughly west of and including Denver, officials said. It was imposed shortly after the shooting began and was lifted at 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET).
Terminal 3 had fully reopened to the public 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Saturday, Lindsey said at the news conference.
President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, the White House said in a statement. Obama called TSA Administrator John Pistole to express his condolences to the family and friends of those injured, including the TSA employee who was killed in the line of duty, a White House official said.
Richard Esposito, Erin McClam and Tracy Connor of NBC News contributed to this report.

Manipulating the Bitcoin Supply to Stabilize the Bitcoin Price
On December 6, 2014, CoinDesk published an article titled, “Can Bitcoin's Price Ever Be Stable?” In this article, the author covers the issue of Bitcoin price volatility, which, according to “experts,” is apparently one of Bitcoin's biggest obstacles to mainstream adoption. The author presented two possible courses of action the Bitcoin community could take in an effort to stabilize the Bitcoin price: marketing Bitcoin to advance demand and expand the user-base, or manipulate the Bitcoin supply. The bulk of the CoinDesk article was focused on supply-side solutions, covering suggestions from Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum, Robert Sams–a “crypto currency economics consultant”–and a Tokyo-based economics research organization.
The present article seeks to deconstruct the suggestions for Bitcoin supply manipulation and show the inadequacies that such changes to the Bitcoin protocol would produce. To preface the arguments presented below, I would like to make it clear that I am not disparaging CoinDesk nor the author of the aforementioned article. My criticisms are directed only towards the idea of Bitcoin supply manipulation as a price stabilization mechanism–the CoinDesk article is merely my source for the arguments advanced by the people listed above.
People Do Care About the Bitcoin Supply Because of Marginal Utility
Vitalik Buterin, the Founder of the Ethereum project, believes that using the Bitcoin supply to stabilize the Bitcoin price is possible and desirable because the amount of currency in circulation is a non-issue to people that use the currency:
My view is that no one cares about supply (how many people even know how many US dollars there are in circulation?). People do care about price, so stabilising price is more important, and that requires having the supply be adjustable based on price via some metric.
To reiterate, Buterin believes that the Bitcoin supply can be manipulated to stabilize the Bitcoin price because the size of the supply does not influence the way people view and use Bitcoin, or any currency for that matter. They do, however, take the Bitcoin price into account when formulating their opinions on the digital currency, so creating a stable purchasing power for Bitcoin would bring more people into the market.
There is a fundamental flaw in the reasoning behind Buterin's justification for adding a supply-adjusting mechanism to the Bitcoin protocol, though. The price of a good–any good, be it a novel trinket or a global currency–has a direct relationship with the supply of that good because of marginal utility. In other words, the Bitcoin price and its supply are related to each other because people actually do care about the Bitcoin supply.
There is no mathematical equation or magical force that determines the Bitcoin price based on its supply. There is nothing that says, “an increase in the money supply by X% will always lead to a Y% decrease in the Bitcoin price.” Rather, the relationship the Bitcoin price has with supply is based on how changes in supply affect demand, which in turn is solely determined by the subjective valuations of individual actors on the market. This economic truism derives from the law of marginal utility, which states that the value of a marginal unit of a good is determined by the highest, subjectively valued utility that must be forgone if that marginal unit is lost.
To put marginal utility in simple terms, human beings have infinite demands and finite resources with which they can satisfy their demands. It follows, then, that not all of man's demands can be satisfied, and each person must allocate their scarce resources towards the satisfaction of wants that are most urgent to him/her. Therefore, if John has $10, he will use the first dollar to buy food and drink, the second dollar will go towards shelter, the third for clothes, etc., until the most urgent demand that can be satisfied by the tenth dollar is the desire for the latest video game. If John loses $1, he will only be able to satisfy his ninth most urgent demand, and will forego the purchase of the video game. On the other hand, if John gains $1, he will be able to purchase one more thing that is less valuable to him than the video game. Essentially, the more money that is available in an economy, the fewer people value it, and they will buy more things, which drives up prices and lowers the purchasing power of money. The opposite is true as well, the less money in an economy, the more valuable it becomes, and you buy less things, which increases the purchasing power of money.
Thus, the notion that no one cares about the money supply is simply untenable. Buterin mistakenly ignored the demand side when he made the statement that no one cares about the money supply. The fact that the quantity of money in circulation does have a direct connection to the purchasing power and foreign exchange rate of the currency in question means that the law of marginal utility must be true, and people do indeed factor supply into their valuations, even if it is not always glaringly obvious. If they did not do so, then a change in the supply of Bitcoin–or any other currency–would have no effect on the purchasing power whatsoever, and the method of supply manipulation would be totally useless for stabilization purposes.
Bitcoin Supply Manipulation Won't Stabilize the Bitcoin Price, but it Will Create Stable Bitcoin Inflation
Since the relationship between Bitcoin supply and price are dependent upon subjective valuations, it is also true that it is impossible to precisely measure the effect any change in supply will have on the Bitcoin price. Valuations cannot be cardinally measured, and they will not change in the same way in every single instance of a supply change. Therefore, an expansion or contraction in the Bitcoin supply would produce a change in valuations that would either fall short of the price target or exceed it. Additionally, the initial positive or negative shift in valuations could produce a chain reaction in which the price crashes far below or soars far above the desirable level determined by mathematical calculations. These chain reactions and their resulting busts and booms would only serve to increase Bitcoin price volatility, rather than stabilize it.
Furthermore, the Institute of Economic Research, a Tokyo based economic think tank, admitted that their proposed mechanism of regulating the Bitcoin supply did not contain a way to contract the supply, it could only be expanded. Without a way to decrease the supply, Bitcoin would constantly inflate and would never be truly stable.
So how could a program decrease the Bitcoin supply? Since there is no central issuer of Bitcoin, there is never a point in time where units of the currency are not owned by a private individual. Therefore, this supply-regulating mechanism would have to remove bitcoins from individual wallets in order to decrease supply. But does that method not seem eerily similar to the the actions taken by Cyprus, in which the government removed funds from the bank accounts of its citizens without their permission? Many citizens of Cyprus turned to Bitcoin to secure their wealth during that time; now, ironically, people within the Bitcoin community are proposing an addition to the protocol that would expand the Bitcoin supply, while only being able to contract the supply by stealing money from Bitcoin users! And since valuations are constantly changing, and the Bitcoin supply would have to constantly shrink and grow to keep pace with valuations, everyone would be in constant threat of having their bitcoins taken from them by the supply-regulation mechanism. Surely, no one can reasonably expect that people will continue–or even start–using Bitcoin when there is a possibility that their bitcoins can be instantly removed from their wallets and destroyed at any time, without warning. The uncertainty involved in such a scheme would far surpass any uncertainty caused by a fluctuating Bitcoin price.
Another possible way to regulate the Bitcoin supply, that was not mentioned in the CoinDesk article, would be to implement a system that limits or increases block rewards for miners based on the Bitcoin price. If the price decreases to an undesirable level, block rewards will be reduced–thereby reducing the rate of increase in the Bitcoin supply–until the price rises to the target level. If the price goes too high, block rewards will be increased to bring the price down, and will be tapered off once the target price is reached. However, such a system would require a complete overhaul of the code that would completely alter the inner workings of the Bitcoin mining process. That task could even prove to be impossible. Such a system would undoubtedly create periods of time where Bitcoin miners would have to rely on transaction fees more heavily than block rewards. This inevitable reliance would lead to miners decreasing the Bitcoin block size, limiting the number of possible transactions and scaling down the Bitcoin network. This periodic down-scaling would become increasingly problematic as the Bitcoin user base continues to grow.This solution would also be temporary, since it would be totally ineffective once the entire supply of bitcoins has been mined
The only option for stabilization that is left, then, is the steady increase of the Bitcoin supply. Essentially, this supply-regulating addition to the Bitcoin protocol would have to employ inflation targeting as the only viable means of supply manipulation. But how would Bitcoin be any different from a fiat currency at that point? What would the difference be between a US dollar that depreciated by 2% every year and a Bitcoin that depreciated by 2% every year? Was Bitcoin not created as the antithesis to the inflationary banking system? I believe that it would be very hard to drum up support from the Bitcoin community for a project that would constantly devalue the digital currency. Moreover, a steadily inflating Bitcoin supply, or at least one that modifies the schedule of Bitcoin creation that has been set since it's inception, would not be stabilization in the way that the “experts” in the CoinDesk article mean it to be. Instead, it would be stabilization in that the Bitcoin price would embark upon a stable decline; rather than maintaining a stable purchasing power, there would be an uncertain depreciation that Bitcoin users would need to attempt to factor into their expectations and valuations for the future.
Conclusion – Bitcoin Manipulation Would Be Harmful
As we can see, the difficulties involved in implementing a system that regulated the Bitcoin supply would be immense, and the benefits would be insignificant, if any existed at all. That being said, it seems far more expedient to make no changes to the Bitcoin supply and allow the market to run its course. Bitcoin is only volatile because its market is so small; price swings can be set in motion by the actions of one individual with a moderate amount of wealth. As Bitcoin's user base grows organically, the number of people contributing to the fluctuations in price, via buying bitcoins, or selling them, will increase, and one person's valuations will have much less of an impact than they do now. Bitcoin price volatility will then become more stable, which will encourage more people to invest, thereby increasing the user base and further lowering volatility. This positive feedback loop is all Bitcoin needs to get rid of its wild volatility…no supply manipulation is necessary.
There is no sense in rushing the progression of Bitcoin, especially if doing so creates unnecessary problems. If Bitcoin truly is as revolutionary and innovative as we in the Bitcoin community believe it to be, then it will have no problem with expanding its user base, and thereby reducing price volatility. Making the Bitcoin supply flexible, and essentially limitless, will produce all of the economic difficulties outlined above, and will eliminate the original purpose of creating a digital monetary system that solves the inflationary problems of the current banking system.
“There is no reason to paralyze these hard-working people for one year with red tape and more red tape,” said Ford, as he pointed to Porter CEO Robert Deluce. “They want their jets, and they want their extension now, and there is no reason why we can't do it.”
Mayor Rob Ford 's push for a conditional approval of Porter Airlines jet expansion plan failed to gain liftoff, with the executive committee voting instead to slow down the process.
But the executive committee heeded the advice of city staff, voting 8-4, against the mayor's motion. City staff warned that the city doesn't have enough information to recommend lifting the jet ban and extending the runway by as much as 200 metres at each end.
In a campaign-style speech, Ford compared his proposal to the push to contract out garbage or kill the vehicle registration fee, when people argued it simply couldn't be done.
If city council follows the executive committee's lead, which was 11 to 1 in favour of staff recommendations, it means the city could begin negotiations on an agreement that could eventually result in a decision on jets at the island airport, but not in this term of council.
The executive committee added the stipulation that negotiations should include the demand that jet-powered aircraft make up no more than 25 per cent of daily flights.
Last April, Porter's Deluce announced his plan to grow from a regional airline flying turboprops to new jets that would fly to destinations farther afield like Los Angeles and Vancouver and Miami.
Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly, a big airport proponent, said the city staff report can lead to the introduction of jets. “There is a way forward, there is a path to a goal most of us want, and I do.”
Porter has placed a conditional order for 12 Bombardier CSeries jets, which are still in the flight testing stage, and not expected to enter service until the second half of 2015.
Deluce has pushed for a swift decision because Porter must begin to put down non-refundable deposits beginning in April.
Deluce said Porter was pleased to see the staff report go ahead, but said they will need to study the timelines and see how they can be accommodated. He wouldn't say whether Porter would be pushing for approval in principle at city council, but said the framework can lead to an approval.
"We will assess the timelines, and figure that out, and how we can make adjustments."
Jets are currently banned under a 1983 tripartite agreement between the city, federal government and Toronto Port Authority, the federal agency that runs the airport. The agreement can be amended, and the runway extended, if all three parties agree.
Without some assurances of some sort of approval, Deluce said Porter would be reluctant to risk its funds.
But city officials warned politicians that it would be a “very big mistake” if they granted a conditional approval.
“Quite emphatically, we do not have enough information,” deputy city manager John Livey said, urging councillors to put off a final decision until after the city hammers out some firm commitments and receives specific details from the Toronto Port Authority and Transport Canada, likely in early 2015.
“I think it would be a very big mistake of this council to make an approval in principle, and lose my leverage (in negotiations),” Livey said. “I think you, as members of council, would regret having made that decision.”
But Ford doesn't want to delay decision-making until after the election, especially because the makeup of council could change after October's vote.
During questioning, Ford suggested to Livey that approval could certainly be done conditionally for Porter's expansion plan, which calls for the lifting of a jet ban and expanding the runway by as much as 200 metres at each end.
But Livey stood his ground, insisting: “I do not believe so. I think it would be a big mistake for the city of Toronto … I don't see how you can do it.”
The executive committee, which began early in the morning and dragged late into the night, heard from more than a hundred people, both opponents and proponents of Porter's airport expansion plan, who lined up to share their views.
For hours, speaker after speaker came to the council chambers to plead their case. Some were big names like former mayor David Crombie and Waterfront Toronto CEO John Campbell, who warned about scale, and urged councillors not to let the airport dominate the waterfront.

As the media elites roll their eyes and sigh at people who deny the apparently inevitable approach of traumatic climate change, there's one category of denial they always endorse: a liberal bias in the "news." Chest-pounding journalistic activism defines the Trump era, and yet shameless journalists still claim media bias is a myth.
James Warren, a former managing editor and chief of the Chicago Tribune Washington, D.C., bureau, now works at The Poynter Institute for media studies (or media denial?). He posted a commentary on Nov. 20 headlined "How Mega-Media Deals Further Erode the Myth of a 'Liberal' Media."
Liberals made fun of Mitt Romney when he claimed that "corporations are people," but they subscribe to the cartoonish idea that "corporations are all conservative." Corporations have a profit motive, so that somehow inexorably translates to Republican propaganda?
Rupert Murdoch is looking at unloading some of his Hollywood assets, and among the suspected potential buyers are The Walt Disney Co. (ABC) and Comcast Corp. (NBC). To Warren, this somehow heralds a new era of "not just unceasing consolidation but the unceasing influence of folks of distinctly conservative ideology." The Murdochs explore selling off assets, and that's conservative consolidation?
Not only that, Warren says the "caricature" of a liberal media is "dubious" and can be rebutted by the fact that the "aggressively conservative" Sinclair Broadcasting Group "is primed to become the biggest local TV broadcaster." Yet Sinclair stations are routinely airing network news and entertainment content from ... ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
Warren then rounds up academics who sound like they never read or watch the liberal media. Matthew Baum, the Marvin Kalb professor of global communications at the Harvard Kennedy School, claims that conservatives "mostly point to the political views of journalists at mainstream media outlets, who tend to lean Democratic." He adds: "Of course, the core journalistic norm of balance and objectivity run directly counter to that. So at minimum it isn't obvious why personal political views would trump professional norms." He then argues that some "research" shows that "news reporting tends to reflect the interests of ownership," so that predicts "a more pro-conservative bias."
It's official: This professor sounds dumber than a grade schooler.
He seems to have ignored every story written or broadcast over the last two years about President Donald Trump and his allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic voters, as the "professional norms" have included demeaning Trump and the Republicans as a dangerously ignorant gang shredding democracy.
Warren then cites Danny Hayes, a political scientist at George Washington University who doubles down on the idiocy. "The debate about ideological bias in the media is not productive at all," he says. That's true ... if you're a liberal who wants the average (and, apparently, ignorant) media consumer to think the news is objective. Hayes insists "the social science research finds virtually no evidence in the mainstream media of systematic liberal or conservative bias."
Hayes should be teaching geology because, clearly, he is living under a rock. We've been churning out daily evidence of a dramatic liberal bias in the "objective" news media for 30 years, and this "scientist" in Washington, D.C., thinks there's "virtually no evidence"?
This is a little like arguing that "research" shows there's virtually no evidence of pro football players kneeling during the national anthem this season. Everyone's seen it. No one is fooled. The only fool is the one who thinks denying the obvious just might work.
DESTIN, Fla. — The SEC's spring meetings wrapped up Friday with a strong parting shot by conference commissioner Mike Slive.
He warned that the SEC would be prepared to pull out of NCAA Division I and form a new NCAA division if the five power conferences don't receive autonomy to set their own rules on certain matters, including benefits for athletes.
The threat seemed to be aimed at the Division I board of directors, which is scheduled to vote in August on an autonomy plan for the 65 schools of the SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and Pac-12.
“If it doesn't pass, the next move would be to go to a ‘Division 4,'” Slive said. “It's not something we want to do.”
But he made it clear the status quo is not an option for the SEC, which believes the NCAA's current governance structure enables schools from smaller leagues to thwart the will of the major conferences.
“We want the ability to have autonomy in areas that have a nexus to the well-being of student-athletes,” Slive said. “I am somewhat optimistic it will pass, but if it doesn't, our league would certainly want to move to a Division 4. My colleagues (in other power conferences), I can't speak for anybody else, but I'd be surprised if they didn't feel the same way.”
Slive said members of a new division would have the ability to create their own rules, just as schools in Divisions I, II and III currently do.
Even if in a new division, SEC teams would want to continue to participate in NCAA championship events, including the basketball tournament, with schools that remained in Division I, Slive said.
The push for autonomy grew out of the five wealthiest conferences' frustration about the difficulty of getting their agendas passed by the full Division I membership. The failure to get approval for $2,000-per-year stipends for athletes, first proposed in 2011 but never enacted because small schools with lesser resources outnumber large schools with massive resources, exacerbated the tensions. There are 351 schools in Division I, each with one vote.
The restructuring move, not coincidentally, coincides with serious threats to college sports' business model: a number of lawsuits by current and former athletes and a unionization effort at Northwestern.
The autonomy plan defines certain areas in which the five leagues could collectively chart their own course, including rules regarding financial aid, other benefits, transfers, insurance, coaching personnel and time demands on athletes. If the plan passes, SEC officials say their first priority would be to provide athletes with stipends that cover the difference between the value of a scholarship and the full cost of college attendance.
“I do believe this is a historic moment,” Slive said. “And if we don't seize the moment, we are going to make a mistake.”
He said the SEC hasn't yet mapped out the details of a new NCAA division and hopes it doesn't have to do so.
“I'm optimistic we're not going to go to the Division 4,” he said, adding ominously, “If in August the board rejects the (autonomy plan), you should call me up.”

BOZEMAN (AP) — A jury in Montana heard opening arguments Wednesday in the case of a mother who is suing her health care providers because they failed to diagnose her unborn daughter's cystic fibrosis, denying her a chance to have an abortion.
Kerrie Evans of Gardiner is seeking nearly $14.5 million in damages from Park Clinic in Livingston, Billings Clinic's Bozeman OB/GYN, nurse practitioner Peggy Scanson and Dr. William Peters — including $10 million for her daughter's medical and psychological care. The girl, who's nearly 6, has a severe form of cystic fibrosis.
The case lays bare an emerging medical ethics struggle. Lawsuits dealing with so-called wrongful births were recently before judges in Washington state and Oregon, while a dozen states prohibit such legal claims.
Umbilical cord theft a huge loss to young mother
Jurors are being asked to determine whether Evans expressed concern about cystic fibrosis during her first prenatal visit, which she says she did. Attorneys for her medical providers said she spoke specifically about Down syndrome and did not participate in recommended genetic counseling.
Evans sued in October 2011. Her attorney, E. Casey Magan, told jurors that a systemic failure led to the lack of diagnosis and the girl needing extensive and expensive medical care for the rest of her life.
Magan said Scanson, the nurse practitioner, did not offer Evans blood screening to determine whether she was a carrier for the disease and the doctor did not ask whether she received genetic counseling. Evans also had difficulty contacting genetic counselors, the attorney said.
“Your job is to fix, help and make up for this error,” Magan said.
In response, Park Clinic and Scanson said the mother only expressed concern about Down syndrome and did not request testing for cystic fibrosis.
It is an inherited disease in which the cells that produce mucus instead produce thick and sticky fluid that damages the lungs and digestive system. While each case is different, many patients now live to be adults with proper treatment and care.
The doctor spoke with Evans about cystic fibrosis and other genetic issues because she had not gone through genetic counseling, said Lisa Speare, an attorney for Peters. She said he will testify that he explained the process and that she declined a blood test to determine if she was a carrier for the disease.
Both parents would have to be carriers for a child to have a 25 percent chance of having cystic fibrosis. The screening results are needed to determine what mutation of the disease a lab should test for, Speare told jurors.
“Dr. Peters did not give (the girl) cystic fibrosis,” the attorney said. “She was either going to be born with cystic fibrosis or (she) was not going to be born.”
The life expectancy for someone with the disease is approaching 40, and medical advancements are occurring all the time, said Julie Lichte, Scanson's attorney.
Evans' daughter is attending school, participating in gymnastics and has received all the recommended medical care.
“It's far from the death sentence or life not worth living that some would have you believe,” Lichte said.
In related cases, the Washington State Court of Appeals upheld a $50 million verdict last fall in the case of a couple whose son was born with severe birth defects due to a genetic disorder that the parents specifically asked that he be screened for. Lab mistakes led to incorrect information being given to the parents.
The Oregon Court of Appeals said last month that the parents of two boys with muscular dystrophy can proceed with an $11 million lawsuit, in which they argue they never would have conceived another child if doctors treating their oldest son had diagnosed his muscular dystrophy in a timely manner.

In the fortieth anniversary year of Philip K Dick's fortieth novel, Eli Lee finds a prescient and poignant work of grief, less concerned with sci-fi predictions of the future than with exorcising the ghosts of the past and confronting the quiet horror of addiction in the present
“Everything in A SCANNER DARKLY I actually saw. I mean, I saw even worse things than I put in A SCANNER DARKLY. I saw people who were reduced to a point where they couldn't complete a sentence…and this was permanent, this was for the rest of their lives. Young people. These were people maybe 18 and 19, and you know, it was like a vision of hell. And I vowed to write a novel about it sometime.” – Philip K. Dick
A Scanner Darkly was Philip K Dick's fortieth novel, and it's one of his best-known works. It's paranoid, disturbing and dystopian, but it wasn't a vision of the future – it was a memoir.
Its main character, undercover narcotics agent, Bob Arctor, lives in a California that feels straight out of the early ‘70s, although we're told the novel is set in 1994. When Arctor tries to infiltrate the supply chain of a drug called Substance D, he becomes addicted to it – his own supplier, Donna, is the woman he loves. His friends and housemates are all addicts, too. The plot ramps up when his police colleagues, from whom his identity is protected, ask him to run surveillance on himself, which is no-one's idea of a good time: whenever he's not on Substance D, he's watching videos of himself on it.
Substance D is basically speed. For a long time, this was Dick's drug of choice (I've written before about how you can conjure up an image of him at his desk, furiously typing, blinds drawn to block out the South California sun. He said he could turn out 68 pages of prose a day when he was on speed). Substance D is especially nasty, though. It destroys the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain, so that they first function independently and then compete, destroying any coherent idea of the self. In the case of Bob Arctor, it means that the addict self and the narc self eventually become unrecognisable to one another.
Dick denied that he based Arctor on himself, but their situations are strikingly similar: after his fourth wife Nancy left him, in 1970 – taking their daughter Isa with her – he said, “I got mixed up with a lot of street people, just to have somebody to fill the house. She left me with a four bedroom, two-bathroom house and nobody living in it but me. So I just filled it with street people and I got mixed up with a lot of people who were into drugs.” Arctor, too, had a family, but found himself alone and involved in drugs. “And then I just took amphetamines,” Dick says. “I have never ever taken hard drugs. But I was in a position to see what hard drugs did to people, what drugs did to my friends…” In A Scanner Darkly there's a strong sense of “how did I get here?” – that this isn't where Arctor is meant to be. It's likely Dick thought this about himself after the end of his marriage, too. When he was writing it, his then-wife Tessa would find him at his desk in tears.
By the time he wrote A Scanner Darkly, Dick was clean. He also had a horrific rehab experience in Canada which gave him the idea for ‘New Path', the rehab organisation in the novel. Before, he would knock out up to four novels a year, but he worked on draft after draft of Darkly for four years. It was different; it required him to wrestle with a devastating period in his life and create something that would help him come to terms with it. Perhaps because it was less of a flight of imagination than other novels he'd written, this fidelity to reality forced him to slow down, get it right. Its depth and density reflect this. Also, its timeless truths about drug addiction and perfect evocation of the grotty southern California of the late ‘60s/early ‘70s make it a canonical drugs novel.
Post-war, two ways of writing about drugs emerged: in the early ‘50s, on the one hand there was William Burroughs, unnerving and brazen about heroin addiction in Junkie. On the other, there was Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception, recommending a nice afternoon listening to Mozart, staring at some flowers and dropping a soupçon of mescalin. In the early ‘60s the Huxleyian narrative of blissful transcendence dominated – his 1962 novel Island is the ultimate pro-psychedelics story. Alan Watts' Joyous Cosmology came out the same year; Leary, Alpert and Metzner published The Psychedelic Experience soon after. But by the end of the decade, these beatific ideals had collapsed. There was acid burnout – a move towards heroin, speed and cocaine. In the background, there was Nixon's war on drugs and the Vietnam War. When Dick wrote A Scanner Darkly, he wasn't alone in charting the cultural wreckage of the late ‘60s – in Joan Didion's era-defining The White Album, she writes that when she was admitted to a psychiatric clinic in Santa Monica, her symptoms did not seem to her “an inappropriate response to the summer of 1968”.
Even so, the characters in A Scanner Darkly are recognisable today. Dick's addicts are paranoid, wired and desperate. When they're high they sit around shooting the shit, which is often very funny. Dick believed it to be both his saddest and most humorous work; a great deal of the novel is just them talking drug-addled rubbish at one another (Dick was also proud of the novel's “very funny suicide scene”). Some of them have a grimly recognisable entrepreneurial spirit, too. Arctor's smart-ass housemate Barris says at one point, “I've got a temporary lab set up at the house…watch me extract a gram of cocaine from common legal materials purchased openly at the 7-11 food store for under a dollar total cost.” Homespun drug production? Distinct shades of Breaking Bad there.
But it's not just a novel about drug addiction. Dick was always spilling over with beliefs, questions and epiphanies. A Scanner Darkly races back and forth between depicting the nervy, brutal shape of drug abuse and Bob Arctor slowly losing his grip on his identity, trying to understand why it insists on being elusive and unstable. This instability is, of course, directly linked to the way in which Substance D causes – as Dick says, wonderfully – “organic brain damage producing split-brain dysfunction and a tragic parody of bilateral hemispheric parity”. But it also connects to a far greater set of ideas Dick was exploring, primarily metaphysical, and especially so as he wrote this.
Dick was an enormously wide-ranging reader and thinker – apparently he pored over his giant set of encyclopaedias (he would have loved the internet). But his reading suggests a certain wayward solipsism, which might be necessary, I guess, if – as he was – you're busy creating your own cosmology. He read especially widely in mysticism, theology and spirituality, and as he tumbled further into this realm, there's a sense that whilst the outside world deeply informed his work, what really lit him up was the construction of his own metaphysics. As much as he was anchored in the now (and in A Scanner Darkly this is especially true), he was also working out his own fantastically idiosyncratic responses to the kinds of abstractions that have been asked forever, most especially who am I? And is this reality the only reality?
Dick's novels always pulsate between possible selves and possible realities. He was open-minded and in earnest. But in the case of A Scanner Darkly, in which the other self and the other reality are created by Substance D, all further possibilities are foreclosed. The only self is the disintegrated drug addict, the only reality their collapsed horizon. Everything implodes inside this paranoid subjectivity. It's fascinating – in this novel alone, Dick shuts down a question he would normally push to the weirdest possible limits; it says an awful lot about the extent to which it stands out from the rest of his work.
In the early months of 1974, whilst writing the novel, Dick had a set of visions which formed the basis for his VALIS trilogy, and are also intricately detailed in his collected journals, ‘The Exegesis of Philip K Dick'. (Robert Crumb also turned them into a comic.) Based on the date, he called them the ‘2-3-74' visions. These events convinced him – amongst much else – that there was another being within him: a first-century Christian called Thomas. Dick also came to believe, in all seriousness, that Anaheim, where he lived, was very clearly also first-century Rome or Palestine; that they were one and the same, and the two thousand years between them did not exist.
He was pretty confident about being Thomas and about his new interpretation of spacetime. As the PKD scholar Erik Davis remarks, “Dick dived into the deep end of the pool of weird”. He had ruptured reality and there was no looking back. As it stood, aspects of 2-3-74 had also been foreshadowed in his earlier writing, which made it all the more convincing. Through these visions, which refuted the idea of a single reality and a single identity, he barrelled towards a feeling of transcendence; towards something mystical and sacred that could eclipse everything that came before. You can see this play out in his novels – characters enter a process – a difficult struggle (just like Dick's himself, which went on until he died of a stroke in ‘82) – to break free from the spell, or the entrapment, of their reality and reach something like salvation. It's almost a Dick dialectic: reality plus rupture equals redemption.
A Scanner Darkly doesn't do this, though. There's no redemption, no light in the dark. This means that even as Dick was elaborating an entire metaphysics in his diaries, in Darkly, he was, very simply, writing his grief. “It is a very sad novel and very sad things happen to very good people,” he says. This makes it all the a more historical record, or even more accurately, a novel about drug addiction.
Since A Scanner Darkly then has no investment in predicting 1994, there's no point asking what it got right about the future. Its few elements of science fiction, such as the ‘scramble suit' that allows Bob to hide his identity in order to spy on himself (brilliantly depicted in Richard Linklater's 2006 film adaptation, by the way); and the holographic projections of his house that he also uses to monitor himself, are background notes. Dick's editor, Judy Del Ray, had to push him to make the novel more convincingly science fictional. “Judy, you know damn well the book is about the ‘60s,” he told her. Even so, he almost can't help but write prescient novels. Even his novels were uncanny precogs – how meta.
In A Scanner Darkly, legal and governmental forces pretend to rehabilitate addicts, but inevitably, in this pessimistic universe, they enable them. The circulation of Substance D represents the epitome of a corrupt system, and making this point in the ‘70s might have made Dick seem a bit fringe, a bit of a conspiracy nut, but today he's an anti-authority touchstone – a harbinger for exposing how corruption is at the very centre of things. There's also, of course, the fact that surveillance is omnipresent in the novel, and that Bob Arctor watches and reports on himself. Dick's surveillance dreams are the reality of social control today. You could also, if you want, say that Arctor's split into two is an analogue of the real-life self and the self on the internet; the former watches the latter, and the latter is, of course, enmeshed in a web of monitoring. You could even go further and say that Substance D, causing self-surveillance and self-estrangement, is a symbol of identity dissociation in the same way the internet is.
But this is all conjecture. Really, Dick just wanted to talk about the friends he lost to drug abuse, and the pain it caused. In the Author's Note at the end of the novel, Dick says, “This has been a novel about some people who were punished entirely too much for what they did.” There's a list of his friends who have either died or been damaged by drug addiction and he says, “I loved them all”. (He puts himself in that list too – to Phil: permanent pancreatic damage.)
Usually, when we think of Philip K Dick we think of his astonishing foresight. He played with simulacra, fractured realities and multiple selves in ways no-one else did and that uncannily anticipated the postmodern condition. The transformation of a novel like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep into the stunning noir of Blade Runner has also made him synonymous with the hypnotic aesthetic of future-dreaming late capitalism, which is, in fact, far removed from his grubby, shambolic novelistic worlds. His prescience and the aesthetic vision we've superimposed on him are the reasons why he's so popular; he dreamed up the myths of the future and we have filled them out, made them real.
Yet I stick to what I've always believed about him – that pretty much the driving force of his writing was to make us empathise with others and with their suffering. A Scanner Darkly was, as he says, “from the deepest part of my life and heart” – it is bound up with his own experience of loss, grief and addiction. Yes, Dick was a brilliant thinker, but it's about time we gave more space to the other aspect of his brilliance – that he was also fully in touch with his own humanity, and able to turn it into such dark, funny and visionary novels.

Two brothers, aged 4 and 10, and a 32-year-old woman have died following a crash on the M6 in Staffordshire.
Their car overturned on a northbound lane between junctions 14, near Stafford, and 15, near Stoke-on-Trent, about 11:25 GMT.
The driver, believed to be the boys' mother, and another woman in the car were seriously injured.
They were taken to hospital and were said by West Midlands Ambulance Service to be in a "stable" condition.
Staffordshire police appealed for witnesses to the incident, involving a red Ford Focus, to contact them.
Earlier, the ambulance service said three children had died.
In a revised statement a spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: "Crews arrived to find a single vehicle that had crashed and overturned.
"Two children and an adult that were travelling in the vehicle suffered serious injuries. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of ambulance crews, nothing could be done to save the two boys and one woman, and they were confirmed dead at the scene.
"Two other adult women travelling in the car, both received emergency treatment at the scene for their injuries and were transferred by land ambulances to University Hospital of North Staffordshire on blue lights for further treatment."
The northbound stretch of M6 was shut for several hours.
Three ambulances, three paramedic officers, a doctor and two Midland Air Ambulances attended the scene.
'Difficult circumstances'
Staffordshire Police had initially said "several vehicles" had been involved, causing "multiple fatalities", but later confirmed it was a one-vehicle crash.
The ambulance service added: "All emergency services personnel worked seamlessly together at the scene in exceptionally difficult circumstances. Unfortunately, the outcome was not the one everyone would have hoped for."
Image caption The M6 northbound was closed after the accident but re-opened before 16:45 GMT
The southbound section of the motorway was initially closed but re-opened mid-afternoon.
The M6 is among a number of key routes that have been struck by weather-related delays in recent days amid heavy rain.
Earlier in Hampshire, two people were killed in a car crash, police said.
The collision happened on the B3349, Odiham Road, near Basingstoke, and police were notified at about 10:05 GMT.
A third person, believed to be the driver of the vehicle, was seriously injured.
The fight against Ebola received a desperately needed monetary boost Wednesday, with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announcing a $50 million donation.
In a statement, the foundation said it would release flexible funds to U.N. agencies combatting the disease, which has already killed over 2,000 people in its worst ever outbreak.
“We are working urgently with our partners to identify the most effective ways to help them save lives now and stop transmission of this deadly disease,” said Gates Foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann.
The foundation said it has already committed $10 million out of the total $50 million to fighting Ebola — $5 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency operations and research, and another $5 million to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF to support efforts in the worst-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. In addition, it will also pledge $2 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
There have been promising developments in the search for a cure, with a new vaccine reportedly producing positive results. However, the rapidly accelerating spread of Ebola has caused the WHO to project that over 20,000 people will be infected by October.

from Scott Olsen:
I was there. When it came down to it we decided that I would not be arrested. One of the reasons for that was so I could upload and distribute this video I took within minutes of us entering. This is before the march and media made it up here. In the video you will see Obama's staffers push us when we tried to move chairs so we could sit in the middle of the office. I got pushed which made me drop my phone and then a man brandished a chair against me.
8/17, 11:30am: Livestream replaced with video clip recorded last night. Six of the seven people, including veterans, were arrested during the nonviolent sit-in. The office was shut down for the night.
11pm Eastern: Scott Olsen and members of Iraq Veterans Against War are currently sitting in an Obama Campaign Headquarters in Oakland demanding Pfc. Manning's release. Dozens of supprters are also rallying outside; some police are on the scene.

Yet another round of sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear program was passed yesterday in Congress–the latest measure in what Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor said is a campaign to “tighten the economic noose” around Iran. The bill also represents another effort to pressure President Barack Obama to inch closer to Israel's “red line” on the Iranian nuclear issue.

were principal sponsors of the latest Iran sanctions bill
(Photo: AIPAC.org)
The legislation, titled the “Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012″ (H.R. 1905), passed easily in both houses of Congress. In the House, the vote was 421-6, with anti-war stalwarts like Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul speaking out against the bill. The bill was so uncontroversial in the Senate that it passed by unanimous consent. President Obama, who announced a separate set of sanctions on July 31, is expected to sign the bill, according to news reports–though he has executive discretion on how to implement the legislation.
The measure was strongly backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), who triumphantly heralded the latest sanctions as part of “the strongest set of sanctions to isolate any country in the world during peacetime.” The legislation was introduced by hardline supporters of Israel in Congress, like Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Howard Berman (D-CA).
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) (h/t Paul Mutter) explains the crux of the latest sanctions:
The bill expands sanctions on insurers dealing with Iran's energy sector; sanctions anyone affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps; expands sanctions on energy and uranium mining activities in Tehran; and freezes the assets of individuals and companies that enable Iran to repress its citizens through the use of technology. It also reduces the threshold for incurring sanctions from $20 million in annual dealings with Iran's energy sector to $5 million.
The JTA also notes this important point:
Also, for the first time in actionable legislation, the measure defines the capability of building a nuclear weapon as posing a threat to the United States.
“Capability” is the key word. The term “nuclear weapons capability”–repeated endlessly in the bill's text–is a fuzzy one.
Commenting on an earlier Iran-related bill, Kucinich said that the term was “a nebulous and undefined term that could include a civilian nuclear program.” In other words, by some readings Iran already has the “capability” to produce a nuclear weapon if it decided to (which it hasn't). Robert Wright similarly notes in The Atlantic that “the term ‘capability' is so mushy that Israel could bomb Iran tomorrow and say that it did so because, by its definition of ‘capability,' Iran was exactly a day away from possessing it!”
AIPAC and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been pressuring the US to adhere closer to their red line, and this is one way to ramp up that pressure. A separate, non-binding resolution that AIPAC pushed around its annual conference was also focused on the word “capability.”
The difference in approach between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations was on display recently when Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited Israel. Panetta emphasized that it was US policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, whereas Netanyahu emphasized the “capability” to do so. (See this Jerusalem Post article for more on this.)
And, as Phyllis Bennis noted Wednesday on Mondoweiss, the Romney campaign has “accepted the official position of his host country – Israel – which is that a nuclear capable Iran is the red line.” Romney advisor Dan Senor–whose sister runs AIPAC in Jerusalem–was explicit that Romney's position was that Israel would be justified in striking Iran if it reached the “capability” to produce a nuclear weapon.
So both Congress and the Romney campaign are marching in lockstep, putting pressure on the Obama administration to adhere to the Israeli “red line” on Iran. And you can expect more pressure: Senator Mark Kirk, the Israel lobby's go-to guy in Congress, has vowed to introduce more Iran sanctions.
RWE nPower has officially opened the £1bn Pembroke Power Station, one of Europe's largest combined cycle gas turbine plants.
A ceremony, held today in Wales to mark the opening of the 2,000MW plant, was attended by members of parliament, including Minister of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change John Hayes.
Planning permission for the station, which is expected to power 3.5m homes, was granted by the UK government in 2009.
The plant was granted a permit by the Environment Agency last November and took three years to build.
Speaking at the ceremony, Volker Beckers, RWE npower group CEO, said: "I'm delighted to welcome Pembroke Power Station into our portfolio of operational plants. This addition means RWE npower now has the largest and most efficient gas portfolio as well as the largest fleet of renewable energy technologies in the country."
Parliamentary under secretary of state for Wales Stephen Crabb welcomed the news: "With the ever-increasing demand for energy production, the UK needs new sources of power generation."
"I have no doubt that this facility will play a vital role in maintaining the UK's energy supplies for the future and make its own contribution to creating economic prosperity for Wales," Crabb added.
However, Friends of the Earth has complained to the European Commission about the plant, for which gas is supplied via a new tunnel drilled through the rock under the Milford Haven, the largest estuary complex in the UK.

Track Where your Early Backers Come From
Once your campaign goes live you will have access to the “Dashboard,” which is a place on Kickstarter to track statistics about your campaign: video views, funding totals, funding source, etc. One unique feature is the “Source of Referrer” section, which tells you from what source your backer has come from. So if a backer saw a link to your project on Facebook and clicked on it, you would know they came from Facebook. This will help you determine which sources are helping your project and which sources you need to promote to more.
Note: It doesn't tell you directly which backer came from which source, but you can keep track of that in real time if you wish by looking to see which category changed every time you get a new backer.
Find out Who your Early Backers Are
It's important to not only find out where your backers came from, but also who your early backers are. When you get a new backer, before you message them thanking them for their support, do a little quick research to find out who that person is. This person my run a blog about the industry your campaign is in, or they may be a working professional in the field. Find out who they are, and if they are someone with “pull,” kindly ask them if they could help promote your campaign. You can research most people in under a minute. Start by clicking on their name on Kickstarter. This will take you to their profile page which will sometimes include their personal or professional website listed or sometimes a city and state. Your search may end there, but don't forget, when in doubt Google the person with everything you know about them. If you can't find out anything about them, at a minimum ask every person “Can you help by sharing this campaign with a few friends?”
Create a “Give Back” Reward
When creating reward levels I would suggest a “Give Back” option: a way for backers to donate the product to someone who can use it. Our product was a camera shoulder rig, so we created an option for backers to donate a shoulder rig to a film school at a cost lower than buying one for themselves. Reasons for doing this may include helping people in need of your product who can't afford one, or giving someone who likes your product, but has no use for it themselves, an option to back the campaign. However, I found that a great reason for including a “Give Back” option is when trying to promote the page you can tell promoters (journalists, bloggers, etc.) about this option. They tend to be more receptive when they learn they can help others by promoting it. It's a win-win-win situation.
Think about “Engagement” What will keep people on the page?
A lot of articles will suggest you include a profile video, but here are the facts right from Kickstarter's blog.
If you showcase your game on conventions – you know how important it is to hold the attention of the user and make his experience playing the game trouble-free. The way people play your game during the event actually allows you to witness how people are going to play the game at home. This opens up a path to gather real-time feedback and, of course, improve the on-boarding process for the game. You can also miss some potential fans if your game does not look appealing or understandable in the first minute.
A bit of a backstory for context: The last 4 months of my life I've been spending all my spare time to develop the game with a working name “Lazy Galaxy.” It's a game where you control an evil (albeit lazy) alien race and try to conquer the universe. It's an experimental mix between RTS and clicker/incremental game: you build a base, then you send ships to space. The ships can be controlled as in RTS games, but this is not necessary. Since I've never seen something like that anywhere before (let me know if you have, I want to play this game!) – there's a challenge of introducing players to this sort of game.
This might seem like a very specific case, but I've learned a lot of stuff that is going to be useful for a lot of games. Over the last two months, I've spent a considerable development effort to ease up the introduction into the game. Here's how it went:
Experiment 1: Text Tutorials, Smaller Convention
I've actually found out that I'm going to an expo only two weeks before. The game seemed complex due to worse state of the ui in early stages of development. We knew that nobody reads texts – but how bad can it actually get? We've drawn cute mascot portraits, made the tutorials fit the narrative and made “bouncing buttons” that highlighted where the player should be clicking. We also made UI elements appear as the game progressed, instead of throwing everything at once.
Needless to say: I think only three or four people read the texts. Most people left in the first minute of the game. That's understandable. Next time you are at a convention, try looking for an unknown games with average amounts of text explanations and play them. Are you capable of going through all instructions? I think the whole event atmosphere creates a “rush” feeling, because there are plenty of things happening around you. The event escalates the dislike for text tutorials, because no one wants to sit in one place, hindered by walls of text, unbeknownst about what are they going to get in the end.
Players also often missed our bouncing button cues, even though I've made all parts of the UI appear after the relevant feature becomes necessary.
Five people left their emails at the end of the day: two of them were friendly developers. Only the remaining three of these were actually people that enjoyed the game and wanted to know more.
Experiment 2: Pictures instead of text. Propaganda posters. Arrows that show where to click.
For the next convention, GameOn, the biggest game convention in the baltic states, we understood that we needed a much better preparation. I've spent two weeks trying to figure out the best way to present information.
The first one to get added was the floating cursor helper. It showed where player needed to click, so the game would be accessible even to the players who don't know english.
The next one to go were the text: most of the texts were thrown away. Only a simple reminder of what needs to be done (i.e. gather 20 minerals). It blinked for the first two seconds to indicate that the task has changed.
Another idea was to replace the texts with iconic images, to show how the game operates and what needs to be done. To avoid making it look like a chore, we've added some sort of “propaganda” posters to the right side of instruction images. Those were designed as a reference to the real-world propaganda posters. The idea was to make a game-world feel a bit more alive and add some lore. Feeling that this should do the trick, we went to the convention with high hopes.
Success?
Actually, only partially. Twenty five interested people left their emails. Not that much, but the results are much more successful than the previous ones: we genuinely found people who were interested in the game, but I've noticed that I often had to step in and explain the core principles that I want to do. In convention, it might be OK, because people actually want to communicate with the developers directly and essentially you are the one “selling” you game idea. But imagine if they were playing my game at home? Nobody would be there to say “Hey, you can actually upgrade your buildings to increase an income.”
Here are the issues:
1) While the players stayed at the game much longer, the tutorial was unable to explain the principles of the game. The players heavily relied on the arrow pointer to show what to do. They progressed through the game, but only because the game explicitly told them what to do. They could not utilize the mechanics as those were introduced: a lot of players missed the concept of building upgrades, how those increased the flow of resources and made the gathering much easier. This is not their fault, but the fault of such design. From now on I understand that arrow/clicking tips have their place to be and are effective at directing players, but should be used with caution. The trade-off: players are able to progress, but unable to learn how to use the tools the game gives them to find solutions to their problems.
2) The images with propaganda posters / instructions got closed as annoying pop-ups. There was not much difference with text popups, although they did attract some initial attention. In the end, this did not prove to be a dependable solution. The small tasks were OK though, and people often look at them.
3) Another thing that affected the first one: the tasks were telling player what actions do they need to do instead of giving them the goals they need to achieve.
Next Steps, Solutions?
Think about the following objectives and which ones sound better:
3.1) “Build a mine” or “Establish Metal supply”
3.2) “Click on 20 asteroids to gain 20 metal” or “Gain 20 metal to start building a base”
3.3) “Research Space Travel” or “Go To Space”
I'm sure you can find out the similar action vs goal-oriented tasks in your game. After witnessing the results of the first option, the second option seems like the better choice. It needs more visual cues, but this gives players the goals they need to reach instead the actions they need to take. Instead of chewing your food in their place, you give them the opportunity to taste it. Give the opportunity to explore and experience your game, instead of letting them feel constrained.
Here's what I'm trying to do now: the game is going to have a special “Codex,” a dictionary with lore and it's going to have a special chapter. There is going to be an article for each one of those instructions (that essentially contains the scheme + propaganda poster). I'm not going to show the propaganda posters right away, the “?” button will appear next to a current objective and when player click it in case he needs help.
The leading mouse pointer goes away for most cases. It is going to be replaced by element outlines / slight shaking that will appear after some time if player struggles to complete his objective.
The small objective window is going to stay. The objectives are going to be task-focused instead of action-focused. Example: instead of “Upgrade Solar Panel,” there's going to be “Get your total energy income to 2 per second.” Essentially, allow the player to find his own solutions and feel great about this. The “feel great” part will need more work: visual cues need to be subtle, instead of “In your face, doing everything instead of you.” Hopefully, this will have better results next time.
What would you do? What do you think could work in this case?
EDIT: In case anyone is wondering, here's how the gameplay looks (explained by yours truly)
Excel is versatile by itself and VBA makes it even better by allowing us to do our own thing. Most of us use VBA to automate tasks of varying complexity – some macros are executed in a flash, but others take hours to run. While there are users who are happy with just a Msgbox “This thing is DONE!”, there are others who'd like to let the user know more about what is happening.
If you are thinking, “Hey I can see exactly what is going on, why would I need to display messages?”, you may have to consider digging into optimizing your code a little. I admit that allowing Excel to update the screen each time your macro makes a change, helps during development, but it slows down the code a lot. It is best to set the ScreenUpdating and EnableEvents properties of the Application object to False at the outset. I intend to write about the best practices in the coming weeks, but let us get back to the issue at hand.
How to control Excel's Status Bar?
The quickest way to display messages while the code is running is to use the Statusbar property of the Application object. Users can display custom messages on Excel's status bar when needed, and allow to excel to take over after their macro finishes executing. Here is a short example:
Sub StatusBarExample() 'Declaring Sub Level Variables Dim lngCounter As Long Dim lngNumberOfTasks As Long 'Initilaizing Variables lngNumberOfTasks = 1000 For lngCounter = 1 To lngNumberOfTasks 'Altering the Statusbar Property Application.StatusBar = "Executing " & lngCounter & _ " of " & lngNumberOfTasks & " | " & _ "Custom Message " & lngCounter Next lngCounter 'Letting Excel Take over the status bar Application.StatusBar = False End Sub
How to display a progress bar?
Another popular method is to deploy a UserForm and have a label control that displays a message. We may also choose to use the width property of a control and resize it as the code progresses, to display a progress bar of sorts. A fellow struggler, a good friend of mine, used to create dedicated forms for each of his macros, just to display a progress bar. That got me thinking, what if I could give my readers a generic form that they could use in all their spreadsheet applications? And I created this Form-Module combo.
How to use Struggling To Excel's Progress bar in your projects?
So here is what you need to do, to use this in your code. Download the workbook from the Downloads section below. Import the userform, ‘ufProgress‘; and the module, ‘modProgress‘, into your VBA project. You may just drag the objects and drop them into your project, in the Project Explorer window of the Visual Basics Editor. And Call the ‘modProgress.ShowProgress‘ with a few arguments. Listed below are the arguments, and their purpose:
ActionNumber – This argument denotes the number of actions that have already been performed. You may probably use a For-Loop counter here, or explicitly change it as the code progresses. TotalActions – This denotes the total number of actions you need to perform. StatusMessage – The form has a little status bar at the bottom and you can display custom messages there. ideally, a short description of the action. CloseWhenDone – Set this argument to True, to close the form automatically when ActionNumber reaches TotalActions. Hence, remember to call ShowProgress with the last ActionNumber only when that action is complete. Title – You may choose to set a custom title for the form here.
Here is an example of how to use the ShowProgress sub:
Sub TestTheBar() 'Declaring Sub Level Variables Dim lngCounter As Long Dim lngNumberOfTasks As Long 'Initilaizing Variables lngNumberOfTasks = 10000 'Calling the ShowProgress sub with ActionNumber = 0, to let the 'user know we are going to work on the 1st task. Also, set a 'title for the form Call modProgress.ShowProgress( _ 0, _ lngNumberOfTasks, _ "Excel is working on Task Number 1", _ False, _ "Progress Bar Test") For lngCounter = 1 To lngNumberOfTasks 'The code for each task goes here 'You can add your code here 'Call the ShowProgress sub each time a task is finished to 'the user know that X out of Y tasks are over, and that 'the X+1'th task is in progress. Call modProgress.ShowProgress( _ lngCounter, _ lngNumberOfTasks, _ "Excel is working on Task Number " & lngCounter + 1, _ False) Next lngCounter End Sub
Note that you can press the Abort button anytime to stop the execution. I urge you to use them in your projects and let me know if you like it.
Update
I have released an update to this progress bar. The new version does not need the Standard Code Module to animate the bar. Also, you can create multiple instances of the Progress Bar simultaneously. I recommend using that version in your code. Check it out and let me know what you think.
Check out First Class Progress Bar for all your Macros for the updated version
Downloads
I received feedback from readers who use multiple displays that the progress bar is not centered to their Excel window. They even gave me code snippets to resolve the problem; thank you all. Here is a updated version that centers the progress bar to Excel's Active Window. If you are a multi-display user, test it and let me know how it works.
Bonus
How to check whether a form is open?
And the workbook also has a simple user defined function that you can use to check if a form has been already opened.
Function isFormOpen(ByVal FormName As String) As Boolean 'Declare Function level Objects Dim ufForm As Object 'Set the Function to False isFormOpen = False 'Loop through all the open forms For Each ufForm In VBA.UserForms 'Check the form names If ufForm.Name = FormName Then 'if the form is open, set the function value to True isFormOpen = True 'and exit the loop Exit For End If Next ufForm End Function
Osiria Rose Guide: (Essential Buying and Caring Tips)
The Osiria rose is quite famous among people who specialize in gardening and enjoy bringing all sorts of exotic and gorgeous flowers into their gardens. If you've never heard of this type of rose before, but you're interested in planting some new types of flowers in your garden that will definitely be a great conversation starter, you're going to like the topic of today's article. We're going to tell you all you need to know about the Osiria rose, from a brief description, to what the best way to plant it is, and the basics of taking care of it. Finally, we're going to include some alternatives to the Osiria rose, since this one is quite difficult to find.
What Is the Osiria Rose?
If you've ever seen pictures on the internet or social media of gorgeous rose petals that come in shades of red and pink contrasted with a white reverse, then you probably already know what an Osiria rose is. It is a type of hybrid tea rose that has lovely coloration and a strong fragrance, both of which make it an asset for any garden. Even though many of the pictures you can find online are clearly enhanced for the color to look more intense, the truth is that there is a clear contrast between the exterior of the rose petals and their interior. This type of rose grows in a bush, it has dark-green leaves, and it blooms from June to November. The maximum height of a bush is around 70 inches.
The Osiria rose was hybridized in 1978 by Mr. Reimer Kordes of Germany. It was first sold in France, where it was also given the name of Osiria. The species used to create this hybrid are the Tea rose and the Hybrid Perpetual. Currently, it is quite difficult to find the Osiria rose in the United States, and also quite challenging to grow one. This is why many people are unsure whether or not to plant this type of rose, even though they are fascinated by its appearance.
How Can You Plant an Osiria Rose?
If what we've told you about its unavailability hasn't tempered your desire to plant your own Osiria roses, then let us take you through the steps that you should follow. First of all, the Osiria rose is quite high-maintenance, and it prefers full sun and well-drained areas.
You're going to have to dig a hole in the ground and then fill it with soil that is rich in nutrients and that will help the rose develop properly. Next, carefully spread the roots of the plant so that they are even. In order for the rose bush to thrive, there is a certain depth that you have to keep in mind. We advise you to keep the stem's base about 2 inches underground for best results.
After you've done that, make sure that you fill all the additional space with soil. Then, water the plant at your discretion. The Osiria rose needs plenty of watering, so remember to provide it with water at least two times a week.
Osiria Rose Care – Everything You Should Know
As we've already mentioned, it can be a challenge to take care of the Osiria rose. The main issue is the fact that this type of rose is susceptible to all kinds of pests and diseases, which is why it rarely comes off as in the pictures you find on the internet. Spider mites, aphids, leafhoppers, and caterpillars are some of the main enemies of the Osiria rose. Also, you should beware of rose rust, black spots, and powdery mildew.
Even if you take care of the Osiria rose properly, don't expect to get a lot of flowers. It is their uniqueness and beauty that draws people in, not the number of blooms it forms. Remember that it also grows quite slowly. This means that you need to have a lot of time and patience in order to get it to bloom.
Pruning
That being said, once your Osiria rose bush has developed blooms, you will also have to prune the roses, as you would any other variety. The best season to prune your roses is in spring because that is when the plant actually starts growing. Pruning helps you get healthier and richer blooms.
The main trick you should keep in mind is allowing air to circulate through the plant, which is why your roses should all have open centers. Also, try to separate any tangled branches and allow the roses plenty of space to grow and develop unencumbered. If you notice small canes or branches that are drying out, cut them off immediately. This will keep your Osiria rose bush healthy and minimize the possibility of pests impeding its growth.
Similarly, as the roses develop and bloom, pay attention to any dead roses that might be hiding amongst the healthy ones. The practice of cutting them off is what specialists call deadheading. It helps the entire plant look better, while also promoting the growth of new blooms.
Fertilizing
As any other type of rose, the Osiria rose also needs fertilizing, especially since it is so high-maintenance. We recommend a fertilizer that is created specifically for roses, such as Jobe's Organic Rose & Flower Granular Fertilizer that you can find on Amazon for $15.61. The best time to fertilize your roses is in early spring, but you should also do that in mid-summer.
We should mention that even if the Osiria rose requires more care than the typical rose variety, that doesn't mean that you should overfertilize it. Overfertilization can easily be counterproductive to your efforts. It can cause root injury, fewer blooms, and even result in the plant's death. This is why you should follow the instructions on the fertilizer package to a tee.
Osiria Rose Disease Control
Powdery mildew is one of the most common afflictions of the Osiria rose. This fungal disease tends to prefer moderate temperatures, and usually, begins by attacking the lower parts of the plant. The fungus gets its name from its appearance, with the stems and leaves of the affected plant having white spots that resemble a powder. This can be controlled by chemical fungicides – propiconazole is a popular choice. Two other options are a solution of sodium bicarbonate, or perhaps the most bio-friendly – a 1:10 milk/water solution.
All of these options work best by spraying them on the plant in the morning two times per week. The sun will have the opportunity to dry the leaves throughout the day so they are not left moist at night, where the moderated temperature and dampness provide the best dual conditions for powdery mildew to grow.
The Osiria rose is also susceptible to black spot. This fungus is also named after its appearance, producing a spattering of black, inky appearing spots on the leaves. As the disease progresses, it will also affect the stems. Unlike powdery mildew, black spot grows best in hotter temperatures. Fortunately, there are multiple synthetic fungicides to choose from – penconazole and mancozeb are two examples. For those who prioritize organic solutions, neem oil rivals the effectiveness of all the synthetics.
The optimal treatment schedule is to apply it by spraying every week to ten days during the hottest months of the year.
Rose rust is less common than powdery mildew or black spot because most roses have developed a partial resistance to it. However, when it occurs, it is usually in the spring and fall. It leaves rust-colored spots on leaves that will grow larger. A good preventative measure is to clear away leaves that have fallen in the autumn season. Often, pruning out affected leaves will stop the spread. However, if that does not work, fungicides such as tebuconazole and triticonazole will do the trick.
Osiria Rose Pest Control
The Osiria rose, like most members of its family, is susceptible to attack by aphids, leafhoppers, spider mites, and caterpillars. One problem with the spider mites and aphids is their small size. Many times, you will not notice their presence until they have already done damage.
Fortunately, as with fungal problems, there are several remedies available. One of the fungicides described above, neem oil, also defends against aphids. Horticultural oil acts as an outstanding preventive measure against several of these pests. The chemical imidacloprid, when applied to the soil, is also an effective repellent.
The presence of some common rose pests may also attract ants because they eat the honeydew that the pests produce. Therefore, ant colonies will fight to protect these other bugs from beneficial insects that may eat them. A natural ant repellent is peppermint oil. Dilute it in a 1:10 ratio with water and spray just at the base of the rose bush.
Where Can I Buy Osiria Rose Seeds?
If you want to buy Osiria rose seeds, but you don't know where you can find them, we advise you to check online. There, you can usually find Osiria seeds in packs that contain other types of rose seeds as well. For instance, you can purchase packages that contain 5 Different Colors Rare Osiria Roses or Rare Osiria Hybrid Tea Rose Seeds.
We highly recommend that you buy osiria rose seeds to add to your garden. They are absolutely stunning and will definitely grab the attention of visitors to your garden. Everyone has roses in their garden, but their roses mostly likely don't stand out like the osiria rose. Buy some seeds and start planting!

Osiria Rose Alternatives
In case you find it difficult to take care of an Osiria rose bush, but you still want to be able to enjoy a similar type of beauty and fragrance, here are some alternatives that require lower maintenance.
1. “Love” Rose
The Love rose is quite similar to the Osiria one. This means that the petals also have a more faded exterior. However, the difference is not as visible as in the case of the Osiria variety. The Love rose has deep-red flowers with a silver-white reverse. Moreover, the flowers grow in more than one flush all throughout the season. This guarantees that you will get to enjoy plenty of fragrant blooms.
2. “Wekdocpot” Rose
This Grandiflora rose is well-known for its yellowish tone that contrasts with the ruby splashed edges. Its petals are mostly golden-yellow, but the edges are what make this rose variety stand out. The ruby color seeps into the yellow tone wonderfully. Consequently, the resulted blend looks as if someone has powdered the petals with red velvet.
3. “Snowfire” Rose
The Snowfire variety is also quite similar to the Osiria rose, in that the petals also have a white backside. Even though the contrast is not as obvious in the Snowfire rose, its intense red tones definitely make up for it. Furthermore, the roses have a light fragrance and a velvet feel. They will make for a gorgeous addition to any garden.
4. “Adacopro” Rose
This is another hybrid tea rose, so it's quite obvious that it has some similarities to the Osiria rose. While the largest part of the petal is dark-red, the underside of it is not white, as in the case of the Osiria variety, but yellow. So if this sounds like something that you would like to have in your garden, you can always plant some Adacopro roses.
5. “Balprez” Rose
Finally, a rather impressive alternative to the Osiria rose is the Balprez rose. This is truly a treat for the eyes. The petals sport a beautiful mixture of yellow, gold, red, orange, and pink that will delight anyone who plants this rose variety in their garden. The flowers bloom quite heavily, and they do so in tiny clusters.
Summing Everything Up
The Osiria hybrid tea rose, while one of the most spectacular and majestic types of roses that you can plant in your garden, is both quite hard to find and difficult to take care of. However, for people who have more experience with gardening, or for people who enjoy taking risks and rejoicing in the high reward, the Osiria rose is definitely a great option.
We must advise you to keep in mind that the end result might not be what you expect since many of the available pictures of the Osiria rose are enhanced. Even so, there's no denying that this rose is one of the most beautiful ones you can find. You are definitely going to enjoy them in yourd garden, as well as the alternatives we have suggested.

Leisur­e League­s out to do the unthin­kable — help footba­ll compet­e with cricke­t in Pakist­an
KARACHI: And then there were eight.
Captains Ronaldinho and Ryan Giggs, along with a superstar cast of Robert Pires, Roberto Carlos, Nicolas Anelka, David James, Luis Boa Morte and George Boateng.
These eight players will compete in a seven-a-side exhibition match on July 8 in Karachi and July 9 in Lahore, with three players apiece lining alongside Ronaldinho and Giggs in either team.
“The national champions of the Leisure Leagues will get the unique chance of playing alongside these players,” said World Group Chief Operating Officer Ishaq Shah. “Each team can have a maximum of 10 players, with seven playing and three subs, so as many as 12 local players will rub shoulders with these eight legends of the beautiful game.”
The World Group is the company behind UK-based Leisure Leagues coming to Pakistan in the first place. “Leisure Leagues existed in three countries before; the UK, the US and the Republic of Ireland. We bought ownership for the remaining 203 countries, while also becoming a partner of the venture in the UK — where the league is headquartered. So Pakistan is the fourth country in the world where Leisure Leagues have been introduced. We plan to take it to the Middle East and Europe after this.”
Leisure Leagues bring another ex-Arsenal footballer to Pakistan
The grand exhibition match will be Leisure Leagues' magnum opus but Ishaq insisted the initiative has already seen more than expected interest from the country's youth. “We have brought something truly unique to the football-loving youth of Pakistan and it's great to see them respond in such enthusiastic fashion,” he said. “We provide them with grounds that are of an international standard, we provide them with footballs of the highest qualities as well as a trained referee, while also having complete first-aid kits at hand in case an injury takes place.”
The facilities provided may well be better than anything previously available to the general public, but it does come at a steep price. “Each 30-minute match costs Rs5,000. Since there are two teams of 10 players apiece, that makes it Rs250 a person.”
Most futsal and football grounds across the country can be booked at half the price for double that time.
Ishaq knows the price may not be everybody's cup of tea but made no bones about this being a business venture first and foremost. “If you do something as non-profit or start depending on donations, then you can soon lose interest in it,” he said. “We want to make this a commercial success as well in order to ensure that it is a self-sustaining project. That way we can ensure the country and its football fans benefit from this in the long run.”
And football fans do have a lot to look forward to if World Group's plans for Leisure Leagues do come to fruition. “This [the Ronaldinho and Friends exhibition match] is not a one-time thing,” promised World Group President Shahzeb Trunkwala, also present in the lavish meeting room at the company's Pakistan headquarters in upscale DHA. “We will organise this every year. And from next year we will try to bring in current players rather than retired ones.”
Brazil legend Roberto Carlos to play in Pakistan
Ishaq further revealed that talks have already begun to bring ‘the best' players in the world to Pakistan for next year, but was naturally hesitant to divulge their names since talks are at a very early stage at the moment.
The event may be arguably the biggest footballing event in the country's history but football players and fans have more to look forward to.
“There is a team that is currently playing in the United Soccer League, which will soon be a part of Major League Soccer — US's major football league — that will be sending their scouts to Pakistan every year,” claimed Ishaq. “A trial camp will be set up, from which they will be choosing five players every year. These players will go train with them in the US and, if they impress there, can become professional footballers.”
Other initiatives are also on the way. “We have talked to all the provincial governments,” added Shahzeb. “We have asked them to provide us with land and we will build football grounds on them so that the youth of this country can indulge in healthy recreational activities. We have had a promising response from all of them, especially the Punjab government, which is willing to give us as many as 100 grounds if we guarantee to deliver on our promises.”
The two men did admit though that paying Rs250 is not possible for every young football enthusiast in the country. “Yes, we know that many can't afford it, that is why there are some teams that play for free,” said Shahzeb. “Around 10 per cent of the teams play for free; who these teams will be is decided based purely on the basis of merit and need. And there is also going to be a league in Lyari that will take place completely free of charge since we know how much the people of that area love football.”

The format
With more than 100 teams already registered, the Leisure League format has teams playing across the year in several leagues.
“Since we know this isn't a professional league, we realise that people have other commitments as well,” said Ishaq. “We know that these commitments are important to them and that they play football on the side. We therefore give them the opportunity to play whenever it is convenient for them. Want to play on Sundays only? You can do that. Have other commitments on Sunday and would rather play on Wednesday night? That is also possible. There is a lot of flexibility.”
The players though play in their separate cities and there are multiple leagues within major cities, which means crowning a national champion can be tricky business.
“The winners of all the different leagues play against each other in knockout games generated via a computer,” explained Ishaq. “The winner of that will be crowned the champions of that city or region. The champions of all regions then face off against each other in a similar format to crown the national champion.”
Other than getting a memorable chance of playing alongside the likes of Ronaldinho and Pires, the national champions will also be competing in the ‘Mini Football World Cup', where they will be representing Pakistan.
“Leisure Leagues' Pakistan national champion will play in the seven-a-side Mini Football World Cup in Dubai,” said Ishaq. “We will also be looking out for the future of these players and they will get either a scholarship or a job offer.”
Not an easy journey
Pakistan's poor security situation means international sport in the country has come to a virtual standstill, so it comes as no surprise that the World Group had its work cut out in their bid to bring these players to Pakistan.
“Yes we did face a few problems convincing these players to come to Pakistan,” admitted Ishaq. “The unfortunate blast in Lahore took place just two days before we signed Ronaldinho, so it wasn't easy to bring the players here. The army helped us a lot by offering to provide the players security for these matches.”
Concerns over security were not the only hurdle though. “Pakistan lacks even the most basic footballing infrastructure,” added Shahzeb. “The players wanted to send their agents so that they could look at the football grounds where they will be playing, but we didn't have even a single ground in Karachi that we could show them. That is why we have had to have the Karachi game at a hockey ground.”
It has been hard work but the duo believe it is not them who are to be credited for pulling this off, but the man behind the vision. “None of this would have been possible without World Group Chairman Mehmood Trunkwala,” said Ishaq. “This is his vision and he is the one backing it.”
Many will write them off even before they have truly begun but Leisure Leagues is about to take one huge stride in their ambitious vision of turning cricket-mad Pakistan into football country. Ronaldinho and friends are coming to town.

They have the Flyers on Wednesday and the Bruins on Thursday as they fight to get into the postseason

After the Detroit Red Wings' latest victory, Henrik Zetterberg was asked how it felt for the team to be back in the playoff picture.
He laughed and noted it was only for a day.
Make that a little longer.
The Wings got a helping hand toward their playoff drive from former Central Division rival Chicago on Sunday as the Blackhawks beat the Boston Bruins, 6-4.
That, coming the day after the Wings won, 3-2, at Toronto, keeps the Wings in third place in the Atlantic Division. The Wings took Sunday off because they don't play again until Wednesday, when they host Philadelphia. The Bruins, a point behind Detroit, next play Tuesday against Carolina. The Wings play at Boston on Thursday.
The Wings have used the past two games to right themselves, playing really well defensively Friday in a home victory over Minnesota and winning in Toronto on the strength of early scoring and the resurgent play of goaltender Jimmy Howard.
“I think overall we're playing pretty good defense, and that's something we talked about,” coach Jeff Blashill said after Saturday's game. “I still believed going into this weekend we can be a team that plays real good defense and can create offense still. I thought we did that pretty well overall.”
Howard has won his past three starts and was especially key in beating the Maple Leafs. It's a gratifying situation given how Howard struggled midseason.
“It's fun being out there competing for the guys,” he said. “Just being back out there, knowing what's on the line, being in the trenches with the guys, it's a lot of fun. And that's why you play the game.”
The Wings can't afford any letup. The next two games are the biggest obstacles to making the playoffs for a 25th consecutive season. The Flyers have one of the wild-card spots in the Eastern Conference. Staying in the top-three spots in the Atlantic, meanwhile, means an automatic playoff berth.
There's even a chance the Wings could move higher than third in the division. They trail Tampa Bay by only four points, and the Lightning just lost two key players to injury in Steven Stamkos and Anton Stralman.
The Wings close out the regular season with a Saturday matinee at the Rangers.

The Huskies have shifted Ben Riva across the offensive line, moving the 6-foot-6, 306-pound junior from right to left tackle because, as Steve Sarkisian noted, Riva has shown the potential to be an “elite” left tackle with NFL upside.
“That'd be cool,” Riva said of his pro prospects. “(But) that's really not my focus right now. I want to win some games here first.”
To do more of that, Riva knows he and his linemates will need to keep senior QB Keith Price upright this season.
“Everybody knows if he's comfortable back there, he can tear (defenses) apart,” Riva said. “He's really happy. He's got his smile on and he's having fun. It's his senior year and we want to make it the best for him.”
Injuries riddled the O-line last year, but Sarkisian said he likes the progress made on the line during the first week of camp — and, in particular, the “nastiness” that is developing with the front five.
Among the linemen, Riva has “snatched the leadership role up by the throat,” Sarkisian said.
Riva has added about 30-35 pounds since arriving on campus from O'Dea High School a few years ago. He's been eating six meals a day in the offseason to maintain his weight — no fast food, he said — and he seems to be fitting in quite well on the left side of the line.
“Obviously, offensive tackles get paid a lot of money (in the NFL) … but geometrically it's no different (from right to left),” he said.
Micah Hatchie has moved from left to right tackle, with Dexter Charles playing left guard with the No. 1 offense and Mike Criste at center; Colin Tanigawa and James Atoe have split reps at right guard in camp so far as Tanigawa comes back from an ACL injury.
Riva has been impressed with Criste's development at center, particularly with how he's handled defensive tackle Danny Shelton.
“Mike's doing a great job. It's really starting to click for him,” Riva said. “I'm happy he's there. I trust him a ton. You can just see on film the progress he's made on film the last year, the last couple years. It's night and day. … I remember he used to have a real problem with Danny Shelton in pass protection; now he's doing a much better job.”

Well, if that's my worst moment in journalism, I might be respected after all. The actual story back in October speculated on whether he would be tempted to raid the RBA coffers, as Wayne Swan had done. Read it for yourself here , but I think I managed to pull up short of saying he would do it.
"Yes, Michael Pascoe is so respected that he wrote a few days, a few days before I put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank he wrote that I was going to rip money out of the Reserve Bank. That's how good Michael Pascoe is. That's how good Michael Pascoe is. So if you're taking economics lessons from Michael Pascoe, I'd suggest you go back to Swanny."
Of course, as it turns out, Hockey has played a much more sophisticated game to make the last "Labor" budget look as bad as possible and "his" first and subsequent budgets look as good as possible. He will indeed rip plenty of money out of the RBA, but not this financial year.
As previously and widely reported, such as here, Trader Joe is borrowing more than $8 billion to give to the RBA this financial year, so that he can Hoover up all its profits as dividends thereafter. With a little bit of luck at the casino that is the foreign exchange market, it should pay off handsomely – and it needs to, as the leveraged bet is costing the rest of us $300 million or so in unnecessary interest.
Unfortunately, it looks like Hockey missed the sweet spot, the chance to borrow the dosh when Commonwealth bond yields were at their lowest and while the Aussie dollar was considerably higher. Politically though, the gamble will still pay off – as long as he can fool enough people about his fiddling with the deficit.
As for the MYEFO numbers, they must indeed be seen to be rubbish if he's not game to even mention them. That became plain in February with the RBA's statement on monetary policy and just about every bit of economic news since then has confirmed it.
Week 8 Preview: Reestablish the Momentum
This week the Hornets continue their five-game road trip with contests against Indiana, Washington, Boston, and Atlanta. The Hornets are presently 14-11 and sit in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Last week the Hornets won three straight before a hard fought loss in Cleveland to LeBron James and Co. This week the Hornets need to get back on track with winnable games across the board. Unfortunately, Monday night Charlotte struggled on the road in Indiana losing 110-94. The teams need to win at least two of the remaining three games to stay on track for home court advantage in the first round of this year's playoffs. Below we dive into the matchups in the remaining games this week.
@ Indiana, 7:00 pm ET — Monday, December 12th
Recap: QCHoops Game Recap: Hornets Unable to Keep Pace with Indiana's Shooting, Lose 110-94
@ Washington, 7:00 pm ET — Wednesday, December 14
Matchup: Washington has been one of the most confusing teams in the NBA this season. The early season hopes that the Wall and Beal duo would blossom have died and much of the NBA blogosphere wonders whether Wall's exit is right around the corner. Recently, Washington has been playing better, winning 5 of 10 games, but this is a game Charlotte should win. The key matchup of the night will be Kemba Walker vs. John Wall both of whom will be compared against the other when All-Start candidates are evaluated. Thus far, Kemba has outperformed Wall primarily due to team success, yet, a dominated performance in this head-to-head matchup can solidify Kemba's rise in the East's point guard rankings.
Key Stat: Rebounds – The Wizards are a slightly better shooting team than the Hornets so it will be essential that the Hornets limit second chance opportunities for the Wizards and create a few for themselves.
@ Boston, 7:30 pm ET — Friday, December 16
Matchup: The East's 5th and 6th place teams will matchup this Friday in the first game of a back-to-back for Charlotte. Boston has struggled recently going 5-5 in their last ten games, including two straight losses, with a tough game against San Antonio to be played Wednesday. Isaiah Thomas has missed three straight games with a groin injury and his status for Wednesday's game is uncertain. While we wish him a speedy and full recovery, ff he is unable to or is limited in play Friday, that will greatly benefit the Hornets. To add onto all of this, the Celtics dealt with a scary situation last week when a bomb threat was called in while the team plane was on its way to OKC.
Key Stat: Avery Bradley's three point shooting – In the October 29th game, which the Celtics won 104-98 in Charlotte, Avery Bradly was 8-11 from three and scored 31 points. Charlotte will need to defend the three point line much more effectively than in the prior game to secure a win.
@ Atlanta, 7:30 pm ET — Saturday, December 17
Matchup: The early season victory against the Hawks was viewed as a marquee win at the time. Recently, however, the Hawks have been in a free fall; losing seven of their last ten and ten of their last thirteen. On the bright side, they are currently riding a two game winning streak thanks to a historic comeback against Milwaukee where the Hawks overcame a 20-point halftime deficit. On the season, the Hawks offensive performance has trailed where it was last year as the team has fallen from the top half of the league in three-point shooting to 28th. Millsap continues to be the team's leader but has struggled with a hip injury recently that has forced him to sit out several games. It appears he will be close to full strength against the Hawks and his presence will create issues for the Hornets' defense. Similarly, Kent Bazemore has been out of the line-up with knee soreness but is on track to be on the court for the match-up with the Hornets.
Key Stat: Turnovers – Atlanta is 27th in the league in turnovers per game at 17 while Charlotte is 2nd at 12 per game. In October, the Hornets had 7 fewer turnovers than Atlanta in their matchup which was instrumental in securing the four point win. Charlotte must continue to protect the ball and must opportunistically take advantage of Atlanta's propensity for carelessness.
George Clooney gave 14 of his best pals a million bucks in cash in 2013—and even paid the taxes on the gifts, according to one of his friends.
Clooney's largesse was revealed by his best friend, Rande Gerber, in a recent episode of MSNBC's Headliners.
“There's a group of guys we call ‘The Boys,'” Gerber explained. “George had called me and ‘The Boys' and said, ‘Hey, mark Sept. 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone's going to come to my house for dinner.”
“ If Rande doesn't take the million dollars, nobody gets it. ” — George Clooney, after Rande Gerber attempted to decline a $1m gift
When they arrived at the Oscar-winning actor and director's place, Gerber said that black luggage bags were set on the table for each guest. “George begins to say, ‘Listen, I want you guys to know how much you've meant to me and how much you mean in my life,” the businessman recalled. “‘I came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I'm so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn't be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we're still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases.'”
According to Gerber, $1 million in $20 bills was stashed in each case.
“Every one of us—14 of us—got a million dollars. Every single one of us,” he continued. “We're in shock. Like, what is this?”
According to Gerber, Clooney then said, “I know we've all been through some hard times, some of you are still going through it. You don't have to worry about your kids, you don't have to worry about, you know, school, you don't have to worry abut paying your mortgage.”
Gerber said that some of the lucky recipients were down on their luck at the time: “One was working at a bar in Texas at the airport, trying just to support his family. Rides a bicycle to work every day.”
Gerber, who is part-owner of Clooney's Casamigos Tequila brand, which sold for $1 billion earlier this year, was reluctant to accept the money: “I pull him aside and said, ‘I absolutely am not taking these million dollars.' Immediately, George goes, ‘I'm just going to make one announcement. If Rande doesn't take the million dollars, nobody gets it.'”
Gerber said he donated all of the funds to charity.
He added, “This is who George is. That was September 27th, 2013. Now September 27, 2014, he marries Amal. That's good karma right there.”
I've been married for two and a half years. Since my wedding day, I've been asked the same question approximately a million times:
“So, when are you going to have kids?”
I'm not exaggerating when I say that I get asked this on a weekly basis. From EVERYONE. And by everyone, I mean my coworkers, my second cousin, the janitorial staff at my office. I mean people on the internet, my nail manicurist, the UPS man, the dental hygienist. I mean neighbors and family friends and long-lost acquaintances from high school. I mean my Pilates instructor, the woman who lives down the street from my mother, the receptionist at the veterinarian office. EVERY. ONE.
I get it. People know I'm married. I am a woman of childbearing age. Kids are the next obvious step. Acknowledging that and asking about my plans is a nod at my current situation. It's expressing an interest in my life. It's a way to show they care. I understand that their curiosity might be well-intentioned, but “when are you going to have kids” is still a rude question that's grounded in three dangerous assumptions:
1. “When are you going to have kids” assumes I actually want to have children. Which, you know, not all women do.
More and more women in my generation are choosing not to have children. And while they may not mind explaining their (very personal and emotionally-loaded) choice, they probably don't want to do that with you, an acquaintance at best, in a very public space. And if they do explain their reasons for not having children, they're often met with an unfair amount of judgment. I've seen people pry and hassle women into a debate about their futures and their lifestyle choices.
Please: do not engage in this kind of challenge to women to defend their personal choices. It's uncomfortable and rude and judgmental and none of your business. This is not your body, not your life, not your decision. You don't get to have an opinion on what I do with these three aspects of my life.
2. “When are you going to have kids” assumes that I'm physically capable of having children. Which, you know, not all women are.
If you're struggling to get pregnant, the last thing you want to do is discuss the issue with strangers. It's painful and personal and not something you want to be reminded of multiple times a day by the general public. Imagine how you would feel if everyone you met was constantly asking you about the one thing you wanted most, but were unable to have.
Remember that having kids is not a given for every woman. It's not an assumption you should make so quickly. If you're going to breach the subject at all, do so with tact and empathy and privacy. You never know what battles they might be facing.
3. “When are you going to have kids” assumes that I'm actually interested in having this deeply personal conversation with you at this specific moment in time. Which is highly unlikely, considering that I didn't bring it up to begin with.
I fall squarely into this camp. I do want to have kids, and there are no known physical reasons preventing me from fulfilling this personal wish, but I don't feel like discussing these facts with you, Dear Stranger. If I did, I would've brought it up myself. Trying for pregnancy and having a baby are arguably the most important decisions a woman makes in her lifetime. It's not “casual acquaintance” conversation topic.
If I want to discuss my plans, I will bring them up. Who knows — I might ask for your advice or insight or personal experience. But the conversation will be on my terms: I will determine the when and where we have this talk. I will set the boundaries for the conversation, because it is my life and my future that we are discussing.
There are some people who are exempt from these rules. My husband, obviously. My mother. My sisters. My best friends. My close family members. My top-tier people. But that's about it. If you're not sure about whether or not you should bring it up, err on the side of caution. I promise you, if you know a married woman of child-bearing age who's thinking about starting a family, she will initiate the conversation when she's ready to have it. And I can guarantee that — if you leave her the space the start that conversation herself, instead of the other way around — she will be happy that she got to do so on her own terms.
I don't think people mean to be offensive when they ask about when I'm planning on having children. I know that they're trying to be supportive and friendly. I don't mean to be dismissive, but it's a very uncomfortable topic and it can be truly offensive and painful for some women to put up with it publicly, every day of their lives, whether they're having a good or bad day. Be mindful of your personal responsibility to respect women's personal choices, moving forward.

Image caption The annual march has taken on extra significance because of anger over tax rises and spending cuts
Thousands of protesters are taking part in an annual march in the Greek capital, Athens, with numbers swelled by anti-austerity demonstrators.
The rally marks the anniversary of a student uprising in 1973 that helped bring down the country's military dictatorship.
There was a brief clash outside the parliament when police fired tear gas at youths throwing petrol bombs, but the march has been mainly peaceful.
Some 7,000 officers are on the streets.
Analysts say it is the first test of public defiance against Prime Minister Lucas Papdemos's new government.
It comes a day after Greece's interim government won a confidence vote.
Mr Papademos's governing coalition had a huge majority - 255 MPs voted in favour, and 38 against.
His technocrat government must approve a new bailout package and commit to reforms in order to secure the next instalment of an international loan.
History repeating?
The 17 November demonstration traditionally draws huge crowds in Athens every year.
Image caption Lucas Papademos says Greece needs to take bolder steps to tackle the crisis
People march from the polytechnic to the US embassy in protest at US support for the military junta, which Washington saw at the time as a buffer against communism.
But this time the march is imbued with a lot of anger about the austerity measures, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens.
In 1973, the uprising helped usher in the end of the country's then leadership, and the current government is hoping that history will not repeat itself, our correspondent adds.
The government says the austerity measures are essential, although two party leaders within the coalition remain reluctant to sign a document committing themselves to the bailout terms.
They are the leaders of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, and the leader of Greece's Far Right Laos party, George Karatzaferis.
But both leaders backed the unity government in the vote.
Mr Papademos, an unelected former banker, earlier said his priority was ratifying the international 130bn euro ($177bn; £111bn) bailout package agreed at an EU summit last month.
Speaking before Wednesday's confidence vote in parliament, Mr Papademos appealed for unity and said Greece needed to take bolder steps to tackle the crisis.
"Dealing with Greece's problems will be more difficult if Greece is not a member of the eurozone," he told parliament.
The planned reforms have already triggered widespread protest in Greece.
The crisis led to the resignation last week of the then-Prime Minister George Papandreou.
The unity government is intended to run the country until elections in February.
Just two miles separated the Amvets post flea market from a meeting of refugees in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. But the opinions on President Donald Trump were nowhere near each other. Below is how people viewed the complicated DC headlines in one American town.
Lancaster, PENNSYLVANIA (CNN) Late on a Saturday morning in the parking lot of a local Amvets post, more than a half-dozen men and women stood behind folding tables strewn with clothing, used books and other knickknacks hoping to make a buck or two. Business wasn't going as well as they'd hoped; only a few shoppers trickled in and out of the sprawling parking of this veterans' service group.
That meant more time spent talking and trading stories than money for goods. Almost without exception, all of the would-be vendors -- many veterans -- supported then-candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
And in this town, in a state that helped Trump win the White House, they seemed largely indifferent to the steady stream of news stories about the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as the FBI's investigation into potential Russian interference into the election.
"I don't think much of it," Cherryl Hess said of the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Russia as she stood behind a set of tables full of old books, T-shirts and some antiques. "He's our president. He couldn't have been doing things that were wrong or he wouldn't have gotten in."
"I wouldn't have voted for him if he was crooked," Hess, 74, added with a laugh.
Stories like these are playing out across the country where mere miles -- or sometimes just a fence -- separate those unbothered by the controversy swirling around the Trump administration and those hopeful that Trump's self-inflicted wounds will finally take their toll. Here at Amvets Post 19, the former outweighs the latter.
Hess and her husband, Craig, were both registered Democrats but picked Trump because he promised a fresh direction for the country and speaks plainly about what he intends to do. But Craig Hess, 66, an Army and Vietnam veteran, said Trump's detractors have been "on him brutal."
In Lancaster County, 57% of voters chose Trump in 2016.
Cherryl Hess said she hoped Trump would make things better for senior citizens in the US -- she said they've been trampled -- while Craig was frustrated with the state of the military and national security, the beleaguered economy, the lack of strong guiding principles. Things aren't what they used to be, he said, but Trump perhaps could have an answer, provided he's given the chance to try.
"I think they need to give him a break, but I don't think that's going to happen," he said, dismissing the reports of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia as "lies."
"I'd be hard-pressed to trust anybody anymore," he said flatly.
Tom Stock and Buddy Lewis set up shop at a different crop of folding tables, selling old newspapers with historic headlines, a collection of lapel pins attached to denim and some books. Both men were frustrated by what they saw as a glacial pace of investigation into the Trump campaign's Russia ties.
Buddy Lewis, 77, and Tom Stock, 84, both voted for Trump and say that all the chaos in Washington is stopping the President from being able to do his job well.
"It's just baloney, this back and forth over every little nitpicking thing, that's what pisses me off," Stock, 84, said. "Now they have this new guy Mueller. See what he does. How long is he going to take, a year or two?
Lewis, 77, piled on, agreeing with Stock that Trump's been unfairly maligned and castigated by Washington politicians.
Both retirees -- Tom is a veteran, Buddy helped build Maryland's Fort McHenry tunnel back in the 1980s -- say they don't like to argue politics, they just like to soak in information. The two men go back and forth, trading a list of headlines they've heard on Fox News, NBC and CNN.
"All you hear is investigating this, investigating that. I'm tired of it," he said, exasperated. "I don't think he's ever been given a chance to do what he could do."
A statue of President James Buchanan stands at the entrance of Buchanan City Park in Lancaster. Buchanan, who is buried in Lancaster, has regularly been ranked one of the worst presidents by historians, citing his ambivalence towards the South wanting to secede from the Union prior to the Civil War.
Richard Sims, a 55-year-old who recently moved back to Pennsylvania from Arizona to support an aging parent, suggested that the daily drama surrounding the Trump administration was exactly what he expected.
"Things are kind of crazy, but I knew that was coming," Sims, who is working on starting his own service business said.
Of those Trump supporters in the parking lot, Sims alone was willing to entertain the idea that the candidate he voted for could soon be on his way out of the Oval Office by way of impeachment.
"I don't want to pass judgment right now, but it wouldn't surprise me because he's definitely not the typical presidential character that we're used to."
Nearly 540,000 people live in the surrounding Lancaster County, roughly 75 miles west of Philadelphia. More than three-quarters are white, and in 2016, 57% of voters chose Trump.
Two miles away, a totally different perspective
Just two miles away in the multipurpose room of a Lutheran church, the feelings about the Trump administration were quite different. In this space, more than a half-dozen immigrants and refugees gathered to learn how to speak to the media and lawmakers and effectively share their stories.
Many said they felt targeted by the Trump administration's immigration policies, including attempts to temporarily block refugees from being resettled in the United States.
Rachel Syke, 33, does a pole dancing exercise demonstration during Open Streets in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Open Streets encourages residents to be outside and meet other people in the community.
Lancaster has a decades-old tradition of welcoming refugees, largely through a branch of Church World Service, a national nonprofit that works with the State Department's refugee resettlement program. Thousands have come to Lancaster over the years, a tradition now in peril thanks to the priorities of the Trump administration, although the White House plan to hit pause on refugees and immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries has been stalled in federal court.
"The whole community was in shock. They didn't know what to do or where to go from here," said Fadia Abdelrahman, 48, who came to the United States from Sudan in 1998, becoming a US citizen several years later.
Abdelrahman, a mother of two with a master's degree in environmental engineering, came to the US to pursue her education. But amidst the economic downturn opportunities have been scarce. She plans to return to school soon to pursue her doctorate. But she's become a leader in Central Pennsylvania's Sudanese community, hoping to provide resources to those who come to America the same way she did.
Fadia Abdelrahman, an engineer who fled to the United States from Sudan in 1998, is concerned about Trump's attitudes toward immigrants.
Sudan was one of the nations targeted by Trump's order -- something Abdelrahman said she didn't find surprising and believed that the President wanted to keep Muslims like her out of the United States. Even though Abdelrahaman has been a US citizen for more than a decade, she said she worried that the Trump administration immigration policies would impact her too.
"In my passport, it says 'country of origin' is Sudan, so I don't know, maybe (Trump) will come up with an executive order and say if you are from Sudan, we take your citizenship away from you," she said.
During the 2016 campaign, Abdelrahman volunteered for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign and found Trump's victory "unbelievable." She remains suspicious of the Trump administration and believed there to be some truth in reports of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
"They're talking about Clinton using her personal email to send work related information to somewhere and they think that is a big deal and she's got to go to jail for that? How about this? Russia is No. 1 enemy of the United States right now," she said. "How can he be friends with them or deal with them?"
Somalian refugee Mustafa Nuur, 24, spent 10 years in a refugee camp before settling in Lancaster.
Mustafa Nuur, 24, participated in the training, too. Years ago, he fled Somalia for safety and came to Lancaster after spending 10 years living in a refugee camp. The day he left Somalia with his mother and siblings, his father was killed in front of his entire family.
"We went from losing my father in the morning to leaving our country in the evening," Nuur, who now works as a web developer said.
Resettling in the US was "a scary process because you don't know what you're getting yourself into," Nuur said. But he was thankful that he ended up in Lancaster, which he described as a "very welcoming community."
In the Trump administration though, Nuur saw parallels to the country he fled more than a decade ago.
"When you come from a broken country where the government is not stable and you come to another country hoping for stability," Nuur said. "To sense that tension and that unexpectedness is almost a tiny reminder of why our country fell apart."

(Reuters Health) - Women who have a sunny outlook on life may live longer than their peers who take a dimmer view of the world, a recent study suggests.
Researchers analyzed data collected over eight years on about 70,000 women and found that the most optimistic people were significantly less likely to die from cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease or infections during the study period than the least optimistic.
“Optimistic people tend to act in healthier ways (i.e., more exercise, healthier diets, higher quality sleep, etc.), which reduces one's risk of death,” said one of the study's lead authors, Kaitlin Hagan, a public health researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University in Boston.
“Optimism may also have a direct impact on our biological functioning,” Hagan added by email. “Other studies have shown that higher optimism is linked with lower inflammation, healthier lipid levels and higher antioxidants.”
Hagan and colleagues examined data from the Nurses Health Study, which began following female registered nurses in 1976 when they were 30 to 55 years old. The study surveyed women about their physical and mental health as well as their habits related to things like diet, exercise, smoking and drinking.
Starting in 2004, the survey added a question about optimism. Beginning that year, and continuing through 2012, researchers looked at what participants said about optimism to see how this related to their other responses and their survival odds.
Researchers divided women into four groups, from least to most optimistic.
Compared with the least optimistic women, those in the most optimistic group were 29 percent less likely to die of all causes during the study period, researchers report in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
Once researchers adjusted the data for health habits, greater optimism was still associated with lower odds of dying during the study, though the effect wasn't as pronounced.
Still, the most optimistic women had 16 percent lower odds of dying from cancer during the study, 38 percent lower odds of death from heart disease or respiratory disease, 39 percent lower odds of dying from stroke and a 52 percent lower risk of death from an infection.
While other studies have linked optimism with reduced risk of early death from cardiovascular problems, this was the first to find a link between optimism and reduced risk from other major causes, the study authors note.
One limitation of the study is the possibility that in some cases, underlying health problems caused a lack of optimism, rather than a grim outlook on life making people sick, the authors point out.
They also didn't include men, though previous research has found the connection between optimism and health is similar for both sexes, said the study's other lead author, Dr. Eric Kim, also of Brigham and Women's and Harvard.
Despite the lack of men in the study, the findings still suggest that it may be worthwhile to pursue public health efforts focused on optimism for all patients, Kim said by email.
That's because even though some people may have a less positive outlook on life for reasons beyond their control like unemployment or a debilitating illness, some previous research suggests that optimism can be learned.
“Negative thinking isn't the cause or the only contributor to these illnesses,” said Dr. Susan Albers, a psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who wasn't involved in the study. “Mindset is just one factor, but the results of the study indicate they are a significant one and can't be ignored.”
Some people can develop optimism when it doesn't come naturally, Albers added by email.
“It is worth tweaking your mindset as much as taking your medicine,” Albers said. “Work with a counselor, join with a friend, hang up optimistic messages, watch films and movies with a hopeful, positive message, find the silver lining in the situation.”

European exceptionalism (updated)
I'd like to broaden John H's discussion of the US as a center-right nation to consider the broader idea that the US is, in some sense, exceptional. As Barack Obama correctly pointed out not so long ago, every nation is exceptional in its own way, which tends to undermine the idea that any nation is specially exceptional.
Still, compared to the developed world in general, it seems obvious that the US is different in lots of ways: an outlier in terms of nationalism, military power, religiosity, working hours and inequality of outcomes and (in the opposite direction) in terms of government intervention, health outcomes and other measures typically associated with welfare states. Among these the outstanding differences arise from the fact that the US aspires, with some success, to be globally hegemonic in military terms and (with rather less success) in economic terms as well.
But, when you think about it, there is nothing exceptional here.
Almost every state of any significance in history has aspired to dominate its known world. In the last century, Britain, Germany, Russia and even France[1] aspired to this role, and right now Russia and China are keen to try. Religiosity, militarism, inequality, and governments that do little for their subjects are the norm rather than the exception. Long hours of hard work have been the lot of humankind at least since the arrival of agriculture.
The real exception to all of this is Europe[2]. The largest economic aggregate in world history, it has enough military power to repel any invader, but is deeply uninterested in using this power to any more glorious end. It grows by a process of reluctant accretion, controlled by ever more onerous admission requirements. In all history, it would be hard to find anything comparable in terms of pacifism, godlessness, equality, leisure for the masses or public provision of services.[3]
Then the EU itself. There aren't many historical parallels and those that I can think of (the US under the Articles of Confederation and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for example) were rapidly abandoned. It's ungainly, unloved and bureaucratic, and yet it has persisted for 50+ years (nearly 60 if you count the ESC). The Great Powers of the 19th are now, with marginal exceptions, parts of this post-sovereign collective.
It's for these reasons that American views of Europe resemble de Tocqueville in reverse. Something so unprecedented, and against the laws of nature, they think, cannot possibly survive, let alone prosper. And yet it does.
fn1. As pointed out in comments, the bloody failure of these attempts between 1914 and 1945 helped cure most European countries of belief in national greatness. But Russia, which suffered more than anywhere else, has seemingly gone the other way.
fn2. That's not to deny, of course, that there are lots of differences within Europe. Nevertheless, on the criteria described above, almost any European state appears as an outlier in historical terms.
fn3. The other developed countries (Japan and the wealthier bits of East Asia, Aust/NZ, Canada and, to the extent it can be regarded as outside Europe, the UK, sit somewhere in between.

ASP.Net
Happy holidays everyone!
I'd been investigating moving to a CMS for a little while now, but hadn't really found the time to learn how to set in up properly and because my site was so simple it wasn't really necessary. Now that my blog and portfolio are getting a little bit bigger it seemed like a good time to move it across during my biannual redesign.
On that note I've used the fantastic Link theme from Blacktie.co for the new version of the site which I think has come out fantastically. They have several great Bootstrap based themes so check them out!
So I looked around for ASP.Net CMS systems and tried out 3 including Orchard, Kenetico and Umbraco. I found that Umbraco was the best document and by far the easiest to create templates from. I was impressed with the fact that I can install it using Nuget and how easy it is to add extra bits of functionality such as a contact page.
All in all, because I cheated with the CSS and HTML, this whole site took me roughly 8 hours to get up and running. I had a few problems when web-deploying Umbraco with regard to IIS HTTP Compression. For reasons I haven't looked into yet it doesn't play nicely with Umbraco, at least on my Smarter ASP hosting. Other than that it was just a little time consuming to move all my content over, but realised I probably could have automated that process by using the RSS feed I had on the old site. I may bring that back at some point if there was anyone out there using it!
Enjoy the new site everyone, powered by Umbraco!

ATLANTA (AP) — Faced with the prospect of losing both hands and her one remaining foot, a young Georgia woman battling to survive a case of flesh-eating bacteria that has already claimed one leg mouthed the words "Let's do this."
Aimee Copeland, 24, "shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash," her father, Andy Copeland, wrote on Facebook on Friday about the conversation he and his wife had with their daughter the day before.
"I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady," Copeland wrote.
It was not immediately clear whether the surgeries had already been performed and a post to a blog about the woman's progress Friday evening simply said "Aimee is doing well today. Her vital signs are as positive as her spirit."
A hospital spokeswoman referred questions to the father's online post.
The story of Copeland's battle to survive has inspired an outpouring of support from around the world. The University of West Georgia student developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after suffering a deep cut in her leg in a May 1 fall from a homemade zip line over the Little Tallapoosa River.
She has been hospitalized in critical condition at an Augusta hospital, battling kidney failure and other organ damage. She had been on a breathing tube until recently, when doctors performed a tracheotomy, her father said.
Until Thursday, Aimee Copeland did not know the full extent of her condition, only that her hands were badly infected.
Andy Copeland said he told his daughter about what had happened since the accident, how her one leg had been amputated. Doctors had once characterized her survival as "slim to none."
"We told her of the outpouring of love from across the world," her father said. "We told her that the world loved and admired her. We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith. Aimee's eyes widened and her jaw dropped. She was amazed."
In Copeland's case, the necrotizing fasciitis was caused by bacteria known as Aeromonas hydrophila, which is found in warm rivers and streams. Many people exposed to the bacteria don't get sick. Only a handful of necrotizing fasciitis infections caused by the bacteria have been reported in medical journals in recent decades.
Under the condition, the bacteria emit toxins that destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue.
Andy Copeland said he learned Thursday that doctors wanted to amputate his daughter's hands and remaining foot. Doctors were concerned she could develop respiratory problems and if her hands released an infection in her body there was a risk she could become septic again, her father said.
"We had a window of opportunity to perform the amputations and have a successful outcome," he said. "As they usually do, the doctors were presenting us with a medical no-brainer. We had to do what is necessary to save Aimee's life."
At that point, the family decided to share the situation with their daughter.
Copeland said he showed his daughter her hands, told her they were not healthy and were hampering her progress.
"Aimee, I do not want anything to happen to you," Copeland said he told his daughter. "Your mind is beautiful, your heart is good and your spirit is strong. These hands can prevent your recovery from moving forward. The doctors want to amputate them and your foot today to assure your best possible chance of survival."
Aimee Copeland nodded her understanding.
Her father explained that she would eventually be fitted with prosthetics to help her get around and she nodded again.
Then she smiled, raised her hands up and looked at the damage. She then turned to her family, gathered by her bedside and mouthed the words: "Let's do this."
Her father said he left the room with tears in his eyes.
"I wasn't crying because Aimee was going to lose her hands and foot, I was crying because, in all my 53 years of existence, I have never seen such a strong display of courage," Copeland said.
The following is excerpted from Xenolinguistics: Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of Consciousness, published by North Atlantic Books/Evolver Editions.
“In both art and science now, the matter of consciousness is high on the agenda. Science is trying hard to explain consciousness, with distinctly limited success. It seems to pose the most intractable of problems. For the artist, consciousness is more to be explored than to be explained, more to be transformed than understood, more to be reframed than reported.” —Roy Ascott , 2003
Psychonauts, at some point, due to the nature of their experiences, become philosophers by default. I came out of my second DMT adventure spluttering, “what-the-fuck.” Over and over. Every thought that arose in response to the experience was immediately translated into a resounding “what-the fuck.”
Finally the sentence became “It's the what-the-fuck drug.” I was expressing the inexpressible content of a head-on collision with the Unspeakable in the only words I could find in the proper emotional register: befuddlement, bewilderment, and the powerful sense that the whole thing was so improbable that to “tell it like it is” would be to sound absurd. Really absurd. This was accompanied by a lot of helpless laughter and head-shaking, as I was dumped out of darshan with the Unspeakable in its most alien manifestation ever. As words returned, the problem deepened. How could I say that an experience I just had was both patently absurd and more real than real, at the same time? How could this be so real, and at the same time have its reality so in question, so laughable, when it so departs from the consensus of what is real and what is not back at baseline?
The experience threw a sparklyspanner in the cognitive machinery, forcing me to go back to basic assumptions in my thought processes. Philosophy begins with these basic questions of knowing and being. In classical Western philosophy, epistemology is the study of knowing, and ontology is the study of being. How could I say that an experience I just had was both patently absurd, and more real than real, at the same time?
The Ontological Dilemma
The ontological status of psychedelic experience—the reality question—pervades psychonautic experience and hence psychedelic research. Was that real? What is reality? What, “really,” is a hallucination? What can we learn from profoundly altered perception of both the world around us and of the mind manifesting in extremely novel ways? Is reality a simple given, or are we complicit in its construction? As Robert Anton Wilson quipped, “Reality is the line where rival gangs of shamans fought to a standstill.”
To argue about what reality is or isn't, when reality is the standard by which we decide what is and what isn't, is a slippery proposition, as circular and self-referential as consciousness attempting to study itself. And who is the authority on what is real? I submit that authority in the psychedelic sphere does not depend on advanced degrees or professional standing, though these are not in short supply among psychonauts. Rather their authority comes from evidence of practice, especially self-reflective practice, combined with rhetorical skill. Thus, the authority of John Lilly's many books comes not only from his medical degree, or from the fact that he received funding for his early LSD research from government agencies. He persuades with passion when he continues his research past the illegalization boundaries. His phenomenological integrity persuades when he is relating not only research results, but his dangerous mistakes and, from a baseline viewpoint, outlandish alien contacts and other outlier phenomena. Of course, the fact that Dr. Lilly continued his psychonautic practice after illegalization, and fell into a lengthy and dangerous ketamine addiction, destroyed his “authority” in the eyes of authorized research. Lilly persuades (or not) because another psychonaut can read his material and know—because of the authority of his or her own self-evidential knowledge—that Lilly is telling it like it is—or is not—for that reader. This does not mean that a report from the psychedelic sphere must totally match my own in every detail to be of use, or that I need to recognize my own experience in a category of types of experience. My report of living in San Francisco would no doubt differ in many details from the reports of other residents, but we would most likely recognize that we are talking about the same place. This process has also been called “inter-subjective validation.”
Reality Reviewed
For my own purposes, I differentiate between the armchair traveler, who writes about the territory based solely on the reports of others, never having made the trip him- or herself; the tourist, who goes once or twice and is found in a state of “Oh Wow” and declaring authority (like a person who has spent a week in Paris, certain they know the city intimately); commuters, who have traveled many times, usually with some purpose in mind; and expatriates, who have relinquished citizenship in the default world and lose their basis and means of comparison, as Lilly suggests. Permanent or near permanent residency has its risks, as can be seen in Marcia Moore's experience with ketamine, ending in death (M. Moore and H. Alltounian 1978). Lilly himself became for a period a resident of the ketamine world, including a close call of near-drowning.
Douglas Turnbull's characterization of early map-making comes into play. Two explorers to the same area compare notes, logs, and sketches, out of which an assemblage and someday maps can be made. Truth is a negotiated, persuaded and/or recognized truth. Turnbull argues that “scientific knowledge can be seen as the contingent assemblage of local knowledge” (Turnbull 2000).
Does the delusion of one visionary ecstatic validate the delusion of another? How many deluded, or illuminated ecstatics does it take to make a reality? PKD proved that it only takes one. But two is better. (T. McKenna in Sutin 1991)
I suggest Turnbull's map-making as a starting place toward psychonautic (personal, first-person, individual) psychedelic knowledge, building a collection of what Turnbull terms “local knowledges.” These localities can be as particular as a single individual's three-paragraph trip report posted to Erowid, or as extensive as John Lilly's or Timothy Leary's lifework.
A locality can be represented by the collective practices and knowledge of a culture, such as the Mazatec mushroom culture, the Peyote Way, or an ayahuasca culture such as the Santo Daime, União do Vegetal, and Barquinha churches, or Shipibo shamanism. Each locus of knowledge, from the individual to the group, produces its own accounts of experience in the psychedelic sphere, its own descriptions of the landscapes, its own sense of the intentionality of the voyage from baseline outward/inward and the return to ordinary reality. From these experiences descriptions are written, interpretations arise, songs, paintings, software, and dances emanate; rituals are enacted. A body of knowledge collects. Maps can be envisioned, landmark by negotiated landmark.
Waking up in the total alien dreamworld—seeing what one has comfortably called reality and all its rules cheerfully dismantled by a bunch of matter of fact prankster world hackers [gee we thought you'd enjoy it] (session report 01.07.14, 2 g dried Stropharia cubensis)
What reality are you in when the munchkins show you what is clearly the machinery of reality? enfolding unfolding into and out of itself (session report 09.12.31, 4 g dried amazonas) –William James—Potential Forms of Consciousness
Programming set for the psychonaut can determine the reality of the particular exploration. William James's iconic passage about his nitrous oxide experiences, often quoted as an epigraph beginning an article on some psychedelic matter (an indirect example of inter-subjective validation), is rhetorically powerful. It represents a founding text on the topic of psychonautics, and a text that has programmed the set of many psychedelic researchers, both authorized and unauthorized, toward their topic on the one hand, and toward their own trips, which are rhetorically sensitive to texts. The passage is quoted at length and then analyzed rhetorically.
Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air, stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree. Depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the inhaler. This truth fades out, however, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if any words remain over in which it seemed to clothe itself, they prove to be the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense of a profound meaning having been there persists; and I know more than one person who is persuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical revelation.2
Some years ago I myself made some observations on this aspect of nitrous oxide intoxication, and reported them in print. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question—for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. (James 1902)
In the first paragraph, James identifies his personal experience with these substances as the source of his knowledge about them. He speaks with the authority of one who has been there, giving a dose protocol tip: especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air. He states the hallmark of ineffability (a standard that he applies to mystical experiences as a whole)—a sense of profound meaning experienced to which language is insufficient, even ridiculous. The rest of the long passage illustrates the apophatic device of saying that what you have just asserted cannot be articulated: the depths of meaning in the psychedelic experience.
The second paragraph persuades on many levels. The apodictic nature of the experience is asserted: One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken. The certainty produced by the experience is persistent despite its ineffability. That certainty has the effect of holding open, like a foot in a cosmological door, the possibility of uncertainty, the appropriateness of uncertainty, in fact, in the face of the field of unknowing opened by the experiences: they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
A hundred years later, we live in a historical moment where consciousness itself is not part of the “Everything” covered by the physicist's “Theory of Everything,” a denial of inner worlds that in James's time was already in progress. James's language is strong: forced, forbid, unshaken. The novelty of the experience, How to regard them is the question—for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness, previews later models of discrete states of consciousness. The word “alien” is used by many to describe both the bizarre phenomena encountered and the epistemological rupture that demands reframing not only of consciousness but of “life, the universe, and everything.” The heart of the experience is named: The keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. This is the coniunctio oppositorum of alchemy, the union of opposites.
It is associated with the lapis or philosopher's stone, which, according to Jung, is both the beginning and goal of the alchemical process (Jung 1953).
James's passage persuades at a pervasively seductive level—inviting the reader into the psychedelic experience. The filmiest of screens suggests Salome's dance of the seven veils and resonates with the earlier reference of clothing (inadequately) the presumably naked truth, depth upon depth. The language of stimulus and touch reinforces this seduction. The passage tunes the seduction from the filmiest of screens to melted into unity, the hierosgamos or sacred marriage. The seduction promises no less than the dissolution of all our difficulties and troubles. The self-experiment beckons.
Is it a fundamental right of a conscious being to say—this is what is real for me, at this moment in time, subject to future revision? I expose my position as a cognitive libertarian by posing these questions. The final determination of what is real and what is myth for the individual psychonaut is a matter of personal experience, epistemological preference, and relative commitment to the proprieties of consensus reality.

As long as we discuss the situation in Greece in isolation, we are going to continue missing the point.
Today the situation is very different from the Argentinian example.
Today there is no hope for further growth to pull anybody out of crisis, Greece is simply the first domino to fall, surely followed by others.
There is not one economy, not even Germany or the "emerging market countries", who continue looking into the future with confidence.
On one hand our whole expansive, constant growth economic system has become unsustainable, on the other hand we are totally interconnected thus we all move in the same direction, either we all recover or we all fall.
And since our present system has become self destructive we can only recover if we fully understand why we became self destructive, what system we exist in, and how we need to change ourselves in order to adapt to the conditions surrounding us.
One sad truth about politics in Egypt today — and there are many — is the extraordinary abundance of hypocrisy.
From revolutionaries to Salafis, the political opportunism, short-sightedness and, at times, utter absence of political principle has thoroughly damaged not only the prospect for revolution in Egypt, but any semblance of political progress.
Before 2011, anti-government protests regularly concentrated on the brutality of the Ministry of Interior. The police and state security regularly arrested, tortured and murdered Egyptians with impunity. Their reign of terror was rightfully condemned by an array of activists, ranging from secular liberals to leftists to Islamists.
Indeed, the protests on January 25, 2011 commenced as a demonstration against that brutality on Police Day. In the ensuing 18 days the police murdered approximately 1,000 Egyptians, wounding and maiming many others while detaining and torturing countless more.
There was a near unanimous demand for accountability, but over three years later, very few have been convicted of the murder of protesters during the 2011 uprising.
Shortly before the parliamentary elections in the fall of 2011, clashes broke out on Mohamed Mahmoud Street. Many more were killed and wounded. This time, however, with the prospect of electoral victory, the Islamist leaders defended police brutality and called the protesters “thugs,” even while individual Islamists committed to the revolution participated in those demonstrations.
For many, this was the ultimate act of treason by the Muslim Brotherhood, and marked the beginning of an intimate collaboration between the Islamist organization and the security apparatus in undermining a successful revolution.
The Brotherhood continued to belittle police and military brutality while the activists cried foul, condemning the group's decision to collaborate with the security apparatus to secure privileges and power.
The following summer, faced with the untenable choice between Mubarak's former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq and the Brotherhood's candidate Mohamed Morsi in the first post-Mubarak presidential elections. Some activists chose to boycott the election altogether, while others threw their support behind Morsi, hoping he would deliver on his promise of a coalition government inclusive of all political movements, and to block the regime from retaking the presidency.
In the name of defending faux secularism, a handful chose to vote for Shafiq, believing the Brotherhood posed a greater threat to Egypt in the long term.
Needless to say, the Morsi presidency failed to deliver on the consensual government he had promised, and there was no serious effort to reform the security apparatus whose brutality had sparked the uprising. Instead, the Brotherhood sought to co-opt the security apparatus and military by extending budget increases and privileges to them both in policy and in their new draft Constitution.
Activists and non-Islamist parties cried foul.
One of the chief grievances with the new Constitution was that it protected military trials for civilians. Before January 2011, non-Islamist activists worked with the Muslim Brotherhood in condemning the injustice of military trials of civilians, and few other groups had suffered at the hands of these trials more than the Islamists.
Now, however, with a naive confidence in their newfound power, Islamists seemed to believe they had started to secure control of the repressive security apparatus of the state, and and that by delivering privileges to that apparatus they could successfully co-opt it and secure its loyalty.
Protests ensued and the Constitution passed with a simple majority and extremely low turnout. The constitution became a sticking point between non-Islamists and the ruling Brotherhood-Salafi alliance.
Soon the Tamarod (Rebel) movement emerged. Tamarod effectively called for Morsi's recall, insisting he had failed to fulfill his promises as president and was unfit to rule.
Officially, Tamarod demanded early elections, but as June 30, 2013 approached — the date they set for nationwide protests against Morsi — it became clear they were prepared to support military intervention to achieve their goals. Eventually, they explicitly demanded this intervention.
Many took to the streets who opposed military intervention in politics; however, the majority seemed to be comfortable with the coup that was conducted on July 3, 2013. Once again, a political movement chose to “use” the security apparatus to deliver the state and privileges.
In fact, in both instances the security apparatus has successfully used both groups to strengthen its position at the expense of any revolutionary change in Egypt.
The new government proceeded to ban opposition television channels and round up Islamist activists that opposed the coup as well as their sympathizers. Massacres ensued and, just as the Islamists had dismissed the victims of the state's brutality in Mohamed Mahmoud as “thugs,” the new non-Islamist leadership dismissed the victims of even greater levels of brutality as “terrorists.” Anyone critical of the crackdown was labeled as a terrorist sympathizer.
Then, on August 14, hundreds of pro-Morsi protesters were killed in broad daylight at two sit-in camps in Cairo, with many more wounded. The government, filled with ministers from parties who had condemned police brutality in the past, was silent. Indeed, it had approved the massacre.
In reaction, Mohamed ElBaradei — who had been appointed as vice president for foreign affairs partly to convince the revolutionaries that this was a coalition government, but primarily to convince the world it wasn't a coup — resigned, having already promised to do so if the sit-in was violently cleared. He was immediately labeled a traitor and condemned as a coward unfit for politics.
Apparently, his critics believed that only people willing to murder their fellow citizens were “courageous” enough for office.
Regardless of the unrevealed details of the government's involvement in the lead up to the violent dispersal of the sit-ins, there was a general willingness by leading political parties to defer to the ongoing authoritarian rule of the security state.
A protest law similar to the one Morsi had been condemned for proposing was passed by the coup government of “revolutionary” parties. The protest law has been used to suppress both Islamist protesters and the few remaining non-Islamist protesters who remained committed to the revolution's cause. A number of them now sit in prison because of this law, while others await trial.
Once again, political parties masquerading as revolutionaries are collaborating with the security state to suppress and crush criticism and opposition in the name of stability and progress.
Eventually, a new draft constitution was put forward. Like its predecessor, it was poorly written and failed to clearly delineate the rights and responsibilities of each branch of government, or to develop an effective structure for holding each branch accountable. Without this clarity and proper checks and balances, abuse and constitutional crises remain inevitable.
Further, the document contains an article that protects the practice of military trials for civilians, one of the main grievances against Morsi's constitution a year earlier. The language in that article is so wide-ranging that one officer claimed simply getting into a fight at a military-owned gas station would result in a military trial for a civilian.
With the military involved in many civilian projects, ranging from gas stations to producing macaroni, there are countless places where civilians engaged in civilian practices are technically interacting with the military, and could find themselves before a military court for pedestrian offenses.
Now the enemies of revolution seek to crown another military general as Egypt's ruler on the back of extensive brutality, and while building up an absurdist cult of personality with paraphernalia and Sisi-faced chocolates.
Mocking this cult of personality resulted in one of the country's most popular TV personalities, Bassem Youssef, being taken off the air from a privately owned Egyptian TV channel and being forced to broadcast on a foreign-owned channel.
The self-censorship of the private media, which now coordinates its messaging with the state and its media apparatus, has resulted in an informational black hole in Egypt that further hampers the prospects for revolution. It has brought the efficacy of the press to its lowest point in the past three years, including the year during which Morsi was president.
The theory that civilian political power can be achieved on the backs of the military is neither novel nor in need of further testing. The Brotherhood tried it twice in 1952 and 2011. The results are known. The Baath party in both Iraq and Syria attempted a similar stunt, only to find civilian members of both parties cast aside, or worse, as their parties became a facade for direct military rule.
The Baath parties in both Iraq and Syria were secular, civilian Arab nationalist political parties that sought allies who could accelerate their access to power. The civilian leadership of the Baath parties cultivated relationships with young politicized officers hoping to use their support to seize the state and establish civilian rule with them at the head of the state.
What ended up happening, however, was that the officers increasingly found that they had little need for their civilian supporters and cast them aside, as well as much of their more progressive ideology. Both states ended up with direct military rule, with an official ruling party named after the original civilian party that had engaged the officers years before.
This image is emerging once again in Egypt. With the latest Cabinet reshuffle and the appointment of Ibrahim Mehleb as prime minister, the civilian “progressive” parties that sought to ride the military to power have found themselves cast aside while youth activists sit in prison.
Mehleb was a member of Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party and its notorious policy committee. Now he sits atop a government that purports to be “revolutionary” — a word unrivalled in its misuse in Egypt.
Gross naiveté and the mistaken assumption that hardcore realpolitik maneuvering is the only pragmatic approach to politics has produced an endless series of blunders over the past three years.
Behaving according to a set of basic principles isn't idealist, and politics isn't simply about achieving a seat in the next parliament or government — it's about building a political system that is sustainable long after the next election.
Today, it is as if there never was a revolution in Egypt — and so long as political actors continue to behave in their imagined short term interests as opposed to the interests of real institutional democratic change in Egypt, revolution will not be realized.
While Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus demagogues over the World War II memorial, promising vets he'll use Republican National Committee funds to keep it open after Republican intransigence shut it, he might want to find some women he can spend his cash on.
Remember his “autopsy” of the 2012 race and his commitment to remake his party? One key component involved reaching out to women, who are deserting his party in droves, to “address concerns that are on women's minds in order to let them know we are fighting for them.” Better check on how that's going, Reince. A National Journal poll released Thursday found that a growing number of American women believe the Republican Party has moved farther away from their concerns since the election.

A third of all women polled said the party had drifted away from them; only 14 percent said it had moved closer (46 percent said the party hadn't moved). But the most striking change took place among college-educated white women. For some reason, Mitt Romney made inroads with that group last year; Obama had won them in 2008 but lost them narrowly last year. Almost half (45 percent) of college-educated white women say the Republican Party has moved away from them, and of that group, two-thirds say it's because the party has become more conservative.
The news is bad among younger women, as well. Among women under 50, 29 percent said the party had moved away from them, to 11 percent who said it had moved closer. Reince Priebus, call your rebranding office.
This polling data gives me an excuse to revisit one of the most farcical chapters in the fast-moving government shutdown crisis – last Saturday night, when House Republicans decided to attach the so-called conscience clause to the continuing resolution, preventing regulations providing contraception without a copay from taking effect.
When I first saw the news on Twitter, while I was at dinner, I was sure it was satire: Who could possibly think such a move would bring the two sides closer to compromise? It had to be some Lizz Winstead hashtag game: #insaneGOPamendmentstoCR. But of course it was for real. Bringing the two sides closer to compromise wasn't the point: Republicans have been using the continuing resolution debate to reward their most extreme and demented constituencies. As written, the measure apparently would have denied women other preventive services, like mammograms, without a copay. Why not deny us dental care? Or attach a rider making it illegal to wear shoes?
Luckily it went nowhere – which is where it seems our country is going, right now.
Unbelievably, GOP women (apart from Michele Bachmann) have been mostly off camera during the shutdown debate. Did you see that cute photo House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tweeted, of his House colleagues waiting in vain for a conference with the Senate? All white men, nobody of color, no women (unless those were binders full of women on that table).

Targeting Obamacare, which is popular with women, and specifically going after the contraception provision -- that wasn't in Reince Priebus' rebranding report, I don't think. But they knew these policies would be unpopular with women: Polling for Republican members on the politics of a government shutdown to defund Obamacare found a huge gender gap, with 61 percent of Republican women opposed to the idea, while 48 percent of men favored it. The GOP keeps digging an electoral hole for itself with women, and they don't seem to care.

One hundred and forty-three years ago today, on 9 April, 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Union Commander Ulysses S. Grant, marking the effective end of the South's struggle for independence.
It was a fateful day for the South, and in particular for my great grandfather and his four elder brothers, all of whom were fighting for the Confederacy.
On that day, the eldest brother Joshua Lazarus Moses was killed a few hours after Lee, unbeknownst to the troops elsewhere, had surrendered. Josh was commanding an artillery battalion (Culpepper's Battery or Culpepper's Light Artillery) that was firing the last shots in defense of Mobile, before being overrun by a Union force outnumbering his 13 to one. In this battle, Fort Blakeley, one of his brothers, Horace, was captured, and another, Perry, was wounded.
Joshua had also been in the thick of the fighting in the War's opening battle, when Fort Sumter was attacked in April, 1861. Josh was the last Confederate Jew to fall in battle. His first cousin, Albert Moses Luria, was the first, killed at age 19 at the Battle of Seven Pines (Fair Oaks) in Virginia on 31 May, 1862.
While Lee was surrendering at Appomattox, a 2,500-man unit attached to Sherman's army, known as Potter's Raiders, was heading towards my family's hometown of Sumter, South Carolina. Sherman had just burned nearby Columbia, and it was feared that his troops were headed to Sumter to do the same.
My then 16-year-old great grandfather, Andrew Jackson Moses, rode out to defend his hometown, along with some 157 other teenagers, invalids, old men, and the wounded from the local hospital. It was a mission as hopeless as it was valiant, but Sumter's rag-tag defenders did manage to hold off Potter's battle-seasoned veterans for over an hour before being overwhelmed by this vastly superior force, outnumbering theirs by some 15 to one.
Jack got away with a price on his head, and Sumter was not burned after all. But some buildings were, and there are documented instances of murder, rape, and arson by the Yankees.
The fifth bother, Isaac Harby Moses, having served with distinction in combat in Wade Hampton's cavalry, later rode home from North Carolina after the Battle of Bentonville (North Carolina), the War's last major battle, where he commanded his company, all of the officers having been killed or wounded. He never surrendered to anyone, his Mother proudly observed in her memoirs.
Earlier, as a member of a company of Citadel Cadets, he had his horse shot out from under him, and was attacked by a Union soldier wielding a sword. He was among those who fired the very first shots of the conflict, when his cadet company opened up on the Union ship, Star of the West, which was attempting to resupply the besieged Fort Sumter in January, 1861, three months before the War officially began.
Over two dozen members of the extended Moses family fought in the War, serving and working closely with such legendary generals as Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and Wade Hampton, and firing some of the first and last shots of the War in its opening and closing battles. They fought on horseback and on ships, in the trenches and in the infantry. They built fortifications, led their men in charges, and one had responsibility for provisioning an entire army corps of some 50,000 men. The extended family sacrificed at least nine of its sons for The Cause.
Like their comrades-in-arms, the Moses' were fighting for their homeland — not for slavery, as is so often said, but for their families, homes, and country. Put simply, most Confederate soldiers felt they were fighting because an invading army from the North was trying to kill them, burn their homes, and destroy their cities.
The hard-pressed Confederates were usually heavily outnumbered, outgunned, and out-supplied, but rarely outfought, showing amazing courage, skill, and valor.
The best known of the Moses family Confederates was Major Raphael Moses, General Longstreet's chief commissary officer, whose three sons also fought for the South. Moses ended up attending the last meeting and carrying out the Last Order of the Confederate government.
He was ordered to deliver the last of the Confederate treasury, $40,000 in gold and silver bullion, to help feed and supply the defeated Confederate soldiers in nearby hospitals, and straggling home after the War — weary, hungry, often sick, shoeless and in tattered uniforms. With the help of a small group of determined armed guards, Moses successfully carried out the order from President Jefferson Davis, despite repeated attempts by mobs to forcibly take the bullion.
The anniversary of this fateful day should serve to remind us what the brave and beleaguered Southern soldiers and civilians were up against. Perhaps it will help people understand why, in this day when the South is so often vilified, native Southerners still revere their ancestors' courage, and continue rightfully to take much pride in this heritage.
The Best of Lewis Regenstein
Will the Turkish army start pulling back from Syria?
As usual, Turkish diplomacy is going through yet another hectic period due to developments on multiple fronts.
On Dec. 11, Russian President Vladimir Putin paid a brief visit to Ankara after short trips to Syria and Egypt, having his third face-to-face meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in less than a month.
Putin issued two main important messages in his visit to Russia's permanent military base Hmeymim in Syria on Dec. 11. Firstly, he said the “war on terror” in Syrian territory has nearly been accomplished, thanks to the Russian military intervention since September 2015. He also said he issued a formal order for the commencement of a gradual pull back of Russia's deployment from the war-torn country.
It seems that Putin's unannounced visit to Syria, a first since the civil war broke out, was a surprise to Ankara, which was hoping to discuss in detail with Putin the ongoing tension over U.S. President Donald Trump's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Obviously, the Russian president's priority was Syria – unlike Turkey, which has become the most vocal regional and Muslim-majority country in challenging Trump's Jerusalem gambit.
However, Putin has of late opted to take a more balanced and cautious stance, in a bid not to lose Russia's standing in the eyes of both Israel and Palestine. Moscow may be hoping to one day gain the status of “honest broker” between the two sides, if conditions ever prevail for a resumption of the peace process.
Going back to the Syrian theater, it may be perfectly claimed that Russia's announcement that it will begin withdrawing troops constitutes a strong message to other countries that currently have military presence in this country, namely Turkey and the U.S.
In his addresses both in Syria and Turkey, Putin made clear that it's time to settle a political solution to the civil war and all actors should be ready to genuinely contribute to it. One dimension of this call requires the active participation of the mentioned countries to provide a political framework to this end, and the other is about the need of the withdrawal of other foreign troops within Syrian territories.
Maybe it's because of this Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Dec. 12 expressed Ankara's skepticism over to what extent Russian troops will be withdrawn from Syria. Furthermore, Çavuşoğlu recalled that Russia will maintain two large military bases in Syria with a sizeable military force in the field.
Although he did not say it directly, he also underlined the fact that the People's Protection Units (YPG) in the Afrin canton of Syria was still posing a threat to Turkey and that the Turkish government would never hesitate to act to clear this area from threatening forces.
Turkey still has troops in Idlib, as part of plans to establish de-escalation zones, and in al-Bab, as part of its Euphrates Shield Operation in northern Syria, and an imminent withdrawal of its military presence should not be anticipated.
No hasty moves should be expected from the Turkish army, as a solution to the Syrian war is still far from visible.
One of the notable offseason storylines Cincinnati is facing this offseason is the health of Andy Dalton.
A fractured thumb suffered on Dec. 13 of last season effectively ended Dalton's season as he missed the final four games of the season, including the Wild Card playoff loss to Pittsburgh. Though Dalton was targeting the Divisional Round for a return, there was doubt he'd even be able to play then, at least at an effective level.
Dalton admitted as much in an interview Mac Engel of the Star-Telegram, where the Bengals quarterback also said he's been cleared to throw again.
Andy Dalton says the thumb is good, that the X-rays are clean and that his doctor gave him the go-ahead to resume throwing this week. Dalton suffered a torn right thumb in a loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Dec. 13. It effectively ended the best season of his career. He said even had the Bengals defeated the Steelers in the AFC Wild Card game he would likely not have been OK to play, but he would have tried regardless in the AFC Divisional round.
Dalton originally suffered the injury in a Week 14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. With 5:06 remaining in the first quarter, Dalton targeted Giovani Bernard on a running back screen around the line of scrimmage, but defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt intercepted the ball. As Dalton clipped Tuitt's legs to make the tackle, his throwing hand landed against Tuitt's knee and fractured it in the process.
Despite not playing in the final month of this season, Dalton still threw for 25 touchdowns and 3,250 yards vs just seven interceptions, good for a career-high 106.3 passer rating. He also rushed for three scores and helped lead the Bengals to a 10-2 start and were atop the AFC standings before going down.
With the offseason now here, we're still about two months until OTAs begin and Dalton gets a chance to throw in an NFL practice again. He'll probably get together with some of his receivers and train at some point this offseason, not to mention making a few trips to see Dr. Tom House.
All of this will hopefully help lead to Dalton having as good of a 2016 season as his 2015 was before the injury. He was on the verge of a Pro Bowl berth and possible All-Pro selection. That's how good he was, and he should perform at a similar level in 2016.
The Mall of America turned 25 on Aug. 11. Here are four moments in the mall's history that stand out. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)
The Mall of America — all 5.6 MILLION square feet of it — turns 25 Friday, so let's stop worrying about Guam for just a moment to celebrate this milestone.
Happy birthday, Mall of America!
You have given capitalism and cement companies so much to celebrate. Look how big you are! We could fit 347 Statues of Liberty — laying down, side-to-side — inside your corridors. That's a lot of liberty, especially for Minnesota. And you have obviously heeded grandma's advice to “never grow up,” collecting more than 170,000 Legos for your playroom.

We are so proud of the American symbol you have become. More than 40 million people visit you every year — to ride your roller coasters, shop your 520 stores, and occasionally make headlines with crazy stunts, powerful protests, and terrorism threats not typically seen in mere 100-store malls.
Here are some of our favorite memories…
A desperate attempt to reunite with a cat
Serge Vorobyov, a popular YouTuber, stopped by in 2013 to shower $1,000 dollar bills from the top floor. This stirred quite a commotion and raised a number of questions from TV reporters and police. One was, “Why did you throw $1,000 bills in a mall?” His answer: publicity. This required some followup questions. “When asked why he wanted the publicity,” the Associated Press reported, “he said he wanted his cat back from his estranged wife.” Vorobyov did not get the cat. He did, however, get cited for disorderly conduct.
‘From my cold, dead hands'
Charlton Heston in “The Ten Commandments”(United Press)
In 1994, after an appearance to support a Republican candidate for Senate, actor and National Rifle Association spokesman Charlton Heston was confronted by protesters while having lunch at a mall restaurant. We don't know if this happened in the food court at Sbarro. In fact we don't know much more about this incident. But it was Charlton Heston — Moses himself, for God's sake — so we felt an obligation to include it.
‘Getting arrested as protesters is as American as apple pie'
Protesting at Mall of America is kind of a thing. There have been dozens of large rallies there during the last quarter century. Political. Racial. Religious. It makes sense as a location — it's super big. Also, it's symbolic. Recall the name: Mall of America! At a Black Lives protest in 2015, one protester said, “Getting arrested as protesters is as American as apple pie,” which has no doubt been served in vast quantities at the food court over the years. The symbolism has also made it a target of terrorist threats. Total buzzkill.

‘Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'
That's Harlem Globetrotters player Zeus McClurkin making that noise — wheeeeeeee — as he zooms down a zip line high above the amusement park, and shoots a basketball at a rim waaaaaaaaaaay down below. Score! (You can watch the video here.) He shoots another from even higher — six stories. Score! Then he tossed a ball from the ferris wheel. Score! “Yeah, baby!”
Mall of America. Yeah baby.

The Detroit Lions were awarded cornerback Josh Thomas off waivers today from the New York Jets.
Thomas appeared in just one game for the Jets and three for the Seattle Seahawks earlier this year after playing his first three NFL seasons with the Carolina Panthers.
He made headlines Monday, before he was cut, when he tweeted that his playbook and passport were stolen. According to NJ.com, the items were taken along Thomas' luggage in New Jersey.
The Lions, who placed right tackle LaAdrian Waddle on season-ending injured reserve today with a partially torn ACL in his left knee, have had just four cornerbacks on their 53-man roster since they waived Danny Gorrer in early November.
No. 4 cornerback Mohammed Seisay suffered a hamstring injury in Sunday's 16-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings and was limited in practice today, and the Lions brought two free-agent defensive backs in for a visit on Tuesday.
With Waddle out, undrafted rookie Cornelius Lucas will take over at right tackle for the rest of the season.

US first lady Michelle Obama has denounced Republican Donald Trump and passionately backed Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
"The hateful language... from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country," she said, to loud cheers and applause.
"Don't stoop to their level. Our motto is, when they go low, we go high."
Earlier, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders urged Democrats to back Mrs Clinton.
She will accept the party's presidential nomination on Thursday, when a roll call of how states' delegates are voting is to be read out.
"While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths," Mr Sanders said.
Some supporters of the senator, who had been Mrs Clinton's rival in the Democratic primary, booed at mention of Mrs Clinton's name; others wore duct tape with the word "silenced" over their mouths.
Mrs Obama's speech was widely seen as an attack on Mr Trump, although she did not mention the Republican nominee by name.
She said she wanted her husband to be succeeded by "somebody who knows this job and takes it seriously" and that could only be Mrs Clinton.
Five times Michelle Obama referred to Donald Trump
"When someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don't stoop to their level''
"We urge them [our daughters] to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or faith"
"Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great"
Issues facing a president "cannot be boiled down to 140 characters"
Ideal president "can't have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out"
Watch: Michelle Obama speech in full
Because of the Democrats' candidate, she said, "my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States."
In other remarks, she praised Mrs Clinton as a "true public servant" who had shown "devotion to our nation's children" and "never buckles under pressure".
After her speech, President Obama wrote on Twitter: "Incredible speech by an incredible woman. Couldn't be more proud & our country has been blessed to have her as FLOTUS [first lady]. I love you, Michelle."

Mr Trump, who has criticised his rivals, both Republican and Democrat, in sometimes colourful language on Twitter, said Mr Sanders had "sold out" to Mrs Clinton.
He also condemned other speakers at the Democratic convention including senators Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, but made no mention of Mrs Obama.
In other key moments from the convention on Monday:
Senator Warren attacked the business record of Mr Trump
Comedian Sarah Silverman, who supported Mr Sanders, told his supporters to get behind Mrs Clinton

The Washington Post said the party's "opening day of discord" ended on a "high note" but USA Today said the Democrats proved "they can be dysfunctional too".
The Boston Globe meanwhile asked: "Has Bernie Sanders lost control of his delegates?"
But it was the First Lady who was credited with invigorating things. This was Hillary's convention, but it was "Michelle's night" says Gail Collins in the New York Times.
The LA Times says she "delivered one of the most passionate Clinton endorsements of the night".

CAR OWNERS WHO allow unaccompanied learner drivers to use their vehicles could face prosecution for the first time under new measures approved by Cabinet today.
In addition, ministers also approved proposals which will allow gardaí seize a vehicle if a learner driver is discovered to be driving without a qualified driver present.
The amendments – dubbed the ‘Clancy amendment' - come within one month in which a man who lost his wife and daughter in a horrific accident involving a learner driver launched a scathing attack on Transport Minister Shane Ross for failure to fully implement promised law reforms.
The car Noel Clancy's wife was driving was struck by that of learner driver Susan Gleeson in December 2015.
His wife, Geraldine Clancy and his daughter Louise were tragically killed.
Since their deaths, he has been campaigning for a change in the law that would make the car owner and driver equally accountable in the law.
This is not the only case. Last year, an unaccompanied driver who was speeding when he hit and killed a teenager was jailed for nine months.
22-year-old Gareth Jones swerved to avoid three of the boy's friends as they crossed the road but hit Paul McCormack, 16, who had changed direction to try to get back to the path.
Ross had committed to the new legislation last year, but it's understood it ran into legal difficulties.
The minister said last year that the change in the law was needed.
He explained that currently gardaí have the power to detain vehicles in a number of circumstances such as where the vehicle is untaxed, uninsured or does not have an NCT.
“An extension of this power to cover vehicles being driven by unaccompanied learners would require an amendment to Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.”

Toronto police say a man is in custody after a sex trade worker was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and held against her will in an east-end home for five days.
Investigators say the 27-year-old victim was approached by a man in the area of Sherbourne and Shuter streets on March 31. Investigators say a “business transaction” took place and the man brought her to a residence in the area of Dundas Street East and Jones Avenue. When the woman arrived, police say she felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave but the man pulled out a handgun, threatened her and refused to let her go.
According to police, she was held at the home for five days and during that time, she was bound with duct tape and handcuffs and was repeatedly sexually assaulted.
Eventually on April 5, police say the woman was able to break free and run out the front door of the home. Officers were notified of the incident by a passerby who heard her screams and called police.
According to police, when officers arrived on scene, the man had fled. The suspect, who is known to police, was later located and arrested on April 6.
“It appears, through investigation, she was targeted, that he has some form of ritualistic actions involved in the crime as well,” Insp. Joanna Beaven-Desjardins said at a news conference Tuesday.
“I can't get into the details of it but he did do things that we are very unfamiliar with.”
The victim was taken to hospital but has since been released and is in "good condition," Beaven-Desjardins said.
She added that the nature and severity of the crime have led investigators to believe that the suspect, who is from Timmins and spent time in Chatham and London, may have victimized other women.
“When we get crimes of this type, that we believe are transient or can happen over many jurisdictions, we notify the OPP, their serial predator unit, and they look into the information that they have,” Beaven-Desjardins told reporters.
The accused, 43-year-old Rejean Hermel Perron, of Toronto, has been charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault.
"I'm asking any sex trade worker if they want to come forward and give us any information relating to anything like this, please do give us a call," Beaven-Desjardins said.
"If you don't want to proceed criminally, please call us and we can hook you up with the proper services through victim services."
Anyone with information about this investigation can contact police by calling 416-808-7474 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477).
California officials say they won't cite the fishermen who hooked a great white shark that bit a swimmer near the Manhattan Beach pier.
Authorities say the 7-foot shark was thrashing to get free from the line for more than 40 minutes Saturday before it bit a swimmer who was treated at a hospital.
It's illegal to fish for great whites in California.
The fishermen said they accidentally hooked the shark and didn't immediately cut the line because they hoped to guide it away from people in the water.
Capt. Rebecca Hartman of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife tells the Los Angeles Times there's no reason to believe they were targeting sharks.
Meanwhile, city officials have banned pier fishing until September while they consider new regulations.

A former Director of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency on Tuesday said that the Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who attacked Mumbai 2008 were trained on Pakistani soil . In an article published in Dawn, Tariq Khosa said that the investigation had established clear links to the LeT, such as the fact that the fishing trawler used by the gunmen to infiltrate Mumbai was traced to Pakistan. Welcoming Khosa's article, former Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh said that India now needed to bring up the points raised by the ex-FIA Director during National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's upcoming meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Sartaj Aziz. Ten gunmen infiltrated Mumbai from the Arabian Sea in November 2008 and killed 166 people.Even as the Congress took out a march on Tuesday to protest against Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's decision to suspend 25 of its MPs from the House, other opposition parties called on the Speaker to revoke her decision . The Biju Janata Dal and the Trinamool Congress asked Mahajan to reconsider her order. Officials from other parties, including Bharatiya Janata Party ally Shiromani Akali Dal, said that the suspensions were an excessive punishment. Several opposition parties, including the Janata Dal (United), the Samajwadi Party and Left bloc, boycotted the Lok Sabha. Meanwhile, the parliamentary panel of the BJP passed a resolution declaring that the Congress had “abdicated its responsibilities of a constructive opposition”.The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday questioned the delay in executing the people convicted of assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Appearing before a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, Tamil Nadu counsel Rakesh Dwivedi noted that the previous United Progressive Alliance government had not hanged Gandhi's assassins despite having been in power for ten years. Dismissing accusations that the Jayalalithaa-led government in the state had remitted the convicts' executions for political gains, Dwivedi said that the Congress had taken too long to dispose of their mercy petitions. The state's arguments were made in response to a petition by the Centre challenging the Tamil Nadu government's decision to release the convicts after the Supreme Court's decided to commute their death sentences.After reviewing its decision to ban 857 websites on the grounds of morality, the Central government on Tuesday unblocked some websites that were found not to contain any pornographic material. The decision was taken after Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad chaired a high-level meeting to review the order. Maintaining that the government was committed to the freedom of communication on the internet, Prasad said the order to ban the websites was issued after the Supreme Court asked his ministry take action on a list of websites provided by a petitioner. However, a government official later said that the ban would still be in effect on portals containing material such as child pornography.Several people were feared dead after two express trains derailed at the same spot while crossing a bridge in the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday night. Officials said that the Kamayani Express and the Janata Express were trying to cross a portion of the bridge submerged underwater. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said that emergency medical teams and relief personnel had been rushed to the site of the accident.
Satuday was Yarn Shop Day: a day dedicated to celebrating everything that's great about your local bricks-and-mortar yarn shop. Now in it's third year, the day is promoted by Let's Knit magazine as a campaign to support independent knitting shops across the UK.
Never one to turn down a yarn shop visit, and more than happy to support this lovely idea, I dutifully gravitated towards my own local yarn shop on Saturday afternoon to spend some time wandering around that familiar space; appreciating the wool, stacked high in its cubed shelving like insulation lining the walls; the needles, hanging neatly on the pillar in the centre of the shop; and the friendly faces crowded round the small table to the left of the till, chatting about knitting patterns and exchanging tips over the rhythmic hum of clicking needles.
Perched on the corner of a Victorian grey granite tenement block in Rosemount, Wool for Ewe is Aberdeen's only independent yarn shop. Located to the north of the city centre, Rosemount is characterised by its community feel; and the knitting shop is nestled comfortably amongst the array of pleasantly traditional independent businesses lining Rosemount Place: the butcher, the cheese shop, the cake shop, and a cluster of boutiques and vintage shops. The area is a refreshing contrast to the fast paced commercialism of the city centre, and Wool for Ewe is like a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered by the knitters of the city who are looking for something that can't be found in Hobbycraft or the John Lewis haberdashery. Needless to say, it's a firm favourite of mine.
Usually quiet when I make the occasional after-work pilgrimage; the shop was busy when I stepped in on Saturday and I had to weave in and out of other local yarn admirers as I made my way round. Yarn Shop Day festivities were in full swing as free patterns were advertised, beginner projects passed out to encourage younger knitters, and glasses of Prosecco and cups of tea offered. Prosecco and wool shopping – what else could you want on a Saturday afternoon?!
After several laps of the shop, I decided upon a relatively modest yarn purchase (it was Yarn Shop Day after all, I couldn't buy something…): two small hanks of Manos Silk Blend Fino in Stellar. Manos Del Uruguay, The Hands of Uruguay, is a non-profit organisation which aims to bring economic and social opportunities to the rural women of Uruguay. A blend of Merino and Silk, the yarn is hand dyed in large kettles so no two hanks are exactly alike. The gorgeous colours caught my eye and, combined with the charitable cause, I felt that it was a fitting ‘special' purchase for Yarn Shop Day.
I left the shop hoping that everyone else leaves with the same sense of satisfaction that I do; and that everyone else has the same soft spot for their local yarn shop. You can find almost every yarn imaginable on the internet, and I think we've all – myself included – been guilty of getting carried away on Love Knitting, Wool Warehouse and other wonderful websites that can deliver yarn beautifulness to your doorstep at the click of a button – who wouldn't?
But on the internet you can't find the feeling of unexpectedly stumbling across a beautiful hank of yarn hidden at the back of a shelf; the pleasant surprise of discovering a yarn shop down a side street in a foreign city; or the act of handling the yarns, feeling the different fibres as you try to decide which to buy amidst an inner struggle of bank balance versus yarn addiction whilst a fellow knitter looks on sympathetically, because they've been there too.
For me, these experiences are all part of what it means to be a knitter and, although I may like the occasional yarn delivery straight from the internet, I know that I will always return to my local yarn shop, and that I will continue to feverishly seek out the local yarn shops of other cities; because, to me, this is what it means to fully immerse myself in the world of knitting and yarn.

The well-paying summer jobs that in previous years seemed like a birthright have grown scarce, and pre-professional internships are disappearing as companies cut back across the board. Recession-strapped parents don't always have the means or will to bankroll starter apartments or art tours of Tuscany .
So many college students and recent graduates are heading to where they least expected: back home, and facing an unfamiliar prospect: downtime, maybe too much of it. To a high-achieving generation whose schedules were once crammed with extracurricular activities meant to propel them into college, it feels like an empty summer — eerie, and a bit scary.
“Things have changed drastically,” said Ron Alsop, author of “The Trophy Kids Grow Up: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaking Up the Workplace,” a book that only last year portrayed young workers as entitled and in a hurry. “It has to be a huge wake-up call for this generation.”
Numbers provide the backdrop to the story — not just the grimly familiar national unemployment rate, 9.5 percent in June, but the even scarier, less publicized unemployment figure for 16- to 19-year-olds, which has hit 24 percent, up from 16.1 percent two years ago. Internships available to college students have fallen 21 percent since last year, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Across the country, there are countless tales like that of Morgan Henderson, a student at the University of San Francisco, who, along with friends, planned a big road trip to Las Vegas this summer. With so few of the friends finding jobs, they downgraded plans to a road trip to Reno, then to no road trip at all. They're spending time watching DVDs at one another's houses.
Or Kathryn Estrada, a high school senior in Hialeah, Fla., who has no summer job after Circuit City , which employed her during the school year, went out of business. She is finding that even this early in the summer, attempts to while away the hours playing Scrabble and Cranium have grown stale. “We all just wish school would start so we would have something to do,” she said.
Or Will Ehrenfeld, a political science major at Tufts , who worked at a think tank last year and this summer was aiming higher: a White House internship. When the White House didn't come through, and neither did the State Department nor dozens of companies he applied to, Mr. Ehrenfeld, 20, moved back home to Vernon, Conn. Even the local Boston Market had no work.
Mr. Ehrenfeld, a top student who has always held leadership positions in clubs and academic groups, loafs through days, rolling out of bed around 11 and reading or playing trumpet or guitar. Nights, he sometimes meets up with friends who also have nowhere that they have to be in the morning, and they share a few cheap beers. “At worst, misery continues to have company,” he said.

While young people in earlier decades might have cherished the chance to goof off and sleep in for a few months, the current generation, experts like Mr. Alsop are apt to point out, “have always been told they can achieve anything they can put their mind to.”
“They were always given trophies just for showing up,” he said. “Now, they're being told ‘no' when they really want a job or an internship.”
To them, a staycation at Mom and Dad's can feel more like house arrest.
If the only problem were tedium, students might find a recessionary summer unpleasant but endurable. But some expressed concern that the economic gloom might be a preview of harsh career realities that await.

“The worst thing about this summer is the lack of hope felt by so many kids,” Lydia Wileden, a Barnard undergraduate, wrote in an e-mail message. “College students ready to thrust themselves into work find nothing, and those most in need are edged out by older, more skilled individuals who are overqualified for such foot-in-the-door opportunities. I worry about how this employment drought will affect my generation in the future.”
There may be reason for concern. Students who enter the job market during a recession can see their wages lag behind comparable students who graduated in better times for as long as 15 years, according to a recent study by Lisa B. Kahn, an economist at the Yale School of Management.
Even for students who remain optimistic about their long-term career prospects, an unexpected move home — back under the roof of Mom and Dad, where many had barely alighted in years except for brief Thanksgiving breaks — can require an attitude adjustment.

“Communication patterns are different when students come back from college,” said Roni Cohen-Sandler, a clinical psychologist in Weston, Conn., specializing in adolescent issues. “Kids may not be as interested in sharing who they're hanging out with and why. The level of disclosure is different, and parents have not made the shift in their mind. They're asking a lot of questions, and students are chafing.”
When students try to stave off the boredom by watching television, parents may wonder aloud if there is not a more productive use of their time. Curfews and household chores that seemed natural at 16 can seem oppressive at 20.
This has been the experience of Kelly Fabian, an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley , who hoped to study art history in Rome this summer, but returned home to Orange County, Calif., instead, when her family asked her to work to help pay her tuition.

It's an adjustment, she said. Living on her own for two years, including summers, she got used to doing chores like washing dishes and taking out the recycling — but not when instructed to.
“It's not weird doing them, it's weird having someone tell you to do them,” she said.
Ms. Fabian said she was close to her parents and valued the time spent together, but the new proximity did take getting used to, on all sides. Ms. Fabian, 20, found work at a cable-television company, and with four family members sharing two cars, she commutes for nearly an hour each way with her father, Jim Fabian.
The opportunity to bond is, in theory, delightful, she said — but does it have to be at 7 a.m.? “My Dad is a morning person and I most certainly am not,” she said. She needs a second cup of coffee just to make her lips move. When they reach for the radio knobs to pass the time, father and daughter encounter a generation gap: He likes sports talk radio; she would rather listen to the New Pornographers.
“I'm a relic of the '70s — I still listen to the Stones, Led Zeppelin , Fleetwood Mac ,” said Mr. Fabian, a financial consultant. “Her music , I'll just describe it as different.“
Some other college students unexpectedly back home described frictions with their families that were less amusing and more fraught. Daniel Bortz, a junior at Syracuse University who was unable to find a summer job for the first time in five years, told of unpleasant friction in his household over money.
In the short term, the lost summer of 2009 might actually be a blessing, some psychologists said, especially because members of this generation have lived their lives like track stars trying to run a marathon at the pace of a 100-meter dash — their parents typically waiting at every turn with a stopwatch.
“Parents have really put a lot of pressure on the kids — everything has been organized, they're all taking A.P. courses, then summer hits and they're going to learning camps,” said Peter A. Spevak, a psychologist in Rockville, Md. Now, he said, with opportunities for achievement at a minimum this summer, “there is something to be said about sitting out on a warm evening and looking at the stars — they need more of this contemplation and self-evaluation.”
Sara Germano, a senior at Fordham University who was hoping to find a journalism internship in New York, ended up moving home to Albany , where she found part-time work as a research assistant. And she has gotten to know her family again after an educational career that usually led her off on one adventure or another during vacations, so that, she said, “I come home on Thanksgiving, they don't even know who I am.”

Now she has time to watch Yankees games with her younger brother and sister, and in the evenings, she sometimes drops in to the bar that her father owns. At 21, she is now able to share a drink with him and to talk sports and politics with the regulars.
“I think he enjoys having a child who's matured and can talk about adult things and enjoy adult pastimes,” she said. “Since I've been gone so long, it's all new territory.”
Her father, Phil Germano, agreed. “She completes the family,” he said.
Discovery of amino acid glycine in gas and dust cloud adds weight to the idea that comets crashing to Earth could have brought chemicals crucial to life
Scientists on the Rosetta mission have found building blocks for life in the cloud of gas and dust around the icy body known as comet 67P. The discovery backs up the idea that similar “dirty snowballs” could have been involved in kickstarting life on Earth.
The theory that extraterrestrial objects crashing into our planet could have brought chemicals crucial to the emergence of life has long been mooted, with an array of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - already discovered on meteorites. But the new research adds weight to the notion that comets could also have played a role.
“It shows that even the very primitive bodies like comets contain a complex chemical soup, independent of [the] sun and Earth,” said Kathrin Altwegg, lead author of the research from the University of Bern. “They contain everything needed for life - except energy.”
Despite the untimely demise of the Philae lander that touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in November 2014, the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has continued to orbit the icy body, capturing data with its fleet of onboard instruments, among them a mass spectrometer dubbed Rosina.
Writing in the journal Scientific Advances, a team of researchers from Europe and the US describe how they analysed data from Rosina, recorded as the comet sped towards its closest approach to the sun last summer.
The results reveal that the comet's coma - the cloud of gas and dust that envelops the comet as it warms - contains the amino acid glycine, as well as the chemicals from which it is formed: methylamine and ethylamine. The equipment also detected the presence of small molecules such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, as well as phosphorus - a key component of DNA.
Scientists have previously reported evidence of chemicals including glycine in material shed by the comet Wild-2, captured by Nasa's Stardust probe and brought back to Earth in 2006 for analysis. But the new research marks the first time that glycine has been detected in space from a comet's coma. Using equipment onboard Rosetta has advantages, say the authors. “We could measure glycine coming off the comet without any human intervention,” said Altwegg, pointing out that the approach means the possibility of complications from contamination is minimal.
The glycine, Altwegg believes, is likely to have formed billions of years ago in the thin layers of ice surrounding dust grains in either the interstellar medium or the cloud of material that gave rise to the solar system - the so-called protosolar nebula. These grains eventually aggregated to form a comet. That, says Altwegg, suggests our own planet might not be the only one to have benefited from the impact of icy bodies. “They could have sparked life on Earth by impacting on an ocean,” she said. “But even nicer is the idea that we have shown that amino acid is ‘universal'. Its formation can happen in any protosolar nebula and then maybe spark life somewhere else.”
Jason Dworkin, chief of astrochemistry at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, says the research bolsters the findings by his team from the Stardust probe. “It is very impressive detection and some important results. I don't know that it is surprising — but it is eagerly anticipated,” he said of the Rosetta research, adding that the results pose an intriguing question. “Are these cometary results telling us that comets only have glycine and no other amino acids, or that they have other amino acids but their abundances are lower than their detection limits?”
But Altwegg and her colleagues believe that it is not surprising that glycine is the only amino acid detected by Rosina, pointing out that other amino acids are all thought to need liquid water to form.
Dworkin, a project scientist for Nasa's OSIRIS-REx - a spacecraft intended to retrieve part of an asteroid known as Bennu - believes that to fully understand the makeup of comets we need to bring chunks of these icy rocks back to earth. “These are the simplest, smallest biologically relevant compounds,” he said of the latest results. “To say more, and to look at the details of the chemistry, we need to look at a sample. We need to go to a comet, get a sample, bring it back to Earth and study it in a laboratory.”
While the data gathered by Rosetta's many instruments will keep scientists busy for years to come, the mission is currently expected to end in September when the spacecraft will be directed on a slow collision course with the surface of comet 67P.
Rappler compares the statements of supposed former Davao Death Squad member Edgar Matobato with official documents, news reports, and interviews
Published 3:00 PM, October 02, 2016
MANILA, Philippines – Self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato's “confessions” during the two Senate hearings on extrajudicial killings were enough to make anyone afraid.
At the same time, many doubted his credibility because of the many “inconsistencies” in his narrations as an alleged former member of the Davao Death Squad (DDS).
Senators pointed to these inconsistencies as proof that Matobato's stories were all “kuwentong kutsero (tall tales)".
For instance, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano “tested” Matobato by asking him to point among an array of adhesive tapes to the "masking tape" the DDS allegedly used when they disposed of their dead victims. Cayetano included "packing tape" in the selection – this kind of tape was known to have been used in the murders, based on photos that had circulated on social media. But Matobato called it "masking tape".
Netizens, however, were quick to point out that most people generally associate some objects with more common brands or names. For instance, most toothpaste are referred to as "Colgate" as baby diapers are called "Pampers".
Besides the masking tape issue, other details, however, did not add up. We compared statements of Matobato to previously published news reports, interviews, and official documents to see what matched and what didn't.
Mosque bombing in 1993
What Matobato said:
The Mosque bombing was done to retaliate against Muslims after the 1993 bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral, also known as the Davao Cathedral, in Davao City.
Matobato said he hurled a grenade at the Bangkerohan Mosque upon the orders of then mayor Duterte. “Umorder si Duterte na massacre-in 'yung mosque ng mga Muslim (Duterte issued the order to destroy the mosque of the Muslims),” he said during the Senate hearing.
After the incident, Matobato said the group was ordered by Duterte to abduct and kill Muslims suspected to be behind the cathedral bombing. The victims, he added, were buried at a quarry owned by a certain Ben Laud.
What Rappler found out:
The bombing incidents – both at the cathedral and mosque – did happen based on existing local and international news reports published in 1993.
The San Pedro Cathedral bombing happened during a December Mass in 1993, leaving at least 6 dead and injuring at least 130. A quick look at the history of bombings in Davao City, meanwhile, showed that the mosque bombing happened 8 hours after the cathedral bombing. News reports identified the perpetrators as “suspected Christian militants” who used two grenades to retaliate. The mosque, however, was not named in news reports about the incident.
However, Matobato's account about the fate of the suspects of the cathedral bombing differs from what was documented in news reports.
He claimed that the DDS was able to abduct, kill, and bury the alleged perpetrators of the bombing, but a 1995 news report by the Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN) said the alleged mastermind Sahib Ponso was arrested in September two years after the cathedral bombing. He was identified as an “urban terrorist force leader of Abu Sayyaf.”
'Sali Makdum' the ‘terrorist'
What Matobato said:
A certain "Sali Makdum" was reportedly ordered “liquidated” by Duterte in 2002 because he was a suspected terrorist.
In his sworn affidavit submitted to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in 2014, Matobato narrated that Makdum was a Pakistani who had no record with the Bureau of Immigration since he came to the Philippines “through backdoor entry from Malaysia.”
Matobato befriended the alleged terrorist over a span of 3 months. He was able to do so because Makdum's girlfriend was his wife's cousin.
After “months of knowing each other,” Makdum allegedly asked Matobato to look for land in the Island City of Samal so he could turn it into a livelihood training center. He also asked Matobato to purchase “100 units of Garand rifles, 50 M14 rifles, and 100 armalite rifles.”
Makdum was “arrested” on the second floor of the Penaplata Market and was brought to Barangay Ma-a, Davao City. According to Matobato, the group slit his throat and took turns stabbing him to death.
The operation, he claimed, was known by Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Ronald dela Rosa since he was head of Davao City's Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) at the time.
What Rappler found out:
The death of Makdum was neither documented nor reported by local and national newspapers.
Makdum's mother-in-law Lydia Marquez, in an interview with CNN Philippines last September 20, clarified that Makdum was Turkish, not Pakistani. A quick search online yielded the name “Makhdoom Faisal Saleh”, very close to "Sali Makdum", but identified as a prominent former Pakistani minister, not a terrorist.
Marquez also said that Matobato once tried to sell a piece of land to Makdum. According to Marquez, Makdum was later abducted, not arrested, during a meeting with Matobato in his favorite eatery in Davao City. The transaction is consistent with the "sideline" or side job of Matobato as real estate "broker", which he told Rappler about.
Matobato also claimed Dela Rosa headed PAOCTF-Davao. He was correct as Dela Rosa was PAOCTF Eastern Mindanao chief from 1991-2001. The task force was, however, abolished in 2001 under the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo after some members were alleged to be involved in several major crimes.
By the time Makdum was killed in 2002, PAOCTF was no longer in existence, and Dela Rosa was no longer its Davao head.
After his stint with PAOCTF, Dela Rosa said he was assigned to Catitipan, Davao City and was sent to the PNP National Headquarters to work under the Directorate for Human Resource and Doctrine Development.
More than 10 years later, no one has been charged for the disappearance of Makdum.
Jun Pala: Duterte enemy?
What Matobato said:
Matobato claimed during the Senate hearing that Duterte, through his alleged "righthand man”, SPO4 Arthur Lascañas, ordered the death of radio broadcaster Jun Pala.
He said that Duterte got fed up with Pala's non-stop attacks against him in his radio shows.
The “operation team” that conducted the killing, Matobato narrated in his NBI affidavit in 2014, was composed of 5 people: SPO2 Jun Ayao, SPO2 Jun Larisma, and 3 civilian hitmen.
What Rappler found out:
Jun Pala was a broadcast journalist who, according to Duterte, “deserved” his death. But it was not all rivalry between Duterte and Pala. The two used to be friends until a string of disagreements led to a bitter feud in 2001. (READ: Duterte's 'enemy': Jun Pala)
As commentator of dxGo Aksyon Radyo, Pala often introduced himself as someone “who remains the voice of democracy in (Mayor Rodrigo) Duterte's reign of terror.”
According to official reports, Pala was killed by unidentified men on board a motorcycle on September 6, 2003, while returning home from a friend's house. The radio broadcaster sustained 9 gunshot wounds, mostly on his chest and head, and was pronounced dead on arrival at the San Pedro Hospital.
However, Davao journalist Jun Ledesma told Rappler in an earlier interview that Pala made a lot of enemies during his time – from businessmen to politicians – adding that he even tried to seek help from Duterte 3 days before he was killed.
But one thing is clear: 13 years later, no person has been arrested or charged over Pala's death. Similar to the Makdum case.
Nograles' supporters
What Matobato said:
Matobato claimed that Duterte and the DDS were also behind the deaths of supporters of ex-Speaker Prospero Nograles during the 2010 elections.
It happened during the heated race between Nograles and Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, for the mayoral position in Davao City. The elder Duterte, meanwhile, ran and eventually won as vice mayor due to term limitations.
In his NBI affidavit in 2014, however, Matobato recalled that the killings occurred in 2009. He also said in the same sworn statement and narration at the Senate that cement hollow blocks were used to help sink the bodies underwater. During an interview with Rappler, however, he said that they used hydraulic jacks.
But amid conflicting claims, Matobato was consistent in pinning the blame on Duterte.
What Rappler found out:
Nograles contradicted the statement of the Matobato, saying that there was “not a single incident” where a staff or security personnel of his was killed. However, during the Holy Week of 2010, 4 bodies were found in several areas within and near Davao City. (READ: Nograles 'supporters' killed by Davao Death Squad in 2010?)
News reports identified two of the bodies to be of Juliana “Nanay Juling” Noquera and Ronald “Ka Onald” Miranda. Both their hands were tied with nylon cords, heads wrapped with packing tape, their bodies with multiple stab wounds, and attached hydraulic jacks.
The two were also allegedly part of retired Jovito Palparan's Bantay party-list group. However, Arthur Tariman, former national media officer of Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy (ANAD) partylist, told Rappler that Miranda was one of the men Palparan sent to provide support to Nograles during the 2010 elections.
Although not directly controlled by the ex-Speaker, Tariman said that their group was working closely with them in a “tactical alliance” against the New People's Army (NPA). Noquera was the supposed contact of Palparan's group in an NPA-infested area in Davao City and was “an original leader in Nograles' camp,” according to Tariman.
More than 6 years later, no one has been arrested or charged over the brutal murders.
Richard King: McDonald's or hotel?
What Matobato said:
According to Matobato, Cebu wealthy businessman Richard King was shot at close range at a McDonald's restaurant in Obrero, Davao City on June 12, 2014.
King's death was ordered because he and Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte were allegedly “rivals” over a woman. He later said that those who carried out the actual killing were two rebel returnees who were eventually killed.
Matobato, meanwhile, told Rappler that he was also implicated in the killing since he had already expressed his intent to stop "working" with the so-called Davao Death Squad. He was arrested and charged for having an expired permit to carry firearms outside residence (PTCFOR). He was allegedly tortured while imprisoned; he was eventually able to post bail.
What Rappler found out:
Contrary to what Matobato said about King being killed inside a popular fast food restaurant, news in 2014 indicated he was shot while inside Vital C Building along Lacson street. This was also pointed out by Senator Panfilo Lacson during the Senate hearing.
On Google Maps, however, the actual Vital C Building is just adjacent to the fast food restaurant that Matobato mentioned.
Matobato's account about the people who killed King being rebel returnees is different from what he said in his 2014 NBI affidavit. In his sworn statement, he named a certain SPO2 Reynante Medina as the killer. He added that no one would take on a “project” as big as King except Medina, who hits “cleanly and quietly.”
News reports also said Matobato was not among the suspects identified by the police. The local police, in June 2014, arrested 3 men for the murder of King: Paul Labang, Rodel dela Cerna, and Rommel dela Cerna.
According to the police, Labang was the gunman. A year later, Police Superintendent Leonardo Felonia was identified as the alleged mastermind. He was charged with murder.
The alleged arrest of Matobato in 2014, however, did happen based on an affidavit-complaint obtained by Rappler. It was even SPO2 Medina, who he said, was the real killer of King in 2014. It was also Medina who arrested him for supposedly violating the Comprehensive Law on Firearms as his permit to carry had already expired.
For sure, Matobato did not get everything right. Neither did he get it all wrong. From indications, too, the events which he said happened, actually happened. – Rappler.com
Share. One Ring to precede them all... One Ring to precede them all...
The next film in The Ring franchise -- aptly titled Rings -- is reportedly going to be a prequel.
According to Bloody Disgusting, Rings will be set before the 2002 American remake and tell the origin of the series' iconic haunted VHS tape. The site notes, "Rings will take place years before the creation of said tape and tell the origin of Samara's reign of terror."
The site also mentions that Rings was the name of the short-film that accompanied the DVD release of The Ring Two back in 2005.
Akiva Goldsman is producing Rings, which is to be directed by Before the Fall helmer F. Javier Gutiérrez. Italian actress Matilda Lutz will star.
Rings -- which is set for a 3D release -- haunts audiences on November 13, 2015.

Marka Ragnos was a half-breed Dark Lord of the Sith who was immensely powerful, both physically and in the Force. He defeated Simus in combat, proving himself worthy of the mantle of Dark Lord.
The tomb of Ragnos on Korriban appears in the games Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. However, the tombs in each game are dissimilar to the other. This was likely for reasons of game structure, rather than a suggestion of the tombs being at different locations. The same phenomenon is seen with the Valley of the Dark Lords as a whole. Another theory is that his tomb underwent a renovation after being desecrated by Revan and his followers.
While a figure of importance in Sith history, Marka Ragnos has actually never appeared in a story in which he was alive, much like another influential Sith Lord, Freedon Nadd.
Biography
Feared, obeyed, and admired among the Sith, he was considered to have been the greatest Dark Lord of the Sith of his time. The details of his century-long reign are few, although his death marked the end of the golden age of the Sith Empire, despite his reluctance to continue expansion. Before his death, he likely composed the epistle of Marka Ragnos. Immediately following his funeral, a schism erupted between the leaders of the Sith, and further events led to a major war with the Galactic Republic and ultimately, because the schism was never healed, the end of their interstellar empire.
His death resulted in the rise of another Sith Lord, Naga Sadow, shortly before the Great Hyperspace War. Ragnos lived on as a Force Ghost after his death, trapped within the confines of his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban.
About one millennium after his death, Marka's spirit was summoned from the grave using a pair of Sith talismans and crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, and Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, all in an attempt to restore the lost empire of a thousand years prior. The Great Sith War devastated the galaxy once again, but the Sith Empire was not restored.
Ragnos's spirit dwelt in his tomb until once again returning from beyond the grave, this time summoned by a Sith cult known as the Disciples of Ragnos whose leader was Tavion Axmis, Desann's student.
Tavion used an ancient scepter made by Ragnos to drain residual Force energy and use it to empower her followers. She then planned to use the collected energy to resurrect Ragnos. When Jaden Korr entered the tomb, intending to stop Tavion, she managed to resurrect Ragnos by allowing his spirit to possess her body, but was nevertheless defeated by Jaden. Ragnos's ghost was forced back into his sarcophagus, screaming out a dark promise that he would return.
Marka Ragnos didn't wield a lightsaber, the common weapon of the Sith Lords and the Jedi Knights. He wielded a Sith sword, consisting of a metal blade enhanced by Sith sorcery, a weapon of the primitive Sith race. He could hide the sword inside his scepter. Apparently only he knew of its hiding place, as Tavion did not draw it until she was possessed, despite its power. He also owned a pair of dark gauntlets which increased skill with a melee weapon or lightsaber.

Clinton's is down from the 12-point lead in the initial four-night rolling average, which was conducted last Thursday through Sunday. | Getty National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 2 points
Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump has plummeted to just a 2-point margin, according to a new national poll out Saturday conducted even before the FBI director said in a letter to Congress that new evidence had been discovered concerning Clinton's improper use of a personal email server while secretary of state.
The ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, which consists of four nights of interviews conducted Monday through Thursday, shows Clinton leading Trump, 47 percent to 45 percent. That's down from Clinton's commanding, 12-point lead, 50 percent to 38 percent, in the initial four-night rolling average, which was conducted last Thursday through Sunday. Over that time, Trump has gained 7 percentage points, while Clinton has slipped by a smaller, not-statistically-significant 3-point margin.
Story Continued Below
Much of the movement is a result of increased enthusiasm among Republicans, even before the latest Clinton news on Friday. In the initial tracking poll, only three-quarters of registered Republicans were classified as likely voters, compared to 81 percent in the most recent poll.
At the same time, Republicans have also come home to Trump: 86 percent of self-identified Republicans say they will vote for Trump, and the GOP nominee also adds 84 percent of Republican-leaning independents.
ABC News and The Washington Post will release the latest four-night rolling averages on a daily basis. The first rolling average conducted entirely after the FBI's letter to Congress will be conducted Friday through Monday and is slated for release next Wednesday.
The most recent survey includes interviews with 1,148 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Ninety organizations, mainly French, decided to prosecute Israel at the International Court for committing War Crimes against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli offensive left more than 1033 Palestinians dead, and over 4580 wounded in its first two weeks.
The French Lamond Newspaper reported that the organizations prosecuting Israel in the International Court are pro-Palestinian and that this step comes as several Arab and international organizations are also moving towards filing lawsuit against Israel for war crimes against the unarmed Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, especially since Israel is using internationally banned weapons in its war such as White Phosphorus.
A French lawyer who phrased the lawsuit said that the eight article of the Rome Conventions specifies a war crime as "a deliberate act that aims at harming civilians and causing great suffering, harming them physically, destroying their property in a way that cannot be justified".
The lawyer, Jill Devier, said that a country cannot justify its war crimes by saying that it was subjected to missile fire "even if the Palestinian homemade shells fired into Israel also constitute a war crime".
He added that the lawsuit against Israel is well supported by two main legal basis;
1. The inequivalent Israel attack against Gaza, as it includes shelling heavily populated areas. He said that this issue was also raised at the Security Council on December 31.
2. The targets of the Israeli shelling were mainly civilian, as most of the casualties are children and women, and the army also shelled governmental facilities, mosques, sport clubs, and a building which had journalists on its rooftop.
Responding to a question regarding the chances of winning the lawsuit especially since it is prosecuting figures in a country that does not recognize the international court, Devier said that this issue makes the case more difficult but added that several Israeli officials have dual citizenships and could be prosecuted in the countries of their second citizenship.
Another possibility, he added, is that the United Nations can form special courts or the security council can call for a lawsuit against Israel, yet he said that the two options are hard to achieve under the current international situation, most likely referring to the biased US government support to Israel.
The number of Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israeli offensive and illegal war against Gaza exceeded 1000, while at least 4,418 were wounded. Most of the casualties are women, elderly and children.
Predictably, television was one of the first topics Tim Cook was asked about at yesterday's interview at AllThingsD. This followed the rumors of Yahoo acquiring Hulu, and Microsoft's entertainment-centric Xbox One launch last week.
It's all about TV and the imminent age of cord-cutting. On this the blogosphere is certain.
Except for one little problem: the economics of cord-cutting simply don't make sense, for neither networks nor viewers. Consider two examples: ESPN and AMC.
ESPN is the linchpin upon which cable television turns. It's the sole reason many people have cable, and it's insanely profitable. The vast majority of that profit comes from affiliate fees paid by cable companies on a per-subscriber basis (unless otherwise noted, all numbers are from this Forbes article that combines information from Disney's annual report and data from SNL Kagan):
ESPN FY12 Revenue: $9.4 billion
Affiliate fees: $6.1 billion
Ad revenues: $3.3 billion
That's about $508 million per month in affiliate fees alone, from about 100 million households.
Last week, ESPN averaged 1.36 million viewers in primetime, which is 9.52 million for the week, or about 40.8 million for the month. I think it's fair to say that most of those are not uniques, to use Internet parlance. If we assume that the average ESPN household tunes in eight times a month in primetime, then that means about 5 million households watch ESPN a month.
Let's assume this is true. That means:
Every household pays $5.13 per month for ESPN in affiliate fees
Only 4.8 percent of households watch ESPN. If ESPN were only available a la carte, each of those households would have to pay $101.60/month for ESPN to achieve the same revenue numbers they do currently
The 95.2 percent of households who don't watch ESPN would only see their cable bills decrease by $5.13 were they able to exclude it
UPDATE: The ESPN numbers were too low; they are closer to $15/viewer. See the update here
ESPN is a special case for many reasons, so let's take AMC, a geek favorite. AMC pulled in 460,000 viewers a night last week, yet earned $196 million in affiliate fees last quarter. If we assume that the average AMC viewer tunes in the same eight times a month, that's 1.73 million households that watch AMC:
Every household pays $0.65 per month for AMC in affiliate fees ($65.3m/100m)
Only 1.7 percent of households watch AMC. If AMC were only available a la carte, each of those households would have to pay $38/month in order for AMC to achieve the same revenue numbers they do currently
The 98.3 percent of households who don't watch AMC would only see their cable bills decrease by $0.65 were they able to exclude it
Both these cases are overly simplified, and make a lot of assumptions, and, crucially, ignore price elasticity: at those a la carte prices, both ESPN and AMC would get a lot less viewers, both decreasing advertising revenue and requiring that much higher of a fee to maintain their current revenues.
The truth is that the current TV system is a great deal for everyone.
Networks earn much more per viewer than would be sustainable under a la carte pricing
Networks are incentivised to create (or in ESPN's case, buy rights to) great programming; making your content “must-watch” lets you raise your affiliate fees
Viewers get access to multiple channels that are hyper-focused on specific niches. Sure, folks complain about paying for those niches, but only because they don't realize others are subsidizing their particular interests
Cable companies know the cable TV business, and would prefer to put up with customer disgruntlement over rising prices than become dumb pipes
Cable TV is socialism that works; subscribers pay equally for everything, and watch only what they want, to the benefit of everyone. Any “grand vision” Apple, or any other tech company, has for television is likely to sustain the current model, not disrupt it directly.
This is a three-part series.
Part 1: The Cord-Cutting Fantasy. Getting only the content you want without paying for everything is a fantasy. Pay TV is socialism that works.
Part 2: Why TV has resisted disruption. Great content is differentiated, has high barriers to entry, and depends on networks.
Part 3: The Jobs TV Does. The key question is attention, not set-top boxes. What jobs do we hire TV to do?

David Bowie's 'Young Americans,' 'Station to Station,' 'Diamond Dogs' Get New Vinyl Reissues
Published Jan 19, 2017
Last year, David Bowie fans were gifted with the Who Can I Be Now? (1974 – 1976) box set, but if you didn't want to shell out for the entire set, the collection's albums will now get individual vinyl reissues.Due out February 10 via Parlophone , remastered vinyl pressings of Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, David Live and Live Nassua Coliseum '76 are all set to arrive. So if you were hoping to get just some of that box set's albums or to avoid seriously jacked-up prices on originals, you're in luck.Unfortunately, the box set's (arguable) main draw, The Gouster , does not appear to be part of the reissue campaign. So if you do want that previously lost album on vinyl, you'll still have to drop a bunch of cash for the entire box set.Pre-orders on some sites have already gone live, but expect the reissues to everywhere come next month.

The House in the Swamp November 5, 2012
The first episode of this serial adventure was posted 9/17/12
The house that the four teens had built within the woods to west of the city impressed Jack. The place had three rooms of a sort and was mostly constructed from vertical logs that formed a palisade. These, along with the plywood roofs, were covered in long strips of plastic.
He had wanted to laugh as the youths got the fire in the oil drum, wood stove going. Bongs and roach clips were hidden in buckets, but he spotted them easily. The outside of one wall had easily hundreds of beer cans hanging by strings. It could have been a creepy Xemmoni lair, but Jack didn't need his Detect Darken ability to determine that these kids were on his side of the war.
The place grew warmer than he would have guessed and soon his only problem was the three bullet holes he had in him. His protection from Yig had kept him alive, but that didn't keep the wounds from being painful as hell. As the teens hurried to gather any stray blankets they could, Jack bound his wounds to the best his skills would allow. Soon the heat washed over him and he stopped shivering. Despite his pain, a few hours after midnight, sleep claimed him at last.
* * *
Upon awaking the next morning, he found all the young men had departed except for Alex. The tallest teen must have gone back to his house and returned for he had brought a goodly amount of food, and from the looks of things, extra weapons. Looking around without letting the youth know he had awakened, Jack was surprised to see as many weapons as he did. Homemade spears numbered in the dozens. Everything from bows to giant spike studded maces lined the walls.
Again, this made him weary, but before he set himself to do a thing, he let the power of his Ki heal his wounds. A pleasant warmth filled him as his body knit together. He wanted to keep going, but decided that he should keep some of his mystical strength in reserve. Who knew what the day would bring? This left him still quite damaged, but at least he would be able to move and the worry about him bleeding to death had passed.
He would have liked to use his Detect Darkened on all the lads at once, but settled on sending it out to gauge Alex while the man fed more wood into the fire. Jack almost fell off the cot when he discovered a thin hint of Yig lurking within the boy. It was weak, but quite evident through the use of his spell.
Most likely he has set down the path of Yig without being aware of such,” Jack Mused. All he needs is a formal awakening. Jack wondered if he should help the lad become a Stalwart, but thought twice. Doing so could curse the poor guy and I don't know if I have the right to lead any one else down the hellish road I'm forced to tread.
“Thanks for bringing me some food, kid.”
Alex jumped at the sound of his voice. “Yeah, ah, it's the least I can do.” He tried to push his long hair behind his ear, but it just fell forward again.
Jack chuckled. “You don't owe me. If anything it's the other way around.” Then Jack remembered something. “Hey how was it you said you knew I was in trouble anyway?”
The youth's cheeks tinged with red and he failed to meet Jack's gaze. “I had a dream, a vision. I know this might sound weird, but I ah… dabble in the supernatural a little. I was performing a ritual and saw a scene within the smoke of some substances I was burning. I wasn't sure what was happening, but I saw a street sign and you're running toward it. In the vision, a newpaper blew by and the date appeared very distinctly. That was eight days ago. It was hard as hell to get my friends to throw down, but I needed them, because I don't drive, but in the end they did as I asked.”
“Well you probably saved my life.” Jack regarded the tall teen silently. Yig moves in mysterious ways, but even that old slumbering serpent must have reasons for keeping me alive.
“Can I ask you a question?”
“Go ahead.”
“Why are you here?”
“My mother's lives in Saint Paul and is in some sort of trouble and lately anything I get involved with tends to turn into a shitstorm real quick.”
“I think I'm supposed to help you.”
“You might be right about that, but most likely it will become too dangerous for me to let you get involved.” Jack said, while reaching for a sandwich.
“Too bad, I'm helping anyway. I think that's what Yig would want.”
Jack sighed as he regarded Alex's serious expression. “I have a feeling this is going to be a long day.”
To be continued next Monday…

Bharara�s Twitter following soared after he tweeted Tuesday, March 22, 2016, about the arrest of Reza Zarrab, a controversial Iranian-Turkish businessman. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File)
Forty-six U.S. attorneys appointed by Barack Obama during his presidency have been asked to step down, including Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, the Department of Justice says.
Also asked to resign were Paul Fishman in New Jersey and Robert Capers in Brooklyn.
It was initially unclear if Bharara's resignation would be accepted by the White House. The 48-year-old prosecutor, who is known as tough on insider trading and public corruption, was appointed to his job in 2009 by Obama and had been kept on as U.S. attorney after meeting with Trump after his election last November.
President Trump told Bharara at the time he planned to keep him on given his record, according to NBC News sources. It was possible Trump could choose not to accept Bharara's resignation.
But a White House spokesman and DOJ spokesman separately told NBC News late Friday the administration will accept all but two resignations, that of Dana Boente of northern Virginia and of Rod Rosenstein of Maryland. That means Bharara's will be among the resignations that are accepted, the senior White House official said.
Bharara wasn't commenting Friday.
Fishman said in a statement, "It has been the greatest professional experience that I can possibly imagine having served in this office for the past seven and a half years... I am enormously grateful for the opportunity I was given to lead the men and women who work in this office."
Capers in Brooklyn said, "It has been my greatest honor to serve my country, New York City and the people of this district for almost 14 years, with the last 17 months serving as United States Attorney."
Many of the U.S. attorneys nominated by Obama's administration already have left the Department of Justice, as was the case in prior transitions, according to Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores.
The 46 of the total 93 U.S. attorneys who were still in their posts were all political appointees. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked them Friday to step down "in order to ensure a uniform transition," NBC News reports.
Flores said, "Until the new U.S. Attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. Attorney's Offices will continue the great work of the Department in investigating, prosecuting and deterring our most violent offenders."
In a statement late Friday, New York Sen. Charles Schumer said he was "troubled to learn of reports of requests for resignations from the remaining U.S. attorneys, particularly that of Preet Bharara."
"While it's true that presidents from both parties made their own choices for U.S. attorney positions across the country, they have always done so in an orderly fashion that doesn't put ongoing investigations at risk. They ask for letters of resignation but the attorneys are allowed to stay on the job until their successor is confirmed," the senator said.
Schumer said that by requesting immediate resignations, Trump was "interrupting ongoing cases and investigations and hindering the administration of justice."

And a week spent in an up-level SEL showed that the Jetta's handling still shines, even if some of the other attributes have lost their glitter.
Volkswagen lowered prices because the Jetta was getting clobbered by competitors in the sales charts, and it is an incredibly important model for the company — accounting last year for slightly more than half of the 213,000 VWs sold in the United States. Those 108,000 Jetta sales compared with 266,000 Corollas and almost 260,000 Civics, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
When the new Jetta goes on sale in October, the S will start at $15,995, or $1,740 less than last year. The SE is $18,195 or $2,355 less. At $21,395 (including a navigation system), the SEL is $2,060 less. But the TDI, with a diesel engine, is up $165, to $22,995. (Prices do not include a $770 shipping charge.) A 6-speed automatic transmission costs $1,100 more.
My test car was an SEL with the automatic and a sunroof. It was $24,165, including shipping.
While prices have shrunk, the overall length has grown about three inches, making the Jetta some five inches longer than the Civic. Rear legroom has increased 2.7 inches, giving it more than the Civic, Corolla, Cruze or Elantra.
I found the driver's seat on the test car comfortable enough for a four-hour stint, and the controls, including the navigation system, were easy to use. But gone is the classy interior that once set the compact-car standard and was the envy of competitors.
The switches in the 2011 Jetta felt flimsy; part of an air-conditioning vent fell off. The push-button starter on the console had a cheap aftermarket look. While I found the interior more disappointing than offensive, a colleague described it as “cheesy,” which I suspect is seen as praise only within the dairy industry.
Volkswagen has also changed the way the angle of the front seats is adjusted. Previously, one had to reach back in an awkward chicken-wing maneuver to turn a knob. While not easy to use, the mechanism allowed precise adjustment. VW still requires the odd reach, but now you use a cheap-feeling lever that is less precise.

The trunk, measuring 15.5 cubic feet, is quite large.
What VW did not cut is the Jetta's core value: how entertaining it can be to drive. On 60 miles of two-lanes through the White Mountains of New Hampshire, it eagerly handled challenges like a tight turn in one direction immediately followed by a wicked, increasingly sharp turn the other way. And while it no longer has an independent rear suspension, it wasn't upset by rumpled surfaces in the middle of a fast turn. Also, the ride quality, while not exactly plush, was impressive for a sedan with serious sporting ability. The suspension softened most of the impact of even large potholes or badly broken pavement.
My only complaint was that the steering — while predictable and relatively quick — could use more weight.

The brake pedal had a firm and progressive feel. All SELs, like my test car, have discs brakes at the rear, as does the TDI; other trim versions have rear drums. Volkswagen says its testing indicates that the Jetta stops just as well with the cheaper drum brakes as with rear discs.
Why, then, does VW include discs on the SEL and TDI? Kerry Christopher, a company spokesman, said, “We still offer disc brakes on certain models because many consumers associate disc brakes with improved performance and appearance.”
Although there is an optional, firmer sport suspension, the standard suspension (with 225/45/17 tires) is good enough that the upgrade seems unnecessary. While the interior and some mechanical changes say “cheaper,” the performance on a demanding road still says “sport sedan.”
The engine on the SE and SEL is a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder rated at 170 horsepower. The engine is a bit noisy but adequately deals with the car's unloaded weight of about 3,100 pounds.
Volkswagen says acceleration from a stop to 60 miles per hour will take about 8.5 seconds with the 6-speed automatic and 8.2 seconds with the 5-speed manual.
On my test car, the automatic transmission worked well in the normal “drive” mode, and it was smart enough to find the right gear and steadfastly hold it during mountain ascents. The gearbox can also be shifted manually by tapping the shift lever. A third option is Sport mode, which brings on downshifts more quickly and delays upshifts to provide greater acceleration.

There was a minor annoyance in sport mode: when lifting off the gas, the transmission tended to downshift for no apparent reason, providing a little powertrain hiccup in an otherwise smooth performance. The Environmental Protection Agency economy estimate for the automatic is 24 miles per gallon in city driving and 31 on the highway. That compares with 25 m.p.g. city and 36 m.p.g. highway for the less powerful Civic. For a 250-mile interstate cruise at speeds of 65 to 75 m.p.h., I averaged 31 m.p.g.
Previously, all Jettas came with the 5-cylinder engine. But to make the S model more affordable, Volkswagen turned on the way-back machine and retrieved a vintage 2-liter 4-cylinder rated at 115 horsepower. Therefore, the base Jetta now lags competitors including the Corolla (132 horsepower), Elantra (138) and Civic (140).
Volkswagen says this 4-cylinder's last American appearance was in the 2005 New Beetle. Before that it was used in the Jetta from 1999 to 2004. I did not have an opportunity to try the 4-cylinder Jetta S. In a critique at caranddriver.com, David Gluckman wrote of it: “The 2.0-equipped Jetta S is certainly slower and seriously decontented versus the more expensive Jettas, but it's by no means a penalty box.” VW says it will take 9.8 seconds for the 4-cylinder Jetta with a manual transmission to reach 60 m.p.h., and 11 seconds with the 6-speed automatic.
Two other engines will be offered. One is the generally admired 2-liter diesel power plant, with turbo direct injection. That 140-horsepower motor will be available later this year.
Early next year, a turbocharged 2-liter direct-injection 4 cylinders, rated at 200 horsepower — currently found in the sporty GTI — will be available in a higher-performance Jetta GLI model. Both the GLI and the TDI will have a dual-clutch automatic transmission.
Volkswagen says it will also offer a hybrid Jetta in 2012.
While VWs are typically seen as more distinctive than Toyotas or Hondas, questions remain about the brand's reliability. In a 2010 study of how three-year-old vehicles held up, VW ranked near the bottom over all, according to J. D. Power. But Consumer Reports magazine says the 2008 Jetta with the 2.5-liter engine had better-than-average reliability; the 2009 Jetta was rated average.
All Jettas are assembled in Mexico. Mr. Christopher, the Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was working hard to improve quality.
The 2011 Jetta is simultaneously a vexing and yet alluring creation. Under economic pressure, Volkswagen has arguably taken a step back in engineering, and it has cheapened an interior that was once an industry benchmark. On the other hand, the Jetta remains engaging and satisfying to drive. For some car buyers, the big drop in price may easily offset the backsliding.

INSIDE TRACK: Volkswagen giveth, and Volkswagen taketh away.
Violence against women in India has reached epidemic proportions. This year there have been 256,000 violent crimes, of which 228,000 have been against women. There is a woman raped in India every 20 minutes, and the rate is rising. Last week saw the brutal rape of a young student on a Delhi bus by 6 drunken men. Indians decided to peacefully protest and demand justice. The state had other ideas….
The victim of the rape is still critically ill in hospital. She is a 23 year old Physiotherapy student who, after her male companion was beaten unconscious, was grabbed on a bus by six men, gang raped and beaten with an iron bar for more than half an hour before being thrown naked and bleeding from the moving vehicle onto the side of the road.
She has managed to provide a statement re her attack and several people have subsequently been arrested in connection with the attack.
This latest rape is one of many, but has captured the public mood amid dismay about the ever increasing number of sex attacks. In Delhi alone, the number of ‘reported' rapes has risen by 17% this year - and 875% across India over the last 40 years.
Indians sick of attacks on women, and of lack of justice, have staged a series of peaceful protests across the country. The state have responded by ‘banning' gatherings of more than 5 people, created ‘no go zones', set up barricades, and have closed down public transport in key areas.
Protesters that have refused to disperse have been brutalised with bamboo sticks, steel poles, batons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. As soon as the protesters responded to being attacked by state forces, a police spokesman has labelled them as ‘hooligans' and ‘troublemakers', who had taken over peaceful protests.
TV footage and countless photographs taken across India clearly shows that the protests have been hijacked by hooligans – but the hooligans in question are all wearing police uniforms.
Pitched battles have been raging across the country for the last two days. There are reports that at least 65 protesters have been injured, along with 75 police officers. One journalist has been shot and killed by police as the opened fire on a large crowd.
A student at a Delhi University has said that:
“Until and unless the government understands the pulse of the people and imposes strict action against these criminals, we will not relent." Quote:
Delhi has been labelled as the ‘rape capital of India', yet rather than focusing of the rapists, the attitude of the state is to blame the victims:
“All six of the alleged assailants from last Saturdays attack have been arrested, but Delhi's police are viewed by many as lazy, corrupt, and incompetent, and of routinely dismissing sex assault complaints. Senior officers are regularly quoted as saying that women who are sexually assaulted have themselves to blame – for wearing jeans, for being out at night, for talking to boys, or getting into cars with them. Even senior female politicians have blamed women for attacks.” The Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit said that she hated the ‘rape capital' tag and supported the death penalty for rapists, but last year, after a woman was raped and murdered on the city's outskirts, her response was – “All by herself at 3am…..you should not be so adventurous”. Quote:
An investigative magazine, ‘Tehelka', recently interviewed scores of senior police officers from around Delhi about the rise of rapes. Their responses overwhelmingly accused women of inviting attacks on them.
The protests are now into a seventh day, and are showing no signs of rescinding.
Solidarity with all those protesting in India!
The Washington Post quoted McCain campaign manager Rick Davis' claim that reports of investigations into ACORN have suggested "rampant voter fraud as it relates to voter registration." But the Post did not point out that actual instances of illegal votes cast as a result of registration fraud, e.g., using false names, are extremely rare. Federal statistics show that between October 2002 and September 2005, the Justice Department charged 95 people with "election fraud" and convicted 55, of whom only 17 were convicted for casting fraudulent ballots.
In an October 18 Washington Post article, staff writers Robert Barnes and Mary Pat Flaherty quoted McCain campaign manager Rick Davis' claim that reports of investigations into the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) have suggested "rampant voter fraud as it relates to voter registration." But in reporting Davis' remark, Barnes and Flaherty did not point out that actual instances of illegal votes cast as a result of registration fraud, e.g., using false names, are extremely rare. Indeed, following Sen. John McCain's assertion during the October 15 presidential debate that ACORN is "on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy," the Post's Alec MacGillis noted in a "Live Fact Check" of the debate: "[T]here is a difference between submitting bogus forms and actual voter fraud. It is not voter fraud until someone shows up at the polls pretending to be [Dallas Cowboys quarterback] Tony Romo or Mickey Mouse and tries to vote. And there is no evidence yet of a wholesale push to send people to the polls under bogus names."
Indeed, U.S. Department of Justice crime statistics cast doubt on the existence of widespread voter fraud. According to a report by the Justice Department's Criminal Division on prosecutions between October 2002 and September 2005, the Justice Department charged 95 people with "election fraud" and convicted 55. Among those, however, just 17 individuals were convicted for casting fraudulent ballots; cases against three other individuals were pending at the time of the report. Further, on April 12, 2007, The New York Times reported, "Five years after the Bush administration began a crackdown on voter fraud, the Justice Department has turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections, according to court records and interviews."
Additionally, a 2007 report titled "The Truth About Voter Fraud" by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice stated: "[W]e are aware of no recent substantiated case in which registration fraud has resulted in fraudulent votes being cast":
There have been several documented and widely publicized instances in which registration forms have been fraudulently completed and submitted. But it is extraordinarily difficult to find reported cases in which individuals have submitted registration forms in someone else's name in order to impersonate them at the polls. Furthermore, most reports of registration fraud do not actually claim that the fraud happens so that ineligible people can vote at the polls. Indeed, we are aware of no recent substantiated case in which registration fraud has resulted in fraudulent votes being cast.
From Barnes and Flaherty's October 18 article:
This is a list of Korean given names by type. Most Korean given names consist of two Sino-Korean morphemes each written with one hanja. There are also names with more than two syllables, often from native Korean vocabulary. Finally, there are a small number of one-syllable names. Originally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names, but since 1993, regulations in South Korea have prohibited the registration of given names longer than five syllable blocks, in response to some parents giving their children extremely long names such as the 16-syllable Haneulbyeollimgureumhaennimbodasarangseureouri (하늘별님구름햇님보다사랑스러우리).[1] Lists of hanja for names are illustrative, not exhaustive.

Native Korean names Hangul 고유어 이름 Hanja 固有語 이름 Revised Romanization Goyueo ireum McCune–Reischauer Koyuŏ irŭm
Goyueo ireum are Korean given names which come from native Korean vocabulary, rather than Sino-Korean roots. These names have been used on occasion for centuries, but they only began to become widespread in South Korea in the late 20th century.[2][3] They do not have corresponding hanja, though in some cases, these names might be represented using hanja with the correct Korean pronunciation but an unrelated meaning (for example, 曙羅, with hanja meaning "sunlight" and "net", for Sora). However, this is not possible for all names; for example, for Ha-neul, there are no hanja with the reading "neul" (늘) on the South Korean government's official list of hanja which may be registered for use in given names.[4]
Since the late 1970s, the frequency of parents giving their children names that are native Korean words, usually of two syllables, has increased. Popular given names of this sort include Haneul (하늘; "Heaven" or "Sky"), Areum (아름; "Beauty"), Iseul (이슬; "Dew") and Seulgi (슬기; "Wisdom").[5] Between 2008 and 2015, the proportion of such names among South Korean newborns rose from 3.5% to 7.7%. The most popular native names in 2015 were Hangyeol (한결; "Unity") for boys and Sarang (사랑; "Love") for girls.[6] Despite this trend away from traditional practice, people's names are still recorded in both hangul and hanja (if available) on official documents, in family genealogies, and so on.

FUJIFILM Corporation announces price increase of photographic films.
FUJIFILM Corporation has announced that it will implement a worldwide price increase for its photographic films. The price increases are substantial and it would be an increase of at least double digit, but will vary depending on products, markets and regions.
1. Products: Photographic Film: Color Negative Film, Color Reversal Film, Black and White Film and Quick Snap
2. Date of Price Increase : Effective from January 2016 onward * * It will vary depending on products, market and regions.
The demand for film products is continuously decreasing and the cost of production, such as raw materials stays at a high level and cost increase associated with lower volumes becomes much serious. Under such circumstances, despite our effort to maintain the production cost, Fujifilm is unable to absorb these costs during the production process and is forced to pass on price increases.
To sustain its photo imaging business, Fujifilm has decided to increase the price of photographic films.
Fujifilm remains committed to photographic products despite its price change.
The new pricing structure will be applied to each market based on its individual conditions.

The outside world might never have heard about the suspected massacre if not for some barroom boasting by a group of miners fresh from working an illegal gig in the Amazon jungle.
The garimpeiros had bragged that they'd come across members of a reclusive, uncontacted Amazonian tribe near Brazil's border with Peru and Colombia, authorities say.
The tribe members were greater in number — there were as many as 10 — but the gold miners said they'd gotten the better of them and killed the entire lot, said Carla de Lello Lorenzi, communications officer for Survival International in Brazil, relaying information from reports the group had received.
The miners cut the tribe members' bodies so that they wouldn't float, Lorenzi said, then dropped them into the Jandiatuba River.
The miners had collected tools and jewelry from the indigenous dead, corroborating their story.
An unidentified person who overheard the story was disturbed by it, recorded the miners' conversation and turned the audio over to authorities. They have since launched an investigation into what, if confirmed, would be one of the largest mass murders of uncontacted people in decades.
Advocates for stricter protective measures say the suspected massacre is evidence that the Brazilian government isn't doing enough to safeguard the more than 100 vulnerable tribes that have never made contact with the outside world — and have no desire to.
“If these reports are confirmed, [Brazilian President Michel Temer] and his government bear a heavy responsibility for this genocidal attack,” said Survival International's director, Stephen Corry. Corry said the government has slashed funds for an agency that protects the tribes, leaving them “defenseless against thousands of invaders — gold miners, ranchers and loggers — who are desperate to steal and ransack their lands.”
“All these tribes should have had their lands properly recognized and protected years ago — the government's open support for those who want to open up indigenous territories is utterly shameful, and is setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades.”
According to the New York Times, the government closed five of the 19 bases it uses to monitor uncontacted tribes and prevent incursions by miners and loggers.
Three of the closed bases were in the Javari Valley, home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth.
For obvious reasons, little is known about the indigenous group involved in the suspected killings.
Locally, Lorenzi said, they're known as Fleicheros, or “the ones who throw arrows,” but their language and customs — and how they interact with at least two other uncontacted tribes in the immediate area — remain a mystery.
But the tribe members are not the only people in that part of the Amazon, Lorenzi said. It is illegal to mine there, but prospectors have brought earth-moving equipment to the area, leaving giant craters that can be seen from the sky.
They also bring violence, according to the government, which says garimpeiros are responsible for threats, child prostitution and killings.
Even their nonviolent presence in the protected lands can be dangerous to uncontacted tribes, which lack the immunity to fight the diseases that miners and loggers bring.
Any contact can be contentious and even violent, with the uncontacted usually getting the worst of it because, as Lorenzi told The Post, “it's usually bows and arrows against guns.”
Details about those contacts remain hazy, because they involve two groups of people unlikely to speak to authorities.
Still, tales of the worst violence sometimes get out. Survival International documented the story of Marisa Yanomami and Leida Yanomami, survivors of the Haximu massacre in 1993:
“The gold-miners killed our brothers and sisters and also killed our father with machetes; some of them were killed with guns,” they told the organization. “After the first 10 people died, at the start of the war, we moved to another place to hide and stayed in our shabono (communal house), but the next day, the miners appeared again.”
In a statement on its website, the Brazilian National Indian Foundation, or Funai, said it had prompted the federal public prosecutor's office to investigate the most recent allegation.
The government has also trumpeted its latest operation against incursions on protected lands. In August, it shut down an illegal mining operation. Soldiers destroyed four dredging machines and fined mining operators $1 million for environmental crimes.

Investigations are tough undertakings. The site of the suspected killing, for example, is a 12-hour trek by boat during the dry season. And it involves a group of people with their own language and a centuries-long wariness of outsiders.
Even the details of the killing are sketchy, Lorenzi said. And the vacuum of information speaks to another fear advocates have: that these types of violent interactions happen a lot more frequently than is reported.
“That's highly probable, yes, because it's so difficult to document,” she said. “It's the uncontacted versus illegal miners who think they can get away with anything.
“Unfortunately, a lot of the time they do.”

Archaeologists unearth a 500-year-old tower of skulls — and another gruesome Aztec mystery
A researcher discovered how cave men cleaned their teeth. It will make you want to brush yours.
Was Anne Frank's family betrayed? After 72 years, historians have a new theory.
Writing (and charting) about the latest employment numbers a couple of weeks ago, I concluded that:
It's probably still nowhere near as dramatic a chart as the monthly numbers from 1931 and 1932 would make. But the BLS wasn't on the case back then.
That brought an e-mail from Dartmouth economist Doug Irwin, who told me that the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually was on the case in the early 1930s, and that its numbers on employment at nonagricultural establishments in those years could be found online at the National Bureau of Economic Research's Macrohistory Database. Sure enough, they could. Here's what it looks like when you chart them against the the payroll employment data from the last six recessions:
Not even remotely in the same ballpark, it turns out. The post-World-War-II recesssions—including this one, so far—are just tiny blips in comparison with the Great Depression. I even had to cut the chart short because if I had carried it all the way to the point where employment finally reached its 1929 levels again, in 1940 (or so; there's some conflicting data), you would have barely been able to see the other recessions at all. To make the comparison with the current recession a little clearer, I charted the first 14 months of Depression job losses against the 14 months of job losses we've had so far in this recession:
Again, really no comparison at all. I was a little worried that this might be because the 1930s numbers were not in fact comparable with today's. An e-mail from Susan B. Carter of UC Riverside, an expert on historical labor market data, reassured me on that front. “In my view, this series is comparable to those you have displayed for later periods and certainly the best you can get,” she wrote.
It is true that a larger share of the workforce was still on the farm in the 1930s, so nonfarm employment wasn't quite the all-important indicator then that it is now. Still, it's clear that the employment downturn we've been dealing with, while probably the worst since the Great Depression, is much, much closer in severity to the recessions of the mid 1970s and early 1980s than to the utter disaster of the 1930s. That's no guarantee that it won't get worse, of course. But it is useful to know.
Thanks to TIME.com graphics czar Feilding Cage for making the charts look nice. Since he's back, I also got him to redo my most recent chart comparing job losses in the past six recessions (my version was pretty ugly):
Update: I should note that the 1930s numbers aren't seasonally adjusted, while the modern ones are. I just didn't even think of that when I was putting them together. Sorry. It doesn't affect the basic point of the charts, but it does explain why the 1930s numbers are so much herkier and jerkier than the modern ones.
An inspection by the Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office (IOCCO) into the targeting by Police Scotland of journalists' sources under anti-terrorism powers without a warrant has concluded the actions were committed with a disregard for human rights regulations, and were "reckless".
The new commissioner, Sir Stanley Burnton, announced in the role at the same time as the government released its draft Investigatory Powers Bill, stated that his office had discovered "Police Scotland sought communications data in order to determine either a journalist's source, or the communications of those suspected to have been acting as intermediaries between a journalist and a suspected source".
"[J]udicial approval was not obtained to acquire this communications data," noted the commissioner, who also found that the police's snooping did not give due regard to Human Rights legislation, and that two of the applications had been signed off by an officer who was not independent of the investigation.
"The failures identified can properly be viewed as reckless," stated Sir Stanley, who informed the individuals affected of how to engage with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal in response.
Police Scotland are alleged to have targeted journalists at the Scottish Sunday Mail to identify a whistleblower in the force.
Police Scotland confirmed that it could confirm "that it did not adhere to the new guidelines covering access to communications data during a recent investigation into alleged serious breaches of information security".
"We also acknowledge the deficiencies in the applications themselves, which have been highlighted by IOCCO", stated the scotch plod, and the commissioner confirmed that Police Scotland have now established "significant measures in order to prevent any recurrence of such contraventions." ®
A sales executive who said he was fired by a San Francisco company after reporting financial improprieties to a manager can sue the company as a whistle-blower even though he never contacted the government, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.
Federal securities law “bars retaliation against an employee of a public company who reports violations to the boss,” the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said in a 2-1 ruling. The issue has divided other federal courts, a situation that often prompts the Supreme Court to step in and resolve the conflict.
The case involves Paul Somers, a vice president of Digital Realty Trust from 2010 to 2014, who worked in Singapore marketing high-tech real estate for the San Francisco data-center services company.
Somers said he was fired after telling management about financial misconduct by a supervisor and the company's lack of internal controls. The company said it fired him for unrelated reasons, but sought to dismiss his lawsuit on the grounds that federal whistle-blower laws protect only those who report potential securities violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
SEC regulations interpret the law more broadly, covering those who report suspected wrongdoing to higher-ups in their company or organization. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco deferred to the SEC's view and refused to dismiss Somers' lawsuit, and the appeals court upheld his ruling Wednesday.
The majority opinion by Judge Mary Schroeder cited a provision of the most recent regulatory law, the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibiting retaliation against employees who make disclosures protected by an earlier securities law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. That law required would-be whistle-blowers to report suspected financial misdeeds to their supervisors before turning to a government agency, and barred companies from punishing them for in-house reports.
“Leaving employees without protection for that required preliminary step would result in early retaliation before the information would reach the regulators,” said Schroeder, joined by Judge Kim Wardlaw. “The SEC's rule in our view accurately reflects Congress' intent to provide broad whistle-blower protections” under Dodd-Frank.
Judge John Owens dissented, agreeing with another court — the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — that interpreted the law more narrowly in 2013.
Stephen Henry, a lawyer for Somers, said the ruling “expands the ability of whistle-blowers to internally report and then be protected.”
President Trump and some congressional Republican leaders have proposed narrowing the regulatory scope of Dodd-Frank. Henry said any changes would not affect Somers' suit, which was filed under the current version of the law.
The company's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

Microsoft has a big opportunity tomorrow when they unveil the next version of Windows known by the code name “Threshold” and what could ultimately be dubbed Windows 9. Though its official name has yet to be confirmed, Microsoft is holding an event tomorrow in San Francisco and to unveil invitations sent out hint at “what's next for Windows.” Lately there have been a flurry of reports and leaks of what is widely known as Windows 9, though there is still some buzz that Microsoft may brand the OS by a different name upon launch. Regardless, here are a few key highlights on what I think we'll see the Redmond team unveil with this new OS, which is expected to cure the many ills users have been complaining of with Windows 8.
Addressing Desktops, Non-Touch Laptops and The Enterprise
Obviously, this is the most widely reported and demanded change for Windows 9 – the start menu will make a triumphant return. Though Microsoft had the best intentions to embrace the touch revolution, ultimately desktop and non-touch laptop users were left with a disjointed mess between Microsoft's “Modern UI” and desktop mode. In a recent Windows 9 Technical Preview leak, the new start menu made its appearance and a dare I say it's a really nice combination of both a traditional program start menu and an expandable, customizable tile menu for a quick hit on your most frequently uses apps. There is also word that Windows 9 will support virtual desktops, allowing you to run multiple desktops at once, simultaneously, which could be a major advantage for workstation professionals, IT managers and the enterprise.
Cortana, Your Digital Assistant Across All Platforms
It makes sense that Microsoft's arguably more intelligent Siri alternative will also come to the desktop and notebook. On mobile device, this feature is great for location-based search and discovery, calendar functions, research, reminders and the like. However, enabled on the desktop with a fast wired connection or over WiFi, and with lots of processing resources available to enhance natural language interaction, Cortana could go from a sexy sidekick of information, to a real search and processing ninja on steroids.
Update Your OS Like You Do All Your Devices, With The Push Of A Button
OTA updates have been common on mobile platforms for a long time now. It simplifies the user experience and make available both major and incremental updates that not only fix bugs and plug security holes but also afford new functionality and features. Microsoft's Windows Update service has typically only been used as a vehicle for distributing security updates, bug fixes and performance enhancements. However, with Redmond's recent commitment to more regular roll-outs of new OS versions with new features and functionality, word on the street is that one-click updating is headed to Windows 9 as well. The move would afford Microsoft the ability to offer feature roll-out much the same way Google does with Android, only for PCs as well as mobile devices, which brings us to Microsoft's next opportunity for improvement: platform unification.
Windows, One Experience For Everything In Your Life
Of all the opportunities Microsoft has before them with future iterations of Windows, this perhaps could be the most compelling if they're able to pull it off. Though Windows RT, with its app store on an island, has been met with a luke-warm reception, one Windows Store for all platforms has been a goal the company has been vocal about since the their Surface 2 launch in late 2013. Microsoft needs to play this card for tablets, smartphones and PCs. If they can make it happen, it could help their obvious mobile ecosystem shortcomings immensely and attract developers in droves. For developers, install base exposure is king and offering them the ability to hit all devices from PCs, to tablets and smartphones is a win. Not to mention end customers love to take versions of their favorite apps to any device or system they own, obviously. It's a proverbial win-win and if you toss in further Xbox One integration, things get even more interesting. I expect we'll hear more detail on this tomorrow and it certainly won't come a moment too soon.
Like Shouting “Free Beer!” In A Frat House
The rumor going around, and one that makes a lot of sense, is that Microsoft will make Windows 9 available for free for Windows 8 users. Nothing says I love you and I'm sorry, like delighting those customers you're courting with a free upgrade. What's more encouraging perhaps is that this rumor may not just be smoke, but a real fire, with the President of Microsoft Indonesia noting that Windows 8 device owners will receive the company's next OS as a free upgrade. This one move would bring Redmond some serious good will for all the shortcomings of Windows 8 and further the adoption of their next generation OS and UI for all platforms as well.
Tomorrow is going to be a big day for Microsoft and again, it represents a lot of opportunity for the company to win back customer and developer confidence. What's eerily odd about Windows releases is that over the years, Microsoft has repeatedly launched operating systems with successful and the subsequently very unsuccessful cadences – Windows 2000 was a great OS, Windows ME was a disaster, Windows XP was very solid, Windows Vista was a train wreck.
Then we have Windows 7, which has served the Windows ecosystem and end users well for many years, only to be followed-up by what felt like Microsoft pulling the rug out from under us with Windows 8. That said, the core OS of Windows 8 is very strong, with excellent resource management, better thread utilization and overall better system-level efficiency. It was just the user interface and ecosystem support that were off the mark. And that's a very big “just.” I'm betting Microsoft gets it right this time and we'll find out how right tomorrow.

At least 115 fighters of the militant Islamist group al-Shabab have been killed in heavy fighting with pro-government forces in northern Somalia, the regional government says.
A further 110 militants were captured during the fighting, the Galmudug government added in a statement.
There has been no independent confirmation of the claims.
The al-Qaeda-linked militants have drifted north after losing ground in southern and central Somalia.
Galmudug's President Abdikarim Hussein Galaud said the security forces were determined to "wipe out" the militants, and to prevent them from establishing bases in stable parts of the north.
The militants were defeated after four days of fighting along Galmudug's border with Puntland, the government statement said.

A few of them managed to flee into rural areas, it added.
The statement did not give casualty figures for pro-government forces.
The African Union (AU) has some 22,000 troops battling al-Shabab in southern Somalia, where it was formed nearly a decade ago to fight for Islamic rule.
Last month, the militants overran an AU base in the southern town of el-Ade.
Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said about 180 Kenyan troops, which were part of the AU force, were killed in the attack.
BitTorrent has always been as much about giving as receiving, but the company behind two of the major torrenting clients—BitTorrent and μTorrent—and has decided to take this ethos a step further, with the release of what it's calling "altruistic mode."
Good etiquette in the file sharing community dictates that users should try and share as much data as they download. This usually means a 1:1 ratio of downloads to uploads, though many conscientious users try to hit a ratio as high as 2:1 or 3:1, in order to offset those users who don't seed at all.
In the BitTorrent and uTorrent clients, the new mode, however, takes best practise and turns it into a rule, enforcing a 2:1 ratio. Effectively, this means users might not be able to complete their downloads before they've uploaded sufficient data—which could be tricky, if no-one wants what you're seeding.
“The precise definition of Altruistic Mode is that it initially downloads two pieces and after that, every time it uploads two pieces worth of data it downloads one more,” BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen told Torrent Freak. “This is a simple and reliable strategy for making sure that you never get much worse than a 2:1 ratio.”
He continued: “Going for a higher number could also cause swarms to no longer have a complete copy of the file if too many peers are in Altruistic Mode, which would harm not just the one peer in altruistic mode but other peers as well."
The new mode is available in uTorrent 3.4.9 and BitTorrent 7.9.9, which were released last week. It is turned off by default but can be switched on in the preferences menu.
A gang of yobs who pushed a cyclist into a canal leaving him struggling to get out of the water have struck at least five times, police revealed today.
Peter Bettell told the Standard last week how he was returning to his canal boat home in Kensal Rise when a gang punched him and slashed open his jacket before pushing him into the icy water. He desperately fought to reach the bank with his shoes clipped to the pedals of his bike.
Now police investigating the incident have identified four other cases of cyclists being pushed into the Grand Union Canal.
All the incidents took place in February at different points along the Grand Union Canal and all involved attacks on lone male cyclists aged between 35 and 49 years old.
Inspector Anna Brennan, who heads the Westminster Safer Neighbourhoods team investigating the attacks, said: “These incidents have been very unpleasant for the victims, who may have not suffered particularly serious injuries, but they have been left frightened and highly traumatised by what has happened to them.”
Mr Bettell, 53, told how he was returning to his canal boat home along the towpath in Kensal Rise on February 23 when a gang punched him and slashed open his jacket before pushing him into the icy water.
He said: “I was cycling home along the towpath and saw this group who looked really menacing. I thought of turning back but I guessed that these people fight other gangs and would not worry me.
“The next thing I knew I was in the water struggling to breathe. I was attached to the pedals of my bike with clips so struggled to release them. It was touch and go whether I could get out.”
He described how he was rescued by a young girl who hauled him out of the water, saying she probably saved his life.
Mr Bettell said he was left so shaken by the assault that he was moving his boat out of London and he planned to commute to his retail job in Piccadilly.
Police have stepped up patrols along the towpath and put in place a dispersal order to allow them to move on groups of youths.
Inspector Brennan said: “I would appeal directly to the persons responsible for these attacks to give serious thought to what they did, and just how dangerous it is. Pushing strangers into a canal is not funny, and could have very serious consequences.
“Whilst the water is not particularly deep, it is still very dangerous for anyone who cannot swim or anyone who has suffered an injury. One victim had his feet clipped into his pedals which made getting out of the water very difficult.
“Our work to reassure people using the area around the canal continues and officers are out patrolling and speaking to people and we are reviewing CCTV. “
She urged any witnesses or anyone with information to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Big tech companies have been creating accelerators left and right to evangelize their brands and get developers engaged with APIs and other open-source efforts. Today, Amazon joined the crowd by announcing a new program for startups developing conversational AI.
This is Amazon's first foray into the world of accelerator programs, though its $100 million Alexa Fund has already invested in 22 companies within the space. These investments have occurred across various company stages and verticals. More recently, Amazon created the Alexa Prize for conversational AI, tasking university students with building bots that can actually hold a conversation.
Doug Booms, VP of corp dev for Amazon (wink, wink, also in charge of Amazon M&A), explained to TechCrunch that the new accelerator wasn't designed to be a feeder for the Alexa Fund nor to be a next step for teams competing for the Alexa Prize.
Amazon's accelerator strategy seems rather open-ended at this point. No formal constraints have been set as to what types of startups will be welcome in the batch that could encompass teams working on connected cars, smart homes and everything in-between.
Rather than go it alone, the entire 13-week program is being run in partnership with Techstars. Amazon first approached the accelerator about a potential partnership to support conversational AI. At the start of the program, participants will receive an initial $20,000 investment from Amazon and Techstars, and be eligible for an additional investment of up to $100,000 in the form of a convertible note. Selected companies will be housed in space rented from the University of Washington. Founders will be given exposure to mentors from both groups.
Startups can begin applying for the program in January. Amazon and Techstars will be hosting joint information sessions in major cities around the world before the program begins in July. As is typical with most accelerators, a demo day will be held in October for investors to view company presentations and interact with founders.
You're the octogenarian billionaire owner of a beverage company that has caught the attention of the young and hip and your stock has shot up 88 percent this year, so what do you do?
You lash out in a press release.
Nick Caporella, the CEO of National Beverage Corp., is complaining about speculators in his stock. Just 15 percent of daily trading volume is based on how the company is doing, he said Thursday in his press release, which is peppered with exclamation points and all-caps. More than 50 percent of the trading, he said, is being done by gamblers.
Worse, he suggested, short sellers (who borrow shares to sell them and then buy them back later hoping to profit, thus betting on a price decline) are in a "stampede aboard" the passive trading wagon.
"If you have the opinion that I, Nick Caporella, am angrily exercised while extremely fortunate to be guiding FIZZ, your opinion is quite accurate!" he wrote.
FIZZ is the Nasdaq trading symbol for the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, maker of soft drinks and other beverages under brands like Shasta and LaCroix. Its shares are down 8 percent this week though up 88 percent this year.
The shares seem to have taken a turn for the worse in the current quarter, falling 22 percent this month after soft drink giant Coca-Cola announced plans to buy rival Topo Chico, maker of lime flavored mineral water. FIZZ's most recent high was $129 in September.
National Beverage has had a huge hit in LaCroix, a brand of fruit-flavored fizzy water popular with Millennials.
The Obama administration is supporting several non-profit groups — with federal funding through a major White House initiative — that are part of an organized effort aimed at converting green-card holders into U.S. citizens in order to vote against Donald Trump, a Daily Caller investigation reveals.
Through an initiative called Networks for Integrating New Americans initiative, which the White House formed in April 2014, the administration has partnered with the National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA), an immigration rights umbrella organization that has denounced Trump's “hateful rhetoric.”
In a recent post to its Facebook page, NPNA asserted that green-card holders “have the potential to change America's electorate” by gaining citizenship. The group and its executive director is also affiliated with one of the leftist groups that helped shut down a Trump rally in Chicago earlier this month.
And through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Obama administration has provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to groups that have cited Trump as one reason that green-card holders should obtain citizenship before the general election in November.
The findings raise questions over whether groups that receive federal funds should be allowed to openly target specific presidential candidates. They also suggest what many conservative critics of immigration reform have long asserted: that one of the goals of activist citizenship groups is to create a new batch of Democratic voters.
Trump has become a target for Latino and immigrant rights groups for his comments about illegal aliens and his promises to build a “big, beautiful wall” along the southern border.
The revolt against a potential Trump nomination has been dubbed the “Trump Effect.” CNN recently reported that the number of naturalization applications increased 14.5 percent in June-December 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.
That jump is thanks in part to activist groups' efforts to convince many of the 4.5 million Latino residents in the U.S. eligible for naturalization to apply for it.
The federal government isn't alone in leveraging Trump in order to boost citizenship applications. Numerous entities — including the Mexican government and billionaire George Soros — have funded community activist groups pushing permanent legal residents to obtain citizenship so that they can vote against the GOP front-runner.
Earlier this month Bloomberg Politics reported that the Mexican government is hosting citizenship drives at its consulates in several major U.S. cities. One presumptive goal of the effort is to put permanent residents on the path to citizenship in order to vote against Trump.
And Soros, through his Open Society Foundations network, is funding numerous organizations that oppose Trump and support amnesty and other pro-immigrant reforms.
Several of those groups were involved in protests that led to the cancellation of a Trump rally in Chicago earlier this month. One of those is the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), a Chicago-based outfit that is closely affiliated with National Partnership for New Americans, the group involved in the Obama White House's citizenship enrollment task force. (RELATED: Here Are The Radical Leftist Anti-Trump Groups Behind The Chicago Protest)
As part of the task force, NPNA operates under the direction of World Education, Inc., a Boston-based social and economic development group. The initiative is being funded by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education.
ICIRR is part of NPNA's network, and the two groups have worked together on the citizenship application push. Part of their effort involves guiding green-card holders through the naturalization process. And in some cases, they help applicants apply for waivers to avoid having to pay the $680 naturalization application fee.
The two non-profits are also connected through NPNA's executive director, Joshua Hoyt. He previously served as executive director at ICIRR.
The White House-backed NPNA makes its anti-Trump bent no secret.
Tara Raghuveer, the group's deputy executive director, recently cited Trump's “hateful” rhetoric as a spark for the naturalization application push.
“People who are eligible are really feeling the urgency to get out there,” Raghuveer told The New York Times. “They are worried by the prospect that someone who is running for president has said hateful things.”
In a post on its Facebook page, NPNA asserted that one “silver lining to all the hateful rhetoric spewing from the presidential campaign” is that naturalization rates have jumped and “could approach 1 million this year.”
NPNA's Facebook page is also littered with anti-Trump rhetoric and links to articles criticizing the candidate. It frequently uses the hashtags “#StandUpToHate” and “#NaturalizeNow” as part of its campaign.
The Obama administration is also backing anti-Trump groups through a $10 million U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) citizenship and integration grant program.
The Chicago-based Instituto del Progresso Latino and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which is based in Los Angeles, both received $250,000 in fiscal year 2015 as part of the program, which aims to help permanent residents apply for and obtain citizenship.
Earlier this month, the Chicago branch of Asian Americans Advancing Justice hosted an event “to denounce the hateful rhetoric against Muslims, immigrants, and others by Sen. [crscore]Ted Cruz[/crscore] and Donald Trump.”
Representatives with Instituto del Progresso Latino and the Chicago branch of the Council on Americans-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group with known ties to terrorists, also attended the event. As did Illinois Rep. [crscore]Luis Gutierrez[/crscore], a Democrat who is one of the House's most vocal supporters of amnesty.
Earlier this month Gutierrez joined Hillary Clinton at an event hosted by another Chicago community organizer called The Resurrection Project in which he called for 1 million legal permanent residents to obtain citizenship in order to “stop the hate” and defeat Trump. (RELATED: Congressman Calls On 1 Million Immigrants To Obtain Citizenship In Order To Stop Trump)
The effort — which Clinton praised — involved the use of “navigators” to guide applicants through the process of obtaining citizenship.
“I am in support of what you are doing to try to help navigate people who are here, who are already permanent residents eligible for citizenship to take the next steps to become citizens,” Clinton said.
“We especially need you now because I know people are worried and they're afraid by some of what they are hearing,” she continued.
The Resurrection Project has also received federal funding, though it appears not to be related to the citizenship effort. Last August the group received a $36,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was given a $36,850 grant the year before.
Another group with anti-Trump sentiments that is involved in the citizenship push is Catholic Legal Services of Miami. Through the USCIS program, it has partnered with the School Board of Miami-Dade County on its “Fast Track to Citizenship” program, which focuses on guiding Cuban, Haitian, Dominican and Colombian residents through the citizenship application process.
In another article published earlier this month about the “Trump Effect,” Catholic Legal Services director Raul Hernandez said he supported residents rationale for obtaining citizenship and heralded a mass push as a “game changer.”
“If that is the motivation for them to become citizens, I welcome the motivation,” he told CNN.
“It's going to be a totally different political situation — folks with a different view of what a citizen is, raising their voice, saying, ‘I'm here and I want to have a say in the future of the nation.'”

John Fahey was the founding father of 'American Primitive Guitar' - a style he coined in the late fifties, breathing new life into traditional country blues fingerpicking on the avant-folk scene. Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke number among his followers, although Fahey lived much of his life in humility. At the tail end of his career in the mid-nineties, he enjoyed a mild spike in interest following a positive write-up in Spin's Alternative Record Guide and name-checks from big contemporary artists such as Sonic Youth and Cul De Sac. During this time, living in a cheap motel in Salem, John Fahey would drive to Portland to sell unwanted promo CDs. There he met a record store clerk called Julie Shapiro at Ozone Records - one of the biggest independent stores and purveyors of Manic Panic hair dye in downtown Portland. Over the course of selling his CDs, he started a rapport with Julie, and one day, unprompted, sent her a couple of cassettes in the post with a short letter and cryptic track-listing.
Both cassettes are to be broadcast via NTS - the first cassette is available for on-demand listening below, and the second will be aired on Friday March 31st, 12:00-13:30 GMT.
LISTEN BACK Music Of The Post Apocalypse: Part 1
We spoke to Julie to ask how these tapes came around, and she kindly sent over scans of Fahey's original letters which are available for viewing below.
Julie: I was a record store clerk living in Portland Oregon, back in 1996. I worked at the Ozone Record Store which was this big, beloved shop in downtown Portland. John Fahey used to come in and sell a lot of the promos he was receiving - he'd just landed back on major record label radar and he'd sell us these incredible Jim O' Rourke promos, things that never came in for sale… They weren't always in great condition but we'd buy the CDs off him. Everyone in the store knew who he was and kind of worshipped him - I just started talking to him about his stuff. I was a big fan but probably wasn't as aware of how historically significant a musician he was, so I wasn't as intimidated.
J: We talked a lot and he sent me a letter with two cassettes and a tracklisting with some information. It was a total surprise and a generous thing for him to do. The letter was postmarked May 8th 1996, Julie at Ozone. That's how he got it to me, sent it to the store... I think he was lonely. That's my personal take, he was at a lonely time in his life and he appreciated having someone to talk to, and I certainly appreciated getting to talk to him. Back then, that's what you did for people you cared about, you'd make them a mixtape. I think he was just happy for for friendship and conveyed his appreciation for our connection through the tapes.

Earlier this month, Aurora Cannabis Inc. (TSX:ACB) announced its intention to acquire Cannimed Therapeutics Inc. (TSX:CMED). When Cannimed showed no interest, Aurora upped the ante and looked to acquire the company through a formal takeover offer.
Although Aurora's offer of $24 a share is a 20% premium over what Cannimed currently trades at, it hasn't seemed to get much traction. One reason is that the offer is all-stock and means that Cannimed investors will simply receive shares of Aurora rather than cash.
The concern for Cannimed shareholders is whether or not Aurora's stock is worth its current share price, which has risen over 170% in just the past three months.
Are cannabis stocks overpriced?
Cannimed's CEO Brent Zettl referred to the offer as being financed with “Monopoly money,” alluding to Aurora's high valuation. With a price-to-sales ratio of more than 100 and a price-to-book ratio of 11, Aurora's stock is currently valued at a hefty premium.
However, this is indicative of where the industry is today. Cannimed is also a bit expensive with a price-to-book multiple of five and investors paying nearly 25 times the company's sales.
In the cannabis industry, it is increasingly difficult to determine what fair value for a stock is, because so many companies have seen their share prices take off recently. We are dealing with a new and emerging industry that will see tremendous growth potential, but it will also face significant challenges that shouldn't be ignored, either.
Currently, investors are in the honeymoon phase and have not been bothered by whether cannabis stocks have been profitable or not (most haven't been); investors have been in a frenzy over how much sales will grow when marijuana is legalized.
Sales will undoubtedly continue to grow for many cannabis stocks, but investors need to be careful, as enormous growth potential has already been priced in to these high valuations. There are many variables to consider, and cannabis stocks have been very sensitive to news and developments in the industry.
Are we seeing a big cannabis bubble begin to form?
Zettl referred to Aurora's business as a “house of cards” and believes that Newstrike Resources Ltd., which Cannimed has made an offer for recently, is a better fit and will add value for shareholders, unlike the bid from Aurora.
Although Zettl might be right about Aurora being overvalued, I would argue that most cannabis stocks, including Cannimed, are trading at big premiums and could see significant corrections if growth falls short of expectations.
What should investors do?
Although cannabis stocks offer significant growth potential, these are not investments that are suitable for risk-averse investors. Both Aurora and Cannimed have seen their share prices skyrocket since this bid was announced, and both might come down in price if the deal falls through.
At this point in time, investors might be better off waiting for a drop in price before buying either stock. Both of these stocks will react strongly to whether the deal goes through or not, and although that presents a significant opportunity, it also exposes investors to a great deal of risk as well.
Krystal Ball is the executive director and founder of the People's House Project , an initiative to elect more Democrats in Midwestern and Appalachian states, and author of " Reversing the Apocalypse: Hijacking the Democratic Party to Save the World ." Ball is a former Virginia congressional candidate and a current resident of Kentucky. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.
(CNN) Another special-election loss, this time in Montana, has kicked off a round of soul searching and excuse making in the Democratic Party. Sure, this loss came in a state that Trump won by 20-plus points. Sure, we outperformed based on the partisan makeup of the state.
But the fact remains, we lost to a candidate who allegedly assaulted a reporter on the eve of the election. We lost to a candidate who embraced our deeply flawed President. We lost to a candidate who, quite simply, should have been unelectable.
Why? Because as terrible as Trump is, and as bad as assaulting a reporter may be, none of this compares to the Democratic Party's awful job at branding its message and its messengers.
Right now, our party has about the same level of credibility as Donald Trump. We claim to be fighting for middle- and working-class people, but it is obvious to all that our priorities lie first and foremost with the wealthy donors we rely on to fund our campaigns. This reality has eroded our moral standing and impacts the way our party operates at every level.
Just consider the ads that Republican Greg Gianforte ran against Democratic hopeful Rob Quist. In them, a narrator informs viewers that Quist may talk folksy, but he's really just "Nancy Pelosi in a cowboy hat." This ad sends the message that Quist is just as tied to the donor class, just as beholden to special interests, just as bereft of ideas and just as condescending to the struggles of ordinary Americans as a distant, dreaded, unaccountable elite.
And while Pelosi may connote liberalism to many, in much of the country , her brand is quite the opposite -- reflecting an elitism that can hurt Democrats on Election Day.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) took a lot of heat for not investing more in Quist's race and then had an " I told you so moment" after his loss, saying it "refused to waste money on hype."
And in a sense, perhaps, the DCCC is right. Even when running against a candidate as dreadful as Gianforte, given the current brand of the Democratic Party, a special election in Montana is a lost cause. What they miss, however, is that this type of fatalism will consign us to defeat in most of the country. So how do we repair and restore the Democratic Party brand?
It's clear that if we want to change where we are able to win, we need to change who we are running, how we are running and what we are running on. Let's start with the candidates we get behind. Because of our loyalty to the donor class, we recruit and support candidates based not on their character or connections to their communities, but on their ability to raise money.
It will not surprise you that this is a less than optimal selection process. We would be better served running teachers, firefighters, nurses and local labor leaders who can actually speak with authority to the working and middle-class experience. Because the working class is substantially more diverse than the country as a whole, this would also naturally lead to more diversity among our leadership ranks.

One of the reasons we have become obsessed with candidate fundraising prowess is because we have accepted conventional wisdom that the most important element in a campaign is money. We have accepted the guidance of the consultant industrial complex, which tells candidates the only way they can run credibly is by spending tens of thousands of dollars on preprinted mail pieces to get thrown in the garbage and hundreds of thousands of dollars on TV ads that most people will fast forward through.
It's time to reassess these assumptions. Did Hillary Clinton lose because she didn't have enough money? Will Jon Ossoff win if we just throw another million dollars at his race? No. And if Jon Ossoff wins in Georgia, it will be because people were enthusiastic about him as a candidate. It will be because they showed up to knock on their neighbors' doors and made the effort on Election Day to wake up early or get home late so they could cast ballots.
The biggest single thing we have going for us right now is the enthusiasm of people who are horrified by what they see happening to our country. Rather than outsourcing campaigns to D.C. consultants, harness that enthusiasm. We need to ask ourselves how much more receptive we would be to reading a handwritten letter from a neighbor rather than a preprinted postcard? How much more attention would we pay to a person knocking on our door than yet another annoying political TV ad?
We could be running more effective races on a lot less money and go a long way toward rebuilding our credibility as a party of the people.
The last thing we need to do, though, is the most critical. Resistance to Donald Trump is not enough. Ultimately, people won't show up to fight or vote if they aren't inspired by our vision. But no individual congressional candidate can create a large national vision -- that has to come from the party. On this measure, we have utterly failed.
As I write in my book, our nation has undergone a massive economic shift that has left more and more Americans balancing precariously on low-paying, unstable service work. Three of the most common jobs in the country are cashier, sales clerk and food service worker. Not only is it impossible to raise a family on the wages from these jobs, but all three are threatened in the near term by automation.
We talk about lifting the minimum wage, but let's be clear, this is palliative care for the middle class at best. What solutions have we offered to restore an economy where American workers can prosper? What vision have we laid out to address the seismic changes that are as large as the Industrial Revolution, but happening at the speed of the Internet? You offer people those answers, and you'll have plenty of grassroots donations to run winning campaigns.
None of this can be done overnight or with one congressional campaign. But over time, if we continue to back candidates who are dissonant with the current brand of the party, run creative and authentic campaigns and detox from Wall Street and Silicon Valley contributions, we can compete everywhere.

And we can make sure that the unelectable, like Gianforte, stay unelected. Because the truth is that we are the party of the people. The current White House occupant and the enabling Republican Party have demonstrated time and again that their allegiance lies only with the rich in this country.
And we have no choice but to try. The alternative is accepting the creeping fatalism offered by the DCCC and crossing a few more states off the list of places where we can credibly compete.
I, for one, refuse to go out without a fight.
People along the Suwannee and Withlacoochee are urged to avoid contact with the water because of possible contamination from city of Valdosta's sewage treatment plant.
Residents and recreationalists along the Suwannee and Withlacoochee rivers are urged to avoid contact with the river water because of possible contamination from city of Valdosta's sewage treatment plant, according to a Florida Department of Health press release.
The agency on Thursday issued an advisory to residents in the counties surrounding the Withlacoochee and Suwannee rivers — Dixie, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Lafayette, Levy, Madison and Suwannee counties.
The Valdosta utility department has located a sanitary sewer overflow that has spilled into the northern Withlacoochee. The Withlacoochee flows south and empties into the Suwannee River.
This is the second time in two months that state health officials have had to warn residents of North Central Florida to avoid contact with the water flowing in the Suwannee — and both instances involve sewage contamination involving a spill in Valdosta.
In early March, the Withlacoochee Water Pollution Control Plant in Valdosta overflowed into the Withlacoochee, state officials said at the time.
As for the current situation, state officials say that, until further information is known regarding possible contamination of the rivers, people are urged to avoid contact with water from either river.
Water contaminated by wastewater overflow presents several health hazards to humans and may contain untreated human sewage with microbes that could cause gastro-intestinal and other diseases.
Anyone who comes in contact with the river water should wash thoroughly, especially before eating or drinking. Children and elderly, as well as people with depressed immune systems, are particularly vulnerable to disease so every precaution should be taken to avoid the river water.

For the people of Puslinch, Ont., horseracing is more than just big business. It's a way of life.
Most people in the south-central Ontario community are involved in the industry as horse owners, handlers and trainers.
But the town of 7,000 was left reeling when a massive fire tore through a barn on Monday, killing more than 40 prized racehorses and leaving their owners to deal with the dramatic loss.
The fire began at approximately 11 p.m., at the Classy Lanes Stables Training Centre in Puslinch, a township located approximately 20 kilometres southeast of Guelph.
A neighbour spotted the flames and called 911. Firefighters were called in from several communities in the area, and trucked in more than 200,000 gallons of water to the location since there are no hydrants in the area.
Most of the roof collapsed, and parts of the walls fell in on the flames.
A total of 43 horses died in the blaze. The loss of the animals along with damage to the property amounts to an estimated $4 million to $5 million.
But for trainers, owners and handlers, the damage goes far beyond business.
"It's devastating...This is a lifestyle, and these horses are part of your life, rather than just a commodity," Ben Wallace told CTV Toronto through tears, saying the horses are like family.
Wallace is an owner and trainer who lost 17 horses in the fire. Wallace told CTV Toronto that one of his horses that died in the fire was racing star Apprentice Hanover, who is worth more than $1 million.
"So you go and identify 44 family members," he said. "Can you imagine if you were asked to go and identify your family? That's what it's like for the people that are doing it right now."
Wallace said the barn holds 46 horses, but there were at least two empty stalls at the time, so he wasn't sure exactly how many horses had died. He said he'd been at the stable as the fire burned through the barn, and that the fire had engulfed one of the buildings so quickly that no one was able to get to the horses.
"The smoke was so dense that you couldn't go near it. They probably all suffocated before they perished," he said in an interview with Newstalk1010 earlier in the day.
In addition to the horses, Wallace also lost all his trophies and ribbons, which he kept in an office in the barn.
Wallace described the training centre a "state-of-the-art" facility, saying it was more advanced than a traditional wooden barn. Classy Lane opened in 2003, and can accommodate as many as 222 horses, according to the stable's website.
"It is devastating to the industry," Flamboro Downs General Manager John Stolte told reporters.
"Ben Wallace has an exceptional amount of top calibre horses... To have this happen is again a reminder of how delicate things are."
The stable facility is owned by Barb and Jamie Millier, who were on vacation at the time of the fire.
Jamie Millier told reporters at the farm that the fire will have a huge impact on the racing industry, saying trainers are not only grieving the loss of the horses, but some may lose their jobs.
"There are five companies that are out of business right now because they've got no horses," he told reporters as he returned to the facility.
Several crowdfunding campaigns have been set up for those wishing to contribute to those affected by the fire. Many, like Wallace, did not have the majority of their horses insured because of the high cost.
The majority of the horses are owned by trainers like Wallace, who race them at southern Ontario racetracks including the Mohawk, Woodbine and Flamboro Downs tracks.
In a statement, Woodbine Entertainment Group said the employees' "deepest sympathies" are with those affected by the fire.
"The horses lost were members of our family and their passing is emotional and heartbreaking for everyone at Woodbine Entertainment Group."
Puslinch Fire Chief Steve Goode said fire crews also struggled because their hoses were freezing in the cold temperatures.
Goode said firefighters were able to stop the fire from spreading to other buildings.
Goode said the cause of the fire is not yet known, but crews are working with provincial police and the Ontario Fire Marshal to investigate.
"This is a multi-million dollar fire, the highest dollar loss that we have experienced in our township," he said.
He said the building is not structurally sound and has to be so that it's safe for officials to go in and investigate.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture will be helping the owners to dispose of the animals' bodies.

— Fayetteville police are searching for a man they say wounded three people in three Saturday morning shootings.
"It appears random," said Lt. James Nolette of the spree that took place over 30 minutes at locations along Bragg Boulevard.
"We don't know if it's just random to us but linked together in his mind," Nolette said. "We don't know."
Police described the three victims as innocent bystanders.
The first shooting happened just before 3:20 a.m. in a parking lot of 4943 Bragg Boulevard. Police said a dark-colored SUV drove into the parking lot and hit the curb. Patrons in the parking lot began to exchange words with the driver of the SUV when someone inside the vehicle opened fire, police said. One person was shot in the leg and a second was grazed by a bullet.
The second shooting happened about 10 minutes later near B and Link streets.
At that location, police said a man in a dark-colored SUV shot at a taxicab. The people inside the taxi were not injured.
The third shooting occurred just after 4 a.m. in the 800 block of Orange Street. A woman was shot in the leg while standing in the front yard of her home. Again, wtinesses described a dark SUV and a passenger firing from inside.
Police recovered the SUV on Saturday and detained the driver and a passenger.
They issued an arrest warrant for Luther Gatling, 23, of 208 Teague Street, whom they said is wanted in connection with the shootings.
Gatling is charged with assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and is also wanted on a probation violation.
Investigators believe Gatling was the shooter inside the SUV. He should be considered armed and dangerous.
Police urged Gatling to surrender.
Anyone with information about the shootings is urged to call the Fayetteville Police Department at 910-916-2764 or Crime Stoppers at 910-438-8477.
The order could hamper Wanda's ability to generate new financing for past acquisitions in the U.S., including the buyout of Legendary Entertainment and AMC Entertainment.
Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin's cash-flow woes are far from over.
The Chinese government's top banking regulators have ordered the country's largest financial institutions to stop lending to the tycoon's Dalian Wanda Group to finance its overseas entertainment acquisitions, according to a document seen by The Wall Street Journal.
Beijing officials are understood to have convened a meeting with China's big banks June 20, where executives were informed that six of Wanda's recent overseas acquisitions — including Wanda-owned AMC Entertainment's deals to acquire Carmike Cinemas and the Nordic Cinema Group — were subject to the government's restrictions on capital outflows unveiled last year.
The document, a portion of which was reviewed by the Journal, refers to four closed and two pending foreign transactions. The two pending deals were related to multibillion-dollar real estate investments Wanda was exploring in Indonesia and Malaysia, a source told the Journal. Although it's understood that Wanda decided not to pursue those transactions, the regulatory message appears clear: don't even think about it.
Wanda's U.S.-based AMC unit, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, is most likely outside the reach of Chinese regulators. But a source that the new regulatory actions can be expected to prevent Wanda from generating new financing in China for some of its past transactions.
Wanda's offshore entities may have to rely on their own capital reserves and fundraising capacities to bankroll any new ambitions — such as, in Wanda-owned Legendary Entertainment's case, expanding into marketing and distribution, financing a pricey film slate and recruiting a new chief executive (studio founder and chairman Thomas Tull exited in January, leaving Wanda exec Jack Gao in the role of interim CEO).
According to the Journal's sources, the new order will prevent Wanda from using any of its Mainland China funds to further capitalize its prior overseas deals. Wanda also remains banned from injecting these foreign entities into its publicly traded entertainment company in China, Wanda Film Holdings. Last year, Wanda attempted to merge Legendary with Wanda Film in precisely this fashion, but the deal was derailed by authorities.
Chinese dealmakers announced a staggering $246 billion in outbound acquisitions last year, but Beijing's regulators have since pumped the breaks. In an effort to stem capital flight, which was seen as contributing to a devaluation of China's battered currency, the government upped scrutiny of large transactions and instituted various measures to make it more difficult for acquirers to shift capital overseas.
Although famous for its close government connections, Wanda has increasingly found itself at the center of the regulatory squeeze. Last month, Beijing asked state banks to review their exposure to several of China's most prolific overseas dealmakers, including Wanda. News of the action triggered a panicked sell-off of Wanda Film Holdings shares, forcing the company to request a temporary suspension of trading.
The latest increase of regulatory pressure on Wanda's financing perhaps helps to explain Wang's surprise move last week to sell Wanda's much-touted theme parks and hotel business to fellow real estate conglomerate Sunac China for $9.3 billion. Wang said the funds raised by the deal would be used to reduce Wanda's heavy debt load.

A deluge of cash has soaked the engineers and executives of the Bay Area, pushing up home prices and leaving San Francisco with levels of income inequality typically seen in developing nations. (Illustration by Matthew Billington for The Washington Post)
SAN FRANCISCO – There is an apartment for rent in a renovated former warehouse here, across the street from the Caltrain commuter rail station. It has two bedrooms and two bathrooms and nearly 700 square feet of space. It comes furnished. It is, the online advertisement proclaims, a "perfect place" for someone, like so many young startup employees today, who works in Silicon Valley but lives in the city. It could be yours for $8,525 a month.
Rents get more bearable in farther flung parts of the city, and in bedroom communities down the Peninsula, but only slightly. A deluge of cash has soaked the engineers and executives of the Bay Area, pushing up home prices and leaving San Francisco with levels of income inequality typically seen in developing nations.
Paul Graham, a venture capitalist and one of the founders of the startup incubator Y Combinator, would have you believe this rising inequality is a good thing. Or, at very worst, the inevitable consequence of a good thing. "You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people from getting rich," he wrote in an essay that went viral online last week, "and you can't do that without preventing them from starting startups."
Graham's piece happened to light up the Internet just as thousands of economists descended on San Francisco for the annual conference of the American Economic Association. The drizzly three days of the gathering featured what appears to have been the largest focus on inequality in the organization's history. The 70 inequality-themed papers presented here wove a nest of new research demonstrating how and why inequality has increased, and what side effects appear to have accompanied it.
Taken together, they make the case that Graham -- and others who wave off inequality as inconsequential -- has misread what's happened in the American economy. They suggest that everyone should worry about the drivers and consequences of inequality -- even venture capitalists.
***
Since the middle of the 1980s, a gap has been widening between what the best-paid Americans earn and what everyone else in the country earns. There has also been a gap between how much money those two groups spend, but for a long time that gap didn't grow as much, because "everyone else" borrowed heavily to try to keep up with the folks at the top.
The Great Recession cut off that borrowing. It also reduced real incomes for the bottom 90 percent of American income-earners. Smaller paychecks and less access to credit left those Americans with only one choice: spend less than they had been. The top earners didn't increase their own spending by nearly enough to make up the difference. That is a big reason the U.S. economy has recovered so sluggishly from the recession, the economists Barry Z. Cynamon and Steven M. Fazzari declared in a new paper presented at the conference.
"Rising income inequality," the wrote in their research paper, "is now a significant barrier to economic growth and full employment."
There was already some irony in that paper, and so many others on inequality, landing in the northern outpost of Silicon Valley. Graham's essay cranked that irony to foghorn decibels.
Inequality, Graham argues in his piece, is not bad "per se." It can stem from rich people exploiting tax loopholes or poor people being locked in prison at high rates, which are both bad things. Or, it can result from more tech entrepreneurs getting rich, which is a good thing, because those entrepreneurs are making valuable things for the economy.
The argument takes several turns, but it boils down to two points. First, whether inequality comes from good or bad sources, it does not, by itself, hurt anyone; just because the rich get richer does not mean the poor and middle class can't get richer, too. He concedes that some rich people got that way by taking money from the poor, but not most of them.
That's his second point: We shouldn't try to reduce inequality, because doing so would necessarily mean killing off the innovators and entrepreneurs who get rich for socially good reasons. He writes:
"Eliminating great variations in wealth would mean eliminating startups. Are you sure, hunters, that you want to shoot this particular animal? It would only mean you eliminated startups in your own country. Ambitious people already move halfway around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate from anywhere nowadays. So if you made it impossible to get rich by creating wealth in your country, the ambitious people in your country would just leave and do it somewhere else."
Research suggests Graham is both overestimating the importance of startups to inequality and underestimating the damage high inequality can inflict.
There is evidence to support his contention that returns to entrepreneurship are making inequality worse. The problem for his argument is that the effect doesn't appear to be large, comparatively.
At the conference, a group of five economists, including Philippe Aghion of College de France and David Hemous of the University of Zurich, unveiled a study that speaks directly to the Silicon Valley effect on inequality. They looked at levels of innovation (as measured by a particular kind of patent production) across individual states over time. They found a significant relationship between increased innovation in a state and the increased income share of the top 1 percent of earners in the state.
When the math cleared from their analyses, the economists estimated that 14 percent of the increase in the share of income going to the top 1 percent of Americans between 1975 and 2012 "may be explained by an increase in innovation." The economists say those increases are temporary , they generate economic growth and they're associated with stronger upward mobility. Those are all good things. Point, Graham.
If you take that as a proxy for the Silicon Valley effect, though, you're left with a problem: 86 percent of the recent inequality increase can't be explained by innovation. You're also stuck with the fact that startup formation for tech companies has been falling for more than a decade even as inequality has been widening, and not rising, as Graham implies. Total venture capital funding remains well below late-1990s levels, even before you adjust for inflation, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association.
In light of all that, it's difficult to conclude that startups are mostly driving the income gap.
Economists have suggested all sorts of other things that might be contributing to the gap. There's the "superstar effect," which says the opening of global markets is delivering big payouts to the very top players in a variety of industries now rolling in cash from around the globe. There's a broader theory that advancing technology is delivering higher payouts to the most skilled workers, and leaving lower-skilled workers to compete with robots and less-expensive foreign labor, pushing down their wages.
There is also mounting evidence that some, or even a lot, of inequality has nothing to do with superstars or skills -- at least not in the way that we tend to think about them. The culprit in this theory is what economists call rent-seeking. Really simply put, it's people making extra money not because they deliver a good or a service that the market values, but because they've bent the rules of some system to shuttle more compensation their way.
Examples of this would include chief executives who pad their profits by lobbying for government favors, and reap big bonuses as a result. Or financial pros who score huge fees helping clients game the tax code to pay less to the IRS. There are all sorts of other examples, but a basic rule is, if you're earning more money without doing anything to add additional value to the economy, you're rent-seeking.
Several papers presented in San Francisco hinted at, or directly identified, rent-seeking as a prime cause of growing inequality. Most forceful was the liberal economist Dean Baker, from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who argued in a paper that rent-seeking in copyright protections and the financial sector, along with excess pay for CEOs and other highly educated professionals, explains "the bulk" of the growth in top incomes.
If his argument is correct, Baker writes, "it means that there is nothing intrinsic to capitalism that led to this rapid rise in inequality." It would mean you couldn't reduce inequality simply by raises taxes on the rich -- you'd need policies to straighten kinks in the market, by shrinking the financial sector or reducing copyright windfalls. It would also mean that reducing inequality shouldn't dampen entrepreneurship.
Other recent studies also suggest high levels of rent-seeking are driving inequality. Brian Bell and John Van Reenan, a pair of economists in Britain (which resembles the United States in many ways when it comes to inequality), reported in 2014 that increased bonuses for bankers accounted for two-thirds of the growth of top 1 percent incomes in Britain after 1999. There are all sorts of reasons to believe that premium financial sector pay is almost entirely rent-seeking; the British paper would suggest that at least two-thirds of inequality could be linked back to "bad" sources, in other words.
Oliver Denk, an economist for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, expanded on that work in two papers for the conference. He dove into statistics for every country in Europe and pieced together a composite of the men -- they're almost all men -- who make up the top 1 percent of earners on the continent. Again, his findings give us a window on America, where inequality is even more pronounced than in Europe.
"Workers in the top 1 percent," Denk found, "tend to be 40 to 60 years old, be men, have tertiary education, work in finance or manufacturing and be senior managers." At worst, that's a group ripe for rent-seeking. At best, it doesn't sound much like the innovators Graham is so worried about discouraging. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has done similar work on America's top 1 percent, and found that at least a quarter of its increased income share since 1979 can be attributed to finance.
Taken together, that evidence suggests Graham may be overly worried about inequality "hunters" discouraging today's crop of startup founders; they just aren't that prevalent in the ranks of the super rich who are pulling away from everyone else.
Other evidence suggests he's wrong on his second point, too: Inequality appears to have consequences for the economy, no matter what's driving it.
At one point in his essay, Graham suggests replacing concern over inequality with concern over poverty and social mobility. He suggests those are distinct from the growth of incomes for the very rich. Americans, he writes, fall prey to "the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor." He says it's possible, but not always true, that the pie can grow such that everyone gets more, even if the rich get a lot more.
It is indeed possible for that to happen. It just doesn't appear that's what's been happening in America in recent years. Instead, it appears the very rich have been enriching themselves further at the expense of workers. That's what researchers from the International Monetary Fund found in a paper presented at the conference, which argues that the rise in top-level earnings is correlated with a decline in union membership; when workers get less, essentially, their bosses and shareholders get more.
A similar argument lies at the heart of the paper by Cynamon and Fazzarri, who are economists at the St. Louis Fed and Washington University in St. Louis. Their contention is that the lack of pie growth, if you will, for most Americans created a shortage of consumer spending that has kept the recovery from recession at historically weak levels. The stagnation of most incomes below the very rich "has opened a large gap in demand generation that has not been filled," they write.
Perhaps most resonant to Graham is the idea that inequality might be discouraging smart workers from working at all -- in startups or elsewhere. A paper from economists at the New York Fed and the University of Southern California finds a link between growing inequality and declining labor-force participation among highly educated women, whose exit from the workforce hurts the economy. The economists find that as some highly educated men's wages rose quickly, their highly educated wives earned and worked less.
If there is middle ground between Graham and this body of research, it's the idea that policymakers shouldn't go after inequality with blunt instruments, like big tax hikes just for the sake of soaking the rich. Perhaps, instead, they should target rent-seeking, which economists agree is bad for everyone who isn't a rent seeker.
That could mean taxing financial transactions to discourage excessive Wall Street trading, or taxing income from investments at the same rate as income earned on the job, in order to discourage expensive financial engineering. It could mean simplifying tax and regulatory codes to reduce companies' gains from lobbying -- which, by the way, big tech firms are increasingly chasing via ramped-up presences in Washington.
If you curbed rent-seeking -- or what conservatives like to call cronyism, in a solely government-focused form -- you'd almost certainly improve growth and help more people share in its returns. Graham's worry is that you wouldn't actually reduce inequality in that case. All the former rent-seekers, he writes, would flow into entrepreneurship: "If the only way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups."
In economic terms, that would be a great problem to have.
The German government voiced concern on Tuesday that the Islamic State group could step up attacks in Europe as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria, and said its domestic intelligence agency is training to respond to a large-scale assault.
Interior Minister Thomas De Maizière welcomed gains made by a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group (also known as ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, but said they were not diminishing the risk of attacks in Europe.
"On the contrary, we fear that Islamic State will externalize, transfer its activities to Europe, especially because of military losses in the region," the minister, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic party, told reporters.
Germany has been on high alert for possible large-scale militant incidents — potentially including military-style weapons — since the ISIS attacks in Paris last November and Brussels in March, Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, told the same news conference.
He said the agency had carried out several exercises to prepare for such events, and several attacks had already been thwarted. Three Syrian men were earlier this month suspected of planning large-scale attacks in Düsseldorf.
Maassen said the agency was also vigilant for potential lone-wolf attacks, self-radicalized individuals, and possible militants smuggled in under the cover of over 1 million mostly Muslim refugees that have entered Germany over the past year.
He said authorities had identified clear evidence against 17 individuals who had entered Germany disguised as refugees, and most were either dead or had been arrested. "We must keep a particularly close eye on this group of people," he said.
Authorities were checking tips about a total of 400 potential Islamists among the refugees, but most of those had turned out to be false claims made by other refugees, he said.
De Maizière said the rate of Islamists leaving Germany to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria had slowed, but remained troubling. A total of 820 such people were now believed to have departed Germany for the region, up from 780 at the end of December, with about one-third estimated to have returned.
About 60 of those who had tried to reach the region were under the age of 18, and 20 of those who actually succeeded were girls, Maasen said.
At the same time, Germany has seen sharp increases in the number of ultra-conservative Islamists known as Salafists in recent years, with the total number of sympathizers now seen at 8,900, up from 7,000 at the end of 2014, German officials said.
De Maiziere said it was important to reintegrate the so-called "foreign fighters" who returned to Germany, some of whom were highly radicalized, while others were disillusioned.
“Follow the money.” As a young journalist on the political left, I often heeded this well-worn advice. If conservatives were denying the science of global warming, I figured, big fossil-fuel companies must be behind it. After all, that was the story with the tobacco industry and the dangers of smoking. Why not here?
And so I covered the attacks on the established scientific knowledge on climate change, evolution and many more issues as a kind of search for the wealthy bad guys behind the curtain. Like many in Washington, I tended to assume that political differences are either about contrasting philosophies or, more cynically, about money and special interests.
There's just one problem: Mounting scientific evidence suggests that this is a pretty limited way of understanding what divides us. And at a time of unprecedented polarization in America, we need a more convincing explanation for the staggering irrationality of our politics. Especially since we're now split not just over what we ought to do politically but also over what we consider to be true.
Liberals and conservatives have access to the same information, yet they hold wildly incompatible views on issues ranging from global warming to whether the president was born in the United States to whether his stimulus package created any jobs. But it's not just that: Partisanship creates stunning intellectual contortions and inconsistencies. Republicans today can denounce a health-care reform plan that's pretty similar to one passed in Massachusetts by a Republican — and the only apparent reason is that this one came from a Democrat.
None of these things make sense — unless you view them through the lens of political psychology. There's now a large body of evidence showing that those who opt for the political left and those who opt for the political right tend to process information in divergent ways and to differ on any number of psychological traits.
Perhaps most important, liberals consistently score higher on a personality measure called “openness to experience,” one of the “Big Five” personality traits, which are easily assessed through standard questionnaires. That means liberals tend to be the kind of people who want to try new things, including new music, books, restaurants and vacation spots — and new ideas.
“Open people everywhere tend to have more liberal values,” said psychologist Robert McCrae, who conducted voluminous studies on personality while at the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health.
Conservatives, in contrast, tend to be less open — less exploratory, less in need of change — and more “conscientious,” a trait that indicates they appreciate order and structure in their lives. This gels nicely with the standard definition of conservatism as resistance to change — in the famous words of William F. Buckley Jr., a desire to stand “athwart history, yelling ‘Stop!' ”
I call myself a liberal, so this description of openness resonates with me. But I think it's vital for everyone to understand, and it needn't be seen as threatening or a put-down; it seems to be part of the nature of politics.
We see the consequences of liberal openness and conservative conscientiousness everywhere — and especially in the political battle over facts. Liberal irrationalities tend toward the sudden, new and trendy, such as, say, subscribing to the now largely discredited idea that childhood vaccines cause autism. This assertion was tailor-made for plucking liberal heartstrings, activating a deeply felt need to protect children from harm, especially harm allegedly caused by big, rich drug companies.
But the claims about vaccine risks happened to be factually wrong. And how do we know? Scientists — who themselves lean liberal — debunked them. Over time, so did many other liberals. And in significant measure, it worked: There are still many people who cling to this inaccurate belief, but it is much, much harder these days to defend it, especially in the news media.
Compare this with a different irrationality: refusing to admit that humans are a product of evolution, a chief point of denial for the religious right. In a recent poll, just 43 percent of tea party adherents accepted the established science here. Yet unlike the vaccine issue, this denial is anything but new and trendy; it is well over 100 years old. The state of Tennessee is even hearkening back to the days of the Scopes “Monkey” Trial, more than 85 years ago. It just passed a bill that will weaken the teaching of evolution.
Such are some of the probable consequences of openness, or the lack thereof.
Now consider another related trait implicated in our divide over reality: the “need for cognitive closure.” This describes discomfort with uncertainty and a desire to resolve it into a firm belief. Someone with a high need for closure tends to seize on a piece of information that dispels doubt or ambiguity, and then freeze, refusing to consider new information. Those who have this trait can also be expected to spend less time processing information than those who are driven by different motivations, such as achieving accuracy.
A number of studies show that conservatives tend to have a greater need for closure than do liberals, which is precisely what you would expect in light of the strong relationship between liberalism and openness. “The finding is very robust,” explained Arie Kruglanski, a University of Maryland psychologist who has pioneered research in this area and worked to develop a scale for measuring the need for closure.
The trait is assessed based on responses to survey statements such as “I dislike questions which could be answered in many different ways” and “In most social conflicts, I can easily see which side is right and which is wrong.”
Anti-evolutionists have been found to score higher on the need for closure. And in the global-warming debate, tea party followers not only strongly deny the science but also tend to say that they “do not need any more information” about the issue.
I'm not saying that liberals have a monopoly on truth. Of course not. They aren't always right; but when they're wrong, they are wrong differently.
When you combine key psychological traits with divergent streams of information from the left and the right, you get a world where there is no truth that we all agree upon. We wield different facts, and hold them close, because we truly experience things differently.
The political psychological divide goes beyond science. Factual disputes over many issues feature the same dynamics: Does the health-care reform law contain “death panels”? Did the stimulus package create any jobs? Even American history is up for debate: Did the founders intend this to be a Christian nation?
However, there only is one reality — and we don't get to discount it forever. And liberal-conservative differences are part of reality, too; inescapable, and increasingly difficult to deny.

WASHINGTON — With most polls showing Democrat Mark Udall and Republican Cory Gardner running almost even in their battle for the U.S. Senate, Gardner in recent weeks has tried a new tactic to break the deadlock.
He's gone global, and attacked Udall on foreign policy.
It's an unusual maneuver, as foreign policy rarely has much bearing on House or Senate races. Adding to the difficulty is Udall's experience in that arena, especially on intelligence matters.
But with Election Day less than two months away and President Barack Obama's approval numbers on foreign policy in the basement, Gardner has broadened his criticism of Udall to include both terrorism and the crisis in the Middle East.
The gambit has risks, not the least of which is showcasing the difference in worldviews between the two candidates. But Gardner has committed to this line of attack, going so far as to compare Udall's position to one of betrayal.
In an interview last week with The Denver Post, Gardner blasted Udall for not describing the activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) — whose members recently beheaded two U.S. journalists — as an “imminent threat” to American safety.
“The only person who doesn't believe (the Islamic State) is an imminent threat is Mark Udall,” Gardner said. “To say they are not an imminent threat is betraying the security needs and safety of our country.”
For his part, Udall has condemned the violence committed by Islamic State militants. But the first-term senator has stopped short of calling the U.S.-designated terrorist group an immediate danger to the U.S. homeland — a reticence that reflects his overall caution in overextending American might at home and abroad.
“It is very clear that ISIL presents a very serious threat to U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, and the group's actions have left no doubt that it's going to take both brains and brawn to defeat them,” Udall said recently at a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, of which he is a member.
Clear dividing line
While the rhetorical difference between “imminent” and “serious” may seem slight, Udall's reluctance to go further represents a clear dividing line between Udall's political philosophy, which includes early opposition to the Iraq War, and that of his Republican rival.
National polls have shown widespread disapproval of Obama's handling of foreign affairs: Only 35 percent of Americans supported Obama's approach to the world compared with 58 percent who disapproved, according to an average of recent polls tallied by the website Real Clear Politics.
“President Obama's poll numbers generally and (on) foreign policy and terrorism (in particular) have tanked fairly dramatically, and so to the extent that Cory Gardner can tag Sen. Udall as weak on national security and weak on terrorism,” the better it is for him, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on political history at George Washington University.
But there's a risk, too — for both candidates — in advocating too strongly for foreign intervention or overselling the danger posed by overseas threats, he said. Liberal Democrats have raised concerns about another costly adventure in the Middle East, and there's a vocal wing within the Republican Party with doubts as well.
“There is a deep frustration and a deep weariness of our inability as a country to impose our will on events,” Dallek said. “Look at all our resources and all the U.S. blood and treasure that have been spent on Iraq and Afghanistan, and look where we are now.”
In making his case about the immediate threat posed by the Islamic State, Gardner pointed to reports coming from the Pentagon about U.S. citizens fighting alongside militants in the region.
Gardner also cited the case of a young Colorado woman who pleaded guilty this month to a charge of trying to help the Islamic State and related terrorist organizations. Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, was arrested in April at Denver International Airport as she was preparing to travel to Syria.
The Islamic State and its members have “the time and the space and the organization to operate,” and are a “direct threat” to the U.S. and its allies, Gardner said.
To deal with the danger, Gardner said Obama needs to develop a “clear strategic mission,” but offered few other specifics.
Like Udall, Gardner opposes the deployment of U.S. ground troops in Syria and Iraq to combat the Islamic State. Both men also voted in support of legislation last week that would arm so-called “moderate” opponents of the terrorist group.
Reached by phone, Udall reiterated his assertion that the Islamic State is a “serious” concern. But he added that the “intelligence doesn't support (the premise that) ISIL has the capacity to attack us today.”
“Congressman Gardner wants to argue about semantics, but my focus is on getting the job done,” Udall said.
While Udall does not see an imminent risk to the U.S. homeland, he says the country still must strike quickly against Islamic State militants before they get that chance.
“Intelligence does support (that) they are a serious threat if we don't face them down now,” he said.
That Udall isn't sounding the alarm as loudly as Gardner is partially a function of Udall's role in the Senate. He sits on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Select Commitee on Intelligence, where members have access to classified documents often not available to other lawmakers. (Gardner is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.)
Trying to explain his position has gotten Udall in trouble on the campaign trail. At a recent debate with Gardner, Udall said the U.S. shouldn't be “impulsive” following the beheadings of two U.S. journalists at the hands of Islamic State captors.
“I can tell you, Steve Sotloff and James Foley would tell us, ‘Don't be impulsive. Horrible and barbarous as those executions were, don't be impulsive. Come up with a plan to knock ISIL back,' ” Udall said.
Gardner criticized Udall for speaking for the two dead Americans, and Udall issued an apology.
War skeptic
Even so, the line captures Udall's general reluctance toward military intervention overseas. His father, the late U.S. Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., was an early critic of the Vietnam War. And Mark Udall was similarly skeptical of the Iraq War — voting in 2002 against the force resolution sought by then-President George W. Bush.
Udall, then a member of the House, was one of 133 members to vote against the resolution, saying ahead of the vote that it “could take us to a costly full-scale war with Iraq too quickly when we have not exhausted every other means of preventing it.”
He recalled that debate when asked about the danger posed by Islamic State fighters.
“There's a real irony right now,” Udall continued. “We were told 12 years ago that we needed to go into Iraq because there were terrorists there with weapons of mass destruction.”
And while that claim was proved false, Udall said now there is a real threat in Iraq that requires U.S. intervention. However, he added, the burden to confront the Islamic State shouldn't fall on Washington alone. Arab nations must “do their part,” he said.
“For too long, Arab countries (have been) both arsonists and firemen; it's time for them to step up and defeat ISIL.”
But U.S. attempts to assemble a coalition to face the Islamic State — or rally other countries for a variety of other causes — is hamstrung, Udall said, by the continued existence of the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
“Its existence makes it harder to work with our allies,” Udall said.
Gitmo differences
Here is another sharp divide between Udall and Gardner: For several years, Udall has pushed Congress and the White House to close the facility, which Udall considers both a “recruiting tool for extremists” and “a symbol around the world of an America that flouts the rule of law.”
Instead, Udall has raised the idea of trying the detainees in either military commissions or civilian courts — though he has lauded the effectiveness of the U.S. justice system in dealing with terrorism.
“Sooner rather than later, this facility will have to close and no matter where the detainees are transferred, Sen. Udall believes they must face justice in the highest security facilities possible,” a Udall spokesman said.
Gardner had a more direct take. He supports keeping Guantanamo Bay open as long as necessary, even if that means the detainees are never released or ever face a civilian court. He does, however, support trying the detainees in military tribunals.
“Sen. Udall wants to read them the Miranda rights,” Gardner said. “I want to keep them out of this country.”
The two lawmakers are less apart on their defense of civil liberties for U.S. citizens — though Udall has played a more prominent role in advocating a check on Big Brother intrusions. Gardner acknowledged Udall's activism during a recent debate.
“I've made sure that I've stood for privacy and the rights of the people time and time again,” Gardner said. “And I appreciate Sen. Udall's work on this issue as well.”
Udall frequently has criticized the data collection methods used by the National Security Agency. And he co-authored legislation in 2013 that would bar the bulk collection of Americans' records as well as add more oversight to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which largely has rubber-stamped requests by U.S. authorities to undertake surveillance operations against suspected foreign threats.
“We need to end the NSA's collection of millions of innocent Americans' private phone records and focus on the real problem: terrorists and spies,” Udall said last year in introducing the measure — though Congress continues to debate its main provisions.
Gardner, meanwhile, backed related legislation in the House last year that would end the NSA's blanket collection of phone records, according to supporters.
He said Congress needs to help ensure a “balance” between security needs and privacy concerns.

Flipboard started on mobile devices, but the magazine app is moving to the web today with the launch of a new site. Its 75 million registered users will be getting access to its superior formatting and curation features for articles, photos and video on their desktops and laptops.
But why the web?
The company has already added 25 million registered users since launching a do-it-yourself mobile magazine creation tool in late March, for a total of around 75 million people to date. If it stayed mobile-only instead of becoming mobile-first — a decision many tech entrepreneurs are considering these days — it would probably continue to grow just fine.
The answer is that the web is still core to how many users behave, particularly around features like easy-access share buttons for distributing articles across social networks and email. If you click on a Flipboard link that you see from a friend on Twitter, for example, you'll now open a dynamic web page instead of being directed to the mobile app like you would have been before (ex: here's our TechCrunch Weekly magazine of our top stories, updated every Friday).
Browsing is also at least as easy as the touch interface offered on Flipboard's iOS and Android native apps, courtesy of Charles Ying and others working on the HTML5 experience for the company. You can use your mouse, magic mouse or trackpad to quickly flip left or right through the stories. If you have a clickwheel, each click turns a page. A navigation scrub bar at the bottom of each magazine lets you quickly browse through the compilation.
“It doesn't matter if the web site cannibalizes native app traffic,” founder Mike McCue says about the web version. “We don't care where the user comes from. We're trying to curate awesome content on any device, as optimized as possible.”
Beyond distribution and a better user experience, being web friendly fits into the Flipboard business plan. The company has begun selling full-page ads mixed in with regular content like what you might see in a high-end print magazine. Larger professional publishers, including the owners of this publication, currently have revenue-sharing agreements in place for their own magazines, but the company plans to expand that to other content and curation creators.
About 2 million magazines have been created since the March launch of the DIY tool, and many of the top ones are being curated by enthusiasts rather than pros — photography, maritime shipping, beer, and GIFS are some example themes. There's a lot of additional reader attention to sell against.
But what about the publications trying to figure out their online (and mobile) business models? Why should they want Flipboard to get a piece of their precious few remaining ad dollars via alternative destinations like native apps and now its own web links?
For some of them/us, the answer is going to be that they don't have the resources to build good websites and mobile apps anyway. For others, it's that they can build their own products but don't know how to monetize them well.
And for the publishers who have figured out web and mobile design *and* monetization, Flipboard has another answer. You'll be able to adjust your administrator settings to decide how Flipboard links behave, McCue tells me. If you don't want them to go to the company's pages, you can set them to resolve straight to your home site URLs and keep the ad revenue and maybe subscription funnel intact.
He hopes, however, that the Flipboard ad format will appeal so strongly to so many advertisers that they'll eventually be spending money more like they did in the golden age of print and less like they do on web and mobile publishers these days.
Professional-grade content has generally not been something that Silicon Valley types want to take bets on, so it's unusual (and pleasant) to see a company led by a veteran tech entrepreneur and backed by top investors working on solutions to our product and monetization problems.
Flipboard also has another launch today, a nonprofits section featuring topical magazines curated by Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF and the Larry King Cardiac Foundation among others. You can find them all via a red ribbon inside the Flipboard interface under the “Big Ideas” category.
The new web versions are supported by the latest versions of all the main desktop and mobile browsers, including IE9+, Safari, Chrome and Firefox, and are offered in 11 languages, including English, Chinese, French, German and Japanese.

It happens every year, but this year is shaping up as one of the worst ever. During Indonesia's dry season, certain people—rarely identified, much less punished—set fires to make land suitable for the palm oil and paper-and-pulp industries. Those fires generate huge amounts of smoke, and the toxic haze often reaches neighboring countries, including Singapore and Malaysia. But this year the El Niño weather phenomenon has created extremely dry conditions, leading to an unusually intense, long-lasting “smoke-out” for the region, affecting everything from travel to sporting events to respiratory health.
So far this year, Indonesia's fires have produced more pollution than Germany or Japan does in a year. On 26 days from the period of Sept. 1 to Oct. 14, their daily emissions surpassed those of the entire US (the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China), according to researchers led by Guido van der Werf from VU University Amsterdam. They calculated that the 100,000-plus fires in Indonesia detected so far this year (as of Oct. 21) have emitted about 1.4 billion metric tons (1.5 billion tons) of carbon dioxide equivalents. That puts the country on track for its worst fire year since 1997. On Oct. 14 alone there were more than 4,700 fire alerts—that's more than on any single day in the past two years.
So why are these fires so potent? More than half of them this year has occurred on peatland areas, concentrated mainly in south Sumatra, south and central Kalimantan (on Borneo), and Papua, according to the World Resources Institute, citing data from Global Forest Watch Fires.
NASA The smoke covering Borneo, as seen from NASA's Aqua satellite on Oct. 19.
Tropical peatland fires are not like regular forest fires. They generate enormous amounts of smoke and are fiendishly difficult to extinguish. Draining and burning these lands for agricultural expansion leads to huge spikes in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the institute, peat fires can emit up to 10 times more methane—a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide—than fires occurring on other types of land. Taken together, the impact of peat fires on global warming can be more than 200 times greater than fires on other lands.
Don't expect such fires to go away anytime soon. Indonesia and Malaysia—which control about 85% of the world's palm oil production—recently announced their intentions to establish a palm oil cartel. This could help them set their own environmental standards (or maintain the status quo), and pay less heed to calls to produce palm oil in ways that preserve wildlife habitat, protect the environment, and don't make breathing so difficult for millions of people living in Southeast Asia.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated an incorrect amount for the carbon dioxide equivalents emitted by Indonesia's fires so far this year. The figure has been corrected and updated.

International findings on the safety of Genetically Modified Organisms are rarely reported on in Western mainstream media. Despite fierce resistance to GMOs in other countries, North Americans are just now starting to learn that GMOs are unsafe for human consumption, and that they pose significant environmental risks, too.
This is precisely why dozens upon dozens of countries around the world have completely banned GMOs from being imported or grown in their country. While major Western government health organizations say the science is clear on their safety, multiple governments, researchers, and scientific publications around the world beg to differ.
The Norwegian government, via The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board (NBAB), is one such group. Commissioned by the Norwegian Environment Agency late last year to develop a guidance document in line with the Norwegian Gene Technology Act, their aim was to assess the sustainability of genetically modified (GM) herbicide-tolerant (HT) plants.
The report examines a dossier that was submitted to the Brazilian government by Monsanto, and it outlined how the research was flawed and lacking a tremendous amount of data. The study also pointed out a myriad of other concerns with regards to GMO Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans, finally concluding that the science behind the cultivation of this crop is simply inadequate. The report highlights a range of methodological weaknesses as well as the problem of incomplete information, research, and science on Genetically Modified Crops. This is something various other countries and scientists around the world have already suggested before.
The fact that long-term effects require long-term studies may seem obvious, but it's apparently beyond the comprehension of GMO regulators worldwide, none of whom require tests of longer than 90 days in rats (about 7 years in human terms). It's a case of “don't look, don't see”. (source)

Norway is one of many countries in Europe to ban genetically modified products and to choose not to produce them. In fact, they are one of the most restrictive importers of GM products, with several EU-approved GMOs being strictly illegal in the country. (source)
The global resistance against Genetically Modified Crops is growing at an exponential rate. A few years ago, you were almost ridiculed for suggesting that GM foods could be hazardous, but now scientists and researchers are presenting information that has 19 new countries joining an already long list of nations to completely ban, or at least place severe restrictions on, GMOs — and the pesticides that go with them. You can read more about that here.
What does this mean for the political relations between countries refusing GMOs and North America? It's difficult to say, but a set of Wikileaks cables reveal that the State Department was lobbying all over the world for Monsanto and other major biotech corporations. They also reveal that American diplomats requested funding to send biotech lobbyists to meet with politicians and agricultural officials in “target countries.” These included countries in Africa, Latin America, and Europe.
One of the most revealing cables is from 2007. It looks at French efforts to ban a Monsanto GM corn variety. HERE is a cable that shows Craig Stapleton, former ambassador to France under the Bush administration, asking Washington to punish the EU countries that did not support the use of GM crops:
Moving to retaliation will make clear that the current path has real costs to EU interests and could help strengthen European pro-biotech voices. . . . Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. (source)
This is basically pressuring and threatening countries to accept the import of North American genetically modified products.
More On GMOs & Why More Countries Are Refusing Them
The main concerns over GMOs are related to human and environmental health. Alongside all of these troubles (according to Reuters), some countries simply want to take time to do proper research — flying in the face of the World Health Organization's (WHO) decree that GMOs are completely safe:
As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that GMOs were safe. – Jane Goodall (source)
There is plenty of research to oppose that assertion, such as one study published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe. The WHO has never cited any long-term studies that prove the safety of GMOs. When a study was finally conducted, it found severe liver and kidney damage, as well as hormonal disturbances, in rats fed GM maize in conjunction with low levels of Roundup — levels that were below those permitted in most drinking water across Europe. The rats also developed large cancer tumours. (source)
Other studies have found instances of adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues. They also determined that no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods have been established. Many studies have emphasized that more scientific effort is needed in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.(source)(source)
Studies have also linked GMO animal feed to severe stomach inflammation and enlarged uteri in pigs. (source)
Here's what Irina Ermakova, VP of Russia's National Association for Genetic Safety, said last year when Russia was mulling over the decision to ban GMOs:
It is necessary to ban GMO, to impose moratorium [on it] for 10 years. While GMO will be prohibited, we can plan experiments, tests, or maybe even new methods of research could be developed. . . . It has been proved that not only in Russia, but also in many other countries in the world, GMO is dangerous. Methods of obtaining the GMO are not perfect, therefore, at this stage, all GMOs are dangerous. . . . Consumption and use of GMOs obtained in such way can lead to tumors, cancers and obesity among animals. . . . Biotechnologies certainly should be developed, but GMO should be stopped. [We] should stop it from spreading. (source)
Keep in mind that we are talking about GM crops which are sprayed with billions of pounds of toxic chemicals every year. These chemicals have been linked to a number of diseases, ranging from autism and Alzheimer's disease to cancer and more.
“Children today are sicker than they were a generation ago. From childhood cancers to autism, birth defects and asthma, a wide range of childhood diseases and disorders are on the rise. Our assessment of the latest science leaves little room for doubt; pesticides are one key driver of this sobering trend.”– October 2012 report by Pesticide Action Network North America (PANNA) (source)(source)
The list goes on and on. I recommend the below book if you want to learn more about this issue.

“Altered Genes, Twisted Truth will stand as a landmark. It should be required reading in every university biology course.” –Joseph Cummins, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Genetics, Western University, London, Ontario (source)
“This incisive and insightful book is truly outstanding. Not only is it well-reasoned and scientifically solid, it's a pleasure to read – and a must-read. Through its masterful marshaling of facts, it dispels the cloud of disinformation that has misled people into believing that GE foods have been adequately tested and don't entail abnormal risk.” –David Schubert, Ph.D. molecular biologist and Head of Cellular Neurobiology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies (source)
Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.
SAN ANTONIO -- News 4 San Antonio has learned there have been 129 murders so far this year, compared to 85 this time last year. San Antonio hasn't seen so many murders since 1995.
Some of the youngest victims include five-year-old Ana Garza who was shot in the head while she slept inside her home on Pecan Valley Drive in June, and seven-year-old Iris Rodriguez who was also shot while walking to a West side store with her Family the same month.
At the time of the little girls' deaths, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said people were too quick to reach for their guns.
"Walk away, do something, but don't go for your gun," said McManus back in June.
Months earlier, McManus had echoed the same thing.
SAPD tells News 4 San Antonio as for the recent murder rate, "We are up as are many big cities nationwide. There is no static reason for the increase."

The New York Times reports Wednesday that the Obama administration is considering a plan to provide direct military aid to Syrian Kurdish fighters to launch an offensive to retake ISIS's capital, Raqqa. This is a sign, along with the ongoing campaign to retake Mosul in Iraq, that the administration plans to make the destruction of ISIS a priority in its final months. After the recent collapse of the Syrian cease-fire made a more comprehensive settlement of the Syrian conflict all but impossible, this may be the best Obama can hope for.
The U.S. has already been coordinating operations with the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, and likely covertly providing them some weapons. It has also provided weapons to a coalition of Turkish-approved Arab fighters and Kurds. But it has avoided directly arming the YPG due to Turkish objections. Turkey views the Syrian Kurdish militias as allies of the PKK, the Kurdish militant group fighting on Turkish soil. Defying Turkey's wishes so flagrantly would be a pretty big shift.
Tuesday, in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan included the YPG along with ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra on a list of terrorist groups carrying out attacks in Syria. Last month, Turkish ground forces and Turkish-backed rebels launched a ground offensive into Syria aimed both at ISIS and at preventing the Kurds from gaining any more territory along the Turkish border.
The Kurds, long marginalized and discriminated against in Bashar al-Assad's Syria, have carved out an autonomous region in eastern Syria known locally as Rojava or “west,” as in the western region of greater Kurdistan. Rather than full independence, they have declared themselves a federal region, calling for a democratic decentralized Syria. Secular, feminist, and mostly democratic, Rojava gets extremely good press, championed by both hawkish Republican senators and anarchist academics, who gloss over a few of its darker aspects. The Rojava Kurds do share much of the ideology of Turkey's PKK and revere its imprisoned founder, Abdullah Ocalan, but claim to be an entirely separate organization. That's been good enough for Washington, but obviously not for Turkey. A decision to provide direct aid to what Turkey considers a terrorist organization will undoubtedly enrage Ankara.
So why would Obama do it? Whatever their political goals, the Syrian Kurds have undoubtedly been one of the most effective forces fighting ISIS. But with Turkey's recent offensive, Syrian Kurds are, understandably, worried that the U.S. will abandon them once they're no longer useful, just as it did multiple times during the Iraqi Kurds' fight against Saddam Hussein. According to the Times, the plan under discussion includes small arms and ammunition but not the heavy artillery and anti-tank weapons that the YPG would like. (Though photos suggest that, somehow or another, the Kurds have gotten their hands on some of these.) That this story is coming out, just a day after Erdoğan's truculent U.N. speech, seems less like a major shift in battlefield strategy than a political signal to the Kurds that the U.S. takes the alliance seriously—and to Erdoğan, that he can't call the shots when it comes to U.S. strategy against ISIS.
Relations between the Obama administration and the Turkish government have been getting rockier for some time now, particularly since the attempted coup in Turkey two months ago and Erdoğan's aggressive crackdown following it. These relations haven't been helped by the Turkish demands that Washington turn over U.S.-based imam Fethullah Gulen, who Erdoğan blames for organizing the coup and who he repeatedly called a terrorist in his speech Tuesday.
Much to the irritation of the Obama administration, it's been clear for a while that Turkey's priorities in Syria are containing the Kurds, helping the anti-Assad rebels, and fighting ISIS, in that order. When the administration was still holding out hope of restoring some semblance of peace and stability to Syria, it was necessary to placate Turkey, one of the most important backers of the anti-Assad opposition. Now that Obama seems to have decided that the cruder and simpler goal of routing ISIS from its territory will take precedence during his final year in office, keeping Turkey happy is less important.
In the early 17th century, walloon smiths were famous for their ironwork, and the Swedish kings therefore invited them to settle in Sweden. A substantial number did, but quickly found that they did not like the Swedish beer. Instead, they preferred the walloon type of beer, which from the description sounds similar to Flemish red or oud bruin. One style seems to have been "Maastrichts oud", which was lightly soured by cellaring in wooden barrels.
To satisfy their craving for walloon beer, the walloons started brewing their own beer. Out of this brewing quickly developed what seems to be a Swedish variation: hundred-year beer (hundraårig öl). This was a beer primarily made for the aristocratic owners of iron works or major mansions.
It was brewed the same way as the walloon beer, and then stored in big wooden tuns. After a few years, half the beer would be drained off and bottled, and a new batch would be used to fill up the barrel again. This would go on for, in quite a few cases, many decades. The barrel would never be emptied, so it could literally be said to be hundred-year beer, although obviously the beer from a century ago would be present only "in homeopathic concentration" as one source put it.
Walloon beer casks, Rebecq (at Tilquin)
This may sound incredible, but there are in fact very good sources to underpin this story. One source from Finspåg in Östergötland writes about the 17th century walloon brewer Lina Goffin (Gauffin), who brewed "old ale for the master of the manor". Then, in 1760, in a description of Östergötland, another source writes of the famous beer tun called "uncle" (mor-bror), containing beer brewed in 1646 by one Lina Goffin. A quarter of it is still left, he writes, and nothing has been added since it was first brewed, "so that it is now a powerful medicine".
Another example is a letter, written by the manager of Söderfors Bruk in May 1873. The author managed the ironworks there from 1820 to 1868, and in all that time he took good care of a tun of hundred-year beer. He writes that it originally dates from 1794. The letter is written to say that he now donates this tun to his successors as managers, in the hope that they will "take good care of it" (emphasis in original), by adding freshly brewed beer every other year. He hopes the tun can be preserved "into the remotest future".
This type of beer became a Christmas delicacy, to be drank in small glasses like the noblest wine. And since it in some ways clearly lasted for centuries, I feel it justifies the title. An obvious question is of course when the tradition died out. That doesn't seem to be known. My source (a book from 1968, see below) writes that in the 1960s there were still families in central Sweden who had a tun in their possession. They would generally get help from local breweries, like Uppsala Bryggeri, to get new beer to add to the tun every other year.
A description of the brewing, written in 1952 and housed at the Nordic Museum in Stockholm, shows how the beer was brewed. Or rather, how it was brewed at Söderfors Bruk in the 1950s. Very likely it's been brewed in different ways at different times and in different places.
Stockholm Old Town at night
60 kilos of malts were used to produce 75 liters of beer. The brewer would pour the unmilled malts into the mashtun, then crush them with the malt shovel against the side of the tun. As a result, the brewer would be covered in white malt dust and look like "a snowman." It was gradually mixed with cold water, then left for some hours. This must have caused lactic bacteria in the malts to sour the beer. Then 200 liters of boiling water would be poured onto the malts. Once the mash had settled, the watery part at the top would be taken off, boiled, and poured back. This was repeated 11 more times!
The wort was then boiled with 5 kilos of hops until the volume was reduced to the desired 75 liters. It was fermented with ordinary "brewery yeast" (not clear exactly what that means). After 24 hours of fermentation, 75 liters of old beer would be drained from the old cask and bottled, and the 75 liters of new beer added.
Now this sounds like a Christmas beer worth trying, but it seems the only way to do it is to go round the old manors outside Uppsala, knocking on the doors of the ones that have suspiciously big cellars.

My single source for this is Harald Thunæus's excellent book on Swedish beer history, published in 1968. I stumbled across it just a couple of days ago, and so haven't had time to track down his references. All of the sources above are quoted in the book. I did Google around to learn more, but found essentially nothing. The title is stolen from one of Thunæus's sources.

NEW DELHI: India has taken a firm step towards building 20 world-class educational institutions, which will be termed Institutions of Eminence, with the human resource development ministry moving the proposal to the Union Cabinet for approval. Firmly bearing the stamp of the Prime Minister's Office, this is a new framework to catapult Indian institutions to global recognition by freeing the best of them from the University Grants Commission's restrictive regulatory regime and ushering in an unprecedented level of institutional autonomy. Here are some of the finer details:The UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) regulations, 2017 will govern all such institutions that are conferred with this status, ensuring their complete academic, administrative and financial autonomy. These regulations will override all other UGC regulations and free the institutions of UGC's restrictive inspection regime, the regulatory control over fee and curriculum.* The institutions will have to achieve a place in the top 500 of any of the global rankings within 10 years of being declared an institution of eminence and eventually reach the top 100 slot* They will have a teacher:student ratio of 1:20 to begin with and 1:10 in five years, with a student enrolment of 15,000 in 15 years. There will be a good mix of Indian and international faculty, and only those who come with a degree from top 500 institutions in global rankings will be considered eligible foreign faculty.* The institutions will be free to select students through a merit-based transparent admission process to ensure no meritorious student is turned away for lack of funds. Up to 30% foreign students vis-a-vis the strength of domestic students can be admitted. The institution will be free to decide its fee structure but will have to declare it in a transparent manner. Any reports of capitation fee will be treated as serious violation. An Ombudsman will be set up to cater to student grievances.* One paper will have to be published per faculty member per year on average in a reputed peer reviewed international journal, with publications included in SCOPUS, Web Science, etc to be counted as a research publication. A world-class library with subscriptions to reputed journals related to courses offered will have to be maintained along with cutting-edge research in frontier areas.* Along-term lead campus (30 years minimum) with adequate space for expansion.* While private institutions will not get any government funding they will be able to access government funds for specific studies and projects they may execute.* Full freedom to the institution to decide course structure, the credit hours needed for a degree, fixing of curriculum and syllabus and up to 20% online courses as part of its programmes and fully online certificate courses. Full freedom to hire faculty, even industry personnel as faculty and choose any career progression scheme, salary structure for its faculty. None of its academic collaborations will need government approval unless they are with countries on the foreign ministry's or home ministry's ‘negative list'.* Ten government run and ten private institutions will be conferred this status, with Rs 10,000 crore funding earmarked for the former.* While a government-owned institution will apply to HRD ministry for the special status, a private deemed to be university or private state universitywill have to be backed by a sponsoring organisation with a total net worth of Rs 5,000 crore and credible members, an identified first chancellor and vice chancellor, and a detailed 15-year vision plan besides a five-year rolling implementation plan.* The governance structure of the institution and its sponsoring organisation will be different.* An empowered expert committee with three to five eminent persons appointed for three years with the final approval of the appointments committee of the Cabinet headed by the PM will select the 20 institutes. The EEC will recommend the names to the UGC, which will forward its decision to the HRD ministry that will issue a letter of intent to such institutions and decide on the final conferment of the status after a memorandum of understanding.* EEC will monitor and review the institutions of eminence to ensure quality, decide on appeals, changes in transfer of sponsorship and liquidation of corpus fund if necessitated amongother things.
Everyone looks at programming languages differently. There are those that want speed and are willing to compromise syntax (I'm looking at you C++ developers), and then there are those that would rather have something that looks beautiful but lacks in performance (like Ruby). I've never understood why a language didn't exist that married the two ideas into a language that was both fast, and beautiful.
Several languages have tried over the years and a few have gotten close. Go is a perfect example. Still loosely based on the C language, Go has an easier to understand and easier to read syntax without sacrificing too much on the performance end. Having been developed by Google it has also matured quickly and gained a high adoption rate. It also compiles down to machine code which means you can use it to write the same types of programs in Go where you'd normally use C. However it's still not as beginner friendly or as easy to understand as a language like Python or Ruby.
Enter Crystal, a beautiful Ruby-esque programming language that compiles down to machine code. I stumbled upon crystal while searching for a way to make Ruby compile to machine code, or at least C, and instantly fell in love. Here are some of the things I love about Crystal:
It's statically typed, but with built-in type inference. That means no more bugs due to incorrect types.
It compiles to native machine code which means much faster execution time. The compiler is also extremely fast and can compile itself in under 30 seconds on my machine.
Crystal is written in Crystal which makes contributing to the language super easy.
It's syntax is so similar to Ruby that some Ruby programs are actually valid Crystal programs and vice-versa.
It has a modern standard library complete with support for JSON, Markdown, XML, and YAML parsing; it also has built in websocket support and macros.
And those are just to name a few. Crystal also comes with a built-in package and dependency manager called Shards that makes distributing libraries and binaries easy.
Crystal's syntax is clear, concise, and human readable. Here is an example (taken from their website):
That code could easily be ruby, but the major difference is that when I run crystal build myserver.cr my little server will get compiled into a single binary file called myserver which ends up being upwards of 100x faster than the Ruby version.
So how fast is it?
Excellent question, for which we'll need some benchmarks. Lucky for me others have already taken up the task of creating these benchmarks and have provided us with some pretty great data.
I decided to run some of the examples myself and got similar responses. All examples show execution time and memory usage.

As you can see Crystal is closer to the speed of C than it is to Ruby. By a lot in most cases.
Crystal's Status
Right now Crystal is still in the alpha stage, meaning that there will be breaking changes along the line. That being said it is one of the least buggy alpha's that I have ever been a part of.
Yes, Crystal is still missing some things, Windows support for one; but the future looks bright for this new kid on the block and I, for one, can't wait to see where it goes.
How Can I Help?
Crystal is open sourced and located at github.com. They accept pull requests and seem to respond to issues very quickly. You can also help out by evangelizing Crystal, like I am now, submitting issues, and adding your own “shards” to github.
Happy coding!
Court documents released on Monday show how an adviser to Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign, George Papadopoulos, repeatedly sought to set up a meeting between the Russian government and Mr. Trump and his campaign officials.
Mr. Papadopoulos contacted the campaign at least 11 times from March to June 2016 about a potential meeting. Campaign officials discussed or replied to his messages at least three times, and they encouraged Mr. Papadopoulos and another adviser to make the trip to meet Russian officials, which never took place.
Meets a Professor With Russian Ties

On March 14, 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos, while traveling in Italy, met a professor who claimed to have substantial connections with Russian government officials. At the time, Mr. Papadopoulos was set to become a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign.
On March 24, Mr. Papadopoulos met again with the professor, who brought a Russian woman he introduced as having ties to the Russian government.
Seeks a Meeting Between Russian Officials and Trump Campaign

After the meeting with the professor, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed the Trump campaign supervisor and members of the campaign's foreign policy team about arranging a meeting between campaign and Russian officials to discuss how United States-Russia relations would be if Mr. Trump were elected.
In response, the campaign supervisor said that he would “work it through the campaign,” but that no commitment should be made at that point, adding, “Great work.”
On March 31, at a national security meeting in Washington, D.C., with Mr. Trump present, Mr. Papadopoulos said that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
Mr. Papadopoulos continued to correspond with the professor and the Russian woman to arrange a meeting, while informing the campaign of his progress.
Speaks With Another Russian Connection

On April 18, the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos via email to a Russian who said he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Over the next several weeks, Mr. Papadopoulos and the Russian had multiple conversations trying to set up a meeting between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.
On April 25, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed a senior campaign adviser and said there was “an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet when he is ready.”

On April 26, in another meeting with the professor, Mr. Papadopoulos is told that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, involving thousands of emails.
Told to Pursue a Meeting

After the conversation with the professor, in at least eight emails to campaign officials, Mr. Papadopoulos reiterated Russia's interest in meeting with Mr. Trump.
In June, Mr. Papadopoulos asked a high-ranking campaign official about the trip again, stating that “I am willing to make the trip off the record if it's in the interest of Mr. Trump and the campaign to meet specific people.”
In August, the campaign supervisor encouraged Mr. Papadopoulos and another adviser to “make the trip, if it is feasible.” The trip did not take place.
Pleads Guilty to Lying to the F.B.I.

One of the hardest parts about performing on stage is that it's not what you've practiced. To get to the point where you can play on stage for the first time you've put in hours on your instrument, and then you're expected to just know how to behave on stage. With little clue of what to do you end up performing a strange mixture of things you've seen your favourite performers do, things you've seen your mates do on stage and whatever you feel like doing in the moment. This can create a brilliant performance, but it also tends to leave people with a few bad habits in key areas. Here's a few of the more common ones we've all been guilty of.
1. “We're experiencing technical difficulties”
It's happened to every single one of us. You're halfway through your set and the PA cuts out, or the guitarist's pedalboard goes haywire, or the bassist takes a little too long to tune up or any one of a number of things that can go wrong does go wrong. It's mostly nobody's fault, but somebody has to fix it. If you're the one on the microphone it's up to you to control the way the performance moves forward while the issue is remedied. Unfortunately what most people do in this scenario is default to the same lines. “We're just having some technical difficulties” or “oh here we go again, we're just waiting for Pete to tune up.”
What you think you're doing:
Much like a comedian dealing with an awkward heckler or a piece of the set falling apart, you're trying to reference and release the tension of the moment by making light of it. You feel awkward and the weight of expectation is on you to keep the audience on side, so you try to shift that awkwardness back to its source.
What you're actually doing:
The difference here is that you're shifting the focus of the audience, and therefore the tension in the room, on to the person dealing with the problem. There are two possibilities here. 1) The audience hasn't yet noticed something is wrong. By telling them what's gone wrong you're bringing it to their attention and making them feel awkward. 2) The audience has noticed what is happening. They don't need you to tell them what's happened, and drawing more attention to it only makes them feel awkward for the poor guy on stage working really hard to locate and remedy the issue.
What you could do:
You have a couple of options here. Firstly you should be prepared for this sort of thing to happen. Hi-hats come unfastened, guitar pedals cut out and strings slip out of tune. So you may as well be ready. Where possible, have different songs that can be played without each of your instrumentalists. If you can give your bandmate a whole song's-worth of breathing space you'll find that most problems can be fixed in 3-4 minutes, and your audience remains entertained.
Where that isn't possible, e.g you're a three piece and it's the guitar that's the problem, you should have some chat saved up for just such an occasion. If you're an original band you can talk a little about the subject matter of the next song (more on overdoing that later), or for a covers band just some old fashioned jokes will do. Either way, the audience will know what you're up to, but they'll see you trying to handle the situation like a professional and will work hard to engage with you while the issues are being fixed.
2. In-Jokes
One of the most awkward experiences I've ever been part of as an audience was the best man's speech I had to sit through at a gig a few years back. To be fair to the guy most people are not professional orators, and you've got to expect a few bad jokes from the best man. But this guy had one habit I've seen in a lot of musicians before. He kept making in-jokes. Specifically he kept talking about ‘high places.' “high places eh Jeff? High places?” Nobody knew what he was talking about, save for two or three people on one table who laughed a little. Musicians do this all the time at gigs where they know a few people in the audience.
What you think you're doing:
In a situation where you're in charge of the microphone and need to say something to fill a gap, you reference a running joke between you and your 2-3 friends in the audience knowing that you'll at least get a laugh from them.
What you're actually doing:
Alienating the vast majority of the audience in exchange for the entertainment of a couple of people. This makes the audience members that don't know you feel less engaged with what you are doing. These are the people you should be engaging with the most, but now you'll have to work twice as hard during the next song to win them back.
What you could do:
If the in-joke has an interesting backstory you could tell it early on in the gig. If not, make one up. If you can find a way to make it funny then you create an in-joke between you and your audience. Referencing it later should guarantee you some laughs when you need them. Otherwise, avoid it like you would avoid high places.
3. Introducing every song
This one's pretty self-explanatory and it would be hypocritical of me to write several paragraphs explaining it.
What you think you're doing:
If you're an original artist you want to give you audience a deeper understanding of the song you lovingly crafted for them, with explanations as to where the subject matter came to you and how you wrote it. As a cover band musician you want to either prepare people for what's coming next, or tell them the name of the song in case they haven't heard it before.
What you're actually doing:
In both cases you're ruining the flow of your performance. People mostly didn't come to your gig to listen to you talk. Especially if you're playing covers. People may want to know about some of your original songs, but if you're playing covers they mostly don't care about what you have to say. Most well known covers can be recognised from the introduction alone. By telling your audience in advance what the song is going to be you deprive them of the chance to enjoy recognising a song they like for themselves.
What you could do:
If you're an original artist, pick a couple of songs to talk about at length, pick different ones every gig. If your audience has seen you play before, then every gig will give them a little bit of new information about you, and you'll keep them engaged. If you're a cover band musician you mostly don't need to say anything. Your job is to make people dance and/or drink, and the part of the gig where you're talking is the part where they have time to realise they are tired and want to sit down or go home. In both cases think of other ways to link songs. If you have a couple that are in the same key, or that share a similar groove, see if you can segue from one in to the other. Or if you need time to change settings between songs, have someone on another instrument play an extended intro or a whole song on their own.
These are a few of my personal least favourite things I see from a lot of otherwise talented musicians. All of which I've been guilty of in the past at some point too, and stopped doing when I saw other people do them and realised how they affected me as an audience member. If you have any suggestions for the list feel free to add them to the comments below.

Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders are inviting hundreds of people to a rally Saturday that could spill out of downtown Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square.
No, Sanders won't be there. He'll be appearing on a nationally streamed telecast after the rally. But the speakers confirmed so far include racial justice and environmental advocates, a state representative and Portland City Commissioner Steve Novick.
The last major Sanders event in Portland, when the candidate spoke at the Moda Center in August, drew 28,000 people -- making it the campaign's largest rally at the time.
Here's everything should know if you're thinking about going -- of if you'll be in the area and wonder what the crowds are all about:
Where: Pioneer Courthouse Square, which is circled by four MAX lines and bound by SW Yamhill and Morrison Streets, SW Broadway, SW Sixth Avenue. If you're using your phone to find directions, the official address is 701 SW Sixth Ave.
When: The speeches start at noon and will likely last until after 2 p.m. The telecast with Sanders, starting at 3 p.m. local time, will be shown at a handful of bars and restaurants across Portland. For more details, go to the campaign's website.
Who's speaking? Confirmed speakers include Rep. Rob Nosse, D-Portland, Portland City Commissioner Steve Novick, Milwaukie Mayor Mark Gamba, Teressa Raiford of Don't Shoot Portland, Cameron Whitten of Know Your City and former Portland City Council candidate Nick Caleb.
Parking: Available in adjacent garages and parking lots. Public transit might be your best bet coming and going from downtown, whether you plan on attending the rally or not.

The skeleton belonged to a man who lived in Kostenki, which is part of what is now Russia.
Dubbed "the first European", the skeleton was examined by experts as part of a study into the early origins of Europeans.
"From a genetic point of view he is a European. In fact he is more closely related to the Danes, Swedes, Finns and Russians than with the French, Germans or the Spaniards," said Eske Willerslev, director of Centre of Excellence in GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, and one of the researchers involved in the study.
The purpose of the study was to find out when the divergence between the people who became Europeans and Asians occurred.
Scientific journals reported that analysis of the Kostenki skeleton also revealed the presence of Neanderthal genes. Previous scientific findings indicated that there was a brief period when Neanderthals and humans bred together.
"What we can see from Kostenki and other ancient genomes is that for 30,000 years there was a single meta-population in Europe. These Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer groups split up, mixed, dispersed and changed, and through ancient genomes we can trace the genetic thread of their shared ancestry," Willerslev added .
The study of ancient DNA material confirmed that the human populations now predominant in Eurasia and East Asia split more than 36,200 years ago.
Researchers used new techniques to analyze genetic samples from the left tibia of a young man who died 38,700-36,200 years ago.

Regex-constrained strings with FsCheck
Prelude
In Haskell, there's the quickcheck-regex package, by Audrey (唐鳳) Tang, which allows writing and execute this:
generate ( matching "[xX][0-9a-z]" ) // Prints -> "''UVBw"
It exports a matching function that turns a Regular Expression into a DFA/NFA finite-state machine and then into a generator of strings matching that regex:
matching :: String -> Gen String
FsCheck
In F#, a similar generator for FsCheck can be written as:
let matching pattern = Gen . sized ( fun size -> let xeger = Xeger pattern let count = if size < 1 then 1 else size [ for i in 1 .. count -> xeger . Generate () ] |> Gen . elements |> Gen . resize count )
The matching function uses the .NET port of dk.brics.automaton and xeger, and has the signature:
val matching : pattern : string -> Gen < string >
Use in F# Interactive
Here's a way to generate regex-constrained strings with FsCheck in F# Interactive:
# r "../packages/Fare/lib/net35/Fare.dll" # r "../packages/FsCheck/lib/net45/FsCheck.dll" open Fare open FsCheck let matching pattern = Gen . sized ( fun size -> let xeger = Xeger pattern let count = if size < 1 then 1 else size [ for i in 1 .. count -> xeger . Generate () ] |> Gen . elements |> Gen . resize count ) let generate = Gen . sample 1000 9 let a = generate ( matching "[xX][0-9a-z]" ) // val a : string list = ["X3"; "X1"; "x3"; "Xg"; "X7"; "xt"; "x5"; "xe"; "Xl"] let b = generate ( matching " \ d{1,3} \ . \ d{1,3} \ . \ d{1,3}" ) // val b : string list = // ["4.2.2"; "31.28.6"; "6.9.2"; "12.25.1"; "61.6.3"; "61.6.174"; "8.6.3"; // "859.3.052"; "4.5.332"] let c = generate ( matching "^http \ ://[a-zA-Z0-9 \ - \ .]+ \ .[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(/ \ S*)?$" ) // val c : string list = // ["http://ng.EO-qzK8d8-o-2w.U1.-1-6-0793D-88t61.-Zk4K-crxu7L"+[222 chars]; // "http://Xi-3SP6--K.VU"; // "http://B96-4.-B..-..L.y.W4xDpM81...3Y.-BuR.Q8iZ.4-Aiv.---"+[101 chars]; // "http://H.M.fQ..F.-dKYk.3.A-7.G-0rHIV--o81ft-h0G4sHBpx..-S"+[152 chars]; // "http://55..-Zl33Pjh..97.b.9i1-e2y10..S1P-If.K-1KA-UW-O12L"+[108 chars]; // "http://1L-3w..N22gftE2OI68.NU5.4F.D2jD43hG41DC.ATL...-r2V"+[66 chars]; // "http://.3R8.-.-YJh3OP0MZgFn.l.Z.Zv..Y-wOy-.0P6j.-4Uyn7IB."+[167 chars]; // "http://DD.1y54-4Bb8oU2-.T3-kVVzTtYT..-o..IU.2J8lNHZ8p...j"+[126 chars]; // "http://mwa7NSM-Y-Ly5w..LFF"] let d = generate ( matching "^[a-zA-Z''-' \ s]{1,40}$" ) // val d : string list = // ["pqVm"; "tX'iu'SyM'"; "Q''DU'''''or'''O"; "l'L'M''Ew'YH"; // "'O'CV'''U'''S''h"; "'"; "OQgJ'G'fR"; "''VGHWmcUB'T"; "''P"]
Notice how FsCheck yields different results on each run:
let a = generate ( matching "[xX][0-9a-z]" ) let b = generate ( matching "[xX][0-9a-z]" ) let c = generate ( matching "[xX][0-9a-z]" ) // val a : string list = ["x2"; "xn"; "Xc"; "Xf"; "Xm"; "xv"; "x6"; "Xi"; "Xn"] // val b : string list = ["x7"; "X9"; "X3"; "xv"; "xn"; "xk"; "xn"; "xv"; "xo"] // val c : string list = ["X5"; "xj"; "X0"; "xw"; "xq"; "Xg"; "xj"; "xv"; "X6"]
That's because matching takes the size of generated test data into account.
Use in FsCheck with xUnit.net
Finally, here's a quantified property scenario using FsCheck with xUnit.net:
open Fare open FsCheck . Xunit open System . Text . RegularExpressions let matching pattern = Gen . sized ( fun size -> let xeger = Xeger pattern let count = if size < 1 then 1 else size [ for i in 1 .. count -> xeger . Generate () ] |> Gen . elements |> Gen . resize count ) [< Property >] let `` Turns a regex into a generator of strings matching that regex `` () = let pattern = "^http \ ://[a-zA-Z0-9 \ - \ .]+ \ .[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(/ \ S*)?$" let matches = Arb . fromGen ( matching pattern ) Prop . forAll matches ( fun s -> Regex . IsMatch ( s , pattern )) // Output: // Ok, passed 100 tests. // // 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, took 1.34 seconds (xUnit.net 1.9.2).
The above examples are also available on GitHub.

Afro Samurai 2 has been pulled from digital store fronts as the publisher apologises for the state it was released in and offers refunds.
Afro Samurai 2 came out in September to very negative reviews. The game wasn't a hit among users either, with plenty of reports of technical problems, not to mention design issues many, including reviewers, had trouble with.
Since then, the game has completely disappeared from Steam, PlayStation Store, and Xbox Store. Anyone who owned it was offered a refund, as reported by CGM.
Steve Escalante, general manager of publisher Versus Evil, has since apologised for the state the game launched in. “The game was a failure. We could not do, in good conscience, volume 2 and volume 3,” he candidly told CGM.
“So we've begun the process, it's been a long process to figure it out because Sony has never really had to do this in this way, but we're returning all the money. So across the board we're putting out an apology saying ‘sorry about this.'”
Escalante added that pulling the game down and refunding consumers was the best course of action from a consumer perspective.
While it's certainly laudable Versus Evil removed it and did right by customers, the game should not have been released in that state.
An advisory committee struck by University of Toronto president Meric Gertler has recommended that the country's largest university should divest its investments from fossil fuel companies that "blatantly disregard" the international effort to combat climate change.
In a report released Wednesday, the 10-person committee named Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips Co. and a number of coal producers including the world's largest producer, Peabody Energy Corp., as "clear examples" of companies whose shares should be sold. "We recognize we're not a big player but [divestment] is part of a sea change that says we should be doing more of this and less of that," said Bryan Karney, who headed the committee and serves as chair of the university's division of environmental engineering and energy systems.
"Specifically, we think divestment is a binary decision that says these are activities that we should not be doing."
Story continues below advertisement
Mr. Gertler – who called climate change "one of the most pressing issues of our times" – said he would be studying the report and responding in the new year. "We have to make our policy decision with the most complete information available to us," he said. University of Toronto Asset Management had $7.4-billion in assets under management at the end of 2014, including endowment and pension funds. It owns the specific shares mentioned through a pooled fund, rather than directly.
Universities across the world have been under pressure from divestment campaigns in recent years. More than 30 such campaigns are under way at postsecondary institutions in Canada alone, but few have met with unqualified success. In February, the University of British Columbia's board of governors will vote on whether to divest $100-million in coal, oil and gas investments from its endowment. In two referendums, more than three-quarters of students and about two-thirds of faculty voted in favour of asking the university to divest its fossil fuel holdings.
Others, such as the University of Calgary and Dalhousie have so far ruled out divestment.
Mr. Karney said the committee singled out Exxon, Conoco and the coal producers as companies that were particularly egregious in their disregard for efforts to limit global warming. The panel – comprising professors and students from a variety of disciplines – accused Exxon of "alleged funding of disinformation" about climate change.
Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company "unequivocally rejects these allegations" that it financed a disinformation campaign. Mr. Jeffers said the company has long acknowledged the reality of climate change and proposes a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a means of addressing it.
He said the U of T committee did not contact the company for its position. "If they have questions about what we're doing, they should come to us," he said.
Mr. Karney said the committee was not making a blanket condemnation or call for divestment of all fossil fuel companies, including Canada's oil sands producers that are often the target of climate change activists. Indeed, it concluded that fossil fuels will remain critical part of the energy mix for many years. "A blanket divestment strategy would be unprincipled and inappropriate in the committee's view," the report said.

The committee chair said Canada's oil sands companies have indicated "they're aware of these concerns and appreciate these concerns and we certainly hope they'll get on board for saying we need to do a better job, we need to be sustainable, we need to be better at communicating."
He added that the university should not just focus on divestment but provide leadership in research, action and teaching in how the society as a whole confronts climate change.

More details emerging following explosion near Tehran: A senior officer in Iran's weapons industry was killed in Saturday's blast outside Tehran, officials in the country said.
The officer, identified as Hassan Tehrani Moqaddam, held a rank parallel to brigadier general in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, the Fars news agency said. He reportedly served as a researcher at a Tehran university and headed the "Jihad Self-Reliance" unit, mostly tasked with developing arms and missiles following the embargo imposed on Iran since 1979.
Related stories:
Saturday's blast killed at least 17 people and wounded 16 others, some of them gravely. Earlier reports put the number of fatalities at 27, but a Revolutionary Guards spokesman said the numbers were inflated as result of a "fax error." The official apologized to the Iranian people for the supposed error.
'Missile base hit in blast'
Iranian officials said the explosion was an accident that took place while munitions were being moved inside the military base. However, according to opposition reports the base where the huge blast took place is home to a Revolutionary Guards missile unit and holds long-rang Shihab-3 missiles.

A former spokesman for the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK, in Washington, citing reliable sources inside Iran, said Saturday that the explosion hit the Modarres Garrison of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps west of Tehran. Alireza Jafarzadeh said the garrison belongs to the IGRC's missile unit and the blasts "resulted from the explosion of IRGC missiles."
Although Iranian reports did not refer to the possibility that the base was struck from the air, some assessments indicate that the explosion may have been the result of a military operation based on intelligence information.
Tehran Police Chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said that a specialized team has been dispatched to the scene to examine the circumstances surrounding the blast.

Those of you on the East Coast or who have access to the internet are likely aware that a severe cold snap has hit the region. It is affecting me personally, both because it is cold in my apartment and because my Twitter stream is now doubling as a real-time thermometer (with cursing).
What this means is that the opportunity is ripe for people who like to deny the existence of climate change to make stupid jokes. Some of these people will pull goofy stunts like building igloos, stunts which will land them a place in infamy among future generations. Other, lower-profile idiots will stop by your desk at work or email you or (God forbid) reach out on Facebook, saying something like “LOL what happenid to global warmeng??????” They will also mention Al Gore. Some will suggest you visit a thing called “Drudge Report”; do not do this.
As a general rule, it is not wise to engage with these people. They have already demonstrated that rationality is not a strong suit, so attempting to reason with them will only bring stress and pain to you both. But if you do want to engage with them — you have eight hours to kill; you are a masochist — we put together this handy, step-by-step guide for you to do so. Remember: speak slowly and, if necessary, draw pictures. The task before you makes Anne Sullivan's look trivial.
Why abnormally cold weather doesn't “disprove” global warming
1. It is winter. More specifically, it is January.
The person to whom you are speaking may have noticed over the course of his life that it always gets colder during the winter, at least for those of us unlucky enough to live far from the Equator. Average temperatures in New York City for January range in the low 30s. Right now it is colder than that, but warmer than the all-time low for the date: 2 degrees, set in 1976.
This happens, you should remind the person, because the Earth doesn't rotate straight up and down. The Earth's axis is tilted. So for part of the year as the Earth rotates around the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere is farther from the Sun than the Northern Hemisphere. When that happens, the Southern Hemisphere has shorter days and less sunshine, affecting the average temperature. Now, the opposite is true.
Now give them a little pat on the head by suggesting that if it were this cold in, say, July, they'd be right to find it suspicious. But thinking it's weird that it's very (but not exceptionally) cold in January is like being puzzled when water they put in the freezer turns to ice. Then ask them if they know how to make ice in a freezer. If they say no, just drop the whole thing.
2. There's a weird weather pattern that's making it colder than it would otherwise be.
Climate Central notes the unusual “stratospheric warming event” that is causing the current cold temperatures. Be warned: This will likely confuse and frighten the person with whom you're speaking. Take it slow.
While the physics behind sudden stratospheric warming events are complicated, their implications are not: such events are often harbingers of colder weather in North America and Eurasia. The ongoing event favors colder and possibly stormier weather for as long as four to eight weeks after the event, meaning that after a mild start to the winter, the rest of this month and February could bring the coldest weather of the winter season to parts of the U.S., along with a heightened chance of snow.
That may be too much for your audience. You can also try saying this, instead: “A sky thing is happening that doesn't usually happen! It's making it cold now, but it will go away.”
The key word to use is “unusual.” It is unusually cold because there is an unusual weather event. Ask the person you're speaking with if they know what “unusual” means.
3. For advanced listeners only: Researchers expected a colder winter — thanks to global warming.
This summer saw the most extensive Arctic ice melt in recorded history. As it concluded, we noted that scientists expected that ice loss to translate to colder weather events. And, sure enough, from the Climate Central article linked above:
Sudden stratospheric warming events take place in about half of all Northern Hemisphere winters, and they have been occurring with increasing frequency during the past decade, possibly related to the loss of Arctic sea ice due to global warming. Arctic sea ice declined to its smallest extent on record in September 2012.
The “warming event” disturbs a pattern known as the “polar vortex.”
Sudden stratospheric warming events occur when large atmospheric waves, known as Rossby waves, extend beyond the troposphere where most weather occurs, and into the stratosphere. This vertical transport of energy can set a complex process into motion that leads to the breakdown of the high altitude cold low pressure area that typically spins above the North Pole during the winter, which is known as the polar vortex. The polar vortex plays a major role in determining how much Arctic air spills southward toward the mid-latitudes. When there is a strong polar vortex, cold air tends to stay bottled up in the Arctic. However, when the vortex weakens or is disrupted, like a spinning top that suddenly starts wobbling, it can cause polar air masses to surge south, while the Arctic experiences milder-than-average temperatures.
Climate Central has a nifty animation of this happening. It may be easier to simply load that animation and point to it while nodding than trying to fight through the explanation above.
4. But most importantly: Weather is not climate.

It's hard for all of us, dim-witted coworkers and relatives aside, to differentiate between a hot or cold day and the concept that the climate is changing over time. One of the best, clearest explanations of the difference comes from this now-famous video:
This week, that dog is dipping down into lower temperatures. But the planet keeps marching higher and higher, bringing all of us along with it.
Another way to think of it is using James Hansen's analogy of loaded dice. Every day, the weather is the result of a roll of the dice. You could get a one. But more and more often, as the dice become more lopsided, you're going to roll a six.
By this point in your argument, it is unlikely that your audience is still listening. He or she (it's a he, isn't it?) has glazed over, or has stormed off while yelling something about a Rush something or other, or has been trying to punch you for five to 10 minutes. There's a tiny, remote possibility of a fourth response: a sudden, gradual nodding of the head, a request for more detail on one of the points you've raised. If this has happened, congratulations. You've done the unimaginable: changed a knee-jerk global warming denier into someone who accepts science.
The bad news is that you've used up an entire lifetime of luck in changing one mind. You probably should have just bought a lottery ticket.
Inspired by this tweet from Marshall Shepherd, the president of the American Meteorological Society.
Update: This post originally included a line about the Earth's distance from the Sun that was an intentional oversimplification, but a dumb one, as (lots of) people have pointed out. I removed it. Your comments about irony and hubris are welcome.
Another update: I have further clarified that it's not distance from the sun itself that matters, but how the tilt affects the amount of daylight. Apologies again for the imprecision.
By Nana Karikari-apau, CNN
Editor's note: The Science Seat is a feature in which CNN Light Years sits down with movers and shakers from many different areas of scientific exploration. This is the first installment.
Jason Kalirai is the deputy project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be NASA's next big mission in astrophysics. He works at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
Last month, Kalirai, 34, won the American Astronomical Society's Newton Lacy Pierce Prize for his achievements in observational astronomy. CNN Light Years recently spoke with him about his work. Below is an edited transcript.
CNN: What inspired you to pursue a degree in science?
Jason Kalirai: As far back as I can remember, I was curious about the way things work. I'm sure I got this trait from my father, whom my friends actually nicknamed “MacGyver” when we were growing up. He enjoyed questioning how things operate and then trying to solve everyday problems through experimentation.
When I was in elementary school, I was fascinated by the night sky, and I wanted to understand the scale of the universe - how big it was, how separated the stars were, what else was out there? I started reading books about the Milky Way galaxy and the universe, put posters of our solar neighborhood in my room and kept asking the question “why.” Science not only provided me with the answers to these grand questions, but it opened up new mysteries that I was motivated to learn about.
CNN: What are five steps through which an astronomer solves a problem?
Kalirai: Astronomical research has many components to it. Astronomers are well-rounded and excel at problem-solving, data acquisition and analysis, writing reports and presenting results. Solving a single problem can take many years through this cycle:
In the first step of the process, astronomers design an experiment to solve a particular problem that they are interested in. Usually, this involves writing a proposal to use a telescope to gain new insights on the universe.
Next, astronomers obtain the observations. For ground-based astronomy, this typically means traveling to a mountaintop and collecting data, whereas for space-based observations the data are sent directly to the astronomer.
Scientists then analyze the observations using powerful computers, usually in their own offices. They also spend time writing computer programs to aid in the analysis. New discoveries are rare, so it takes very careful attention to details in the data.
Astronomers publish (their) results in peer-reviewed journals, so they have to write detailed reports of all of their findings. These reports are judged by other astronomers to make sure they are based on sound principles.
Finally, astronomers present their findings to the science community through domestic and international meetings.
CNN: What kind of astronomer do you consider yourself?
Kalirai: My focus is on observational astronomy, and I'm particularly passionate about using telescopes to push beyond the limits of what we've already seen. I try to discover new population of stars in our Milky Way galaxy and try to reveal new parts of galaxies in the nearby universe. Whenever I can get access to a new capability or technology in astronomy (e.g., a more sensitive camera), I like to take that tool and apply it to the kind of science problems that I most enjoy working on.
CNN: Why do you focus on star clusters?
Kalirai: Star clusters are one of the universe's most remarkable environments. In a small region of space that is not too much larger than the distance between the sun and the nearest few stars to the sun, a cluster contains thousands of stars. These stars share incredible similarities, all having formed at the same time millions of years ago and with the same chemistry. The only difference between the individual stars is their mass, and mass happens to be the primary factor that controls how stars evolve (e.g., how long they live for, how bright they become and how they die).
So, observations of each individual star cluster give us a snapshot of how stellar evolution has shaped a population with that age, and we can complete a picture of stellar evolution by observing many clusters with different ages. As a result, star clusters anchor much of our knowledge of the universe.
CNN: How exactly do stars evolve over time?
Kalirai: We are used to thinking of the stars as fixed points in the night sky, but they actually go through a life cycle, just like humans. Newborn stars are very active and energetic, kind of like my twins. Stars in their middle years are kind of boring (dare I say, like our parents), and can spend billions of years not doing much other than converting hydrogen into helium. Toward the end of their lives, stars become “cool” again, kind of like grandparents are “cool.” The lifetimes of stars are so much longer than human lifetimes that we see them as being fixed over generations. But they all evolve from stellar birth to stellar death.
CNN: What is the main goal of your research program?
Kalirai: The main goal of my research is to understand the details of how stars like our sun, including those that are a little more and a little less massive, change over time. For billions of years, these stars will remain at the same brightness and temperature. This is great for humans on Earth since it gives us a stable climate. After the hydrogen in the sun is exhausted, the sun will become a stellar cinder and simply cool over time. We call this state, the end state of 98% of all stars, white dwarfs.
All of the action in stellar evolution occurs between these two phases, when, over a relatively short time scale, stars swell up into “giants” and spill their outer materials into space. The detailed understanding of this process, of how stars dramatically change, is fundamentally important to many research areas in astronomy. After all, the light that we see from distant galaxies is really just millions of individual stars at the tip of their luminous evolution.
CNN: If the sun will experience this dramatic change, what is the fate of our planet Earth?
Kalirai: The Earth is orbiting the sun at a distance of about 90 million miles. When the sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, it will begin burning hydrogen in a shell around the core and become very luminous and bloated. The outer layers of the sun will actually reach the Earth, and so the oceans will evaporate and our planet will be fried. Sorry! Fortunately for us, this won't happen for several billions of years.
Based on my research on “stellar mass loss,” the sun itself will lose about 45% of its mass through this process. The remaining mass, the core of the sun, will be the white dwarf. Interestingly, the size of that core will only be a little larger than the Earth, so the remnant star will be very dense.
CNN: What telescopes do you use to study the stars?
Kalirai: I enjoy using the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Over the past seven years, I've traveled to Hawaii to collect data from these telescopes more than a dozen times. The Keck telescopes are two of the biggest optical telescopes we have on Earth. The mirrors stretch over 30 feet across and the building itself is bigger than a house.
The site of the telescopes is also beautiful. Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano, and the telescopes sit at the peak, at the distance of 13,000 feet. It's a harsh environment to observe from since there is about 40% less oxygen at that altitude than sea level.
CNN: You recently received an award from the American Astronomical Society called the 2013 Newton Lacy Pierce Prize. What does it mean to your career, and how does it affect your future endeavors?
Kalirai: The Pierce Prize is the biggest honor that I've received in my life. I am very passionate about astronomy and work very hard, so receiving the Pierce Prize tells me that the rest of the astronomy community values my contributions. This means a lot to me and will motivate me to work even harder in the future.
CNN: What do you see as the major achievement of the Hubble Space Telescope so far and its most important discoveries?
Kalirai: Actually, I think its best years are ahead of it. It's amazing when a scientific tool can rewrite a textbook, but Hubble has managed to do it countless times. In 2009, astronauts serviced Hubble and put two new cameras on the telescope. These instruments are functioning fantastically, and the demand for Hubble observations by the astronomical community is the highest that it's ever been. I have absolutely no doubt that Hubble will continue to amaze us with new discoveries about the universe.
CNN: You also spend a significant part of your time working on the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to Hubble. Tell us about this fascinating project?
Kalirai: The James Webb Space Telescope is one of the most ambitious scientific projects that humans have ever undertaken. NASA has partnered up with the European and Canadian space agencies to build an unprecedented telescope, one that is the size of a tennis court and will launch 1 million miles away from Earth. (Hubble orbits at 350 miles.)
Webb, as we call it, will be 100 times more powerful than any other telescope we've made, and is designed to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. It will seek the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe, solve mysteries on how stars and planets form and look for water in the atmosphere of other worlds. I can't wait to use it.
CNN: What are the most rewarding things about being a scientist?
Kalirai: Professionally, it's the fact that there is continuous satisfaction in expanding our knowledge of the universe. There are countless mysteries about the universe that we presently don't understand, and it's amazing to be a part of the process that will yield answers to these questions.
Personally, it's very rewarding to see young people becoming curious about the way things work. I spend one day every month doing public outreach, where I visit science centers, planetariums, classrooms and other venues to communicate science. As I get kids excited about the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), I always try to leave a little nugget of information untold. It's extremely rewarding to get the phone call or e-mail afterward when you realize that you've sparked their interest in science.

FRESH YARN PRESENTS: My First (and Nearly Last) Day on Friends
By Lauren Tom
It's the summer of 1994. I am an out of work actress sitting in my home in the Hollywood Hills watching an episode of a new sit-com, Friends, on NBC. I seem to be having a mild crush on one of the characters, Ross. I distinctly remember thinking, "I'd love to work on this show. And I'd love to play my scenes with that guy. I'll wait to see what his name is in the end credits. David Schwimmer. Got it.
The next morning, I'm walking on my treadmill while eating a Krispy Kreme when my agent, Leslie, phones. "Lauren, I have a job offer for you."
"A 'what' offer?" I say, slowing down the treadmill.
"I know, it's been awhile," she says in a dry, flat, tone. Even when Leslie was a fledgling agent, she always sounded like she had seen it all, heard it all, and done it all before. Most people are afraid of her, including myself. "The producers of Friends want to know if you'd like to do a six episode arc on the show starting next week-playing Ross's girlfriend."
I stop the treadmill and nearly trip off of it. "Wait, is that the guy, David Schwimmer?" I say, nearly choking on my last bite of donut.
"Yeah, he's a client of mine too."
"You got me this job?"
"No, one of the producers loved you in The Joy Luck Club. So you want to do it?"
"Well hmm, let-me-think-about-that-for-a second-YES."
"Okay. I'll call you when I have more details. Congratulations," she says as if she works at the DMV and she's calling the next person in line.
"Leslie, this means you're not allowed to call me 'Loser' any more."
"Exaaactly," she says and hangs up.
What the hell? Could this mean what I think it means? This is the break I've been waiting for my entire career. I'm about to become a hip, trendy, great hairdo wearin' Friend. I'm crossing into the mainstream, I'm finally going to be one of the "in" crowd, a popular white girl. Hell, if I play my cards right, who knows? Maybe I'll become a regular on the show and then I'll be a gazillionaire just like them! How could this have happened to me? I better write down everything I did, said, wore, and ate the night I seemed to have manifested this job.
But wait, I've never been on a sit-com before. What if I'm not funny? What if I show up and the producers look at me and say, "Oh, not her. We meant the other Asian girl-geez, they all do look alike." Or "Oh, we didn't realize you were Chinese, we were looking for someone White, and well younger. What are you 35?" Oh My God, what if they ask me how old I am? I start to panic. Lottery winners often lose every dime they make because their systems can't hold all that abundance. Their brains haven't caught up with their reality. Is it my destiny to manifest incredible events only to screw them up? By the time I show up for my first day of work, I am convinced I will be fired.
As I sit at a table with the cast of Friends I try to imagine them all in their underwear but this doesn't help one bit. I feel like I want to throw up.
We're in a sound stage at Warner Bros. Studios about to read through the script for the producers and the network executives -- the "suits." They sit in folding chairs directly behind us silently making notes in their scripts. The other contributors to the show -- the costumers, the make-up artists and set designers, sit in the audience bleacher seats. The temperature is about 60 degrees, a strategy to keep the lights cool, and the cast alive and perky. I look around and see the various sets for each scene: the main apartment, Joey's apartment, an airport waiting area, the café. My heart beats a little faster. I cross my legs and squeeze them-- partially because I'm giddy, and partially because I'm freezing.
David Schwimmer sits to my right. He seems relaxed and confident. His large brown eyes slant down at the outer edges even as he smiles. He extends his hand as he introduces himself, "Hey, welcome to the cast."
My palms are soaked with sweat, I give them a quick wipe on my micro-mini blue jean skirt before I place my hand in his. "I'm Lauren," I say, smiling way too hard, my teeth almost chattering from the cold air and my lack of clothing. Why didn't I wear pants? No one can even see my legs underneath this table. Geez, I'm going to have to kiss this person in about an hour when we start rehearsing. What if I faint?
I'm prone to fainting when I get nervous. I just fall down on the ground and leave the planet. I turn away my head to avoid that embarrassment.
To my left is Michael McKean, a guest star for this episode who will play Courteney Cox's boss. He gives me a big toothy grin. His eyes are clear blue.
"Do you remember me?" he asks.
You mean besides the fact that you're famous for Laverne and Shirley, Spinal Tap and about 1,000 other jobs? I crinkle my brow, unsure. I do not have a good memory. I think I may have contracted Alzheimer's at the age of seven. There are whole trips to foreign countries I can't recall, so remembering people's faces and names is pretty much hopeless. Not a good quality to have considering this kind of thing happens all the time in show business. I'm an ant compared to the career of Michael Mckean so I'm going to try extra hard to make him believe that I remember everything about him. I giggle and wait.
"We worked together on the film Man Trouble a few years ago, remember?"
"Of course! It's good to see you again!" I squeal, having absolutely no clue. He seems to be buying it. The 45 minute reading goes well and the room erupts in applause. This is a good sign -- it means I'm probably not fired yet. After a few minutes, Kevin Bright, the producer, says, "Okay gang, good job. We want to tweak the script a bit more, so we'll be breaking for the day. See you all tomorrow." Hmmm, breaking for the day? Maybe it didn't go that well. But at least I didn't get fired today, and I won't have to kiss David Schwimmer until tomorrow. Courteney Cox, her black shiny hair framing porcelain skin and shockingly blue eyes, (is she wearing colored contacts?) is even more beautiful in person than she is on TV. She gives me a small wave and says, "Hey Lauren, we heard it was your birthday today and we all wanted to take you out for lunch."
Did I just become a Make-a-Wish Foundation recipient? Just last week I was standing in the unemployment line wondering if I would ever work again. I'm practically speechless. "Great!" I say.
I follow the cast to the commissary. They chatter on like they are truly best friends. The three girls walk arm in arm down the street. The theme song from The Monkees pops into my head. I used to watch that TV show when I was a kid; I was in love with Davy Jones. A teenage girl rushes up and asks for the gang's autographs. She looks at me as if she's confused, decides I'm not famous, and then runs off. The group starts to walk again and this time, I walk slightly behind them. Why am I acting like I'm some sort of Japanese Geisha girl walking behind my master? I'm a good three to ten years older than most of these guys. I was in The Joy Luck Club and When A Man Loves A Woman. It's not like this is my first job, and yet, I feel like an awkward geeky, loser who's just transferred from a different junior high school.
At the commissary, a private room awaits us, seven chairs ringing a table. Did Courteney Cox call and arrange this ahead of time? How can she be that pretty and that nice? How did she know it was my birthday and why would she care? The table is set with a crisp white tablecloth, fine china and wine glasses. I'm sandwiched between Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry. I pick up the oversized menu and clench it so tight I start to get a cramp in my thumb. I have no clue what to say to these people. I concentrate on relaxing my shoulders. They drop about an inch. I put the menu down and shake out my hands.

UX Study: Timeful
Richard Kim Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 27, 2014
An example of UX improvements on an app
I'm a huge fan of Timeful, which uses “Intelligent Time Assistance” to recommend times to complete tasks. You can tell it you want to run for an hour 3 times a week, or you want to spend 2 hours a week looking for a job, and it'll recommend when you should spend time doing that. If you've never used it before, check it out first. You'll get a lot more from this if you experience the app first.
So, Timeful is still on version 1 (1.1.5 to be exact), and they're doing the right thing by emphasizing functionality before investing time in trying to make it pretty. They've also been really well received, with 300+ ratings and an average of 4 stars on the iTunes store. So, it's the perfect time for someone to scrutinize the UX for the future versions. In this article, I'm going to point out 3 problems and potential wireframe solutions.
This is Timeful

It was easy to miss amid all the chaos during Wednesday's 7-0 loss at Atlanta: a brief, but compelling interlude about the state of the Revolution's leadership situation quietly unfolded during the early stages.
In the wake of Xavier Kouassi's 16th minute dismissal, the designated player, who was named captain for the match, relinquished the armband to Lee Nguyen, who had worn it for the better part of the past year. But immediately after receiving it, Nguyen deferred to goalkeeper Cody Cropper, who had never donned it until Wednesday (see the above video at the 0:27 and 1:33 marks).
Looks like Nguyen gave Cropper the captain's armband #NERevs — Seth (@SethMan31) September 13, 2017
So what prompted Nguyen to hand it over to Cropper instead of wrapping it around his left arm? It's hard to say, but recent history may give us some of the answer.
Nguyen earned the armband on a full-time basis following the Copa America snub. Revolution coach Jay Heaps praised Nguyen for his attitude after the omission, and he remained the skipper until a hamstring injury sidelined him for two games in late-August. During that spell, Kouassi was named captain at New York City and at D.C. United.
But once Nguyen returned, the armband was passed on to another veteran: Chris Tierney, who sported it during home wins over Orlando City and Montreal.
Following the Orlando City match – the first game in which Nguyen didn't wear the armband in over a year – the Revolution midfielder briefly touched on his feelings about not getting the chance to reclaim it.
“Armband or not, I know I'm the captain of this team,” Nguyen said after the match. “I can lead this team, and that's how I look at it.”
The armband question was also raised during Heaps' post-game press conference following the win over Orlando City, a game that Nguyen matched an MLS record by collecting four assists.
“In terms of captains, I think we've discussed this before,” Heaps said at the time. “It's just a matter of, for me, I like having a shared load. I like when we have more voices. We're in a tough time right now. One voice isn't enough in the locker room. And you have Lee, and Chris, and Scotty [Caldwell] and [Xavier] Kouassi. You just have a couple different guys that can really pull the group together, and that's why I like moving that around a little bit, just to keep everyone having that ability to have that voice.”
Did Nguyen shun the armband as a form of protest? Or was it a sign that Nguyen genuinely does not believe he needed to wear it to validate his position as a team leader?
It's hard to say from the outside, but the optics are sure to create more discussion about the apparent lack of leadership that's plagued the Revolution since the departure of Jermaine Jones.
Madrid mayor welcomes first cargo train from China after epic 8,111-mile rail trip inaugurates the longest rail link in the world
The longest rail link in the world and the first direct link between China and Spain is up and running after a train from Yiwu in coastal China completed its maiden journey of 8,111 miles to Madrid.
En route it passed through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany and France before arriving at the Abroñigal freight terminal in Madrid.
The railway has been dubbed the “21st-century Silk Road” by Li Qiang, the governor of Zhejiang province, where Yiwu is located. Its route is longer than the Trans-Siberian railway and the Orient Express.
The first train was met by the mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella, and Spain's minister of public works, Ana Pastor. It consisted of 30 containers carrying 1,400 tonnes of cargo – mostly toys, stationery and other items for sale over Christmas across Europe.
According to China's ambassador to Spain, Zhu Banzao, it will return laden with wine, jamón and olive oil in time for the Chinese new year in February.
Yiwu is the world's largest wholesale hub for small consumer goods and plays host to a vast 4 sq km (1.5 sq mile) market where tens of thousands of traders work daily. The journey was a test run to assess the viability of adding Spain to a route that already links China with Germany five times a week. Those trains link Chongqing, the huge industrial city in south-west China, with Duisburg, and Beijing with Hamburg.
China is Spain's biggest trading partner after the EU, with bilateral trade worth around £16bn. It is also Spain's third largest source of imports, after Germany and France. About half of these imports are made up of mobile phones and clothing. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, was in China in September, where he signed deals reported to be worth more than £6.3bn.
A major advantage of the rail route is speed. The train took just three weeks to complete a journey that takes up to six weeks by sea. It is also more environmentally friendly than road transport, which would produce 114 tonnes of CO2 to shift the same volume of goods, compared with the 44 tonnes produced by the train – a 62% reduction.
However, the cargo had to be transferred three times during the journey as a result of incompatible rail gauges. The locomotive also had to be changed every 500 miles.
The service is being operated by InterRail Services and DB Schenker Rail and in Spain by DB's Spanish offshoot, Tranfesa.
At the welcoming ceremony, the mayor of Madrid pointed out that a majority of the city's 30,000 Chinese residents hailed from Zhejiang province. Relations between Spain and China took a dive earlier this year when a judge sought international arrest warrants for former president Jiang Zemin and four top officials in relation to alleged genocide in Tibet. The Spanish parliament took barely 10 days to throw out the case.
Can using privacy-enhancing tools (such as Tor or a Virtual Private Network) actually expose you to warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency? This week, the ACLU sent off four FOIA requests to federal agencies in order to try and answer this question.
To understand why we think that may be the case, we have to go back to the passage of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) in 2008. That act was not a high-point for civil liberties or the rule of law. It included a provision giving immunity to the telecom companies that violated the law by assisting the NSA with its warrantless wiretapping program. Although the get-out-of-jail-free card given to the phone companies is the most well-known aspect to the FAA, there is much more to the law, and many other things that give privacy advocates reason to worry.
Under the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government was required to provide specific, targeted requests aimed at foreign powers or their agents before lawful surveillance was permissible. But the FAA created an additional, broader surveillance system, enabling the government to conduct surveillance without particularized suspicion where a “significant purpose” is to obtain “foreign intelligence” and where the surveillance is targeted against persons "reasonably believed to be located outside the United States."
Although the FAA defined several key terms, it did not provide a definition for a person “reasonably believed to be located outside the United States." In that ambiguity lies the source of our concern.
Tor and VPNS
To understand why, it's important to understand how the privacy tools work. The Tor Project (Tor) is an anonymizing network that provides censorship and surveillance resistant internet connectivity to activists, journalists, researchers and privacy advocates around the world. There are an estimated 500,000 users of Tor. These include law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States, which was the intention of the US Naval Research Lab when it invented the underlying technology and funded the early development of the project. Tor is also used by activists, journalists and the general public in Iran, Syria, China and other countries with authoritarian governments, which has led to significant funding for Tor from the US State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. However, Tor is also used by many people in the United States—it is estimated that approximately 15% of the users of Tor are located in the United States.
Tor is but one tool used by people who want to protect their anonymity online. Virtual Private Networks, offered by dozens (if not hundreds) of companies, provide a weaker degree of security than Tor, but still allow them to sever the link between their own computer's IP address and their online browsing activities. Such services are extremely popular with users who wish to circumvent geo-restrictions on streaming content. For example, VPNs make it possible to listen to Pandora or watch the Daily Show when you are outside the US, which are normally blocked.
When someone browses the web using Tor or a VPN service their Internet traffic appears to originate at the Tor or VPN server, rather than from their home connection. Thus, a US citizen located in Chicago who uses a Tor exit server in France will, to Google or Facebook, appear to be a user in France. Likewise, someone in Iran connecting to the web via a Tor exit server located in San Francisco will appear to the New York Times as a web surfer from San Francisco.
Tor, VPNs and the FISA Amendments Act
If the NSA is engaging in surveillance of foreign networks and it encounters traffic originating from a foreign Tor exit server, it will have no way of knowing if that traffic originally came from the United States or another foreign computer. Likewise, the NSA has no way of knowing if traffic exiting a US Tor exit server is actually from domestic users, or foreign. That is, after all, the point of Tor. This presents a pretty interesting and troubling legal question. Tor is extremely popular in countries like Iran, where the NSA is actively monitoring communications networks. However, Tor is also popular with users in the United States, whose communications the NSA shouldn't be monitoring.
When the traffic of Iranian, Chinese, British and American citizens is combined and anonymized such that the true origin of the traffic cannot be determined, which set of the intelligence rules does the NSA follow? Certainly, a US citizen shouldn't have his or her communications traffic intercepted by the NSA simply because they want to watch the latest season of Downton Abbey streamed directly from the UK.
In order to try and shed a bit of light on this issue, last week, we filed FOIA requests with DOJ, the FBI and NSA. A copy of the NSA request can be downloaded here, and the DOJ request is here.
Alcatel OneTouch has been creating some pretty nice budget handsets recently, and after seeing their new Idol 3 at MWC, I knew I had to give it a try. So I took the SIM card out of my Nexus 6 and fully switched over to the Idol 3 for the last week. I put it through its paces to see just what this budget smartphone could handle.
[alert color=”green”]The unit I used to conduct this review was running on pre-release software. Please keep in mind that any problems I faced may be fixed by the phone's release or by a future software update.[/alert] [spacer color=”264C84″ icon=”fa-android”]
Design
The first thing that I noticed about the Idol 3 was that it looked pretty nice for a $250 phone. Sure, there was no metal chassis or leather back, but the phone felt extremely solid. It did not bend or creak and the build quality was great. The chrome accents along the top and bottom on the edge of the phone give it a little something so that it stands out against the crowd of black slate phones. Since they are plastic, they might pick up some scratches and dings, but I have not seen any on my unit so far. Also, the back is made of a brushed plastic that looks more premium and feels better than normal glossy plastic.
One of my favorite design features on the Idol 3 is the recessed front facing speakers on the top and bottom of the phone. This helps to break up the otherwise flat device and give it some dimension.
On the right side at the very top of the phone is the volume rocker. Interestingly, the power button is at the very top of the left side. This placement is extremely inconvenient for me, but thankfully the phone features double-tap to wake and sleep so the power button did not need to be used much. The SIM card slot is placed under the power button, and removing it you will also find a place for a Micro-SD card. If the 16GB of storage is not enough for you, it supports Micro-SD cards up to 128GB.
One on the most notable things about the Idol 3's look is that it is perfectly symmetrical. If you turned the phone completely upside down, you would almost have no idea if it wasn't for the front-facing camera switching places. Also, the Idol 3 only weighs in at 140 grams, which makes this phone feel extremely light. This helps with their Reversible UI feature that I will get to soon. For $250, you are getting a well made device that feels and looks great.
Display
The Idol 3 comes with a 5.5″ full-HD display at a pixel density of 401 ppi. Alcatel touts that this display is enhanced by Technicolor and the colors are supposed to appear more real. I have to say that this screen was enjoyable to look at. Everything looked amazing on the display and colors looked great. I was not expecting a display this nice on a $250 phone, and I am glad Alcatel proved me wrong.
This is one of the brightest phone displays I have ever used. I ended up keeping the brightness around 25-30% and it was plenty bright for me. You will definitely have no trouble viewing this screen in direct sunlight.
The Idol 3 uses an IPS display, and even though I prefer AMOLED, I like the way this screen looks. Black looks dark, whites were bright, and colors were natural without being overpowering. Also, viewing angles are amazing. Even at extreme angles, I saw no lack of detail or color.
Android and UI
If you could not tell from the fact I own a Nexus 6, I love stock Android. When I first powered on the Idol 3, I was worried because what I saw looked like a pretty heavily skinned version of Android. Thankfully, I was completely wrong. The Idol 3 is running on Android 5.0.2, and while it may not look extremely stock, few things are actually changed.
Alcatel OneTouch skinned the icons and replaced some of the stock apps, but most of Android was left completely untouched. And the apps that were replaced performed just as well as stock Google apps. Since the tweaks were light, the Idol 3 is able to run Android Lollipop very well. There are also a few software tweaks that actually added to the experience. Double-tap to sleep and wake is a welcome addition because of that terrible power button placement. It works extremely well, and I rarely found myself having to double-tap more than once.
My favorite change is the Reversible UI feature. What this features do is orient the UI to whatever direction you are holding the phone. It allows the screen to rotate completely around so you are never actually holding the phone upside down. I thought this was the biggest gimmick until I actually tried it.
As it turns out I tend to take my phone out of my pocked upside down about half of the time, but I never noticed it on the Idol 3. I would just double-tap the screen and Android would be rotated around. Since there is a speaker and microphone at both ends of the device, you can answer phone calls with the device upside down, too. Also, the animation that happens to you flip the phone around is pretty sweet. The Reversible UI is a feature that I hope other OEMs include on their phones in the future.
Camera
The Idol 3 comes with a 13 MP main camera with a Sony sensor and an 8 MP front-facing camera. The camera software has most of the features a normal user is looking for plus some extras. There is an HDR mode, a panorama mode, a manual mode, a time-lapse mode, a bar-code scanner, and one called “Face beauty” which basically smooths out your skin and may make selfies look a little better.
The phone took pictures extremely fast, with close to no shutter lag. Of course, the real test of a phone's camera is the kind of pictures it can take. I found that the Idol 3's camera was okay. Pictures taken outside were pretty good, although they are not going to be blowing anyone away. In pictues with bright colors, detail is sometimes lost in the colors. Pictures taken inside turned out about the same.
Low light pictures is where the Idol 3 struggled a bit. They lost some details and had a little extra noise. That being said, if you are just looking for a phone to take pictures to post on social media or share with friends, the Idol 3's camera will suit you just fine.
Speakers
One of the big features of the Idol 3 is the dual front-facing speakers powered by JBL audio. After listening to music daily on this phone, I have to say that I am impressed. The speakers can get loud, but do not seem to suffer from much distortion at the high volumes. Most importantly, the sound is amazing, even through headphones.
The bass is not as strong or deep as you will find in something like Boomsound on the HTC One, but mids and highs are nice and clear. Alcatel touted that the sound quality was very good, and I imagine that anyone who listens to music from the Idol 3 will agree.
Performance
The Idol 3 is running on a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615, with four cores clocked at 1 GHz and four clocked at 1.5 GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM. I found that, for the most part, performance was smooth. I could scroll through apps, recents, and web pages with minimal slowdowns. However, there were a few times when the Idol 3 would just seem to randomly slow down. It was still usable, but animations and scrolling seemed more choppy and less fluid. Unfortunately, I do not know what caused these dips in performance.
You should not expect to play any graphically intense games on the Idol 3, but it should handle most casual games pretty well. I tried it out with Limbo and suffered no slowdowns at all. This phone will not be winning any speed tests or benchmark scores, but the performance was better than I expected and fluid most of the time.
Battery
The Idol 3 is powered by a 2910 mAh battery. I am what you would consider a “power user” when it comes to my phone. It is rare for me to finish a day with less than 4 hours of screen on time for my phone. If a phone can survive my days, it should be able to survive anyones. I have three email accounts that pull down every five minutes. I also watch around an hour of YouTube over WiFi and stream at least a hour of music over LTE.
The Idol 3 took my daily activities just fine and I had no worries about running out of battery before I got home. If you are a light to moderate user, you will definitely be pleased with the Idol 3's battery life as it will easily last you through the day with battery to spare. If you are a heavier user like me, then I would wager the Idol 3 could handle your lifestyle just as well, maybe with less battery left over though. If you want to see the daily breakdown for battery life, you can check out all five days in the tabs below.

I did the usual hour of YouTube and hour of streaming music
Today was a lighter day and I only reached 3 hours and 43 minutes of Screen On Time by 1 AM
I finished the day with 15% battery left

On day four, I took the Idol 3 off the charger around 9 AM
I usually spend Saturdays with friends so I spend less time on my phone
I listened to about 2 hours of music streaming over LTE
I reached 3 hours and 20 minutes of Screen On Time by 1:30 AM
I finished the day with 21% left

On day five, I took the phone off the charger around 10 AM
On Sundays, I get an extra hour or so of Screen On Time that I do not usually get
Because of that, I had to put the Idol 3 back on the charger at 9:20
However, I got over 5 hours of Screen On Time for day 5

The biggest test I have for a phone is will I miss it when I stop using it? The answer for the Idol 3 is undoubtedly “Yes!”
It is definitely not a powerhouse, but the experience of using it is great. I will miss some of the features like the Reversible UI and double-tap to wake immediately. Of course, it is not perfect. Performance suffered from time to time and the camera is okay at best, but for $250, I would put the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 as the best budget flagship of 2015.
If you are in the market for an affordable phone that will still provide a great experience, the Idol 3 should be at the top of your list.
Josh Duggar has been shuttered up in an Illinois rehab facility since word spread this summer that he had been cheating on his wife, Anna, via the website AshleyMadison.com. The disgraced eldest Duggar son, who, before being caught cheating, admitted to molesting five young girls while he was in his teens, will be at the faith-based rehab center for an undetermined period of time, but it appears that he's starting to get some visitors, including his estranged wife Anna!
In Touch Weekly and Entertainment Tonight both report that Anna has made several trips to the rehab center to visit Josh, with the most-recent being yesterday!
“On Tuesday, 27-year-old Anna was spotted in Rockford, Illinois, — where Josh is currently in treatment — presumably visiting her husband without their four kids,” ET reported.
In Touch added that this was at least Anna's second visit to see Josh. The magazine reported that Anna also went to the rehab over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, with their baby Meredith in tow.
“Anna went right before Thanksgiving,” the magazine's source revealed. “She had a lot to discuss with Josh. She thought it best that she go alone so she decided not to bring the kids, except Meredith because she is still breastfeeding…Seeing Josh was really hard for Anna. She cried about how much she misses him and teared up while they prayed.”
In a few days, Anna (as well as many other members of the Duggar family) will appear on the first of three Jill & Jessa: Counting On specials. In a clip of the specials, released today by Good Morning America, Anna revealed how she felt after finding out that her husband had cheated on her.
“I was just like, ‘I'm gonna wake up and everything is going to be OK,'” Anna says. “This can't be true.”
The sources for both In Touch and Entertainment Tonight stated that Anna plans to get back together with her cheating husband once he's released from rehab. She is also reportedly planning to use her third (and final) visit to bring the kids to see Josh right before Christmas. (The treatment center allows very limited visitation.)
“She believes everything Josh says,” In Touch‘s source said. “She actually thinks he's getting better.”
One sign that Anna and Josh are planning to reconcile? Their family website is back up and running, after being shut down for months.
“Anna is planning on getting back together with Josh, that's just how it goes,” the ET source said. “The family was taught to have a new level of forgiveness towards Josh.”
Well…not everyone…
Judging from the newly released clip of the specials, Josh's sisters (and former victims) Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard appear to be angry that their brother made them look foolish when they defended him after the first scandal broke.
“It wasn't right for him to let us speak our words without having the full knowledge of what he was hiding,” Jill tells the cameras.
The the first of the three ‘Jill & Jessa: Counting On' specials will air on Sunday, December 13 on TLC. The other two specials will air on December 20 and December 27.

Warning to marijuana shops selling Linsanity weed: Your buzzkill has arrived.
Jeremy Lin's legal team has sent a flurry of cease-and-desist letters to medical marijuana dispensaries offering "Linsanity" brand pot, and a few shops have already complied, a lawyer for the New York Knicks star told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.
"Their enthusiasm for Jeremy Lin got ahead of their understanding of the law," said Pamela Deese of the Washington, D.C., firm Arent Fox.
Although Deese would not name the companies, HuffPost found at least three California dispensaries that have stopped their doobie-ous enterprise.
The owner of 420 Specialists of Moreno Valley confirmed that he had received the notice and deleted Linsanity from the menu a week and a half ago. "They also wanted me to write a letter of apology," Josh Leibowitz said Thursday, adding that he hasn't done so yet.
Gourmet Green Room of West Los Angeles would only say that it had replaced Linsanity with Insanity.
L.A. Confidential Caregivers in Hollywood, which was listed in a Marijuana.com post about Linsanity sellers, seems to have removed Linsanity from its menu as well. We reached out to L.A. Confidential Thursday morning, and we'll provide an update if it responds.
Word of Linsanity reefer madness spread when rappers Rick Ross and Stalley tweeted in early March about Linsanity OG cannabis, providing photos. As the jar in one photo indicated, Linsanity OG was priced at $60 for an eighth of an ounce.
That was back when Linsanity, the popular label for Lin's rise from benchwarmer to star, had apparently already peaked. But now that the Knicks have won five straight as of Thursday, with Lin as the fourth-quarter hero in Wednesday's victory, companies might be looking to cash in again.
There were an estimated 1,000 state-legalized pot shops in California before a recent federal crackdown. Five or six are violating Lin's rights, according to the NBA player's attorney. "We've identified those entities," said Deese, who also wouldn't share their names.
TRADEMARK COMPETITORS CUT
In a related matter, Deese said that cease-and-desist letters to 24 entities who applied for a trademark on Linsanity or some other Lin term have been effective in weeding out claimants. Many applicants said they were sorry and withdrew their claim, according to the lawyer.
"You can't file a trademark when there's a clear connection to someone else's name," Deese said. "In this case, Jeremy Lin has the right to his name and related names and marks, as well as his signature, voice and likeness. That's all part of his intellectual property."
Lin filed his own claim for Linsanity on Feb. 13, asserting his rights to sell merchandise from underwear to beverage sleeves with that mark. Ganja did not make the list.
Razer's gotten itself a power up, courtesy of Nvidia. The company's refreshed the 14-inch Blade, making the jump from last generation's Nvidia GeForce GTX 870M GPU to the more powerful GTX 970M GPU with a whopping 3GB of video memory. Available now starting at $2,199, the notebook retains its stylish black aluminum chassis complete with its pair of distinctive ridges and the alluring glowing green three-headed snake.
MORE: Best Gaming Mice
In addition to the new Nvidia Maxwell card, the revamped Blade features a 2.6-GHz Intel Core i7-4720 CPU with 16GB of RAM. Similar to past iterations of the laptop, the newest version of the Blade features three SSD configurations: 128GB, 256GB and 512GB. The QHD+ version of the laptop features a 3200 x 1800 display, but Razer also offers a model with 1920 x 1080p panel. However the full HD model ($1,999) will only feature 8GB of RAM with a 256GB SSD.
Both iterations of the Blade will have 3 USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, a backlit anti-ghosting keyboard, a Kensington lock and a 2 megapixel camera. In terms of software, you can expect Dolby Digital Plus Home Theater and Razer Synapse 2.0, the company's cloud-based software that lets you create and program macros.
With Razer, the more things change (new GPU and CPU), the more they stay the same (lightweight, sexy chassis) and with gaming laptops that's not a bad thing.

A Thai man who organised illegal rhino poaching trips has been given the country's strongest illegal wildlife sentence to date
A Thai national has been sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to charges of exporting rhino horns from South Africa, in the country's strongest illegal wildlife sentence to date.
Chumlong Lemtongthai admitted to playing a large part in a scheme that used white rhino trophy hunts in South Africa as a cover for smuggling horns to black markets in Asia. He employed Asian nationals to pose as hunters and take part in organised hunts on game farms in the North West province.
Charges against three South Africans and two others Asian nationals, the co-accused, were however dropped without explanation.
Lemtongthai told Johnannesburg's Kempton Park magistrates court: "I humbly apologise to the court and to the people of South Africa for my role in this matter. I appreciate that the emotions of all animal lovers in South Africa are running very high and that I was part of the problem."
Jo Shaw, rhino co-ordinator for WWF-SA, said: "These higher-level arrests and convictions are critical to disrupting the illegal trade chains used to move rhino horns into illicit markets in Asia."
Areas of Asia, in particular Vietnam, have increased their demand for white rhino horn powder in recent years. Wrongly believed to enhance sexual performance, cure hangovers and even cancer, a growing wealthy class in Asian society have begun to pay more than ever for rhino horns. The result has been a rapid rise in rhino horn poaching in South Africa, culminating in a record rise in 2012, with more than 450 rhinos killed in the country this year already.
Around half of the poaching occurs in the Kruger national park, in the country's north-west.
Hard to believe it, but a year and one day ago, most Americans were blissfully unaware of a lurid urban legend that had previously only thrived in the anti-choice community: That Planned Parenthood was in the business of selling "baby parts" garnered from abortions on the black market.
To those of us who encountered this tale before, it seemed it would never gain traction outside of the gullible circles of the Christian right, i.e. the same people who believed that Proctor & Gamble was run by Satanists and that "Jesus Take The Wheel" offers good advice about auto safety. That, and the notion that the venerable health care non-profit is just a front for a fetus-selling underground is a self-evidently idiotic conspiracy theory that surely would strike anyone who encountered it as nonsense.
Advertisement:
But a year ago, a group going under the mysterious name the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) managed to turn this obscure urban legend into a national controversy by releasing what they claimed was a hidden camera video of a Planned Parenthood doctor supposedly admitting to being a part of this conspiracy.
The claim was a lie. The nine-minute video was heavily edited from hours of footage to make it seem like the doctor was admitting to those things.
But those who watched the longer video quickly realized the doctor was saying exactly the opposite of what CMP accused her of saying. In the longer version, she repeatedly makes it clear that Planned Parenthood does not sell fetal tissue. Instead, they donate fetal tissue, tissue that would otherwise go into biowaste, to medical research at the behest of that patients, most of whom are undergoing later abortions because of medically necessary reasons.
All these facts and context came out in the hours and days after the initial, lurid reports about the "undercover" video, after reporters had some time to do their research and actually watch the longer video the hoax video was pieced together from.
CMP's strategy was sleazy but effective, taking advantage of the internet era's rush to get the story out while it's still hot — and before there's a chance for thorough fact-checking, or even basic research. And in those few precious hours between the initial reports and the facts being released, the story about "baby parts" being "sold" became a national story, and one that became ingrained wisdom on the right. Conservatives would continue clinging to the lie despite overwhelming evidence that it's just pure, uncut bullshit.
A year ago, it looked like CMP's strategy of shameless lying had scored a direct, perhaps even fatal hit on Planned Parenthood and a major injury to the cause of reproductive rights. It was enough pretext for Republicans to renew attacks on Planned Parenthood's funding and advance the real agenda behind all this, which is cutting off low-income women from affordable contraception.

But now, a year later, it's starting to look like those who stand up for science and women's health care access were not conquered so easily with a few laughable lies. In many ways, the widespread embrace of such cynical and corrupt tactics has backfired on the right.
"The attack failed," Erica Sackin, the director of political communications for Planned Parenthood, argued in an email sent out on Wednesday. "And public support for Planned Parenthood continues to rise."
To back up this argument, Sackin cites polling that shows that support for Planned Parenthood has risen in the past year and notes that "voters in key swing states saying that opposing care at Planned Parenthood actually makes voters less likely to support a candidate." She goes on to highlight how the Democratic party, with Hillary Clinton at the front, has strengthened its commitment to reproductive rights.
Just last month, the anti-choice movement was dealt a legal blow that sets the movement back at least a decade, when the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law meant to use red tape regulations to squeeze legal abortion out of existence. Now there are plans to use the decision to challenge all manner of anti-abortion laws across the country.

Justice Breyer's decision in this case was centered around the problem of anti-choice dishonesty, as the Texas law was passed in bad faith. That the arguments were being held during a year-long furor over obnoxious and obvious anti-choice lies could not have helped dissuade the justices from viewing anti-choicers as a bunch of liars.
The people behind the CMP videos, especially the ringleader David Daleiden, are quickly finding out exactly how much legal trouble that pushing these kinds of lies can get you. Both Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Federation (NAF) have filed lawsuits against CMP. As this timeline offered by NAF shows, CMP's legal defense is not going well and they are losing most of the court battles in this slow-moving process.
CMP also had to tangle with the criminal authorities. A grand jury convened by Republicans to dig up dirt on Planned Parenthood instead, after looking at the evidence, chose to indict Daleiden and his co-conspirator instead. California officials have also raided Daleiden's home, confiscating a laptop and multiple hard drives, though no charges have yet been filed.

Politicians who pretended to believe the accusations in these hoax videos haven't fared much better. During a September Republican primary debate, Carly Fiorina told a massive whopper, claiming that CMP had released a video showing "a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.'"
For a few days, this lie helped bolster her polling numbers. After all, it's not like most people actually watched the videos themselves. Eventually, however, fact-checking reports from those who did watch the videos caught up with her and her reputation as an obnoxious liar helped send her poll numbers into the tank.
In the same month, House Republicans decided to drag Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards into a kangaroo hearing clearly designed to embarrass her. Instead, Richards turned the tables on them, drawing attention to their various falsehoods, which swiftly became fodder for late night comedians.

A video demonstrating how many times the Republican men interrupted Richards, making them look like sexist asses they are, quickly went viral.
Having not learned a single thing from this political embarrassment, House Republicans authorized the creation of the ridiculously titled Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, headed by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, in October. Since then, the panel has heard testimony from a variety of anti-choicers, right wing nuts, and a woman who insists that her main credential is that she is a "wife and a mother".
For months, this panel has supposedly been trying to ascertain whether there is, in Blackburn's words, a "profit scheme that has developed around the sale of the organs of these babies." The answer to the question should be obvious — no, you idiots — and no surprise, months of desperately digging for any evidence has yet to produce anything substantive.
The continued existence of this travesty of a panel is starting to draw negative attention from outside the women's health care world. Earlier this week, a diverse coalition of 20 organizations co-signed a letter from the ACLU demanding that Speaker Paul Ryan put an end to this charade.

The signatories include groups like the SEIU, the Sierra Club, the National Immigration Law Center, the NAACP, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) — groups that have no relationship to the debate over reproductive rights, but who felt they had to say something.
Denouncing the panel for going on "a fishing expedition in an apparent attempt to ratify a discredited smear campaign against Planned Parenthood", the letter argues that the panel's "actions offend basic standards of fairness and respect for the rights of American citizens".
CMP failed to bring down Planned Parenthood or even move the football, politically, against legal abortion or affordable contraception. Unfortunately, the "baby parts" lie was successful in one regard: It fired up some of the most violent and unhinged elements of the anti-choice movement.
"We have seen a dramatic increase in hate speech and internet harassment, death threats, attempted murder, and murder, which coincided with the release of these heavily-edited, misleading, and inflammatory videos last year," Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation told me over email.
Advertisement:
In April, NAF released a report showing that the release of the hoax videos precipitated a rise in anti-clinic violence generally, with the most shocking example being a mass shooting in a Colorado Planned Parenthood, where a man named Robert Dear killed three people, which he justified by spewing incoherent nonsense about "baby parts".
It's not just abortion providers that are affected, either. Since donated fetal tissue is used in medical research, researchers who have never worked in gynecological care are now sucked into the culture of fear and violence.
"Researchers and scientists have repeatedly said that the misleading, inflammatory videos and the resulting politically-motivated investigations have delayed potentially life-saving research," Saporta explained. "As a result of the videos, researchers and institutions have been threated and targeted."
Blackburn's panel made this worse, by "accidentally" revealing the names of medical researchers in a memo that was easily accessed by the terrorist-minded elements of the anti-choice movement.
Advertisement:
It's important not to forget the anti-choice movement's tacit-if-unadmitted reliance on the threat of violence in order to exert pressure on abortion providers. But that so many in the movement are drawn to using threats and violence to get their way is likely due, in no small part, of their inability to achieve the goal of demonizing reproductive rights and sexual autonomy in any other way.
CMP initially got a credulous hearing, even amongs some people who really should have known better. This is a testament to their ability to manipulate both the news cycle, and lingering and often subconscious hostility towards women's growing independence.
But in the year since the videos came out, it became clear that while the public might be easily provoked with lurid stories demonizing sexual health care, people quickly regain their senses. While female sexuality makes many people uncomfortable, they still ultimately agree that sexual health care is not evil or gross, but necessary. Attacking people's health care access — or their right to a safe and healthy sex life — is more likely than not to blow up in conservative faces.
The most common form of force feedback in our electronic devices is the sort of rumbling buzz you get when a motor spins some sort of mass inside the case of your hardware. Video game controllers usually have two motors, one on each side of the controller, and that sort of "rumble in stereo" configuration allows for a number of effects based on the speed of each motor. This takes power, it takes space, and there's not much you can do with the technology. At CES I met with Artificial Muscle, a Bayer MaterialScience company, so they could show me their Vivitouch technology. Vivitouch a sort of artificial muscle that could change how we experience haptic effects in our devices.
The Vivitouch device is small, almost perfectly flat, and after playing through a few demos using a consumer device that's available now, I was turned into a believer. That thin piece of plastic in the image above produces a rumble effect that's more responsive, subtle, and expressive than the technology that's currently the market standard.
The haptic effects in this case are created by a "dialectric elastomer film" sandwiched between two layers of electrodes. The electrodes contract when electric current is introduced, causing movement. You still need mass in order to give the player a satisfying feeling of movement and rumble, and in most of the devices we saw—such as a concept cell phone and a modified iPad—the mass was supplied by the device's battery. Vivitouch is able to use the existing components of the device to create rumble, instead of the metal weights used by most game controllers and portable devices.
What's even better is that the technology is easy to apply once the hardware is installed. I played a series of tech demos on an iPhone where the feedback was created using sound cues from a game. When I rolled dice, it felt like I was holding a box that contained physical dice, not the sputtery rumble usually felt in an iPhone. I played a pinball game on a modded iPad that included one of these strips, and the rumble effect felt much more satisfying than what we're used to from our portable electronics. I was told that they could fake the effects very well using just audio information, but the company would also provide an SDK for developers so they could code even better effects into games and applications.
Right now this technology is more expensive than existing motors, so if a company is just looking for a brute force approach, this isn't the best option. What this version of haptic feedback excels at is sending more detailed and subtle information to the player, and that's where the extra cost is justified. I was able to play with an Xbox 360 controller that had been modded with Vivitouch's technology and during a few demos I was able to feel the rumble of a motor in a way that felt much more realistic. In this case the strip was located in the center of the rear of the controller, using the battery pack as the rumbling mechanism. That may sound like it leads to a jittery mess, but the rumble effects felt much more precise than the stock controller.
The cost of these strips will come down in time, and the benefits are many: the technology is smaller than existing motors, it requires less power, and the feedback offered by the rumble is much higher quality than what's currently available. It may take a little convincing for electronics manufacturers to look at a new way of offering force feedback, but Vivitouch has a compelling argument.
Image caption The area was sealed off while searches were carried out by police and bomb disposal experts
Police are treating a bomb attack near officers on patrol in north Belfast as attempted murder.
Three officers escaped injury in the blast in the Hazelbank area near the M5 on Saturday evening.
The area was sealed off for more than 24 hours as searches were carried out by police and bomb disposal experts.
Ch Supt Henry Irvine, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), said it was "only by good fortune" that nobody was killed or badly injured.
The incident happened as officers, responding to a call, made their way along the Duncrue towpath.
DUP councillor Robert Hill said it seemed police had been lured into the area.
"From what I understand, the police had a call to go down into the area," he said.
"While they were in the area, an explosion took place and it would seem this was an attempt to kill police officers.
"It's an area that's used by all sections of our community - it's used by young families, it's used by cyclists, dog walkers - anybody could have been caught up in this."
A PSNI spokeswoman said: "Police can confirm that an explosive device detonated.
"It is believed that the target was police officers and police are now treating it as attempted murder."
The spokeswoman said the officers were left badly shaken but were not injured.
'Complete disregard'
Ch Supt Irvine condemned those behind the attack, and appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
"This is a well-known area that is used every day by members of the local community," he said.
"It is only by good fortune that police officers and members of the public were not killed or seriously injured last night.
"Those who carried out this attack have shown complete disregard to the safety of the local community and the police officers serving this community."
The M5 reopened on Sunday night although the towpath remained closed between Dargan and Fortwilliam.
The remains of the device have been taken from the scene for forensic tests.
Also on Saturday, Glenmachan Street in Belfast and surrounding streets were closed while experts dealt with a suspicious object.
It was declared a hoax after a controlled explosion was carried out.
There were traffic problems on the Westlink for several hours as the Broadway off-slips were closed in both directions.
AeroMobil's flying car, actually flying.
Before anything goes on offer to the public, it needs to be thoroughly tested. Trouble is, when you're building a flying car, you might struggle to find people brave enough.
While the idea of airborne automobiles has hovered around for decades, there's currently a very distinct buzz about the prospect. Last year, for instance, Uber seemed to lay out serious plans to build out an on-demand urban aviation system within the next five to 10 years.
That sounds ambitious, but Uber is not alone in liking the idea of personal aerial transit. This week, Dubai's Roads and Transportation Agency announced that it plans to roll out single-passenger autonomous drones to ferry people around the city as soon as this July. It's not a flying car, sure—but it's nudging in that direction.
There are a number of companies trying hard to build the real thing. Take your pick from Joby Aviation, eHang, Zee.Aero, and Kitty Hawk, among others. The final two on that list boast Google's Larry Page as an investor. Even larger aerospace companies like Airbus claim to be committed to building the things.
While companies such as AeroMobil and Terrafugia have demonstrated that they can build airplanes that can drive, a flying car is a rather more subtle and, well, car-like thing. And there are clearly numerous obstacles to building such a vehicle—not least creating a compact airframe fit for the road that can also accommodate the means of creating respectable lift and power in the air.
And yet, however preposterous they may seem, these vehicles are—very slowly—edging closer to reality. That much is made clear by a series of new job ads: both Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero are currently looking to recruit flight test engineers.
In the case of Kitty Hawk, a private pilot's license is listed as desirable for the role. It also explains that the company likes to “design/build/test/fly in rapid iteration,” so the ideal candidate will “be energetic, adaptable and a fast learner who can make sound judgments in safety-critical situations.” Which sounds ominous at best.
Speaking to the BBC about Dubai's drones, Steve Wright, an avionics researcher at the University of the West of England, explained that “the tricky bit is making systems that are resilient to failure, adding that he "would like to see the drone flying for at least 1,000 hours before I saw a human in it."
Still, you know what they say: to make a flying car, first you must break some in testing.

Back in March, Obama ordered the Office of Management and Budget to take a close look at the government's contracting procedures, especially the use of outside contractors. Cost-plus contracts came under particular scrutiny, as did sole-source contracts.
One of the first agencies to make changes to their use of major outside contractors was the IRS. In April, they declined to renew a contract to outsource debt collections. Why? Partly because it overstepped the line of using private contractors for inherently governmental functions, but mostly because government debt collectors were a better investment when it came to getting more back for your buck:
The decision followed an extensive IRS review of the program, which showed that private collection agencies recouped less money per case than federal employees, closed fewer cases and were more expensive than in-house collectors. The study, conducted by the IRS and reviewed by MITRE Corp., found that the cost of the IRS' in-house program averaged $0.07 per dollar collected, while that of private debt-collection agencies was $0.24 per dollar recovered. The IRS program recouped 11 percent of debts assigned for collection and moved 28 percent of taxpayers into payment status, compared to 4 percent and 11 percent for private collection agencies.
Claire McCaskill is pushing DHS to get their contracts under control, and now the DOD is also stepping up. While everyone else in DC was watching the health insurance reform bill get passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve, Walter Pincus was poring over the the fine print of the DOD appropriations bill:
The Defense Department estimates it will save an average of $44,000 a year for every contractor it replaces with full-time federal personnel to perform critical defense jobs, according to the House-Senate conference report on the fiscal 2010 defense appropriation bill.
A week ago, OMB reported that it has found $19B in savings on acquisition contracts as a result of the studies they ordered in March. For eight years, the Bush administration used the war in Iraq and the mantra that privatization is best to justify expanding the use of contractors in all aspects of the government. Now we're seeing the fruits of that folly, with excess spending for private profits and a poor return to the government for their investment.
I'm sure all the deficit hawks in the GOP who were screaming about the cost of the health care proposals will be jumping for joy at this about face in government contracting.
Judges Increasingly Catching On to Copyright Trolls' Unfair Tactics
Life under the bridge is a bit less comfortable for copyright trolls these days, as a series of legal losses continues to undermine their misguided business model. Trolls make their money through variations on a simple scheme: file mass copyright lawsuits against thousands of people at once without regard for whether they're in the right court, get a judge to give them power to obtain identifying information for the anonymous “Does,” and then send settlement demand letters threatening to name these Does in a lawsuit if he or she doesn't pay up. In many cases, troll lawsuits are based on allegations of downloading pornography, creating additional pressure to settle rather than risk the embarrassment of being publicly named as watching dirty movies online.
The strategy may be simple, but courts are increasingly rejecting it. In the past few months, judges around the country have picked up the pace and gone after both the legal tactics used for trolling and the lawyers engaging in them.
One battleground is in Florida, where copyright trolls are on a real losing streak. Earlier this month a federal judge in the Northern District of Florida dismissed 27 cases targeting over 3,500 Does — because the lawyer Tarik Hashmi was practicing without a license.
That victory for the legal system follows two major decisions that have collectively taken a shaky legal tactic off the table for trolls. Florida trolls had attempted to use a state law to force ISPs to identify suspected file-sharers. Two different judges rejected that legal theory, quashing subpoenas or dismissing cases outright for nearly 1000 anonymous defendants. Notably, the motions in these cases were brought by the ISPs themselves, which are not happy to be assisting in the process of extorting their customers.
Those decisions are characteristic of what Northern District of Illinois Judge James F. Holderman called a "stiffening judicial headwind" against copyright trolls' abuse of the legal system. Judge Holderman provided that analysis in an opinion rejecting conspiracy charges [pdf] brought by a troll on similarly legally suspect grounds.
In the Northern District of California, Judge Howard R. Lloyd has been even more direct with the lawyers bringing troll suits. In an order issued late last month [pdf] in Hard Drive Productions v. Does 1-90 the Judge wrote:
the court will not assist a plaintiff who seems to have no desire to actually litigate but instead seems to be using the courts to pursue an extrajudicial business plan against possible infringers (and innocent others caught up in the ISP net).
It's clear that many judges are running out of patience for extrajudicial shakedown operations wasting court resources and victimizing Internet users at large. The Northern District of Texas Court Judge David C. Godbey granted sanctions motions brought by EFF and Public Citizen late last year against prolific porn troll lawyer Evan Stone, complaining in his opinion about Stone's "staggering chutzpah." Judge Godbey's colleague Judge John McBryde echoed that sentiment in another opinion [pdf], saying that Stone "failed to demonstrate the level of candor the court expects of members of the bar of this court."
Stone is joined in ignominy by fellow troll John Steele, who has also been the subject of harsh words from multiple federal judges, including Judge Milton I. Shadur in the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Shadur threw out one of Steele's cases against 300 Does, saying that his "ill-considered lawsuit" "abused the litigation system in more than one way."
And of course Righthaven, which at one point was among the most high-profile copyright trolls in the business but has never won a single case, is now in ruins, losing four appeals so far this year and having its domain name auctioned to pay its opponents' legal bills.
Sadly, these judges' views are not universally held: too many courts are letting these cases go forward even after being apprised of their fundamental flaws. Several Internet service providers (with amicus support from EFF) have asked a federal judge who signed off on some of these lawsuits in a widely cited opinion to reconsider her determination or let them raise the issue before an appellate court. With hundreds of cases pending, and hundreds of thousands of individuals' right to anonymity online at stake, it is high time for an appeals court to put some uniformity on the law and stop the trolls' unsavory tactics.
Mike Griffith cited Guitar Hero as a sign of the influence of gaming Video games are poised to "eclipse" all other forms of entertainment, according to games studio boss Mike Griffith. The Activision chief made the bold call during a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He said video games were prospering as interest in almost every other category of entertainment declines. Mr Griffith said social gaming, more interactivity and better technology would help gaming dominate the entertainment landscape in future. He said: "Movies, recorded music and TV - these are all stagnating or contracting entertainment sectors." 40% growth He quoted US market statistics which showed that between 2003 and 2007 sales of movie tickets fell by 6%; the number of hours of TV watched dropped by 6%, sales of recorded music slumped 12% and purchases of DVDs remained flat. Over the same four-year period, said Mr Griffith, the video game industry grew by 40%. "Video games are poised to eclipse all other forms of entertainment in the decade ahead," he said. Gamers will spend longer with James Bond than moviegoers The success of Guitar Hero, said Mr Griffith, showed how influential gaming had become on many other entertainment sectors. He quoted Nielsen SoundScan data which showed that artists whose music featured on Guitar Hero had seen a rise in download sales of 15-843%. The game had proved so popular that some bands, such as Metallica and Aerosmith, were bringing out a version of the game that only features their music. "Music has a history of evolving through technology and we are at the beginning of the latest chapter in that story," he said. Technology, community and interactivity were the three factors that would help the video game industry become the driving force in entertainment, said Mr Griffith. 'Story telling' The powerful processors in consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360 meant that games were getting ever more realistic and immersive, he said. "Games are no longer pre-set trips through linear mazes," said Mr Griffith. "They are becoming a legitimate story-telling medium that rivals feature films." He cited the video game of the latest James Bond film Quantum of Solace (QoS) as an example of how games were taking over. Guitar Hero players are sharing their own musical creations "The moviegoer is passive whereas the gamer is active and part of the game itself," he said, adding that anyone who played QoS would spend more than 50 hours in the company of James Bond compared to only 106 minutes if they watched the movie. The communities growing up around titles such as Guitar Hero World Tour also showed how entertainment was changing, he said. Owners of the game had created 141,000 tracks of their own using its in-built mixing studio and uploaded them to the Guitar Hero community site, which now has more than 600,000 members, he said. More interactive controllers such as the guitars and drums in Guitar Hero and the Wiimote on Nintendo's gaming console were also helping encourage more people to take up gaming, said Mr Griffiths. "Those new controllers are encouraging new ways to become more socially active in gaming," he said. "They are bringing in a whole new group of consumers that have never before been involved in gaming." He concluded: "The one thing that is for sure is entertainment is changed forever with gaming."

The most useless waste of an hour that Fox News could possibly offer up – Sean Hannity – has upped the ante on his suckage.
It's like he and Eric Bolling are in a competition to score points as the ultimate Trump bootlick.
At this point, Hannity's family should be feeling deep pangs of shame and embarrassment.
So what the latest mind-numbing nugget of vagary is Hannity engaged in?
It seems he has a message for all the other Trumplings, who may be distressed over Trump's cratering poll numbers.
He has chosen to eschew the numbers of more reliable polls, in favor of the Gateway Pundit nonsense, as mentioned here this past weekend.
From Hannity's own site:
As we've seen recently with Reuters, presidential polls cannot always be trusted. So for anyone who's been disheartened by the post-convention bump for Hillary Clinton, the Gateway Pundit has some uplifting numbers for you: The website reports that analysis from the two candidates' social media accounts could mean Donald Trump will win in a landslide. Consider the two candidates' Facebook accounts: Trump has over 10 million “likes” while Hillary has just over 5 million.
Stop laughing. That's an actual excerpt from his actual website.
How about when the two candidates live stream their events? Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream while Clinton receives on average, a measly 500 viewers. And on Reddit, “Hillary for Prison” has more than double the subscribers (55,000) than the actual Hillary Clinton page does (24,000).
This is an entirely new level of seat sniffing for Sean Hannity. If anyone ever had any lingering shreds of respect for the man, I'm not sure how those remain, at this point.
Mr. Hannity, you are pathetic, sir.
CommonSpace columnist and Common Weal director Robin McAlpine says kneejerk reactions from the unionist camp are to be expected every time the Scottish independence case strengthens
WHERE stands Scottish unionism? We're all used to commentary pieces on the state of the case for independence. What about the case for Britain?
I find myself reflecting on this in the aftermath of the publication last week of our paper on Scotland's finances (Beyond GERS) and the reaction from parts of the unionist community in Scotland.
My conclusion is that Scottish unionism is now a wholly negative proposition. As far as I can tell, the 'positive case for the union' (always tricky to disentangle from the wider Project Fear narrative) is now a distant memory. The only case left for Britain is that Scotland can't finance an independent state.
As far as I can tell, the 'positive case for the union' is now a distant memory. The only case left for Britain is that Scotland can't finance an independent state.
That is why any attempt to show that an independent Scotland is as fiscally viable as the UK is such a threat – if all you've got is 'you can't afford it' then you really, really need it not to be challenged.
I won't go over the whole argument in the report – you can read a quick summary by report author Craig Dalzell here. What we sought to do was produce a proper report with verifiable references which anyone is free to explore.
We made assumptions (as any report into the future must do) and we outlined those assumptions, not because we believe that makes them 'definitely true' but because assumptions should be openly stated precisely so they can be challenged.
And we proposed clear and understandable actions which could address the issue of the comparative fiscal situation in Scotland and England. You may very well not agree with them, but as always we wished to make it as clear as possible what they are so they can be debated.
That is why any attempt to show that an independent Scotland is as fiscally viable as the UK is such a threat – if all you've got is 'you can't afford it' then you really, really need it not to be challenged.
So as always we welcome that debate. It would just be nice if it was grounded in something a little more serious than the two blogs on which the whole unionist community seems to have relied for their response.
(That response includes well-known macroeconomist JK Rowling who in her very own post-truth bubble simply accused us of making things up. With her disdain for experts and conviction that popular and powerful figures should use their fame to trump rational debate, she should perhaps consider a new home in Ukip.)
The two blogs in question are here and here. Craig has addressed the multiple mistakes in them here, but I want to outline a few examples.
We propose that less should be spent on the military but that it should be spent in Scotland, defending Scotland. This means it is very easy to spend less overall but spend more in-country. Sure, we wouldn't be able to start wars all round the world, but a basic understanding of the profile of UK military expenditure in Scotland could have saved our blogger from missing the point.
The other blogger suggests that the UK could simply pass a law to remove pension entitlement from pensioners who retire in Scotland. At the moment anyone who has a track record of National Insurance Contributions has a right to a UK state pension, irrespective of where they retire. This applies to former citizens – such as pensioners in an independent Scotland who paid NICs their whole life.
As always we welcome the debate. It would just be nice if it was grounded in something a little more serious than the two blogs on which the whole unionist community seems to have relied for their response.
But either he is proposing removing the pensions from former British citizens all over the world (which is certainly subject to challenge and the Daily Mail will be delighted) or he's suggesting that Scotland alone of all the world's nations is the one to which people who paid NICs couldn't retire. California, Australia, South Africa – all fine, you'll keep getting your pension. But not Scotland.
I realise the UK is lukewarm on the whole human rights thing, but I feel that the Supreme Court might have something to say about selective targeting of people's legal entitlement for purely political purposes.
Then of course, if we're all allowed just to sign bits of legislation reneging on previous commitments, why would Scotland keep paying the UK for 'its share of debt' as unionists are convinced it has to? We're in a world where unionists think you can just sign away responsibilities with the wave of a magic pen, but only if you're not Scotland. This really is Hogwarts stuff.
In any case, the whole thing is predicated on a repeated unionist misunderstanding of successor and continuing state. I actually ploughed my way through the Vienna Conventions on the division of nation states and Craig did a survey of international precedent for our previous paper on debts and assets.
Basically, the rules are 'it's a share of everything or a share of nothing'. Either we both (Scotland and England) get proportionate access to everything (including institutions and currency) and are both considered successor states, or one country is designated as a new state and one the continuing state. In the latter case the new nation has no automatic right to out-of-country assets and institutions, but also no liability for debt.
We're in a world where unionists think you can just sign away responsibilities with the wave of a magic pen, but only if you're not Scotland. This really is Hogwarts stuff.
The debt is the UK Government's debt. I'm weary of explaining that this is the law, whether unionists like it or not. If you take a mortgage out in your name and you share the payment of the mortgage with a lodger, you can't phone the bank and transfer half the legal liability of the mortgage on to the lodger if he or she moves out. What counts is who signed the contract – and it wasn't Scotland.
One of our bloggers claims that financing Scottish debt would be expensive because our borrowing rate would be higher than the UK's. Except we know this and have allowed for it – and we'd still save money because the UK debt was largely accrued at a time when UK borrowing rates were much higher. You'd think he'd understand this basic point.
And as a flat-out rule, if you say you're going to attempt to close tax loopholes and someone claims this is the same as a rise in income tax, they're not being serious. Likewise, if you refuse to accept standard Treasury methodology for measuring the tax impact of moving civil servants to Scotland (which Craig used in the report) then it's pointless trying to engage.
The two blogs concerned are littered with this stuff from start to finish. There is plenty you might want to challenge in our report. For example, we accept that closing tax loopholes isn't as difficult as the UK pretends but still isn't easy (we're developing a paper on this to explore it more).
Yes, allocation of debt is a negotiation and accurately predicting outcomes is tricky. And yes, the Vienna Conventions haven't been ratified and the UK might refuse to accept international precedent (did I mention that this is a country with a declining interest in the rule of law?).
At Common Weal we're trying to do what we can to recognise previous flaws, put the hours into researching possible solutions, to produce them and test them.
The pensions outcome is right in numbers terms but in terms of policy you don't really want your pensioners dependent on the policy of another country (which isn't what we're proposing but would at least be a substantive argument).
But this is not the debate. Instead we get Trump stuff, the statement of opinion as fact without engaging with any counterfactual ideas, without looking at history, without doing proper research.
Now this is not simply a flaw on one side – I have always been critical of some of the assertions and bold but unfounded statements that have come from parts of the indy movement (mainly members of the public). But what else does unionism have these days other than certainty and swagger that it is fundamentally superior?
Is it that the UK is a great place we should want to be a part of? That pooling and sharing was the best thing that happened to Daniel Blake? That being in the EU is a primary concern? That Labour is close to victory and that's all we need? Or perhaps the real hope is that Tony Blair might return.
For the love of the wee man, Boris Johnston is a foreign secretary and Nigel Farage is being tipped as our new ambassador to the US. As one of our intrepid bloggers put it, if that's a convincing case, email me because I want to sell you things.
Unionists' lack of seriousness makes them weak. Their lack of debate about what they are for makes them vulnerable. So they cling to their one tool – a spreadsheet – for comfort.
I have hardly been uncritical of the state of the independence movement. We are two years past the referendum and barely a jot of work has been done to revise the case. We've been through three GERS reports and the official response looked quite a lot like a rabbit caught in the headlights.
Have I got everything right in the past? Nope. For example, we're soon going to publish a paper by a very well informed source on the stages needed to implement a new currency. There are aspects of this I simply didn't previously understand. So I'm working hard to learn, to fix parts of my thinking that may have been faulty.
But unionism? It seems to have understood nothing, learned nothing and refuses to pull its head out from under the duvet. It sits quietly as the borders are closed to foreigners, as human rights are abolished, as the poor are victimised, as the media turns on the judges.
At Common Weal we're trying to do what we can to recognise previous flaws, put the hours into researching possible solutions, to produce them and test them. I am a pluralist and welcome unionist critique and criticism, because it may well identify new flaws we need to work on.
But there should be two conditions. It should be serious in a way our bloggers aren't. And it should apply in both directions – unionists should be demonstrating a fleeting interest in their own flaws.
Their lack of seriousness makes them weak. Their lack of debate about what they are for makes them vulnerable. So they cling to their one tool – a spreadsheet – for comfort.
Just listen to them squeal if you try and take it from them.

Cortana is set to receive a few new additions in the upcoming builds of Windows 10 Redstone, with the latest internal builds including a new option to enable additional push notifications for your other Windows 10 devices. Cortana will soon be able to alert you when your phone battery is low, a phone call is missed, and when you receive a text or app notification.
This functionality is expanded from what is already possible with todays version of Cortana, which will simply alert you when you miss a phone call. Redstone will introduce the ability to include additional apps and features to be alerted by, which also means notification centers will no longer be out of sync across devices.
This is part of the improvements to “continuum” that we exclusively revealed a few months ago, which will bring all your devices closer together by allowing apps to be continued throughout all your Windows 10 devices. Notifications will also be included with this updated continuum, allowing users to see what's happening on what devices no matter where they are.
Of course, this feature is completely optional, and can be turned off via Cortana. What are your thoughts on this? Let us know below!

BENGALURU: Incarcerated AIADMK leader VK Sasikala has received a barrage of letters from Tamil Nadu, accusing her of killing J Jayalalithaa . Angry letter-writers have said their curses will haunt Sasikala for ever, sources in Parappana Agrahara central prison said.More than 100 letters, written in Tamil and addressed to 'Sasikala, Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara, Bangalore 560100', have reached the jail since February 15, the day Sasikala stepped into the prison after the Supreme Court upheld her conviction in an illegal wealth case."The letters accuse Sasikala of hatching a plot to murder then Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. The writers believe Jayalalithaa had no reason to die and it was a planned murder," the sources said.A prison source quoted from a letter: "You have killed our Thalaivi, our beloved amma. You are an ungrateful and unfaithful woman and back-stabber. You betrayed a person who gave you life and everything. Remember, you will have to suffer for your bad deeds. You will suffer inch by inch and repay for everything you have done."Prison sources said many letters are political in nature, but don't spell any threat. Sasikala's companion J Ilavarasi filters the letters and destroys the most abusive ones. "In the beginning, Sasikala would read all the letters. Gradually, she stopped reading them as most were abusive," a source said."We found the letters have come from different parts of Tamil Nadu - Salem, Dharmapuri, Madurai, Dindigul, Karur, Tiruchirapalli and Villupuram," the source said, adding: "There are fewer letters from Chennai."
It was a quiet Sunday morning when my horny landlady, Mrs. Sinclair left for her weekly trip to Thunderbird casino fifty miles away. If she stays true to her schedule, she won't be home until dinner time. With her gone, I feel free to use the house, hang out by the pool and do some laundry in peace. Shasta, her twenty one year old daughter was in her room as usual. Connor, nineteen year old son was gaming in the family room. They stuck to themselves while I hung out by the pool drinking a beer and doing laundry.
It was early afternoon when I got up to check my laundry. My load had finished washing thirty minutes ago and it was my third trip to the laundry room to see a load of dry women's clothing still in the dryer. I didn't want to dump out someone else's laundry but I didn't want to come back either. I finally unloaded the dry clothes into a waiting basket before loading my wet clothes into the dryer and started the machine. I stepped back to see a pair of lavender panties had fallen on the ground. I picked them up and found myself fingering its silky material. They must have been Shasta's as they were a size small. I looked both ways before putting them up to my nose and inhaled their sweet just washed scent. The satin against my nose, its fresh bouquet, it was all so very intoxicating. I tongued the cotton lining while imagining them filled with the crack of a vagina. The sound of leather sandals slapping against concrete roused me. Panicked, I flew into the broom closet and hid, still clutching her panties in my hand. Through the slates I watched as Shasta entered the room dressed in ripped up denim cutoffs and a tank top. She looked a little bewildered, maybe pissed off, that her laundry had been piled into her basket. She looked up as Connor entered the room, closing the door behind him.
“What's up?” she said.
“I don't know how much longer I can take mom. I need to move out but I don't want anything to happen to her.”
He started to cry and Shasta moved to comfort him by taking him into her arms for a close and genuinely loving hug. She stroked the back of his head and shushed him with a gentle ‘shhhhh, shhhhh' into his ear. He wrapped his arms around her before pulling back to look in her eyes. She kissed his lips. He stopped crying to kiss her back as he held her in his muscular arms. After his kiss, she looked up at him with caring brown eyes.
She said, “You can't be responsible if mom commits suicide. All because you saved her once doesn't mean you have to save her forever. You need to live your own life.”
“I'll never have a relationship with a girl. Not the way I am.”
“No. You will. It gets better. I promise.”
She wiped the hair from his eyes.
She said, “You want me to make you feel good?”
He nodded, sniffing away his tears.
Shasta's eyes never left his as her nimble fingers unbuttoned his jeans. He stood there quietly, looking at his sister as though she were a goddess while she jerked down his pants. Then she slid down his underwear. Jeez! My mouth fell open at the sight of Connor's freakishly large dick. At least nine inches long flaccid, wide in girth, its head was as large as a plum. It hung there waiting to be awakened. No wonder the guy fears he'll never have a girlfriend. Any sane girl would look at his enormous dick, scream and start running. That thing can wreck a chick.
Shasta took his massive cock into her hands, squeezing and kneading it to life until became heavily erect. She spit in her hands before stroking him again until it began to slicken with his pre-cum.
She said, “You like this, baby? You like when I do that?”
“Yeah,” he rasped out.
She shucked off her ripped denim shorts and scooted up onto the folding table leaving her legs to swing off the edge. My dick twitched at the sight of her waxed clean snatch and she opened up her legs for Connor as he moved in between them with his luridly long dick.
She said, “Remember what I taught you. You gotta get a girl ready.”
He bent his head to lick her pussy, slobbering on it for a minute before pulling away. Her whole pussy glistened with his spit mixed with her own juices. He pulled her legs up until her ankles rested on his shoulders and he took a hand to guide his massive head towards her hairless slit. Propped up on her elbows, her head lolled back as he put it in and slowly pushed.
“Take it easy,” she said.
He muttered, “Fuck, you feel so good.”
He pulled her legs to him though it never went deep and when he was as deep as he was going to go, he slowly moved it in and out.
My hand full of panties slipped into my cargo shorts where I unconsciously massaged the burgeoning hard-on with the silky material. With Shasta's panties around my dick and the fact that I couldn't rip my sight away from Connor's large dick inside his sister's stretched hole, I felt like I was trapped in a heated quicksand of lust.
Her pussy was stretched red with only six inches of him in her. She was now laid back on the table thumping against the wall, taking as much as of him she can handle for as long as he needed. His hands bit into her thighs as he flung his head back.
“Uhhh!” he exclaimed as he came.
“Fuck,” I bit back as my cum spurted into Shasta's panties.
We came together as Connor's ass squeezed together to pump his jizz into her steamy cunt. It bubbled up and out as it dribbled in the tight skin between them. He stayed in her for a minute before he withdrew, letting go of her legs and stumbling back a little before he righted himself. Shasta propped herself up on her elbow, taking a nearby hand towel to wiped herself before closing her tanned legs now hanging from the table. Connor pushed his dick into his pants. He hung his quiet head again and left the room. She lazily slid off the table before picking up her shorts on the ground. She reached in the back pocket and pulled out an e-cigarette. She sat back on the table and leaned back as she sucked on the vaporizer, holding in the vapor blowing it from her nose. Her snatch was still naked to the world and my eyes stayed glued upon butterfly tattoo a few inches from her split. She sucked on the e-cigarette again and lazily blew out a smoke ring like she was waiting for something. Does she know I'm here? Is she waiting for me to jump out the closet? My blood pounded in my head as I held my breath. I wrung her jizz splattered panties in my hands.
She finally sat up, slipped her legs off the table to step into her shorts and hopped as she pulled them over her naked ass to zip them up. She grabbed her basket before leaving. I stood there for a few minutes later, handling her sticky underwear in my hand and exhaling mightily as I stepped out of the closet. I walked straight to the washbasin to rinse the soiled underwear before throwing them in with my drying clothes. When they're dry, I'll leave them on top of the dryer, pretending that they just got mixed in my load. Looking through the window, making sure there was no one by the pool, I left the laundry room and headed straight to my room, quietly shutting the door behind me to jump in the shower to wash the shame from my body.
The warm water pouring over my head relaxed me and though I felt the change in the air, a subtle cold breeze, I paid it no attention until I heard my shower door slide open. I flinched with surprise and turned my head to see a naked Shasta entering my shower.
I asked, “What are you doing?”
“I thought I'd clean up with you as you cool down from what you saw. I saw you come out of the laundry room after I left.”
I tried to step out of the tub but she stopped me, putting her arms around my neck as the shower head sprayed the back of my head. She kissed me, pressing her body against mine until I pried her off of me.
“Stop,” I blurted out. “You have really got some problems.”
I pushed past her, grabbing a towel to wrap around myself as I entered my bedroom. She actually stayed and finished her shower. It was minutes after I jumped into a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that she finally turned off the shower and emerged wrapped in my last clean towel. She sauntered into my bedroom.
“He's not really my brother,” she said. “Not by blood anyways. Thanks for the shampoo.”
The moment she stepped from my room, I locked the door behind her. I flopped back still damp upon my bed thinking this place is one mind fuck of a crazy house.

Story highlights Lawmakers will vote on whether to allow the bill to move forward
Some Labour MPs have said they will not back the bill
London (CNN) The UK government is set to clear a hurdle on the path to Brexit later Wednesday when lawmakers vote on a bill to trigger negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, following two days of debate.
Members of Parliament are expected to approve the EU (Notification on Withdrawal) Bill, sending it on to the next stage in the parliamentary process.
The real battle is expected next week, according to Britain's Press Association news agency, when the bill returns to the House of Commons for detailed scrutiny in the committee stage. Opposition parties will then try to push through a series of amendments.
Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty -- and so start two years of negotiations to leave the 27-nation economic and political grouping -- by the end of March.
Her government was forced to bring legislation to Parliament after the Supreme Court ruled it could not trigger Article 50 without the permission of lawmakers.

NDP Leader Dominic Cardy is calling on the health minister to explain how the provincial government will provide access to abortion services once the Morgentaler clinic in Fredericton closes.
NDP Leader Dominic Cardy wants to hear from the health minister on abortions now that the Morgentaler lawsuit has been dropped. the situation, citing the lawsuit filed against the province by the estate of Dr. Henry Morgentaler. Health Minister Ted Flemming has previously declined to comment onMorgentaler.
But that lawsuit was officially withdrawn on Thursday.
"I hope the minister, now that the minister has been deprived of his hedge to hide behind with the delay over the lawsuit being dropped, actually comes out and gives a clear statement about how New Brunswick intends to uphold the Supreme Court ruling and the decision of Parliament from many decades ago," Cardy told CBC News.
In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Criminal Code section on abortion violated a woman's right to security of the person.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health said in an emailed statement on Friday that "access to this medical service will still be available in our province if the clinic closes."
"Women will continue to have access to medically-necessary abortions in the province with the approval of two physicians."
The Morgentaler clinic in Fredericton is scheduled to close at the end of July following a 20-year fight with the New Brunswick government over funding. The Morgentaler clinic , the only private abortion facility in New Brunswick, is scheduled to close at the end of July, following a 20-year fight with the provincial government over funding.
New Brunswick is the only province in Canada with a private abortion clinic that isn't funded by medicare.
The current fee for the procedure is $700 before 14 weeks of pregnancy, and $850 between 14 and 16 weeks.
The province pays for abortions at two hospitals, but only if a woman gets approval from two doctors who certify the procedure is “medically necessary.”
Earlier this week, the new government advisory agency on women's issues, the Voices of New Brunswick Women, called on the province to immediately repeal the regulation it says places barriers on access to women.
“We are concerned that with fewer options, some women might harm themselves by choosing dangerous means to end a pregnancy,” said Phylomène Zangio, co-chair of the Forum, stated in a release.
“For this reason, it is urgent that the province change its policy and take the necessary measures to ensure that abortion services are made available to women everywhere in the province.”
An online petition to pressure the province to fund services at the Morgentaler clinic has gotten more than 13,000 signatures since the clinic announced in April its plans to close.
As part of their Green Monday sale, Amazon has the Logitech Harmony Smart Remote w/ Bluetooth Hub on sale for $79.99 for today only. That's the lowest price this remote has ever been and $20 less than the last time it went on sale. This remote is one of the few universal remotes capable of controlling the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. It comes with a bluetooth capable hub that translates the remotes RF signals into bluetooth which lets it control a slew of devices in addition to the Fire TV including Rokus, Apple TVs, Xboxs, Playstations, and even PCs. Logitech calls this remote “future-proof” because they regularly update its software to support new devices, and I believe them because they were quick to add Fire TV support within 2 months of it being released. Whether you're not happy with your FLIRC setup or just want to step up to the ultimate Fire TV smart remote setup, there's never been a better time to buy this remote. The sale ends at midnight.

Welcome to SmashBoards Writer'- Oh, this is a twist. The start of something new? General interviews? Starting with the one and only famous Smash 4 player ZeRo! - It makes sense considering even he was a SmashBoards writer.In the future, these general interviews will have a bit more of a twist. Without further due still, please, give ZeRo a nice welcome!Haha, well! It's always been hard for me to answer this question. You see, I wanna say 'I'm strange' or 'weird', but isn't everyone to some extent, well, interesting like that? Exactly.As a person I'm very mood based. And that swings a lot, I'd say. I''m kinda shy, goofy, very quiet or very loud when comfortable.I'm somebody who's very driven, and, when that motivation is found, I tend to be very determined to accomplish whatever I set myself to. Smash, YouTube, and others can be used as examples here.I enjoy reading, Japanese food, visual novel games (Ace attorney, Layton, Zero Escape), every single smash bros game and absolutely adore and love my fiance Vanessa- I also like law and order, star fox and other stuff. But Smash is the main thingI've always been a big Nintendo fan. My mom brought Smash 64 home one day, and been stuck on it. Eventually found the national scene in Chile, and went from there. I slowly started doing more and cooler things, and it just became the full time thing for me to do that it is now.Fun! It's a passion of mine. I enjoy it, it's a great time. Otherwise I'd be in school.eSports! Every year we're getting bigger and better. It's a matter of time for things to unfold. Biggest thing is more Nintendo support at this pointYa' know? I don't know, lol. Brawl.. used to be Halberd. In Melee...Brinstar...Hmmm, in Smash 4? Well, I kinda like Smashville, LOL.All time Smash Bros? Fox. Main him in 64, Melee, PM. In Smash 4? Diddy Kong!!! And Sheik and Falcon come close.I write a lot personally for other matters, always been a writer. Just didn't have time to continue- and maybe?? Not sure haha.

Not everyone has been doing badly during the economic turmoil of the last few years. In fact, there are some Americans that are doing really, really well. While the vast majority of us struggle, there is one small segment of society that is seemingly doing better than ever. This was reflected in a recent article on CNBC in which it was noted that companies that cater to average Americans are doing rather poorly right now while companies that market luxury goods and services are generally performing exceptionally well. So why aren't all American consumers jumping on the spending bandwagon? Well, it seems that there are a large number of Americans who either can't spend a lot of money right now or who are very hesitant to. A stunningly high number of Americans are still unemployed, and for many other Americans, there is a very real fear that hard economic times will return soon. On the other hand, there is a significant percentage of Americans who are blowing money on luxury goods and services as if the economy has fully turned around and it is time to let the good times roll. So exactly what in the world is going on here?
Well, in 2010 life is very, very different depending on whether you are a “have” or a “have not”. The recent article on CNBC referenced above described it this way….
Consumer spending in the U.S. has turned into a tale of two cities in 2010, with an entire segment of consumers splurging confidently on the finer things in life, while another segment, concerned about unemployment and with little or no discretionary income, spends only on bare necessities.
So why is this happening?
It is happening because the rich are getting richer and they have plenty of money to buy stuff and the poor are getting poorer and have less money to spend than ever.
In case you haven't been paying attention over the past couple of decades, what we have in America today is a system that is designed to funnel as much wealth into the hands of the elite as possible.
This isn't capitalism that we have in America in 2010. Instead, what we have created is a system where the laws are set up so that the power elite and their big, dominant corporations always win.
Why do you think so many of America's largest corporations pay so little in taxes?
Why do you think so many of them are showered with government subsidies, tax breaks and bailouts?
It's not about competition anymore.
It's about rigging the game in your favor.
The power elite and the giant corporations they control spend millions and millions on lobbying and campaign contributions and they expect a big return on that investment.
Let's take a look at one example. Many people think that Barack Obama and the Democrats are supposed to be anti-business, right?
Well then why are some of Barack Obama's biggest donors the very same corporations that are receiving giant bailouts, making record profits and paying their employees billions in bonuses?
Goldman Sachs was Barack Obama's second biggest donor. Microsoft was number four. Citigroup was number six. JPMorgan Chase was number seven. Time Warner was number eight.
Are you starting to get the picture?
Every single year, the U.S. Congress passes law after law that makes it easier for big corporations to dominate and makes it easier for the rich to get even richer.
America's economy is not about competition anymore.
It is about eliminating competition.
And unfortunately for middle class Americans, the giant predator corporations that now dominate our economy are realizing that they don't really need nearly as many American workers anymore.
Instead, they are slowly but surely shipping our jobs off to the other side of the world where workers are willing to work for about a tenth as much.
And yet we still run out to the “big box” stores and fill up our carts with a bunch of plastic crap made on the other side of the world by these giant corporations.
Meanwhile, those giant corporations are taking the profits they make out of our communities and they are taking our jobs and are shipping them overseas.
So in the final analysis, is it any wonder why the income inequality gap is growing?
Without small businesses having a legitimate chance to compete and without good jobs for American workers, the middle class in America is going to continue to get chewed up and spit out.
The following are 30 statistics that prove that the elite are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the middle class is being destroyed in 2010….
The Rich Are Getting Richer
1 – As of 2007, the top 1 percent of all Americans was taking home 24 percent of the national income. This was a level that had not been seen since the days of the Great Depression.
2 – Incomes have been growing in the United States, but those at the very top of the pyramid have been gobbling up almost all of the income growth. According to Harvard Magazine, 66% of the income growth between 2001 and 2007 went to the top 1% of all Americans.
3 – Even official government figures bear out the fact that the rich are getting richer. An analysis of income-tax data by the Congressional Budget Office a few years ago found that the top 1% of all American households own nearly twice as much of the corporate wealth as they did just 15 years ago.
4– Most Americans have suffered during the last few years, but not the boys and girls down on Wall Street. New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli says that Wall Street bonuses for 2009 were up 17 percent when compared with 2008.
5 – Even as the number of Americans living in poverty skyrockets, the number of millionaires just keeps growing. In fact, the number of millionaires in the United States rose a whopping 16 percent to 7.8 million during 2009.
6 – The amount of money some of these Wall Street hotshots are making is incredible. Back in 2005, the top 25 hedge fund managers earned a total of 9 billion dollars. That would be bad enough, but even in these hard economic times the rich just keep getting richer. One year after the recent financial collapse the top 25 hedge fund managers earned a total of approximately $25 billion. That breaks down to an average of $1 billion each. The truth is that the United States has been experiencing uneven prosperity for quite some time and things just seem to get worse with each passing year.
The Poor Are Getting Poorer
7 – Government anti-poverty programs are exploding in size in response to the recent economic difficulties. USA Today is reporting that a record one in six Americans are now being served by at least one government anti-poverty program.
8 – Over 50 million Americans are on now Medicaid. That figure is up more than 17 percent since the beginning of the recession.
9 – The number of Americans in the food stamp program rose to a new all-time record of 40.8 million in May. That number is up almost 50 percent since the beginning of the recession.
10 – The number of Americans who cannot afford even the basic necessities is absolutely staggering. A whopping 50 million Americans could not afford to buy enough food in order to stay healthy at some point over the last year.
11 – Compared to other industrialized nations, the United States is doing very poorly. The U.S. poverty rate is now the third worst among the developed nations tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
12 – The saddest part of this is what we are doing to our children. According to one recent study, approximately 21 percent of all children in the United States are living below the poverty line in 2010.
13 – But the American people cannot provide for their families if they don't have jobs. Today there are not nearly enough jobs for everyone. In 2010, it takes the average unemployed American worker over 8 months to find a job.
14 – Approximately 10 million Americans are currently receiving unemployment insurance, which is a number that is nearly four times higher than what it was at back in 2007.
15 – The truth is that we are creating a permanent underclass of Americans that cannot get jobs. The number of Americans receiving long-term unemployment benefits has increased over 60 percent in just the past year.
16 – Increasingly, the wealth of the United States is being held in fewer and fewer hands. One study found that as of 2007, the bottom 80 percent of American households held about 7% of the liquid financial assets.
17 – It is not a good time to be living in “the bottom half” in America. The size of “the pie” being divided up among those at the low end of the wage scale is becoming really, really small. In fact, the bottom 40 percent of all income earners in the United States now collectively own less than 1 percent of the nation's wealth.
The Middle Class Is Being Destroyed
18 – Even those Americans that still does have decent jobs are seeing their wealth fade rapidly. For example, U.S. families have $6 trillion less in housing wealth than they did just three years ago.
19 – Home ownership used to be a sign that one had arrived in the middle class, but in 2010 an increasing number of Americans are finding out that they simply can't afford their homes anymore. One out of every seven mortgages were either delinquent or in foreclosure during the first quarter of 2010.
20 – The reality is that incomes have just not kept up with housing costs. This has put an incredible amount of pressure on the middle class. Just how much pressure? Well, only the top 5 percent of all U.S. households have earned enough additional income to match the rise in housing costs since 1975.
21 – The debt binge middle class Americans have been on over the past couple of decades has drained many of them completely dry, and now more Americans than ever have bad credit scores. Over 25 percent of Americans now have a credit score below 599, which means that they are a very bad credit risk.
22 – A rapidly rising number of Americans are actually choosing bankruptcy as a way out of their financial problems. Nationwide, bankruptcy filings rose 20 percent in the 12 month period ending this past June 30th.
23 – The middle class manufacturing jobs that once defined so many American cities are rapidly disappearing. Despite the fact that the U.S. population has dramatically increased, less Americans are employed in manufacturing today than in 1950.
24 – These days it seems like almost everyone is looking for a good job, but very few people are finding them. According to one recent survey, 28% of all U.S. households have at least one member that is looking for a full-time job.
25 – Even many of those Americans that still has decent jobs have been hit hard by this economic downturn. A recent Pew Research survey found that 55 percent of the U.S. labor force has experienced either unemployment, a pay decrease, a reduction in hours or an involuntary move to part-time work since the recession began.
26 – The number of jobs that are evaporating is absolutely stunning. According to one analysis, the United States has lost a total of 10.5 million jobs since 2007.
27 – So where are the jobs going? It doesn't take a genius to figure it out. China's trade surplus (much of it with the United States) climbed 140 percent in June compared to a year earlier.
28 – The truth is that “globalism” and “free trade” have put middle class American workers in direct competition with the cheapest labor in the world. This is what middle class American workers must now compete against: in China a garment worker makes approximately 86 cents an hour and in Cambodia a garment worker makes approximately 22 cents an hour.
29 – Due to these difficult economic conditions, the middle class is being squeezed as never before. According to a poll taken in 2009, 61 percent of Americans “always or usually” live paycheck to paycheck. That was up significantly from 49 percent in 2008 and 43 percent in 2007.
30 – So what kind of future do our young people have in front of them? Unfortunately, things don't look pretty. Many fresh college graduates can't even get a job that will allow them to be independent. One recent survey of last year's college graduates discovered that 80 percent moved right back home with their parents after graduation. That was up significantly from 63 percent in 2006.
Sony's PlayStation VR (PSVR) celebrates its first birthday in just under two weeks' time, and the company is marking the anniversary with a revised model.
Japanese publication Famitsu has revealed a new version of the PS4-based VR headset that sports some minor, but appreciated updates. For starters, the kit's processor unit now allows for high dynamic range (HDR) passthrough. PS4 got an HDR update last year, but anyone with PSVR needed to unplug the headset to get the benefits on their TV. To be clear, this doesn't sound like PSVR itself now supports HDR, just traditional games can be played on a TV with the option while it's still plugged in.
Elsewhere, the site notes the headset's stereo headphone jack has been relocated, and the cables have been replaced with new, slimmer alternatives. PSVR's wires can indeed cause something of a mess, so this is another appreciated update. The images above are all we've got for now.
It sounds like that's it for updates. Nothing major, then, though with PSVR only a year old Sony would be hard pressed to implement major new features that would require early adopters to update. Still, we'd love to see some improved tracking for the headset's 180 degree single-camera solution, or some improved motion controllers.
We've reached out to Sony to confirm that this new model will also be making its way to the US, Europe and other parts of the world soon. It costs 44,980 yen (about $398), so don't expect this to new model to have a big price drop if it does release elsewhere.

Gun Owners Come To Annapolis For 2A Tuesday

More than 100 gun owners gathered on Lawyer's Mall outside the State House today for 2-A Tuesday.
The gun owners are pushing for a series of bills that supporters say would preserve Second Amendment rights.
The gun owners are seeking to repeal the gun control law enacted in 2013, which banned 45 different types of assault weapons and limited gun magazines to just 10 rounds.
Groups including the National Rifle Association and Maryland Shall Issue say that law has curbed gun owners rights.
Portions of the law are being challenged in court.
As a candidate, Larry Hogan described the gun control law as "settled law" and he would not pursue a repeal of the measure.
NRA Maryland Liaison Shannon Alford told WBAL NewsRadio 1090 that her group's efforts is not on convincing Hogan to pursue a repeal, but rather considering a Democratic controlled legislature to consider the repeal.
She says her group intends to do that by educating lawmakers about the Second Amendment.
The groups also want the law repealed requiring bullet manufactures to submit images of spent shells to the State Police for ballistics matching.
Alford notes the funding to enforce this law has not been in the budget for at least ten years.
Tensions that stemmed from La Vista Mayor Doug Kindig's alleged comments to an atheist activist after a Memorial Day service led to a political storm and protests on June 2nd. A group of atheists in La Vista, Nebraska has accused the mayor of offering a “disturbing” response to their complaint over an event organized part of the city's Memorial Day celebrations that they believed violated the separation of church and state.
At the “Faith & Freedom Day” event on May 25th, Robert Fuller, treasurer for Omaha Atheists, approached Douglas Kindig to say that the Memorial weekend event violated the separation of church and state.
According to a press release by Omaha Atheists, Fuller approached the mayor, calmly telling Kindig how he disagreed with certain aspects of the event. After expressing his thoughts, Fuller handed over his business card to Kindig, requesting an appointment so they could meet and discuss the issue further. But, according to the organization, the mayor responded with “disturbing comments.”
“Take me to f****** court, because I don't care… Minorities are not going to run my city,” said the mayor.
In his press release, Fuller said that he was “baffled” by Kindig's “disturbing” response and did not have hope that the politician would hear his concerns.
In response, the mayor's office said Kindig had been “confronted” by Fuller though they did not divulge any details about the incident.
“I am truly sorry that my response to this representative caused backlash against the city… I was coming out of a very emotional event at which local veterans who were killed in action were recognized, and my reaction was certainly emotional in nature… It is my hope all sides can move forward together,” said Kindig in his statement.
This did not satisfy many Nebraska atheists, who congregated at La Vista City Hall to protest the mayor's conduct on June 2nd.
“We have a political figure, such as the mayor of the city, picking such marginalizing comments. We want to make sure that he knows it's wrong,” said Jill Fitzgerald, an atheist demonstrator.
In fact, members of the Harrison Street Baptist Church also joined the protest, though it was in support of the mayor and not against him.
“We concluded that it was a constitutional event. It is really a private worship service, not a government-sponsored one… I don't see the mayor as a bigot. I don't think he was making any kind of racial comments or anything like that,” said Roger Criser, chief organizer of the La Vista Daze memorial service.
Faith and Freedom Day was organized on Sunday to thank and celebrate veterans as well as those currently serving in the military. The event included a pancake breakfast as well as a prayer service. According to the city's website, the event received its sponsorships from local churches.
Neither group instigated the other and both sides kept to themselves. While the Christian protesters continued to pray at the gathering, the atheist protesters delivered powerful speeches. The La Vista police said that this was the first-ever protest to be held at the City Hall. During the protest, Fuller said that he was still seeking an appointment with Kindig to discuss the separation of church and state in the organization of the Memorial Day service in question.
Opinions
A 33-year-old Greeley man accused of trafficking several underage girls for sex in Weld County has been sentenced to 248 years in prison.
Paul Burman received the maximum possible sentence Wednesday for his conviction of 32 counts, including human trafficking and child prostitution.
Prosecutors say Burman, who went by "Haylo," pimped out several victims, both adults and minors. One of his victims was 15 years old.
According to court testimony, he provided the victims with drugs and alcohol and booked hotel rooms for them to have sex with men, sometimes on several occasions in one night.
Burman also is accused of threatening the victims with violence to force them into prostitution. Prosecutors say that in one instance, he beat and sexually assaulted one of the girls for talking back to him and not making enough money.

As President Trump continues to make news with his executive orders, a new National Museum of American History exhibit reminds us of one particularly memorable — and damaging — such order enacted by Franklin Roosevelt on Feb. 19, 1942.
Signed two months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Executive Order 9066 resulted in the imprisonment of more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast of the U.S., two-thirds of whom were American citizens.
The executive order didn't specify Japanese-Americans as the target; rather, it gave the War Department the authority to remove from designated military zones anyone considered a threat to the U.S. People of Japanese heritage living on the West Coast were feared to be spies for the Axis powers and transported to “accommodations” set up by the military.
Junwo “Jimmy” Yamashita wore this uniform while serving in the U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a unit made up entirely of Japanese-Americans, many of them from the internment camps. Yamashita and two fellow company members were awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal in 2014. (Richard Strauss / National Museum of American History)
“West Coast zones were seen as vulnerable for attack by Japan, so [the military] created a zone of exclusion” and kicked Japanese and Japanese-American residents out of it, says Jennifer Locke Jones, curator of “Righting a Wrong: Japanese Americans and World War II.” “The hysteria of a two-front war led to the executive order, and the military determined who it would exclude and remove.”
Japanese-American families living in California, western Washington state, western Oregon and southern Arizona were rounded up and shipped off to internment camps further inland, where they lived under strict supervision until the war ended — and in some cases, up to a year afterward. “No charges were ever brought, and no one was ever found guilty of espionage,” Jones says of the internees, who were all effectively treated like spies during the war.
Commemorating the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, the exhibit is bookended by a display of the original fateful document and the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which issued an official apology and granted reparations. In between are more than 100 objects from the museum's collection, and items newly acquired from the families of the internees. These include official documents concerning the “evacuations,” birth and death certificates, family photos, ID tags, school yearbooks, newspapers, war medals and handmade art from various camps.
Richard Strauss (National Museum of American History)
One particularly memorable object is a box containing several hand-carved wooden birds, above, made by Sadao Oka from Monterey, Calif., while he was interned at the Poston camp in Arizona. Many internees — especially those too young or too old to work in the camps — found themselves spending hours on arts and crafts.
“The older generation had a popular bird-carving workshop,” says museum specialist Noriko Sanefuji, who helped acquire many of the objects for the collection, including the bird box. “The birds are made from scrap wood and inspired by books and magazines. The focus on birds is symbolic for people who don't have their freedom.” Many of these carved birds became buttons and pins, and boys in the camp would give them to their girlfriends as gifts.
“The exhibition is about how life goes on,” Jones says. “You can't right a wrong; you can only redress it.”

I wouldn't have believed it had I not read it for myself from the official Congressional website.
U.S. Representative Martha Roby, a Republican from Alabama's 2d Congressional District has introduced H.R. 1406, officially named the “Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013” which would END the requirement of the Fair Labor Standards Act for employers to pay Time-and-a-Half to employees for every hour worked over 40 in one week.
http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1406
The Congressional Budget Office has reported on the bill, and in part wrote that:
“H.R. 1406 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide compensatory time for employees in the private sector. In lieu of overtime pay, employees could receive compensatory time off at a rate not less than one and one-half hours for each hour of employment for which overtime pay would otherwise have been required. Such compensatory time could be provided only in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement or with the consent of affected employees. The changes would be effective for five years after enactment of the bill.”
The CBO's full report of the one page document may be downloaded here:
(https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr1406.pdf)
Mrs. Roby's act, H.R. 1406, would be, according to the CBO report, “revenue neutral.” In other words, it would NOT affect the cost or performance of the federal government, or of state or local governments, nor would it impose any costs upon them. In fact, the report states:
“Enacting H.R. 1406 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. Implementing the bill also would not affect spending subject to appropriation. H.R. 1406 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.”
https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44100
Note to the reader: Contained in this entry are Links to these topics on the Wikipedia site: Fair Labor Standards Act, Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Congressional Budget Office, compensatory time, Martha Roby, U.S. House of Representatives, Alabama, Wikipedia, Alabama's 2d Congressional District, Mises Institute, child labor, collective bargaining agreement, and collective bargaining.
This is a blatant effort to eliminate employees legal rights and protections.
In my opinion, Mrs. Roby and the exceeding majority of her GOP cohorts are radicals who are Hell-bent upon destroying every hard-gained law that protects American employees from abuses by their employers. It wouldn't surprise me to continue to see efforts to whittle away at Labor Laws, including those forbidding Child Labor. This is such a shocking development that I am incensed beyond imagination. It would not surprise me in the least to continue seeing such efforts by Republicans to chip away at Employees Rights, up to and including prohibitions on Child Labor.
Ideologically, of course, the action proposed by this bill is in keeping with the radicalized wing of the GOP, which has been hijacked and co-opted by the TEA Party movement, which is nothing more than a thinly disguised Libertarian in Republican's clothes. Those are the types who also align themselves with the Utopian, ivory-towered, theoretical visions of the Mises Institute, which is headquartered in Auburn, Alabama. For those who may not be aware, the Mises Institute teaches that government should not exist, but that instead of government, free enterprise should rule mankind. Their theoretical vision for “free markets” cannot work, because it supposes a perfect world.
Concerning H.R. 1406 introduced by Mrs. Roby, it is also a hypocritical bill, because “compensatory time could be provided only in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement or with the consent of affected employees,” and as is well known, Republicans are at increasing odds with Labor Unions and Organized Labor, and continue seeking to enact laws that strip away protections granted by collective bargaining agreements, which themselves are virtually non-existent in so-called “Right to Work” states, which in large part are in the Southeast. The term itself – Right to Work – is a misnomer, because in those states, an employee has NO RIGHT to work, and can be fired for any reason. Your hair is curly? You're fired. Your eyes are blue? You're fired. The “Right to Work” states are also called “Employment At Will” states, which is an attempt at “rebranding” the issue, as if it empowers the employee, when in fact, it does not.
Philosophically, H.R. 1406 is an effort to return to the “bad old days” in which deaths in unsafe working conditions were common throughout the United States; in which Child Labor was common; in which employers did not have to pay their employees any wages, and often changed their rates of pay – to reduce it – without the employees' knowledge or consent, and more.
It is, in essence, very much like the story told in the Exodus account, in which the Hebrew children suffered oppression in their labors at the hands of Pharaoh, who at last, told them that they were to “make more bricks, but could not use hay.” And surprisingly, it's not a new message. Today, we say “Do more with less.” In that historical narrative, in return, Moses delivered a message to Pharaoh from the Almighty to “Let my people go.”
In the modern scenario, people are already not being paid enough to survive, CEO's, BIG BUSINESS and the über-wealthy are paying lobbyists to curry favor with Congress to lower tax rates upon the very wealthy or eliminate corporate income tax, and like modern-day pirates, they hide their vast accumulated wealth in tropical island paradise tax havens such as the Antilles, Bermuda, Caymans, Seychelles and more. It's theft by deception, pure and simple.
In turn, government oppresses the employees by making or eliminating laws that would empower or favor employees over the denizen hoards of corporate lawyers protecting their Big Business employers, and they're made to believe they're free, but that somehow, when the weak are made strong, it is the “liberal Democrats” and Nancy Pelosi who are behind every effort to undermine their way of life.
Martha Roby's bill – H.R. 1406 – would render employees powerless against their employers who in turn could legally refuse to pay them for mandatory overtime. Don't like those terms? Don't like working here? Tough. You're free to leave. After all, this is an “employment at will state.”
Is this the scenario you want for yourself or your children?
What do you think?

Addendum, Saturday, 23 November 2013
It's GREAT to read the vigorous discussion in this thread!
There are jobs where such “comp time” is a regular part of the compensation package, and given IN ADDITION TO overtime, regular time, and vacation time. In some, but not all, cases, if the comp time is not used in a given period – such as in a year – the time is lost, and the employee is paid for all unused time. In other scenarios, comp time may be accrued without limit. In the better scenarios where comp time is an ADDITIONAL PART of the total compensation package, comp time is paid out completely when an employee leaves the company. But not all states require that to be done.
Rep. Roby's bill would supplant, i.e. completely REPLACE the legal requirement to pay time-and-a-half for overtime with CTO – Compensatory Time Off.
Here's the Office of Personnel Managment's website on Comp Time for federal employees.

Obamacare and You The Rollout of the Affordable Care Act
Oct. 30: This post has been updated to reflect quotes from video of today's hearing.
Most-often mentioned state at today's House committee grilling of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius? So far, it's the secretary's home state of Kansas.
“Madam Secretary, while you're from Kansas, we're not in Kansas anymore. Some might say that we are actually in the Wizard of Oz land,” Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said to Sebelius during one contentious exchange about her agency's troubled rollout of Healthcare.gov.
Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., retorted: “I know we're not in Kansas, but I do believe increasingly we're in Oz because of what I see here.”
So, how is this all playing in Kansas?
We decided to check in with the state's insurance commissioner, Sandy Praeger. Her state has forcefully decided not to take part in the Affordable Care Act, but Praeger, a Republican, has voiced support for health-care reform.
Praeger succeeded Sebelius as commissioner in 2003 when Sebelius became the state's governor. Praeger is a past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and chairs the group's health committee.
Here are highlights of our interview, edited for clarity and length.
Q. How do you think the rollout of the health insurance marketplaces is going? Is the media overhyping the problems?
A. Not very well. I think it's just been unfortunate. It seems like from what I'm hearing that some of the last-minute changes that were requested by the administration have caused some of the problems, forcing people to sign up [for accounts on Healthcare.gov] and put their personal information in before they could shop. It's been pretty rocky.
Q. Do you think they can be fixed in time for consumers to enroll in coverage beginning Jan. 1?
A. The Affordable Care Act does not depend entirely on the [Healthcare.gov] marketplace. All of the provisions are still there and people can still go to an agent and use a call center and sign up even though the federal exchange [has had problems]. I think there are still other ways for people to get signed up. It's not as convenient as it was supposed to have been. That part of it is really problematic and hopefully it will get fixed so that people can get signed up by the first of the year.
Q. Have you spoken to insurance companies in your state about how it's going?
A. They are getting enrollees, but they have not yet been willing to release numbers. It's a competitive thing. They don't want to look bad compared to their competitors. Especially during the open enrollment period they want people to sign up for their plan. If it looks like the other company is getting more enrollees, that could affect their marketing. Hopefully HHS is going to release [enrollment] numbers sometime in November.
Q. Is this a tale of a divided country in terms of success and failure? The 14 states that have chosen to run their own exchanges have seen reasonable success, while the 36 that left it to the federal government are most affected by Healthcare.gov's problems.
A. I think it's a clear example of how the law was intended. The states that are running their own exchanges — while there have been some technical glitches, which is going to happen with any new computer system rollout — it's much easier to fix it at the state level. You don't have as many people to deal with. You have state specific information. When conservative states pulled back and said, ‘We're not going to do it,' the reason for doing it is that they didn't want the law to succeed. And this is a way of creating an impediment.
Think of the complexity of [the federal government] creating something for citizens in 36 states with different health plans. [If those states chose to run their own exchanges,] it would have been a smoother rollout, I think, based on the evidence we've seen with the states that have their own exchanges. While it has not been perfect, those states are moving ahead and getting enrollees. I think it is a case of a tale of two systems.
Q. Are you surprised that in some states, the number of people enrolling in the Medicaid expansion far outnumbers those signing up for private plans?
A. No not at all. The way the [marketplace] website is designed, if you're eligible based on income for Medicaid, you're immediately moved over to the Medicaid program, where the enrollment is much easier. If you're going on the exchange to buy private insurance, you have to go through the process, you have to decide which one [plan] do I want. There are a lot more decisions that the individual has to make vs. Medicaid. If you're put in the Medicaid program, those decisions are part of the Medicaid program. It's much less complicated. In some states, it's a huge expansion. In states like ours, where we didn't expand [Medicaid], there's very little eligibility.
Q. What advice would you give HHS to make the rollout smoother?
A. That's tough. If the website is not going to be functioning in time to get people enrolled, then they really need to add more call centers and they need to beef up the call centers, and they need to increase the education and outreach efforts to let people know this is what you need to do.
Q. What about consumers. What advice would you give them?
A. I really recommend that they work with either an insurance agent or one of the navigators to understand the diff in the plans. Don't just look for the lowest premium but look for coverage that's going to be comprehensive enough to meet your needs. Low premiums can mean higher out-of-pocket costs. That's a big decision. If it's someone that knows they have health conditions, they should probably go for one that has a higher premium and then has lower out-of-pocket costs. The out-of-pocket costs are capped, but for an individual it's a little bit over $6,000 and for a family $12,500. There's still some significant out-of-pocket costs before the health plan covers everything.
I think I've heard somebody say this is not like a rock concert. The tickets are not going to sell out. You don't have to do it right now. Famous last words. They can at least see what they'd be eligible for by going to our website and putting in basic family information and income information and it will tell them what the premium would be.
A reply to Kevin Meagher
KuZenithFlemoir Blocked Unblock Follow May 11, 2016
A stooshie kicked off today in the small and shadowy enclave of the world that is Scottish Labour twitter. The reason for anger was this article by Kevin Meagher on ‘Labour Uncut' entitled Why aren't we furious with the Scottish party?
Let me state at the outset, that there are a number of underlying important points made in this article. I agree with them many of them to some extent, and indeed mI have written about in the past. I do not think we have developed a textured or nuanced enough response to Scottish Nationalism. I do not think that we have been positive or visionary enough in the way we do politics for a long time.
I have some serious issues though with the hyperbolic and inflammatory language used, and many of the underlying assumptions the article rests on.
“How did it come to this? How did Labour ‘lose' Scotland and by doing so, make it improbable the party will win a general election any time before the advent of commercial space travel?”
I'm not sure whether this is the writer's intention or not, but his wording is consistent with a frustrating dynamic for Labour activists in Scotland. Scottish politics does not, and did not exist to send the UK party fifty or so MPs to sit in the Commons. The Scottish Parliament controls our schools, and our hospitals . It impacts on economic development and oversees cultural policy. It matters. Without unfairly misrepresenting Mr Meagher, there is no sense of regret here that we lack Labour representation in these areas, just that we've let the side down in getting in some bodies to the Strangers' Bar. If Scottish Labour has sometimes been chippy with colleagues down South, and it has, then one of the reasons might be that there was no real interest in the distinct political culture and institutions emerging in Scotland.
‘And why aren't we angrier with the bunglers in the Scottish party who frittered away Labour's position?'
Scottish Labour politicians and staffers have made mistakes in the past. Sure. They aren't the only ones. Should we have been taking notes when the Ed Stone was unveiled? Should we have had tartan buses after the success of the pink ones?
We've been too negative, yes. I don't remember many UK Labour politicians however, making the hairs stand up on the back of my neck while their oratory sought for the sunny uplands. The article reads as if Scottish Labour is an autonomous organisation North of the Wall, which has resisted the sensible entreaties of the enlightened sages from Kings Landing imploring us to improve. Remember, the dynamics of Scottish Labour have been impacted by the dynamics of the UK Labour Party. In a direct sense, in 2007, many of the staffers who helped run that campaign were sent up from London. They had a hand in what was ultimately a defeat.
Moreover, the accusation has been made that Scottish Labour was run as the personal fiefdom of Gordon Brown for many years. We can debate how accurate that actually was, but it certainly has some truth. This was one of the consequences of the Shakespearean psycho-drama between Brown and Blair. Many talented people didn't run for the Scottish Parliament under Scottish Labour for many years, yes. Yet the systems that have encouraged and funnelled talent have been dictated by decisions in London as much as Glasgow.
We have been too angry. We have been too negative. Yet this is a blog that attempts to address that by being angry and negative.
Let's take this line “… the steaming turd that is the Scottish Labour party.”
This isn't incisive analysis. This is just mean spirited. Let us remember what has happened last week. Scottish Parliament researchers lost their jobs last week. Activists gave up weeks, if not months of their time, and they got hammered. They deserve better than an article that doesn't read like a rousing call to action, or even a well intentioned wake-up call, but a screed of indulgent sniping.
And let's answer the final the blog's titular question? “Why aren't we furious with the Scottish party?”
Who is the “we” here? I thought we were a UK wide collectivist party build on the principles of solidarity. Or is this the Labour political equivalent of Andy Murray — UK Labour when we win, but Scottish Labour when we lose? The reality is that Scottish Labour has made lots of mistakes, but they are not unique, they are ones that have been repeated across the UK. Labour politics has failures, but these ultimately are shared failures.
And nobody should be furious, because it will achieve nothing. The ultimate tragedy of this blog is its futility. It is interesting that Labour Uncut, a website that reminds us that if we want to reach out to voters and persuade them, then demonising and insulting them probably won't help. Whether the process is reaching out to a floating Tory voter, or a fellow party member, insulting them is not the best way to illicit a positive response.
I want Scottish Labour to succeed again. I do want us to be a party filled with “fiery, confident, visionary, and, above all, optimistic leaders…people who believe in something, can clearly articulate it, fight for it and galvanise people behind them.” Yet the fuel on which we build the fire of such a movement cannot be simmering sectarian resentment. If we want to sound hopeful in our politics, hopeful about what Scotland and the UK can be, then we must remain hopeful about each other. Anger and bitterness will get us nowhere.
I think it is important that evidently smart and motivated people like Mr Meagher join the conversation about what Scottish Labour does next. But that discourse has to be rooted in the understanding that the Scottish electorate is never going to believe in us again, if we have so clearly and vocally stopped believing in each other.
Mr Meagher, don't bitch, organise.
Tommy Chong said he was insulted after the Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE campaign dropped him as a speaker.
The comedian and pot advocate said he was scheduled to introduce the Vermont senator at a Los Angeles rally, and was dropped just hours before it was to take place.
"It's lip service to get the votes, but they don't want to endorse what I stand for and what I've stood for all my professional career," Chong told The Hollywood Reporter after he was uninvited from the rally.

"It was an insult."
The Sanders campaign said in an email they appreciated Chong's support, but a "scheduling issue came up."
Chong, who endorsed Sanders earlier this year, blamed his advocacy for marijuana for the incident.
He expressed regret for a video endorsement in which he praised Sanders for supporting the legalization of marijuana.
"Now I'm going to look like a fool, like one of those guys who start bragging about something that isn't true," he said.
"And I don't like that because my endorsement means a lot because of what I have gone through and what the whole [marijuana] culture has gone through."
Chong tweeted about being uninvited from the campaign appearance on Monday.
"Unfortunately, after months of support and endorsement videos, I have to report that @BernieSanders pulled away his invite to me," he tweeted Monday.

He later tweeted that he heard there was a scheduling conflict with the Sanders campaign and planned to continue his support of the candidate.

Champions League matches could be played at weekends from 2021.
The idea is one of several being discussed by European governing body Uefa as it looks to maximise interest in its flagship club competition.
Change to the Champions League schedule would not happen for at least five years because of broadcasting cycles.
"We are in constant dialogue with all stakeholders and any decisions will be taken in agreement with them," said a Uefa spokesman.
"It is far too early to speculate about changes to the formats of our club competitions."
The Champions League, previously known as the European Cup, has been played as a midweek competition since 1968.
Its final was played in midweek until 2010 but now takes place on a Saturday.
Weekend games could be staged at times more suited to the television audience in the Far East but would require changes to domestic schedules.

The Dodgers have officially struck a deal with free agent righty Brandon Beachy, as first reported by Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports (Twitter link). The ICON Sports Management client will receive a $1.5MM guarantee, per the report, and can reach $4.25MM through incentives.
Beachy, 29, reached the majors only briefly last year with Los Angeles as he worked back from consecutive Tommy John surgeries. In his 48 2/3 Triple-A frames, which included ten starts, Beachy worked to a 3.51 ERA with 6.8 K/9 against 4.1 BB/9.
Before that, of course, Beachy had looked like a solid young rotation piece with the Braves. Over the 2010 through 2013 campaigns, he worked to a 3.23 ERA with 9.2 K.9 against 2.9 BB/9 across 267 2/3 innings in that span.
While the Dodgers did not receive a significant major league contribution from Beachy last year, the club obviously saw enough to motivate a return. And given that he was able to achieve a major league deal despite a less-than-complete comeback, it appears that some other clubs also saw some room to expect bigger things in 2016.
Jon Heyman (Twitter links) and SB Nation's Chris Cotillo (Twitter link) provided details of the incentives clause.
Amy Mather is thirteen years old. She made a presentation at last week's Raspberry Jamboree in Manchester, where she explains how she got into programming and why she loves it: “I wanted to make it do what I wanted it to do, not what the people working at Apple or Android wanted it to do”. Amy walks us through Conway's Game of Life, which she ends up building…well, I won't spoil it for you. Watch this one all the way through; it's worth it.
In the week since the Jamboree, I think I've had more emails about Amy's presentation than about anything else – people have wanted to know when the video will be ready (word about this excellent presentation spread very fast on Twitter), and to congratulate Amy.
I'm very struck by the number of different organisations that have been supporting Amy; Codecademy, Young Rewired State, the Raspberry Jams and Manchester Girl Geeks have all helped her on her journey. If you want to see more kids like Amy, there's something you can do: support these organisations by volunteering or donating. We can't expect schools to do it all for us; the wider engineering community has, we believe, a responsibility to give kids like Amy all the opportunities to learn she can get her crocodile clips on. The Raspberry Pi is all about putting opportunities in the way of kids, so they have a chance to discover, like Amy, something new that they can quickly become skilled at, and that they love doing.
Alan O'Donohoe, who organises the Jams with the energy of a toddler with a coffee machine, has blogged more about the day on the Raspberry Jams site. Well done Amy – and thanks Alan!
Lowest-graded player at every position in NFL Week 10
By Bryson Vesnaver • Nov 15, 2016
Another week gone by, another sampling of performances to judge. While we saw some pretty incredible outings by some top-notch players, we also saw some less-than-stellar performances from others. Every week, we highlight the lowest-graded players at every position; this week's roster is topped by Bears QB Jay Cutler.
Quarterback: Jay Cutler, Chicago Bears, 26.6
Cutler's stats were boosted by a fluke Hail Mary touchdown, but otherwise he was very underwhelming on Sunday. Take away that throw, and he was just 15-of-29 for 132 yards and two interceptions. When Cutler was under pressure, he completed under 50 percent of his throws and had a QB rating of 61.2—which was actually better than his rating of 51.6 when the heat wasn't on.
Running back: Isaiah Crowell, Cleveland Browns, 43.6
Crowell was very lackluster in his performance for the Browns, managing to gain just 23 yards on nine carries. Even more telling was that he gained a mere 7 yards after contact on those rushes, and failed to force a single missed tackle.
Wide receiver: J.J. Nelson, Arizona Cardinals, 38.2
This was a game to forget for Nelson, who turned six targets into just two catches for 29 yards. Only six of those yards came after the catch; he also dropped a pass and fumbled once.
Wide receiver: Michael Thomas, New Orleans Saints, 39.7
Thomas caught four passes for 40 yards for the Saints, which doesn't seem too bad. But he had a dropped pass, and fumbled twice. Not the ball-security day he was hoping for.
Slot receiver: Albert Wilson, Kansas City Chiefs, 44.5
Wilson played out of the slot, as he usually does, and failed to make much of an impact. He caught four-of-seven passes for just 25 yards on the day. He also had a big drop.
Tight end: Will Tye, New York Giants, 34.8
Tye was relatively average when it came to the receiving game, catching five balls for 53 yards with a dropped pass. But it was his 26.6 run-blocking grade that did him in, as he continued to play a big role in the Giants' run-game struggles.
Left tackle: Dennis Kelly, Tennessee Titans, 33.6
Kelly had a tough time in the run game for the Titans, which is surprising, considering that they rushed for 164 yards on 30 carries. Kelly, however, allowed a couple of run stops, and also surrendered a few QB pressures when pass blocking.
Left guard: Caleb Benenoch, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 32.7
Benenoch struggled both in pass protection and when run blocking. He surrendered a sack, a hit, and three hurries against the pass-rush. In the run game, he managed to surrender up five solo run stops.
Center: Jeremy Zuttah, Baltimore Ravens, 40.1
Zuttah allowed just two QB hurries, but also was beaten a few more times in pass protection. He also struggled to establish holes in the middle of the line for the Ravens' run game.
Right guard: Chris Chester, Atlanta Falcons, 37.3
While Chester wasn't great when it came to run blocking, most of his problems came in the passing game. He gave up two hits and five hurries, as well as a couple of other plays where he was beaten.
Right tackle: Donald Stephenson, Denver Broncos, 30.9
A mainstay on this list, Stephenson struggled yet again, allowing two hits and four hurries while pass blocking. He also gave up a couple of run stops.
Week 10 defense
Edge defender: Muhammed Wilkerson, New York Jets, 36.0
After a very dominant four-year run, it's tough seeing Wilkerson struggle like he has this season (44.4 overall grade through Week 10). But he managed just one hit when rushing the passer, and wasn't any better in the run game. Wilkerson's run-defense grade of 29.3 highlights how easily he was blocked out of his gaps.
Interior defender: Sheldon Rankins, New Orleans Saints, 36.5
Rankins failed to clog up the run lanes like the Saints would've liked him to on Sunday, and was constantly removed from his gap. Denver failed to really take advantage, but it could've been much worse, as the rookie managed to make only one solo stop.
Interior defender: Ahtyba Rubin, Seattle Seahawks, 39.0
Rubin also had a tough time in the run game; he failed to make any run stop, and was often sealed out of his gaps, allowing the Patriots to have success when they ran the ball in his direction.
Edge defender: Cliff Avril, Seattle Seahawks, 37.6
It was surprising to see Avril on this list, as he's been having a solid season. But his pass-rush line consisted of just two hurries. His run defense? Not much better, as he failed to make a single stop and was often sealed off the edge.
Linebacker: Karlos Dansby, Cincinnati Bengals, 30.7
Dansby was asked to cover a lot in Monday night's game, and finished with a very low 27.9 coverage grade. He surrendered five catches for 40 yards, but almost all of them went for first downs.
Linebacker: Chad Greenway, Minnesota Vikings, 31.8
Greenway wasn't great in coverage, allowing four catches on five targets for 33 yards. But he really had a tough time in the run game, rarely making an impact. Greenway missed as many tackles as he made (two).
Cornerback: Logan Ryan, New England Patriots, 29.8
Tough sledding for Ryan, who was targeted frequently against the Seahawks—11 times actually, allowing six catches for 101 yards and a touchdown. On a few of those incompletions, he wasn't exactly playing tight coverage, either.
Cornerback: Marcus Cooper, Arizona Cardinals, 31.3
Cooper gave up just four catches on five targets for 51 yards. All of those went for first downs, however. He also missed two tackles while in coverage.
Slot corner: Bobby McCain, Miami Dolphins, 28.8
McCain's raw numbers don't look awful: three catches surrendered on three targets for 47 yards. But those were all first downs, and he also earned three coverage penalties, as well as a facemask. Not a great day for the slot corner.
Safety: Kenny Vaccaro, New Orleans Saints, 33.3
Vaccaro had a game to forget in both run and pass defense. While he had an interception, he also surrendered five catches for 62 yards. In the run game, he made just one stop and was not great at coming up in support.
Safety: Dwight Lowery, San Diego Chargers, 33.5
Lowery was in a similar boat to Vaccaro. He struggled in pass defense, giving up three catches on the three targets he saw as the primary coverage man for 54 yards and a touchdown. But in the run game, he missed two tackles and failed to bring the support necessary from the safety position.
Week 10 special teams
Punter: Brad Nortman, Jacksonville Jaguars
Nortman punted just three times, averaging a measly 38.3 yards per punt. One was a touchback, one landed out of bounds, and one was returned for 57 yards, leading to a 12.7 net yard average.
Kicker: Blair Walsh, Minnesota Vikings
This might be adding insult to injury with Walsh's release from the Vikings today, but on a solid day for kickers, he missed an extra point yet again.
Kick returner: Jakeem Grant, Miami Dolphins
Grant muffed two kicks—not much more to say than that.

WATE 6 On Your Side staff - KNOXVILLE (WATE) - Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero is exploring the possibility of the city becoming the next test site for connected and self-driving vehicles.
"We may have a unique opportunity to build a new industry right here in Knoxville led by companies like Grindsmart," said Mayor Rogero in a statement. "While this is just a discussion, we'll have the right people in the room to consider the viability of this opportunity."
Gridsmart Founder and CEO Bill Malkes says the company's intersection cameras could one day be used with self-driving cars.
"They'll help the cars that are autonomous and have this technology be able to communicate and interface with cars who are still legacy and don't have that," said Malkes.
Right now the technology can be used with connected vehicles.
"In between autonomous vehicles and where we are today, there's going to be connected vehicles and that's where the vehicles talk to one another and talk to the infrastructure," said Malkes. "We're part of that infrastructure."
Malke says Rogero will meet with a group of America's transportation leaders at INTERSECT, an annual high-tech transportation program held at the world headquarters of GRINDSMART Technologies, Inc. in Knoxville.The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at 12:30 p.m.
Several cities including Ann Arbor, Michigan; Contra Costa, California; and Tampa, Florida, have already established test beds on both public and private roads.

In a new interview, Star Trek Beyond star John Cho reveals that a kiss between his character Sulu, and Sulu's husband was left on the cutting room's floor.
“It wasn't like a make-out session. We're [Sulu and his husband] at the airport with our daughter. It was a welcome-home kiss,” Cho told Vulture. “I'm actually proud of that scene, because it was pretty tough. We're two straight guys and had to get to a very loving, intimate place. It was hard to do on the fly. We had to open up. It came off well, in my view.”
Brendon Thorne/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures
Cho also reveals that in the film, his husband is played by Doug Jung, the screenwriter of the movie. The reason Jung was cast was because it was hard to find an Asian actor willing to play gay:
We were in Vancouver first and we finished up the production in Dubai and that scene was in Dubai and I was like, “Hey, so who'd you get?” They were like, “We can't find anybody! Doug may have to play him!” It started out as a joke. I was like, “Haha.” And then at some point they were not joking. We definitely had trouble finding East Asians first off, and then actors willing to play gay. We had a guy and then his parents really objected. Basically, we couldn't find an Asian actor willing to play gay in Dubai is my understanding.
Sulu having an Asian husband was something Cho pushed for himself:
Basically it was a little Valentine to the gay Asian friends that I grew up with. This may be presumptuous, but I always felt the Asian gay men that I knew had much heavier cultural-shame issues. This is probably more so for my generation than for yours, but I felt like those guys didn't date Asian men because of that cultural shame. So I wanted it to seem really normal in the future. I thought that would be the most normal thing, that there was zero shame in the future. I don't know if that hit or not, but it was something that I felt in my gut and asked for that.
Cho wanted Sulu's husband to be Asian, knowing that it's still rare to see two Asian men together as an on-screen couple. “There was something about this pairing that would seem very old-fashioned, and then something about it to gay men that would be radical.”

Essays
Jennifer Hornsby on the UK and French elections.
It's easy nowadays to wonder quite what democracy means. Thinking together about the result (to date) of the French Presidential election and the prospects of the forthcoming U.K. general election draws attention to the undemocratic character of our own electoral system.
Ahead of the French election, we were told how very unpredictable it was. But given the steady polls for the last six weeks, a bet on Macron and LePen seemed very safe even if a surprise wasn't out of the question. What was remarkable about this election was not its unpredictability, but the fact that neither of the top two candidates comes from either of France's two major parties. Imagine being told that after our election, we'll have a Prime Minister who's neither Labour nor Conservative.
Of course the French and U.K. systems are very different. We don't elect our head of state: if the Queen has any authority, it isn't derived from us, her subjects. (We've come to call ourselves citizens, it's true, and we even know what our citizen rights are – at least until we leave the E.U.) But what has ensured the present stark contrast between France and us is not just the difference between their (semi) Presidential system and our (mitigated) monarchy, but the fact of our first past the post system in Parliamentary elections. It has kept the two-party system in place. And it has ensured that an election can easily turn into a media-led popularity contest between the leaders of the two main parties. It also makes for wildly disproportionate representation, so that in the last 20 years, save for Labour's triumphant 43% in 1997 – netting them two thirds of MPs – neither of the two parties has got as much as 40% of votes cast.
The referendum, however, was different. In this case, one side got 52%. It remains to be seen exactly what they may have been voting for. But we're told the will of the people was revealed. And now we're to have another election. It's not a re-run of the referendum of course, simply the Prime Minister's means of shoring up the referendum result. May finds the opposition she faces in Parliament regrettable, so that she now “seeks our support for her decisions”. Differently put: she hopes to exploit the system. If Tories across the nation get 48% of the votes, which is what Remainers got in the referendum, then it'll be a Tory landslide in the Commons, after which it can be the will of May, not of the people.
It would have been amusing if Labour had voted against an early election and followed it up with a Commons vote “That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government”. Only a simple majority would have been needed, and Tories would have had to vote in favour. Why shouldn't they? May had made it plain that she lacked confidence in her power to govern. Perhaps such a vote would have been better than amusing. Perhaps it would have drawn attention to the power grab which May intends, and which, thanks to our undemocratic electoral system, is probably in a position to pull off.

Here is more evidence to illustrate how belief-systems can utterly screw up and skew the human mind …
WARREN, MI (WDIV/CNN) – A Michigan man shot and killed his stepdaughter because he felt she was not honoring her Muslim religion, according to police.
Rahim Alfetlawi told investigators that he shot Jessica Mokdad in the head Saturday, because he was upset about her new lifestyle.
“He indicated he wanted her back in Minnesota, so she could [practice] a more conservative lifestyle,” said Det. Cpl. Stephen Mills, with the Warren Police Department.
Alfetlawi allegedly left his home in Minnesota on Friday and stopped in Grand Blanc, MI, where Mokdad had been living with her biological father. But he was not able to find her.
“She wasn't wearing a scarf anymore and was becoming more Westernized, more American,” Mills said.
Maybe the super secret club that all the Arsenal greats created has a secret agenda to keep downplaying Olivier Giroud in the hopes that it fires him up. First Thierry Henry, now Martin Keown – nobody thinks Olivier Giroud can take Arsenal to the promised land.
They are wrong.
If there is one thing Olivier Giroud does well, it is score goals. He may flounder an opportunity or two, but who doesn't? RVP does, Messi does, Ibrahimovic does; people miss chances, that is what makes them people.
“I'm not sure he is up there with some of the greats that have played in the past. [A world-class striker] would take Arsenal to the next level and it would galvanise the group. It raises the bar, the rest of the group become more competitive, and there is real competition for places,” Keown all-knowingly stated via the Express.
Having always been a fan of Keown, it makes it tough to criticize his criticism but what was he thinking? He has joined the masses out there that A. don't see how valuable Olivier Giroud is to this attack, B. think that there are tons of world class strikers available and C. take everything out on Giroud.
Olivier Giroud is coming up on his 100th appearance for Arsenal. In his first 99 EPL appearances he has netted 42 goals. Only Thiery Henry (59), Ian Wright (56) and the all-popular Emmanuel Adebayor (44) scored more in their first 100 appearances, via the Independent.
RELATED: Is Giroud misjudged by Arsenal?
What do you want a striker to do? If you answered anything other than ‘score goals' then there is something wrong. Well guess what, Keown, only three guys in the history of Arsenal, the vast, vast history of Arsenal, have scored more goals for the club than Olivier Giroud through their first 100 games. Something about that little fact screams “he is enough,” maybe even that “he is great.”
The only relevant point Keown made was that Arsenal need some competition at the striker spot, but that does not have to come from external signings. That can just as easily and more desirably come from Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck. Walcott has proven that he can be class at the striker position and with his new contract in hand, it is time that he comes out and shows it.
Danny Welbeck, too, has a ton to prove and he needs to start doing so. Once he returns from injury, I would not be surprised to see a transformed Welbeck, after all, it has been the case in the past that a player returns from injury at Arsenal with inspired form.
The point is that Keown is lashing out at the wrong striker. Olivier Giroud is doing his job – he is scoring goals. That is all you should want and need from a striker. Flashy moves and cute tricks are fun to watch but seeing the back of the net bulge briefly is much more beautiful and that is the only trick Olivier Giroud needs.
The only Arsenal great that seems to have hit the nail on the head is Ian Wright, who said back in May (via ESPNFC):
“I love him [Giroud]. He is a fantastic player. He doesn't get a lot of credit and even Thierry [Henry] is saying that we won't win the league with him which is very unfair, because it's the players you have around you that helps to win games. It's not just the one player up front. One player up front cannot win you the league anywhere and that is why you need the team to help you. When you are averaging double-digit goals every season and you got help around you, then you should be able to do enough to win the league.”
Cheers to Ian Wright for doing the unpopular thing and standing up for a player that deserves it.
The only negative thing that can be said about Giroud is that he hit a cold streak at the end of last year. But again, who doesn't hit cold streaks? In the 1998/99 season, Dennis Bergkamp did not score until October 4th. If Olivier Giroud did not score in a season until October 4th, he would be tarred, feathered and run out of town.
What Arsenal have in Olivier Giroud is a proven goalscorer with the ability to link up play. His passing ability is tremendously underrated. Here, even Giroud deserves a montage:
There you have it, if you want a striker with tricks, flicks and flips, Olivier Giroud has those too.
The Frenchman has increased his overall goal tally in each year and if he keeps up the pace he is on, he will work his way into some elite company in terms of scoring goals at Arsenal. Assuming he can keep up this pace for the next few years, he could very easily notch another 90 goals for the club and put himself in the top ten all-time Arsenal goal scorers, and he had a very late start to his Arsenal career, very similar to Bergkamp.
Olivier Giroud is going to keep scoring goals for Arsenal and chances are he is going to keep getting undervalued. Obviously Karim Benzema would be a welcome addition, but no matter how much you want a guy, if his club will not sell, they will not sell. Again, Wenger's supermarket analogy is spot on. It is not like Arsenal can just waltz into a market, find the world-class strikers in aisle 9 and ring a few up. That is not how it works.
Giroud is world class at scoring goals. If you want world class in pace or dribbling, then you can find it in Alexis.
Editor's Note: The following is a guest post written by Jon Wellinghoff and James Tong. Wellinghoff is the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is currently a partner at law firm Stoel Rives LLP. Tong is the vice president of strategy and government affairs for Clean Power Finance, a financial services and software firm in the residential solar market. This article is the first in a series from Tong and Wellinghoff looking at issues surrounding utilities, distributed energy resources, and the grid. Tong and Wellinghoff's joint proposal to create an independent distribution system operator was covered in Utility Dive here.
Correction: A previous version of this post said a report by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) found that net energy metering (NEM) customers in the state were paying 106% of the full cost of service. The report was, in fact, a draft. The final report found California NEM customers were paying 103% of the full cost of service.
Public discussion on net energy metering (NEM) has gone from heated to downright nasty. It started as an arcane and seemingly innocuous policy: solar customers get a one-for-one bill credit from their utility for each kWh they produce and send to the grid. NEM has become a full-blown wedge issue.
Critics assert NEM customers use the grid but do not pay their fair share of the costs. They say that NEM shifts grid costs to non-solar ratepayers, especially lower-income households and minorities. They invoke phrases such as “regressive tax”, “reverse Robin Hood,” or even “robbin' the hood,” to suggest that solar customers – purportedly far wealthier and whiter – are getting a free ride at everyone else's expense.
“Nonsense,” reply NEM advocates. “NEM critics don't care about ratepayer fairness – they care about protecting profits and monopolies for utilities that have never faced competition.” They contend that, far from shifting costs, NEM customers create net value to the grid and all grid users. One only need to look to a study commissioned by the neutral Nevada Public Utility Commission that shows NEM customers provide a net present value benefit of $36M to non-NEM customers in Nevada.
However, both arguments miss the point. That is because both use “cost-shifting” and “not paying the fair share” interchangeably. This understanding is wrong – critically wrong. And it is resulting in needlessly fractious debates and bad policies, including arbitrary fixed fees on solar customers.
A telling example: In 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) published a study that projected a cost shift of $1.1 billion per year by 2020 due to NEM policy. NEM critics, including the American Legislative Council (ALEC), Americans for Prosperity, and even some academics cited the study as proof that NEM customers were not paying their fair share. So they pushed harder for fixed fees for NEM customers, a policy that various states, including Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas, and Oklahoma, have since either explored or enacted.
But critics (as well as NEM advocates) overlooked that the same CPUC report also found that NEM customers as a whole “appear to be paying slightly more than their full cost of service” – 103% of their costs, to be precise. In other words, NEM customers were not zeroing out their bills and “free-riding:” on average, they were paying more to utilities in fixed-cost recovery than non-NEM customers.
Why do so many policy wonks on both sides consistently conflate cost-shifting with not paying one's fair share? It could be that explaining these concepts is difficult and doesn't make for good sound bites. Or it could be that few people understand the arcane subject of utility rate design or are willing to admit that the prevailing utility regulatory model is highly redistributive to begin with.
According to the CPUC study, before going solar, all NEM customers (commercial and residential) had paid 133% of their full cost of service. The residential segment alone paid 154% of its cost. By going solar, NEM customers were mitigating or reversing the subsidies they had traditionally been paying to support the grid. This is the crux of what is called cost-shifting.
Cost-shifting should not be ignored. But the focus on NEM customers dangerously obscures more critical problems with the utility model, namely slowing demand, escalating costs, and disruptive innovations. In such an environment, any technology that reduces sales of electrons will challenge traditional practices of cross-subsidization.
For example, the energy economist Catherine Wolfram estimates that adoption of LED lighting may shift costs as much as the adoption of distributed solar. Does this mean we should condemn LED users for cheating the system, or charge them fixed fees? Or should we fix the system in which the mere adoption of LED lighting can hurt the poor?
Vulnerable customer segments should not bear more cost when others adopt distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar or efficiency technologies. But all customers – not just solar or DER customers – need to address the potential equity issues that new technologies, however promising, may raise. The Regulatory Assistance Project's concept of a minimum bill – which utilities and solar advocates in Massachusetts had agreed to before getting stuck in the legislature – can ensure that all grid users pay their fair share. While imperfect (we advocate for more comprehensive reforms), the concept is more efficient and fairer than a sweeping fixed fee that singles out one technology with almost no regards of its benefits and costs to the grid.
The recent push for fixed fees is problematic for many reasons; for one, it does not rely on actual data or results, but rather on the faulty assumption that users of technologies that shift costs are necessarily not paying their fair share. This fallacy will handicap the deployment of all promising DERs, which, by virtue of being distributed, will necessarily create uneven benefits and costs. Even worse, it may ultimately harm those ratepayers that NEM critics are trying to protect.
Separate analyses from the Rocky Mountain Institute and Morgan Stanley show that grid defection will soon be economically viable, and that levying more fixed fees would accelerate defection. Even if “mass defection” is unlikely, defection by a small group will probably have an outsized impact. Utilities rely disproportionately on heavy users, who tend to be more affluent and thus more economically capable of going off-grid. If these users do start defecting en masse, then we really will have an unprecedented problem of cost-shifting from the “haves” to the “have-nots” – but we can't blame the “haves” for not paying their fair share for a grid they aren't using.
Let us hope that we never have to face this calamity to finally understand the distinction between cost-shifting and not paying one's fair share.
Back in April, the Hillary Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record, which is helmed by the former right-wing attack dog David Brock, announced that it would be spending $1 million to “engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram.” In other words, the political action committee would spend a cool million on paid internet trolls to pounce on anyone who dared to criticize their presidential candidate.
This announcement was part of a bigger story about the 2016 presidential election: the powerful and far-reaching presence the Bernie Sanders campaign has on social media, and the enthusiasm of young Sanders supporters online, many of whom have been labeled trolls, “Bernie Bros,” “BernieBots,” and — more egregiously — sexists and racists by Democratic partisans and the corporate media over the past year. Sanders has such a passionate online base that David Brock and the Clinton campaign felt it necessary not only to pay legitimate trolls to attack them, but to make bogus generalizations intended to discredit the entire movement.

Throughout the primary season, a narrative has formed — thanks in large part to an uncritical media's willingness to accept unsubstantiated reports (like chair-throwing and other violence in Nevada) — that Sanders supporters are a bunch of sexists, brutish, violent, and even racist white male trolls and serial harassers (the last charge, which has been exploited by influential journalists and establishment figures to evade any substantive criticisms, is perhaps the most troubling, for the very reason that it undermines people who are genuinely harassed online — which is a very real problem, especially for women and people of color).
Of course, there are indeed anti-Clinton/pro-Bernie trolls on social media — you'd be hard pressed to find any political movement that doesn't have its share of trolls and assholes, and anyone who thinks their side is troll-free is either naive or self-absorbed. As The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald recently put it on Twitter: “Self-centered people always think their own group is free of trolls because they're never targeted by them.”
Interestingly enough, polling data indicates that Clinton supporters have been more aggressive than Sanders supporters on social media and the internet, while — not surprisingly — Trump supporters have been the most aggressive by a long shot. A poll supported by Craigslist.com founder Craig Newmark found that 57 percent of Americans say Trump supporters are very aggressive and/or threatening online, 30 percent say the same for Clinton supporters, and 16 percent for Sanders supporters (while 68 percent say Sanders supporters are not that aggressive, 52 percent for Clinton supporters, and 30 percent for Trump supporters).
Unfortunately, “troll” and “harassment” have become terms that are now impulsively hurled by Democratic partisans at anyone who criticizes or disputes their opinion or a claim they've made, whether on social media or in a publication. Accusing someone of harassment — even when the person is making a valid argument (admittedly, sometimes substantive arguments can be made in a rude or condescending manner, but is being rude or impolite harassment?) — is an easy way to avoid their argument and discredit them in the future.
A few weeks ago, for instance, former Demos blogger Matt Bruenig (who was later fired for the incident after being rude to Center for American Progress president and Clinton confidant Neera Tanden) responded on Twitter to a column written by Joan Walsh in The Nation that made fairly ridiculous claims, including the declaration that the Sanders movement risked becoming an “angry white male cult” (is this not trolling itself?). Bruenig innocuously wrote that “It's really about old people versus young people, but you know that,” to which Walsh flatly replied: “Matt, you're becoming a troll.”
The things that pass for trolling these days!

Of course, Bruenig's “trollish” comment was factual: the most revealing demographic divisions between Sanders and Clinton have not been gender or race, a narrative that Democratic partisans and the media have pushed incessantly, but age and generational divides. According to a recent analysis from Tufts University, Sanders has now “surpassed Barack Obama's 2008 Democratic primary totals among young people in the 25 states where we can draw a comparison — whether you count by raw vote total or percentage of the overall vote share,” as reported by Jeff Stein on Vox. Sanders is beating Clinton by a whopping 71-to-28 margin among voters under 30. And even in states where Sanders lost to Clinton by significant margins, like North Carolina, the Senator still managed to take the youth vote.
One constant narrative throughout the primaries has been that Sanders just can't gain the support of women or people of color, and that his supporters are overwhelmingly white males who back him for the simple reason that he is a man (e.g. Walsh's “angry white male cult”). But again, this is complete hogwash. Sanders has actually done better with young women than young men — a USA Today poll taken in the midst of the primaries found that Millennial women backed “Sanders by a jaw-dropping 61%-30% while the divide among Millennial men is much closer, 48%-44%.” Similarly, while Clinton has dominated with African American voters overall, young black and Hispanic voters have a more favorable opinion of Sanders than Clinton, according to a Gallup survey from May. Indeed, Sanders is viewed even more favorably among black millennials than white millennials. The survey also found that Sanders is viewed more favorably among millennial women than millennial men, and that millennials were the most left-leaning generation.
This seems to validate the notion that the youngest generation is the most progressive generation and that they like Bernie Sanders because he's the most progressive candidate (I know, it's crazy that voters would support a politician because of his or her politics and ideas rather than his or her gender or ethnicity).
In the year leading up to the 2016 presidential campaign season, progressive Americans were eagerly awaiting and encouraging the consumer-advocating Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to announce a Democratic run for the presidency. Sanders was a beloved progressive gadfly who had been fighting for economic and social justice for several decades, but he was also a 74-year old Jewish democratic socialist. Warren was younger, she was a woman, and — perhaps most importantly — she didn't describe herself as a socialist. She was the obvious choice for progressives, and she was deemed infinitely more electable than Sanders.

Of course, Warren had no real desire to run for president. She is not a born politician (which is one of her best traits) and had only been in the Senate for a couple of years; besides, she has been extremely effective in Congress. Once it became clear that Warren wouldn't run, and once Sanders announced his own candidacy, many progressives and progressive advocacy groups who had been pushing for the Massachusetts Senator to challenge Clinton quickly began supporting the Vermont socialist. A group called Ready for Warren launched an initiative for Sanders called Ready to Fight, while progressive advocacy group Move On, which had been urging Warren to run, endorsed Sanders, as did Democracy for America. This further corroborates the claim that support for Sanders is broadly about his politics and ideas.
Roughly a year after launching her campaign, Hillary Clinton has now locked up the Democratic nomination. But her campaign and the DNC establishment have also done a great job at alienating young people and the left.
Partisans have been reluctant to acknowledge that a formidable progressive movement fueled by millennials could challenge the neoliberal status quo in the coming years, and have instead tried to tarnish the reputation of the entire Sanders movement. But Sanders isn't going to fight until the convention because of “sexism,” as Clintonites have started postulating, but because of politics and ideas; his entire campaign has been about combating “establishment politics” and “establishment economics,” which, unfortunately, Clinton epitomizes. Of course, partisans don't want to debate ideas or address inconvenient truths, like the party's close ties to Wall Street and corporate America. It's much easier to make generalizations and accuse everyone who disagrees with you of trolling or harassment.
Advertisement:
Until the Democratic establishment is ready to debate ideas, the Sanders movement and the left should keep the pressure on strong and avoid petty or personal attacks against the Democratic party or Hillary (needless to say, this does not include questioning Clinton's and the party's financial ties to corporate America and Wall Street). And the online Sanders/progressive community should police any trolls or provocateurs who help prop up the media/establishment's narrative.
As I noted above, every movement has trolls, and they should be shunned. The Sanders movement must be about ideas in the weeks to come, because real political change can only happen after the battle of ideas is won.
This database was created to help startups, investors and potential business partners navigate their way through this exploding startup scene
According to the European Commission, small and medium sized businesses created 85% of net new jobs in the EU between 2002 and 2010.
Finland has taken this lesson to heart. When Apple introduced the first smartphone in 2007, Nokia's fortunes plummeted. The country's largest private employer, which generated 4% of its GDP in 2000, went through round after round of layoffs.
“Steve Jobs took our jobs,” Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb quipped.
As a result, Finland's government has invested heavily in the country's startup scene, resulting in some major post-Nokia success stories such as billion dollar startups Rovio and Supercell.
And there's a lot more where they came from. Nokia's Bridge Program alone has created 1,000 startups.
In order to help startups, investors, and potential business partners navigate their way through Finland's exploding startup scene, and inspired by the Israeli crowd-source angels list created by Eden Shochat, we've created an open source document – a database, if you will – of Finnish angel investors, VC management firms and accelerators, along with their contact information and what kind of opportunities they're looking for.
The file is already up-to-date with names and contact details of over 50 investors who actively invest in Finnish startups.
Feel free to add, edit or comment. The idea is to crowdsource information for the benefit of the entire Finnish startup ecosystem. If you're not on the list and would like to add your name, feel free to do so. Also, if you're an investor and would like to amend your entry, please do. We hope this list will be useful to Finnish investors and startups as well as to individuals all over the world looking for an entry point into the Finnish market.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese government plans to begin claiming compensation from polluting companies and individuals, particularly those who damage state property, over the next two years, China's cabinet has said.
The State Council said on its website late on Thursday it would trial the policy in a few provinces before rolling it out nationwide in 2018. The plan would cover air, water and soil pollution, as well as damage to plants and animals.
China already allows government-registered environmental organizations that have been operating for at least five years to launch legal action against polluters.
High pollution levels have sparked widespread social unrest and become a major concern for China's leadership. Environmentalists say China's big polluters routinely exceed government emission limits.
China's capital Beijing suffered choking pollution this week, triggering an “orange” alert, the second-highest level, closing highways, halting or suspending construction and prompting a warning to residents to stay indoors.
That coincided with a meeting of world leaders in Paris to address climate change. China said after the meeting on Wednesday it would cut emissions of major pollutants in its power sector by 2020.
Here is a position-by-position look at who stays, who goes when the San Diego Chargers make their final cuts.
The Chargers still have a few players nursing injuries who will not be available when the team begins the regular season Sept. 13 against the Detroit Lions. Guard Johnnie Troutman isn't expected back from a broken right forearm until Week 3. And outside linebacker Tourek Williams might be out until midway through the year with a broken foot.
Veteran tight end Antonio Gates likely will begin the regular season on the NFL's suspended list while serving his four-game suspension for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. That means Gates will not count as part of San Diego's 53-man roster to start the regular season.
Quarterbacks (2): Philip Rivers, Kellen Clemens
The Chargers kept only two quarterbacks last season, and the expectation is that will happen again. Brad Sorensen has shown improvement and is a practice-squad candidate.
Running backs (4): Melvin Gordon, Danny Woodhead, Branden Oliver, Dreamius Smith.
Chargers general manager Tom Telesco indicated the team would like to keep Donald Brown around as the team's fourth running back, but he played only four snaps on offense in the team's dress rehearsal against the Seattle Seahawks last week. The Chargers could save $3 million in cash by releasing Brown. Smith played well in the preseason and would give San Diego an inexpensive option to Brown for depth at running back. Brown could also command trade interest for teams looking for experienced depth at running back like the Indianapolis Colts, Houston Texans and Cleveland Browns.
Wide receivers (5): Keenan Allen, Malcom Floyd, Stevie Johnson, Jacoby Jones, Dontrelle Inman.
It will be hard to let go of talented players such as Javontee Herndon, Austin Pettis and Tyrell Williams, but hopefully the Chargers can get someone like Herndon back on the practice squad.
Tight ends (4): Ladarius Green, John Phillips, David Johnson , Kyle Miller.
Miller makes it here to add depth to the tight end group with Gates missing the first four games. The Chargers want to run more two tight-end sets this year.
Tackles: (4): King Dunlap, D.J. Fluker, Joe Barksdale, Chris Hairston
Undrafted rookie free agent Tyreek Burwell has potential and should wind up on the practice squad if he clears waivers.
Guards (3): Orlando Franklin, Johnnie Troutman, Jeremiah Sirles
Kenny Wiggins had a good training camp and could make the roster for added depth, particularly with Troutman potentially missing the first two weeks.
Centers (2): Chris Watt, Trevor Robinson
The Chargers like the versatility of these two players, who can both play guard. Michael Huey also had a strong camp and is a practice-squad candidate.
Defensive tackles (3): Sean Lissemore, Ryan Carrethers, Mitch Unrein
Damion Square made some plays during training camp and warrants a look as a guy who could add depth on the active roster.
Defensive ends (4): Corey Liuget, Kendall Reyes, Darius Philon, Ricardo Mathews
This group has more depth and guys who can push the pocket from the interior line than in years past.
Outside linebackers (5): Melvin Ingram, Jeremiah Attaochu, Tourek Williams, Kyle Emanuel, Cordarro Law
Colton Underwood flashed during exhibition play and is a practice-squad candidate. The Chargers need an extra body with Williams injured.
Inside linebackers (5): Donald Butler, Manti Te'o, Denzel Perryman, Kavell Conner, Nick Dzubnar
Not sure how you keep Dzubnar off the active roster with the way he's played. The competition at this position helped improve the play of Butler and Te'o.
Cornerbacks (5): Brandon Flowers, Jason Verrett, Patrick Robinson, Steve Williams, Craig Mager.
Too bad guys such as Chris Davis and Greg Ducre suffered injuries; they were playing well early in camp. Richard Crawford deserves consideration for the active roster.
Safeties (4): Eric Weddle, Jimmy Wilson, Jahleel Addae, Darrell Stuckey
The Chargers have pretty good depth in the secondary and Adrian Phillips is another guy who can play. Perhaps Phillips lands on the practice squad.
Specialists (3): Nick Novak, Mike Scifres, Mike Windt
Josh Lambo did enough to get a job audition for another team or return if Novak suffers an injury.
THE authors of the religious instruction program suspended in a Queensland school have obtained legal advice showing they were following the law.
Youthworks writes the Connect program, under review by the State Government because of concerns raised at Windsor State School, it was "proselytising" children.
Principal Matthew Keong wrote to parents advising the Connect syllabus was not approved as it taught material like "every single person has sinned and rejected God and deserves to be punished".
Youthworks Minister Support Director Jon Thorpe stood by the material and also had legal advice Mr Keong was in the wrong suspending the program.
Youthworks obtained legal advice from Brisbane barrister Stewart Webster which confirmed it was operating within the law.
Mr Webster advised his understanding of the Education Act by Education Queensland had "no prohibition on proselytising".
Proselytising is defined as the attempt to convert someone from one religion, belief, or opinion to another.
Mr Webster said the prohibition appeared in Education Queensland policy in the context of "cooperative arrangements" and it referred to attempting to persuade people to change religions denomination only - such as switching from Baptist to Presbyterian.
"It is plain from the context the prohibition is to the effect a person delivering religious instruction may not attempt to persuade a student to change from one denomination or society to another," he wrote.
"In the context of the Policy, the prohibition has nothing to do with informing students about what it means to be a Christian and does not prevent a person delivering religious instruction from inviting students to consider for themselves the central teachings of Christianity."
In Mr Webster's view, the Connect program which Mr Keong objected to "do not in fact contravene the prohibition on proseltysing in the Policy".
"The extracts from the Connect program to which Mr Keong has taken objection largely reflect the central tenants of the Christian faith, something expressly permitted by the Act, the Regulation and the Policy," he said.
"Mr Keong has misunderstood the meaning of proselytising in the Policy and may not understand the statutory and regulatory regime governing the delivery of religious instruction.
"The decision to prevent the further use of the Connect program at Windsor State School is not justified on the grounds set out in the letter and Mr Keong's approach is not consistent with the policy.
"Further, the decision recorded in the letter in substances operates as a suspension on religious instruction at the school. Because that suspension is unjustified, it appears to be in contravention of s76 pf te Act/.
"Mr Keong has also acted outside the Act if he has not given an option to parents of children who are not members of the denominations represented in the cooperative agreement to consent to their children attending religious instruction.
"Mr Keong's approach is directly inconsistent with s29 of the Regulation."
It is understood Youthworks has submitted the legal advice to Education Minister Kate Jones for consideration.
During a speech on Monday regarding terrorism, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke about immigration:
"We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, through a process… No one has a right to immigrate to this country. It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who expect to succeed and flourish here and really be proud of what they've done and where they came from. They have to love our country."
For Trump, this was a very reasonable and coherent statement. There is no constitutional or "human right" to immigrate to the United States.
Hillary Clinton thinks otherwise--or at least her campaign does.
Shortly after Trump's speech, the Twitter account "Hillary for Ohio" tweeted the following:
The official Hillary Clinton Twitter account retweeted it shortly thereafter.
Embedded in the tweet is a link to the story of Mohamed G. and his family. Mohamed recounts the story of his father's difficult path to stay in the United States:
"My father came to the United States in 1994 on a scholarship as an international student. He wasn't able to get his permanent residency approved until 2015, leaving our family in limbo for more than two decades. He has a post-Masters' degree, but for years he had no other choice than to do odd jobs due to his immigration status. The worst part was that for decades he couldn't visit his family in Libya, even after many of them passed away. If he left the United States to visit relatives in Libya, he would not be allowed back."
Mohamed notes that his father is a good man who started an Islamic organization in Ohio and helped refugees. He adds that there's no way he "could let a person that disrespects my father and other immigrants win the White House."
Interesting story. However, it leaves a lingering question. What does Mohamed's tale have to do with what Trump said about immigration? The answer is that it has nothing to do with what Trump said about immigration. It's a story specifically designed to pull so hard on the heartstrings that logic and reason become irrelevant.
The story doesn't address that fact that, as Trump said, "no one has the right to immigrate to this country." It simply stirs up animosity toward the GOP nominee by portraying him as a villain who might dare to enforce immigration laws.
This "heartstring" tactic is one that's employed by both Democrats and Republicans on various issues. However, it's used predominantly by the Left. When one cannot argue policy, one muddies the water with emotions.
Random Facts About Israel You May Have Not Known
(None of this is any surprise for those who are familiar with the facts. This post is intended for the casual observer in the West who just gathered tidbits about the conflict from the prevalent discourse and for Israelis / Zionists who were kept in the dark regarding Israel's objective history with Zionist mythology and indoctrination, like I was)
1. Israel was created through colonial immigration and the ethnic cleansing (a Crime Against Humanity) of the native Palestinians from their historic land in 1947-1948 and the systematic destruction of hundreds of their villages using dynamite and bulldozers. This is how Jewish majority was created from what was less than 5% of the population prior to the 20th century. Those who were expelled or fled were not allowed to return and those refugees who tried to return to their homes were shot dead by the thousands. United Nations resolution 194 from 1948 called on Israel to allow the refugees back to their homes, a resolution which has been ignored to this day.
2. A significant percentage of the expelled Palestinians were Christian (estimated 15% – 30%). This fact may come as a surprise to those who were led to believe that it is a struggle between Jews and Muslims for land. If anything, it is an anecdotal evidence that it is a replay of the story of colonial dispossession of the indigenous population.
The Christian Palestinians went on to participate in the armed struggle against their colonial dispossessors and still hold a significant role in the Palestinian leadership.
3. Prior to the colonial immigration of Jews in the 20th century to Palestine, there had been no strife in the land for many centuries, since the demise of the Crusader State. It is a well circulated myth and a misconception that Jews and Muslims had been fighting over that land forever – a complete fallacy without any basis. Muslims, Christians, Jews, Druze and other religions co-existed harmoniously throughout the ages in Palestine until immigrant Jews from Europe under the auspices of a colonial power set their aim to establish a Jewish State on a land populated by 95% non-Jews.
4. Israel is home to the largest non-citizen, stateless group of people in the world. For any of you it is hard to imagine being born, growing up and dying without citizenship in any country. That is the case with millions of Palestinians under Israel's rule who have no basic human rights (such as the right to a lawyer and fair trial, let alone citizenship rights) and are subject to Israel's military rule since 1967. The reason they are not granted citizenship and human rights is because they are not Jewish.
5. The Palestinians are the natives of Palestine since time immemorial. It has been a Zionist propaganda myth to portray them as ‘squatters' and European Jews as ‘rightful owners'. Israeli DNA research which aimed to prove Jews' ancient ancestry (hence insinuating ‘historic right to the land') found at most tenuous evidence that ‘some' Jews have some of their ancestry in the Middle East (while the latest research concluded European Jews to be descendents of converted Khazars). However, what they proved beyond shadow of a doubt is that Palestinians are natives of the land, i.e. descendents of Israelites, Canaanites and other indigenous tribes that mixed together over the ages like in most parts of the world. However, even without DNA research, it is quite clear that the Palestinians are semites and part of the region, have lived in Palestine for countless generations and more importantly have land deeds and property deeds (which were revoked and confiscated by the Jewish State), while the European colonialists have nothing but a ludicrous claim about supposed ancestry from 2,000 years ago (no less!). The ancient ancestral claim, even if it had merit to it (it doesn't), is so absurd that if we adopt this logic, we should all be entitled to claim the continent of Africa to ourselves and to expel the Africans, as we all originate from Africa!
6. There was never any significant expulsion of Jews in the first century A.D. as Professor Shlomo Sand clearly illustrates in his book “The Invention of the Jewish People”. This fact alone destroys the Zionist arch-myth about “expulsion and return of Jews to their historic homeland after 2000 years”. Moreover, Prof. Sand clearly demonstrates that all modern Zionist historians and leaders were well aware of this fact, yet for demagoguery reasons propagated the myth of forced expulsion and return. This myth is so deeply entrenched that it is even referenced in Israel's Declaration of Independence. So where did the Judeans “disappear”? They did not. Although some may have immigrated over the centuries, most stayed and adopted Christianity and later Islam and mixed with other local tribes. These are the ancestors of current day Palestinians.
7. The arch-myth of expulsion and return has a sub-myth about “Arabs trying to throw Jews into the sea and Jews prevailing”. That myth was busted by modern Israeli historians (as well as Palestinian and foreign historians) who proved that the colonial European Jews in Palestine were by far militarily superior to the essentially defenseless rural native population, which enabled them to carry out the ethnic cleansing of Palestine with little resistance. Moreover, this widely publicized myth tells how fledgling Israel heroically fights the armies of 5 Arab states at once and prevails. Once again, the same Israeli historians proved that (a) the Arab countries sent small auxiliary forces at the pressure of their populace to come to the aid of the Palestinians in reaction to the ethnic cleansing by Jewish forces that was taking place in Palestine for some time (the ethnic cleansing campaign started in November 1947 while the first Arab states' forces were sent in May 1948) (b) those forces that were sent were hardly a match, both numerically and by quality, to the well organized, armed and trained Jewish forces who had strong backing in the West.
8. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine did not stop in 1948. It continued in the first years after Israel's establishment and in 1967, under the fog of the six day war, Israel once again expelled well over 200,000 civilians from their homes in the West Bank and the Golan Heights, constituting the second major ethnic cleansing carried out by Israel. In subsequent years, through administrative means Israel deported another 150,000 non-Jews by revoking their residence rights and by preventing the return of Palestinians who were abroad temporarily.
9. Israel was Apartheid S. Africa's closest ally and trade partner through the boycott years. It even proliferated nuclear weapons technology to the Apartheid regime and was the only country in the world to support the Bantustan solution, which enabled the minority whites to continue controlling the country. You can guess the reason.
10. Israel is the only country in the world where home demolitions are carried out as a collective punitive measure for non-Jews.
11. Israel's security forces use torture on a regular basis. It was the only country in the world to allow torture by law.
12. Israel is the only country in the world with roads for Jews only and settlements for Jews only and two separate legal systems, one for Jewish settlers and one for non-Jewish Palestinians who sometimes live only a few yards away from each other.
The problems in the Holy Land stem from systematic discrimination, ethnic cleansing and abuse by an exclusionary colonial Apartheid state, not a border dispute or a struggle over land between two nations or two religions as some would have you believe. Realizing and understanding this is the first step that will help pave the way to the desired solution, which is equal rights and one law for all.

STATE HOUSE – The General Assembly has passed legislation (2016-H 7007 Sub A/ 2016-S 2699 ) that enables and explicitly authorizes municipalities to regulate unlicensed massage parlors and services within its borders in response to illegal sex trafficking operations disguised as massage parlors or bodyworks establishments. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Carlos E. Tobon and Sen. James E. Doyle II, has addressed the concerns of several local legitimate businesses who are concerned that the legislation would have adversely affected their legal and licensed massage practices.
“Pawtucket cannot be a safe haven for businesses involved in sex-trafficking,” said Representative Tobon (D-Dist. 58, Pawtucket). “This legislation will protect the children and families of Pawtucket, it will protect the victims of sex-trafficking trapped in these businesses and it will allow the city to ensure that illegal storefront brothels do not exist in Pawtucket any longer. Since the bill was voted out of committee, I have heard from hundreds of massage therapists who want a clearer distinction between their legitimate massage businesses and the bodyworks and massage parlors who have brought ill-repute to the industry,” said Representative Tobon. “We worked collaboratively with these folks, and the leadership, to tighten up the legislation so that we get it right. We are trying to crack down on the exploitation of women and sex trafficking, but we didn't want legitimate small business owners hurt in the process. I am confident that this legislation will end the question of whether or not cities and towns can regulate unlicensed massage parlors and services in an effort to protect the community and end the exploitation of women.”
“The days of illicit storefront brothels residing on the streets of Pawtucket, or any other community in Rhode Island, are finally over,” said Senator Doyle (D-Dist. 8, Pawtucket). “This was a complicated piece of legislation, but with all the stakeholders involved, we came up with legislation that will protect the reputation of genuine businesses while also ending the scourge of sex trafficking that once masqueraded in our communities as legitimate businesses. This act is good for the community, it's good for small businesses, and most importantly, it will protect the victims of sex trafficking from further exploitation.”
The legislation is a response to the City of Pawtucket's on-going battle against unregulated massage parlors or “body-works” establishments that authorities believe are deceptive fronts for sex-trafficking and prostitution. The City of Pawtucket had passed a municipal ordinance calling for the proper licensing and public-health regulation of such establishments but a Superior Court judge earlier in the month ruled that the city did not have the legal authority to uphold such an ordinance and that enabling legislation from the General Assembly was necessary. Representative Tobon and Senator Doyle have been diligently working with the Pawtucket City Council in order to give the city legal authority to regulate unlicensed massage services in the city with the intent of weeding out businesses who engage in illegal sex-work and human trafficking.
The legislation now heads to Governor Raimondo's desk for action.
Bitcoin's oldest mining pool, Slush Pool, will let its miners vote on the Segregated Witness soft fork proposed by Bitcoin Core. By passing this choice down to individual miners that connect to the pool (sometimes also referred to as “hashers”) Slush Pool hopes to remove itself as a decision maker from the equation.
Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek “Slush” Palatinus stated:
“Satoshi's idea was not to have a few entities control the network. As a mining pool we shouldn't rule.”
Segregated Witness
Mining pools offer Bitcoin miners a solution to combine their hash power, sharing any block rewards they may find. Last year, Slush Pool was the first pool to also offer their hashers a chance to indicate preference on a potential block size limit increase hard fork. Whenever a hasher participating in the pool finds a block, that specific block is tagged with the choice of the hasher.
As a proposed soft fork per the requirement established by Bitcoin Core, Segregated Witness will require support from 95 percent of all hash power on the network to activate. Continuing its policy to put hashers in control, Slush Pool — which accounts for six percent of all hash power on the Bitcoin network — will let hashers vote in support of, or against, Segregated Witness activation.
Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Palatinus explained why he believes Slush Pool should refrain from making decisions on behalf of its hashers:
“Pools are just service providers for miners, which makes mining easier and optimizes costs. I don't consider it much different from internet service providers, and I think we should adhere to similar principles of net neutrality. At Slush Pool, therefore, our long-term strategy is to remain neutral on potential hard forks and soft forks, and to offer tools for miners to decide for themselves.”
Palatinus himself does hope the Segregated Witness soft fork will activate. The co-inventor of pooled mining believes that the proposal will offer significant benefits that improve Bitcoin overall, with little downside.
“We see Segregated Witness as a fix of many holes left in the Bitcoin protocol, which do need to be fixed,” Palatinus said. “Problems like quadratic scaling during transaction signing, malleability issues, the inability to know the value of an input... Yes, Segregated Witness is a pretty complex solution, but these issues cannot be fixed much [more easlily]. It is also one of the most tested changes in Bitcoin history. There's huge intellectual effort behind the whole concept, and I think it would be really sad if that won't go through because of political games.”
Despite its intention to remain neutral, Slush Pool did decide to enable Segregated Witness signaling as the default. If hashers don't change their settings, they will signal support for Segregated Witness — but they can easily switch that support off.
Block Size Debate
While Segregated Witness offers several benefits, one of these has garnered a lot of attention in the context of the block size debate in particular. The proposed soft fork replaces Bitcoin's block size limit with a block “weight” limit, which offers an effective block size limit increase of about 0.7 to 1.0 megabyte, depending on the types of transactions included in a block.
Some proponents of a block size limit increase, however, prefer a hard fork to increase the block size limit instead. Perhaps most notably, the relatively new Chinese mining pool ViaBTC — controlling about eight percent of all hash power on the network — has indicated it will reject Segregated Witness in favor of a hard fork.
Criticizing this approach, Palatinus said he does not believe Segregated Witness and a hard fork block size limit increase are mutually exclusive. Apart from Segregated Witness signaling, Slush Pool hashers can still mine blocks indicating support for a block size limit increase hard fork.
“We don't see Segregated Witness as a scaling solution primarily — though it will help a bit,” Palatinus explained. “And we believe that all scaling solutions — including Segregated Witness — should be adopted, regardless of politics. That's why we let our miners vote for their preferred hard fork and soft fork at the same time, and give them an option to combine these votes. It's not an either/or proposition.”
Palatinus himself has been a long-time proponent of increasing Bitcoin's block size limit through a hard fork. Though, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the pool operator also explained he's not confident the solution, as proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited and endorsed by ViaBTC, is the way to go at this point.
“I was in favor of increasing the block size limit because I think Bitcoin is quite anti-fragile, and do not share some of the disaster visions you hear,” Palatinus said. “However, what troubles me is that recent efforts to hard fork seem pretty light-handed and without serious research behind them. Proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited's are adding another degree of freedom to Bitcoin's economic model, and it is unclear how much this changes incentives and the overall balance of the network.
“Simply put: I don't believe there are simple solutions for complex problems.”
Cecil back in the day (Picture: AP)
An ‘animal communicator' claims to have spoken to the spirit of Cecil the lion, and it turns out he was quite a deep thinker.
In what is we like to think was a Mufasa-type appearance in the clouds, Karen Anderson says she ‘connected' with the animal after he was killed in Zimbabwe by dentist Walter James Palmer.
I know, we're sceptics too, but let's just go with it for a moment.

Rather than wanting revenge on Mr Palmer, Cecil is apparently more concerned with moving on.
Cecil wants closure.
‘Let not the actions of these few men defeat us or allow darkness to enter our hearts. If we do then we become one of them,' Anderson's Facebook post claims he said.

‘I am here. Be strong and speak for all the others who suffer needlessly to satisfy human greed. Bring Light and Love and we will rise above this.'
Anderson, who describes herself as a psychic medium, said the words brought tears to her eyes.
Reactions to Cecil's words have ranged from the heartfelt: ‘Moved my mom and I to tears. I have been very upset about this but his words allow for healing and love', to the not-so-heartfelt: ‘so you talked to a dead lion… okaaaay.'

Martin O'Malley speaks with a "robot" at the Iowa State Fair on August 13. (David Weigel)
DES MOINES, Iowa. -- "Hey, robot man!" said Martin O'Malley. "Will you caucus for me?"
The former Democratic governor of Maryland was addressing an educational "robot" wearing a tie-dyed shirt, standing at an intersection of the Iowa State Fairgrounds -- a cybernetic organism much sturdier than the late hitchBot. Just moments earlier, O'Malley had tobogganed down a slide with his son, William, and daughter, Grace, and the camera crews around him were ready for more kitsch.
"What kind of technology experience do you have?" said the piped-in voice of the robot.
"I have lots of technology experience," said O'Malley. "Mostly on the campaigns."
The robot was silent. His electronic display did not move. His voice actor seemed as confused as passersby, who had been stage-whispering questions like "who is that?" and "is he famous?" as O'Malley worked the fair.
"You're giving me kind of flat effect," said O'Malley.
The robot changed the subject like a pro, telling O'Malley to listen to his kids, and campaign hard. Then the multi-armed organism of the press scrum moved on, to procure pork on a stick.
There are life cycles in insurgent presidential campaigns. First comes speculation about how they'd run, then speculation about they'd win, then the questions of why they're polling so poorly, then the stories of their resurgence. Some candidates, like 2012's Tim Pawlenty, do not live to cycle through this. O'Malley -- who, alone among Democrats is running a traditional barnstorming campaign -- may have had his sped up by the problems of Hillary Clinton. Both he and Jim Webb, the former Democratic senator from Virginia, flourished in the media shower of the Iowa State Fair. Both tried to plant a flag somewhere opposite Hillary Clinton -- with decreasingly subtle arguments about why Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) should not have that role to himself.
Webb, a laconic speaker who is waging only his second bid for office, arrived at the fair shortly before his 1 p.m. turn at the Des Moines Register's candidate soap box. He pointed out an old platoon mate in the crowd -- "a citizen of Iowa" -- then apologized for the brightness of the day, as "the first rule you learn in Marine Corps leadership is to never put your crowd's face into the sun." Then he explained his support for the Keystone XL pipeline, his bipartisan outreach in the Senate, and his version of economic populism.
"If you look at the recession we endured," said Webb, "and you start in April 2009, when we started climbing back out of it, the stock market has almost tripled. It's gone from about 6,000 to 18,000. If you own stock, if you have capital assets, you're probably doing well. If you're not in the flow of capital, holding stocks and real estate, you're not doing so well. We need to make sure the American worker, who is the hardest, most productive in the world gets a share of this economy as we bring it back."
But Webb would not criticize any of his opponents. He referred obliquely to "the attention that the candidates who are more on the extreme are getting in the media." After his speech, hounded by a few reporters, he refused to comment on Hillary Clinton's ongoing email scandal, or the rumors of a Joe Biden presidential bid stoked by friends of the vice president.
After the speech, Webb worked his way quietly out of the fair, pursued by TV cameras, stopping only to sign copies of his book and a photo of a voter's soldier son. He insisted that he was having fun regardless.
"I actually saw one T-shirt that said: I'm not interested, I'm in it for the chicks," said Webb. "This is a fair. Everybody is selling something or going on a ride.
O'Malley threw himself into the fair life with more brio, peaking when he snapped a family selfie with the butter cow.
“Sixty days ago, when we got in, we were at one percent," he said. "After 30 days, we went to three. Latest poll has us at seven. And we're going to keep going.”
At every turn, he met cameras attached to reporters who wanted to get his latest read on the competition. Unlike Webb, he had one.
Hillary Clinton? "There's always an inevitable front-runner in the Democratic primary," O'Malley told one crew. "This is a choice between our past and a choice between our future."
Joe Biden? "I would welcome Vice President Biden's entry into this race. He is a good and decent man who has served our country for decades."
Bernie Sanders? That one pulled O'Malley onto a limb. Asked if he thought the Democrats had a "problem" when a self-described democratic socialist sought their nomination, O'Malley disagreed, then worked his way into the affirmative.
"I don't think it's a problem for the Democratic Party, but it might be long-term for Sen. Sanders," he said. I believe that the Democratic Party has a tradition of offering pragmatic solutions to the problems that face us as a country. I am a lifelong Democrat, and I believe very deeply in the principles of our party. I believe in what Franklin Roosevelt was talking about and what John F. Kennedy was talking about. That's why I choose to be a Democrat not just in presidential years but in every year of my life."
Asked if he was being squeezed out of the race, with Clinton on the right and Sanders on the left, O'Malley smiled wide.
"It's funny you see it like that," he said. "I see a whole lane opening."
O'Malley's own soap box speech had all the coiled energy that evaded Webb. His top two shirt buttons undone, his legs arching forward in what someone not running for president might call a yoga warrior stance, O'Malley boiled down the 15 goals of his potential presidency. He spent special time attacking "bad trade deals," a commonality with Webb and Sanders -- something Hillary Clinton could not agree with unless she flip-flopped. "China and India – they have countries of their own to invest in," said O'Malley,
After the speech, O'Malley went a little further, saying that China's recent devaluation of the Yuan looked to him like a sneaky manipulation. "I think we need to put much more pressure on the appropriate agencies, and take action on our own, to do the countervailing measures and impose the tariffs when this sort of things happens," he said.
Webb would not go so far. "On anything like that, we need to watch it, get the facts," he said. "Some have been saying that they want Chinese currency to follow the marketplace, and there are analysts who say that if that happened, the Yuan would go down. All of these complex issues, these economic issues, it's best to watch the trend line and listen to your key advisers."
The two candidates found some space on another question: The name of Iowa's annual "Jefferson-Jackson" Democratic dinner. The party was planning to change it, new name TBD, after this year. O'Malley obliquely suggested that the party was making a good call.
"I've been to so many state party dinners," said O'Malley. "There are a lot of different names. The important thing is that we honor the principles of our party. In Charles County, I think they call it the Truman dinner. I know that when I was in Minnesota it was named after local people. So it's whatever honors the modern principles."
Webb, who wrote a whole book (Born Fighting) about the Scots-Irish, Appalachian populism that produced leaders like Jackson, was even more evasive. He would neither commend nor criticize the party if it erased the 3rd and 7th presidents.
“That's up to them," he said. "Those are great presidents, but if people here want to name a dinner after something else, I don't –"
Ed Fallon, a former state legislator, interrupted with an idea.
“How about the Roosevelt-Reagan dinner?” asked Fallon.
“That might get a big crowd,” said Webb.
He laughed his staccato laugh, and moved toward a less press-stricken area of the fair. Hillary Clinton would arrive two days later.
When complete, this will be the largest development in Vancouver since the Olympic Village was constructed for the 2010 Winter Games. Concord Pacific has announced its plans for False Creek Central – a $1.3 billion development.
[youtube id=”xoeOaTMI5gU”]
The proposal is located on one of Concord Pacific's last remaining parcels of undeveloped Expo '86 lands and will include eight residential buildings with over 1,000 units for 3,000 people. The area will also include 90,000 square feet of amenities, bringing a selection of services and commercial activity such as a public fitness and wellness club, restaurants and lounges, cafes, a market, boutiques and more.
Concord Pacific's plan also includes a new bicycle and pedestrian route that will connect downtown Vancouver to the seawall and the Cambie Bridge. Completion of all the towers, amenities and infrastructure is not expected until 2023.
That neighbourhood will see some major changes in the coming years. The BC Place casino project was re-announced last month as a $535 million entertainment and urban resort destination but with a smaller casino than previously proposed to simply replace Edgewater Casino. Major residential and commercial developments are also planned for the site of the Plaza of Nations and a parcel of Concord Pacific-owned land to the west of the planned expansion of Creekside Park.
Three rental towers have been approved for Rogers Arena and will bring 614 rental units to the downtown core. The first tower is currently under construction and its lower levels will include a major expansion of the Rogers Arena concourse plus additional food, restaurant and bar options. The project has been touted as the largest rental-only development the city has seen in nearly 30 years.
A two-year study is underway to plan the removal of the Dunsmuir and Georgia Viaducts. With growth, new developments and the diversion of traffic volumes into Pacific Boulevard, the removal of the Viaducts has many worried of a pending traffic nightmare.

When is a church not a church? The answer – when the government says so. At least this is the case in several European countries, where a multi-tiered system is strictly operated and only the entities that reach the top tier are officially recognized as churches.
While non-recognized churches can potentially still operate as associations, lacking official church recognition carries many consequences. For example, official churches can receive tax exemptions from real-estate tax; financial contributions to recognized churches can be tax deductible; it is easier for foreign ministers and missionaries to gain visas to work for a recognized church, and depending on the country, there may also be benefits in relation to education, military service and several other areas of life – none of which can be received by non-recognized churches.
Imagine the shock, then, for churches operating in Hungary in late 2011 when the government decided to introduce a new law that would de-register hundreds of churches from the officially recognized list. In almost no time at all, the list had been shaved from over 300 churches to just 14. After significant outcry, the list was begrudgingly extended to 32 churches – still 90% smaller than it had been just a few months before and still missing many religious communities that had been in existence for decades.
The Hungarian government explained that new law addressed the situation of bogus churches that were receiving benefits from the state – including such churches as the “Hungarian Witch Association” and “Cute Pilgrims from A to Z.”
Perhaps, then, the government had a legitimate ground for concern, but the new requirements for recognized churches are very demanding. For example, to be recognized as a church you must meet the government's definition of religion; have existed for either 20 years domestically or 100 years internationally, and must have at least 1000 members. These requirements immediately ruled some smaller or newer congregations out of the running.
But remarkably, such requirements are not particularly unusual in some parts of Europe. Hungary's neighbours, Slovakia and Austria, have equally, if not more imposing requirements – Slovakia requires 20,000 members and Austria requires a membership equalling at least 0,2% of the Austrian population (about 16,700 members). Several other European Union countries operate similar registration systems to Hungary, including Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, and the likes of Azerbaijan, Belarus and Turkey have systems that are far worse.
However, it was the process in which the re-ordering of religious organizations took place that was the main ground for concern in Hungary. At least that was the view of the country's Constitutional Court, who ruled on Tuesday 26 February 2013 that parts of the law were unconstitutional; having previously ruled that the way in which the law was brought about was unconstitutional.
According to the law, it is the Hungarian Parliament who ultimately decides which organizations are on the list and which are not, and to be recognized as a church requires a two thirds majority in a parliamentary vote. There is no review process against the vote, no written reasons, and crucially, no option to appeal the decision in the courts. All of which means that a religious organization may tick all of the required boxes, yet still be voted against in parliament, with no option to appeal – a process that clearly lends itself to political influence. The Constitutional Court therefore decided that this process was unconstitutional. However, the practical consequences of the decision are still unclear.
It has been reported that the government may choose to amend the constitution so that the legislature has the explicit right to decide which churches are and are not officially recognized, effectively nullifying Tuesday's court decision. Further problems remain for the churches that have now been de-registered, with many disappearing altogether or being forced to restructure themselves around the association model. And all the while a case before the European Court of Human Rights continues, involving nine different religious communities that were all arbitrarily deregistered on January 1 2012.
The future of churches in Hungary therefore remains unknown, and while Tuesday's court decision will be welcomed by those who believe there are better ways to protect religious freedom than through a strict registration system, it is unclear what will change in the immediate future. Certainly, for the time being it looks like many countries in Europe are still a long way from removing or reforming the multi-tier system, which means the government will continue to have the final say as to whether a church is really a church.

Cass and Bob interview Rebecca Murphy. Rebecca is a 46 year old white cisgender heterosexual female, married for 28 years and childfree by choice. She was raised in an off-shoot of Mormonism called Temple Lot. In college she left that faith but was swept up into the International Church of Christ, which under the surface of their inspirational Sunday services was a domineering pyramid scheme with all the mind controlling influences of a cult. Before our talk with Rebecca, Cass has a brief conversation with Harry Flook, a 21 year old British photographer and documentarian visiting the states through former guest Gayle Jordan and the Recovering From Religion organization to chronicle how people find a sense of community after losing their faith and leaving the church.
If you've been following the last several episodes, you will have noticed that I am on a journey that associate with the stage of life in which I find myself, which I'll describe as mid-life, post-religious, and post-parent. There seems to be a natural rite of passage happening that is not unlike puberty, where it is going to happen whether you like it or not. In the absence of meaning, formerly found in the role of being a parent and/or seeing one's self within a religious narrative or simply the realization that one has fewer years left to live than one has lived thus far, some realizations begin to enter one's mind that can serve as a mirror that exposes immaturity in one's character (at best) or seem pathological at worst. It turns out (at least for me) that a strong sense of self has been kept at bay by the busying narratives in which my life has been immersed, and as the curtain closes on them (my role as a parent, for example, or my role as child of god destined to live eternally in heaven), and that suppressed identity is coming unchained and emerging from the dungeon with a vengeance. But, it doesn't know how to behave or even walk and is blinded by the sun and atrophied by immobility so nothing about this is homecoming is going to be pretty. In fact, it can arouse deep anxieties, even panic, and hopelessness that can lead to suicidal thoughts. You will hurt and be hurt by those nearest to you. Especially if they're going through the same thing at the same time. Many marriages are ended by this transition. But I found my hope in a psychological concept founded by Carl Jung and Murray Bowen called “differentiation.”
Differentiation of self is one's ability to separate one's own intellectual and emotional functioning from that of one's family and/or lover. Individuals with "low differentiation" are more likely to become emotionally fused with others—particularly family or lovers. They're like Siamese twins attached at the hip. And this attachment, that is largely dependent and codendent, can last for years until this awakening happens and you want to go your own way. Any attempt to do so will be taken personally by the person you are fused with. You want to differentiate yourself from them and they say, “why are you doing this to me?” When in fact, you are doing nothing TO them, they are just leaning on you so hard that they hit the floor when you move. People with "low differentiation" depend on others' approval and acceptance. They either conform themselves to others in order to please them, or they attempt to force others to conform to themselves. They are thus more vulnerable to stress and less adaptive to life changes. You may have heard of a healthy H-shaped relationship, where two stand-alone, vertical lines are in relationship, contrasted with an unhealthy A-shape relationship where those lines are leaning on each other.
Those with generally higher levels of "self differentiation" recognize that they need others, but they depend less on others' acceptance and approval. They do not merely adopt the attitude of those around them but acquire and maintain their principles thoughtfully. These principles, morals, and ethics help them resist lapsing into emotional reactivity and impulsive thoughts and actions. Thus, despite conflict, criticism, and even rejection, those with greater capacity to "self differentiate" can stay calm and rationally "clear-headed" enough to carefully assess facts, less clouded by emotion. What they decide and say matches what they do. Even when they act in the best interests of a group, they choose thoughtfully, not because they are caving in to group-think. They're more objective observers, more capable of calmness under relationship and task pressures. Confident in their own thinking, they can either support another's viewpoints without becoming wishy-washy; or, they can reject another's opinions without becoming hostile with them, or passively disconnected from them.
The ideal outcome here is when two people (beit father and son, or siblings, or husband and wife) both move from an A shape to an H shape, no one falls to the ground. However, if one person is unwilling or unable to do the work—the introspection, the therapy, the communication, the research—all of which are helpful in understanding what the fuck is happening, then they are most certainly going to crash when the other person differentiates. At that point, they have the option to stay on the floor crying, blaming and demonizing the other person…for the rest of their lives, but in so doing, they miss out on this wonderful evolutionary opportunity to grow up and personally develop, and secondly, they destroy a valuable relationship to their own heart.
I see this as a key development for those of us who have graduated from religious faith. When we discover that self-debasing doctrines have left us a depleted shell or ghost-like version of our true selves, we have to find them and meet them, maybe for the first time. We have to get to know them, we have to ask them questions, we have to discover what they like and dislike because they've been asked. This is the first step of differentiation. The second is learning how to self-soothe and control our own anxieties. Before, we looked to God or others to comfort us. The third is learning to manage our reactivity, or what Dr. David Schnarch calls, “grounded responding.” Religions remove responsibility from people and when they get our from under that tyranny, they find that they're ability to respond to circumstances and people is undeveloped. They either over-respond in aggression and thoughtless comments, or under-respond in passive aggression, apathy and dis-attachment.
The fourth and last element of differentiation is endurance. Stay in the room with difference. Tolerate some discomfort for the sake of personal growth and the healing of relationships. Toughen up. Grow a pair. Start giving yourself and your loved ones the benefit of the doubt. Don't be so quick to assume the worst in them. Bounce back after defeat or failure.
Ultimately, you know what this is: this is saying yes to what is. This rite of passage is a gift and will reap tremendous benefits in your life and relationships. Like giving birth, if you can survive the pain of transition and the stretching, you will reap a new life. No-sayers want to pretend it's not happening or that there's no work to be done here. They may be quick to thrown in the towel or say “there was no hope for that relationship anyway,” which actually may be true, but please, only make that call after exhaustive effort on your part.
Know this: there's nothing wrong with you if you're going through this. Don't blame or shame yourself or anyone else. Tenderly welcome your formerly enslaved self into the 21st century, into freedom, and start looking for ways for that beautiful human being to express their self. Teach them they can self-comfort, they can act from their core and not react from fear, and that they have what it takes to finish strong.

This is a subject many Dolphins fans don't want to think about. Cameron Wake is the Miami Dolphins the best player. He's the favorite current player of many fans. His story is a sports movie writer's dream. He played 4-3 outside linebacker at Penn State. He went undrafted in 2005, signed with the New York Giants as a free agent, but couldn't make the team. He went to work in a gym and as a mortgage broker trying to make ends meet while he kept his NFL dream alive. He got a workout for a Canadian football team, but showed up to the wrong place for the workout and nearly missed the opportunity. But he was signed by the BC Lions, where the coach put him at defensive end instead of linebacker. In his first two seasons, he accumulated 39 sacks, earning defensive honors in the CFL. He signed with the Dolphins in 2009 and well, you know the rest.
Cameron Wake is the type of player that offenses have to account for on every play. He has possibly the best first step of any defender in the NFL and can bend with the best of them to get to the quarterback. He's the type of player that most every team wishes they had on their roster. On top of that, Wake has a favorable contract for a player of his caliber. He's a face of the Dolphins franchise. So why would Miami even think about giving a player like that away? There are two reasons why they should think of trading Wake.
AGE
Miami is on the verge of missing the playoffs for a sixth straight season. If they don't, it will be time to rebuild/retool yet again. Unlike previous seasons though, Miami has some young talent to build around: Ryan Tannehill, Lamar Miller, Jarvis Landry, Charles Clay, Ja'Wuan James, Olivier Vernon, Jelani Jenkins, and Reshad Jones are all talented players a new coach could build around. That's a good base to work with. But the other side of retooling is that the Dolphins will need to get rid of parts they can't build around. That means getting rid of aging or declining players.
As good as Wake is, his age will be a factor that does not work in his favor. He will be 33 years old at the beginning of the 2015 season. Wake takes great care of his body and the lack of overall football 'mileage' could keep him fresher than most 33 year old defensive ends. But at some point, his age will catch up to him. Wake excels with athleticism and when that starts declining, will Wake be able to keep up his level of play? There is no doubt that the decline is coming, but when will that happen: the end of his contract in 2017? Next season?
TRADE VALUE
The inevitable decline is coming, but all we know is that it's not here yet. What that means is Wake's trade value is as high now as it's ever going to be. In the past, Miami has held on to a player a season or two too long and gotten nothing for them. If Miami holds on to him for too long and his play drops off, they will have to cut him, netting nothing. Or they can keep him and use him as a pass rushing specialist at a higher price. His contract is great for an elite pass rusher. If he can't remain an elite pass rusher, then Miami will be overpaying him and his trade value will be gone. Trading Wake this offseason means the Dolphins will be able to get the most they can out of the deal.
There is no guarantee that a team will want to trade for Wake, but a query must be made at the very least. There is always a team out there that is close to championship contention that would be willing to yield a draft pick for a player they think can get them over the hump. You can rule out attempting to trade Wake to lottery pick teams. It's a pipe dream to think the Dolphins will trade Wake to the Raiders or Buccaneers for a high draft pick. But teams like Atlanta, Seattle, or Arizona for example may want Wake for a Super Bowl push and would be willing to give up a decent pick to ensure they get there.
CONCLUSION
Wake is a popular player with fans, and most, including myself, would hate to see him go to another team. There are going to be some tough decisions coming up regarding this roster and what to do with Wake is one of them. It's unlikely that Wake will remain a top tier talent when Miami will be in a position to contend and his trade window is closing fast. This offseason will be the best opportunity for Miami to move Wake and get the best value for him, if they choose to move him. There are benefits to both sides of this equation and it will be a critical decision for the person that has to make it.
The authorities of Mahajati Sadan, a prominent government-owned auditorium in Kolkata, have cancelled the booking for an event scheduled for early October where RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was supposed to deliver a speech.
Bengal governor Keshari Nath Tripathi was also scheduled to attend the programme on October 3. The subject of the speech was Sister Nivedita's role in India's nationalist movement.
“By July we completed all formalities and informed the police about the VIP movement. Suddenly, on August 31, the auditorium told us our booking could be cancelled and gave several vague reasons, finally asking us to obtain a no-objection certificate from the police. This NOC was never required before but we approached police anyway. The authorities called us on September 1 and said the booking was cancelled for maintenance,” Rantideb Sengupta, general secretary of Sister Nivedita Mission Trust, told HT on Monday.
The organisation is now looking for another auditorium.
Sources said though the topic of discussion is not communally sensitive, the state government thought the timing of the visit was itself fraught with risk. Bijoya Dashami (the last day of Durga Puja) and Muharram are on subsequent days on September 30 and October 1.
The saffron camps have already planned to hold shastra puja or weapon worship on Bijoya Dashami.
“We'll go ahead with the event for sure. Once we finalise the new venue,it will be informed to the Governor and Bhagwat,” Sengupta said.
This is not the first time the state government tried to stop Bhagwat from addressing public gatherings. Earlier in January, Kolkata Police denied permission for Bhagwat's rally in the city but the high court ruled against the decision.
In 2016, too, Muharram fell a day after Bijoya Dashami, and the state witnessed clashes between Hindus and Muslims in several districts that continued for nearly a week.
“In case clashes break out again, Bhagwat's presence in the state will only worsen the situation,” an administrative officer said.
On Monday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, expressed concerns over the planned shastra puja events.
“Weapons are best suited in the hands of Maa Durga. Just be careful so that there is no attempt to create tension on the Bijoya Dashami day in the name of sashtra puja, or procession with arms,” the chief minister said during an administrative meeting with the state's top policemen.

A brother who was sharing lodging with other brothers asked Abba Bessarion, ‘What should I do?' The old man replied, ‘Keep silence and do not compare yourself to others.'
—-sayings of the desert
There is no greater enemy than the enemy of self – judgment. When we compare ourselves to others, we are judging ourselves and usually looking for ways to compete with the other. This sort of behavior easily leads to jealousy and envy, emotions which ALWAYS cause us to fall into sin. Jealousy and envy become all-consuming and the next thing you know you are trying to eliminate them so they are no longer a threat.
The other side of that scenario is self – loathing. Such an attitude leads to loss of productivity, depression and destructive behavior. We must be continually be reminded that we are created in the image and likeness of God, and we are possessors of great potential. The sheer numbers of different personalities and talents are an expression of an infinite God whose possibilities are limitless.
The Abba is telling the brother and us, to keep silent and see the person that God has created. We are not all the same, but we are the crown jewel of God's creation. In silence we discover God's spark in our lives, and He then uses it to bring us to our full potential. As the psalmist says, ‘Be still and know that I am God….'

UPDATE: (6/14/17)Police arrested two women in connection to a double murder at Cayce Homes in East Nashville.
According to Metro Nashville Police, 19-year-old Taylor Roberts and 20-year-old Shakiria Webster are being held on counts of felony murder and robbery.
Metro police say Roberts was arrested in Maury County Tuesday night, and Webster was already in jail in Sumner County for an unrelated incident. Both women are from Columbia, Tennessee.
Both Roberts and Webster are considered co-defendants of Tramell Sparkman, who was indicted for the double murder earlier this week.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Metro Police said a Columbia man has been arrested and indicted for the murder of a TSU student and another man at Cayce Homes.
Tramell Sparkman, 28, was indicted Tuesday for the May 23 double murder.
Brandon Jordan, 22, a TSU student, and Eric Allen, 38, were identified as the victims killed in the shooting about 12:50 a.m. at the public housing development along South 8th Street.
Sparkman was arrested in Spring Hill my Metro Police.
Responding officers found Jordan lying on the ground near a porch stoop with a gunshot wound to his upper torso. Allen, who lived at the apartment, was found in the doorway with multiple gunshot wounds to his upper chest.
Police said Jordan died at the scene and Allen died shortly after arriving to Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Metro Police have an increased presence in the East Nashville housing community after recent violence.
SASKATOON—When Steve Simonar was pulled over by police in the past, he says officers would quickly question why he wasn't wearing a seatbelt while behind the wheel. Then they realized why. He has no arms.
Steve Simonar stands in front of his modified pickup truck in Saskatoon, Sask., on Wednesday. Saskatoon police say they have safety concerns about Simonar who has no arms and was caught driving without wearing a seatbelt. ( Liam Richards / The Canadian Press )
He says the surprised officers usually looked him over and let him off with “have a nice day.” “Nobody ever gave me a seatbelt ticket because, you know, I can't wear one. I can't put it on,” Simonar explained Wednesday. The owner of a Saskatoon construction company is fighting his first seatbelt ticket, a $175-fine issued last week during a city traffic blitz.

Simonar said he was angry and hurt by the fine and plans to file a complaint with Saskatoon police. He wants the officer who approved the ticket to rip it up and apologize. “I'm a rare bird . . . and that's what kind of makes this whole thing stupid,” he said. “I'm the exception to the rule and it has to be treated that way.” He has had many vehicles modified over the years so he can drive with his feet. His left foot turns a small steering wheel near the floor and his right foot works the gas and brake pedals. He also uses his feet to open the door of his pickup truck and turn the key in the ignition. In 1985, Simonar had finished a summer day of sailing north of Saskatoon, with two of his young children and a friend. The kids were on the beach and the men were pulling the boat onto shore when its mast hit a power line.
Simonar said his buddy died instantly and he was rushed to hospital. His arms were burned from the inside out and both limbs had to be amputated to his shoulders. The 55-year-old, who is married and now has four children, needs help each day doing most things, such as getting dressed and eating. But he can drive on his own.

Simonar said shortly after he lost his arms, he passed a driving test using his feet. And Saskatchewan Government Insurance has approved all of his modified vehicles. He also used to carry a doctor's note explaining the obvious: he can't put on a seatbelt. He didn't know the rules had changed requiring him to apply to SGI for a medical exemption. SGI spokeswoman Kellie Brinkworth said doctors were previously allowed to grant the exemptions. In 2000, legislation changed requiring approval from SGI with a doctor's note. “At that time, we sent a letter to every person with an existing exemption letting them know about the change and what would be required to maintain their exemption,” Brinkworth said. Six permanent seatbelt exemptions were approved in the province last year, she said. Simonar said he didn't know about the requirement until police pulled him over last Thursday. An RCMP officer first walked up to his window and then called over a supervising city police officer. Simonar said the Mountie didn't want to issue the ticket but the city constable was adamant. “He said, ‘Well, if you can't wear a seatbelt, then you shouldn't be driving.' “It just blew me away.” Saskatoon police spokeswoman Alyson Edwards said the force is concerned for the man's safety and the safety of the public. “Wearing a seatbelt is the law. We realize there are people who have different needs and they can apply and be granted medical exemptions. And in those cases we would not write tickets, but this gentleman did not have that.” Edwards said the officer gave Simonar information on how to apply for a seatbelt exemption. The constable and the staff sergeant in charge of the Saskatoon police traffic unit then met with Simonar on Wednesday to explain why they issued the ticket. And how they legally can't withdraw it. “The staff sergeant certainly wanted to try and bring about some understanding on both sides and get our point across,” she said. “We had to issue a ticket to someone who we really didn't want to issue a ticket to . . . but we can't just simply look away and say, ‘drive on.'” Simonar described the meeting as a waste of time. The officer who ordered the ticket was firm and told him all drivers need to be treated the same. “I told him, ‘You think this is over? This is so far from over. I still maintain you're going to rip this ticket up and you're going to give me an apology, even if you don't like it.' “He just sat there so smug and ignorant and arrogant, just rolling his eyes.” Simonar said he is already in the process of applying for a medical exemption. And, since police probably won't get rid of the ticket, he'll be fighting it in traffic court. He earlier fought a parking fine in court, arguing he was unable to plug coins in the meter, he said. He lost. He said the prosecutor told the judge Simonar should have been able to use his teeth to put in some change.

Winter Storm Helena, the eighth named storm of the 2016-17 season, was pulling out in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday after delivering more than a foot of snow in parts of New England after coating the South with snow and ice.
Overall, the track of Helena was a bit farther north and west than originally expected in parts of the South and East. Areas expecting more snow ended up getting more sleet and ice in the Southeast, while more moderate snow totals crept closer to parts of the I-95 corridor in New York City and Philadelphia.
The storm delayed flights, made roads treacherous and closed schools and businesses. It left bitterly cold temperatures in its wake.
Schools in the South were already canceling classes Monday because of lingering ice on roads or the unusual cold.
How do we Turn Welsh Projects into Welsh Jobs?
How do we Turn Welsh Projects into Welsh Jobs?
New Welsh infrastructure projects offer a massive opportunity for young people in Wales – provided they are given the right skills, says Sir Derek Jones.
Sir Derek, the former Permanent Secretary of the Welsh Government, wants major new projects to be seen as a way to help disadvantaged young people get into high-value work.
He was speaking ahead of the ‘Growing Wales Together' panel discussion on harnessing the potential of the next generation – at The Principality Stadium in Cardiff on June 14.
Sir Derek will be hosting the event as the new Chair of the Council to youth charity, The Prince's Trust Cymru.
He said:
“We're at the stage now where landmark projects are being approved, or at the point of approval. “We can think of Rail Electrification and the Metro systems in both North and South Wales, the M4 relief road and the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station to name a few – and there are many other capital projects and inward investments in the Welsh pipeline. “They all represent a huge opportunity for young people in Wales to become part of the next generation of skilled workers. “At the same time, we know there are thousands of disadvantaged young people who are not currently in employment, education, or training. We need to collaborate to get them inspired and work-ready. “The work is going to be done. The question is – who's going to do it? Social justice and economic efficiency can go hand-in-hand.”
The panel discussion will ask how Welsh institutions can work together to enable these young people to play a real role in growing Wales.
Sitting alongside Sir Derek on the panel will be:
Ali Abdi – Cardiff University
Alwen Williams – BT Cymru
Ian Price – CBI Wales
Julie James and Dr Rachel Garside-Jones – Welsh Government
Phil Jones – The Prince's Trust Cymru
Sharon Lusher – Pembrokeshire College and ColegauCymru
The free event runs from 8.30am-11am and includes breakfast and networking opportunities.

He is what you might call, with some understatement, a catch. Chris Gray, 57, is tall and attractive with dark hair and blue eyes.
By his own admission, he is ‘very well‑off', owns several properties, including a £1.3 million terraced house in affluent Chiswick, West London, and is financially set for life, thanks to a series of successful investments.
A widower, Chris is educated and well‑travelled — in part thanks to his previous career as a BBC cameraman of 30 years' standing.
The cherry on the cake? For hobbies, he flies small aircraft and enjoys dining in Michelin-starred restaurants.
Five single men shared why they've struggled to find women worth dating. Chris Gray, 57, (pictured) says 'I'm all for female equality, so why do 99 per cent of women expects me to always foot the bill'
So why, you might wonder, has Chris joined the growing band of British men, old and young, who have sworn off women for ever?
It's simple, he says. There simply aren't any good women out there.
‘I have given up. I have many female friends, but I can't be bothered to deal with all the hang-ups and complications other women have,' he says.
‘Often, at my stage in life, many of them are divorced and seem full of bitterness and anger.'
That's certainly not the only complaint single men such as Chris direct at potential female partners they meet.
Indeed, after the Mail recently recounted the stories of attractive single women who appeared to have everything, yet said they still couldn't find a decent man, there was a significant backlash from male readers.
Men told us in their droves that it wasn't they who were to blame — but women.
They insisted romances failed today, not because of male laziness and a lack of attention to their physical appearance as claimed, but because women are picky and demanding divas, who either treat dates like job interviews or are all too keen to leap into bed.
Above all else, though, men said women are increasingly status and money-obsessed. While they might be full of the entitlements of feminism and happy to preach the necessity of equality, men said the opposite sex were simultaneously all too keen to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle almost entirely paid for by their male partners.
One MailOnline reader put it succinctly in response to the article's question asking why women were finding it so difficult to find a man with whom to settle down: ‘It's because every man they meet has already been taken for a ride and had his pockets emptied.'
So should the old adage ‘Where have all the good men gone?' really be more applicable to women instead?
Chris is adamant this is the case —and believes single, middle-aged women in particular should look closer to home when casting blame.
You might want to dismiss Chris as just another misogynist. Far from it.
Alex Cavadas, 41, (pictured) a divorced part-time actor, says he' has given up on love after a series of emotionally crushing dates with women seemingly after just money
A devoted husband of 21 years to his late wife Rosie, who also worked in television until her sudden death from an undiagnosed heart condition in 2008, the urbane Chris is as removed from a stereotypical knuckle-dragging woman-hater as you could hope to meet.
Yet even he was astonished by how brutally mercenary some of the middle-aged single women he met were.
‘I was brought up by just my mother and absolutely support female empowerment. But the vast majority of women I met expected the man to pay for everything,' he says. ‘I'm all for female equality, so why did 99 per cent of women expects me to always foot the bill?'
Chris's dating experience was particularly bruising as he spent years grieving, before loneliness led him to online dating and to pay a substantial sum to an introduction agency to find someone with whom to share his life.
But as well as being relentlessly focused on money, he found some of the women he met — and he went on scores of dates — were surprisingly envious.
‘A few years after Rosie died, I felt capable of trying to meet someone, so I joined the brutal triage of online dating. It was such a disappointment. I found women can be so jealous. They very quickly started to make demands. They were jealous of my female friends. Believe it or not, some didn't like that I had photos of my wife still on the wall.'
In addition, many were hell-bent on commitment, treating casual lunch dates more like job interviews for a prospective husband.
There was a gradual realisation that you are complete just as you are. Men can have an entirely content life on their own Chris Gray
‘The introductory agency set me up on a date with an attractive lady in her 50s who had a very powerful job. She texted me, saying she was on her way and to ask for my address so she could park on my street.
‘Minutes later there was a knock on the door. She barged in and started looking around: checking me out, checking out my house. She was a complete stranger to me. It was very odd.'
He says after lunch — which, of course, he paid for — things went even more rapidly downhill.
‘She said: “So, Chris, what about us? Where are we?”
‘I said: “We're on a first date, I don't know.”
‘Women like this are trying to run before they can walk. Maybe, faced with mortality as we all are in our 50s, she was so desperate for a relationship she tried to rush things.'
Chris found he differed from many women he met because, unscarred by the trauma of a divorce, he had none of the resentment that seemed to haunt others. Indeed, he was driven by the loving memories of how wonderful life can be when you have a partner with whom to share it.
‘I loved — love — my wife. I always will. My marriage was very happy. Maybe I was trying to recreate that, but it certainly didn't work.'
After around five years of dating, in 2015 Chris decided enough was enough.
‘There was a gradual realisation that you are complete just as you are. Men can have an entirely content life on their own.'
Ross Foad, 29, (pictured) has been single now for more than two years and says: ‘This is what I want for the rest of my life'
So what's causing this schism between the sexes at the very point in their lives when you might imagine they would be more likely than ever to settle down?
Psychotherapist Teresa Wilson, who runs a practice in South-West London, believes men and women are coming to the dating game in middle age with entirely different perspectives.
While women — now so independent in outlook and behaviour — are much less worried than male counterparts about finding a new long-term partner, men are more likely to have come from a relationship they'd rather have kept.
‘Women don't feel quite so trapped in bad relationships. They've found a certain liberation over the last 20 years,' she says.
‘Men, however, like the stability of a home life provided for them, their creature comforts, and often don't know how they're going to manage except by going into another relationship.
‘Women, meanwhile, are not as fearful [of being alone]. They tell me: “I might find another relationship, but even if I do not, I can cope.” '
Meanwhile, Selena Dogg-ett-Jones, a psychosexual and couples' therapist, sees men as less able to cope with an entirely new dating landscape which has made singletons much pickier about prospective partners.
‘If you're newly divorced, the dating game has changed dramatically; it's all online now,' she says.
‘People who had finished a long-term relationship or were widowed used to be introduced to someone new at a dinner party.
‘But today people will say precisely what they want online. For example, “I only want to meet someone between 40 and 50”, meaning someone aged 51 will not be considered because they're not in the right category. If they met someone for real, they'd maybe not find out their age until they'd been on a couple of dates, by which time they'd probably like them and the age wouldn't matter.
‘But instead, all they're looking at is a photograph and they'll swipe or click “yes” or “no”. It's very difficult.'
Alex Cavadas, 41, a divorced part-time actor, says he's a victim of this pickiness — and has given up on love after a series of emotionally crushing dates with women seemingly set on just one thing: money. ‘Some of the women I've dated were too pushy,' he says. ‘One woman talked to me on the first date about having children and getting married.
‘She asked me how much I make, which is about £400 a week. She told me that wasn't enough, saying: “I have certain standards.”
‘Yes, I'm a struggling actor. But she wasn't well off, either. She was an au pair. She was just looking for a wealthy husband.
‘She told me she thought I was handsome and kind, but not successful or rich enough.'
For Alex, who lives in Mitcham, South London, it has been heartbreaking to find his hopes for love so quashed, especially because he says he was very happily married until recently.
‘I met my wife at a concert in 2004 and we married a few years later. I was smitten instantly,' he recalls.
'The dominant discourse in the Western world is that men are up for sex 24/7. But many men are not' says Alex (file image)
‘Things were great at first, but when our daughter was born in 2014, it felt to me like my wife didn't want me any more. We divorced in 2015.
‘I've been on dates since then, but soon think to myself: “What's the point?”
‘Since my marriage, I have been celibate because I can't find a nice woman.'
Psychotherapist Selena says another reason for men, old and young, being disappointed by modern dating is that today's sexual relationships have been complicated by online dating and pornography.
‘There's an awful lot of instant sex expected with some of the apps, like Tinder. It's meet-for-sex and sometimes it will develop into a relationship.
‘The dominant discourse in the Western world is that men are up for sex 24/7. But many men are not. They want to get to know the woman. They tell me they find it very difficult because they feel rushed; and women are rushing them because they think that's what is expected. Some men can cope with one-night stands, but most do not feel comfortable with them.'
This is the case with Jamie Clows. He may only be 27, but he's already decided to give up on women entirely, disillusioned after a number of painful relationships and subsequent attempts at dating women who, after drinking too much, have proved themselves rather too keen to jump into bed.
Jamie, a small business owner from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, who has a young daughter from a previous relationship, says he is ‘a lot happier being single'.
‘It all ends the same way,' he says resignedly. ‘I don't want to go on dates. It depresses me.
Jamie has found himself agreeing with a growing army of single men who make up the online community called MGTOW — Men Going Their Own Way (file image)
‘Some women have become violent, in jealous rages for no reason, because they've been drinking too much.
‘I'd rather go for a walk than to the pub. But I've found it hard to meet anyone the same as me.
‘Some women have asked me to sleep with them on the first night. They get drunk and wear very revealing clothes, too. I think women who do this doesn't respect themselves, and I can't respect them, either.'
Jamie has found himself agreeing with a growing army of single men who make up the online community called MGTOW — Men Going Their Own Way — which has tens of thousands of followers. On this website, disillusioned males come to share relationship problems, their struggles for equal access to children and describe being freer, happier and wealthier for shunning relationships.
The philosophy of MGTOW, which began in America in the Seventies, is described as a ‘statement of self-ownership, where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty above all else'.
On its website, it lists great men throughout history — among them Beethoven and Sir Isaac Newton — who were all single and, as a consequence, says MGTOW, led fulfilled lives packed with accomplishments.
It's a group Jamie admits he never imagined he would find kinship with: ‘When I was younger, I always dreamed I would get married. No more.'
Trelawney Kerrigan, a consultant for the Dating Agency Association, says: 'After a couple of knock-backs, [men] will shrivel up. They are easily disillusioned; women are better at brushing themselves off' (file image)
Ross Foad, 29, is another who subscribes to this philosophy. A talented actor, comedian and writer, he is charismatic, confident, fit and attractive.
But he says he has no interest in ever finding anyone with whom to spend his life.
For Ross, from Kingston-upon-Thames, south-west London, says: ‘I don't hate women — I have many female friends. I just can't give them what they want, which is commitment, attention and time. I want to concentrate on my career. I like to write, create films and be active.'
Ross has been single now for more than two years and says: ‘This is what I want for the rest of my life.'
Another factor, experts say, is that men are actually more sensitive than women, and struggle to deal with romantic knock-backs.
Trelawney Kerrigan, a consultant for the Dating Agency Association, says: ‘Women will take a more positive approach while men, after a couple of knock-backs, will shrivel up. They are easily disillusioned; women are better at brushing themselves off.
‘It's a confidence thing with men. You often hear men saying there are not enough genuine people out there and nobody's taking it seriously.'
Danny Webster, a 33-year-old radio presenter from Birmingham, who has been single for more than three years following the break-up of a long-term relationship, admits he's given up on women because of painful rejections.
‘I think women don't want nice men like me. They want bad boys,' he says. ‘I've found the knock-backs hard to deal with and decided a few years ago I'm better off alone. I'm meeting more people of this mindset. Increasing numbers of men are choosing to be independent.'
However, Danny does admit he finds the fact he will not have children difficult to bear.
‘It's one part of my life I yearn for, because when I see all my other friends with kids, I feel I should have them, too.
‘But there is no one holding me back. I can come and go as I please. A lot of men would give their right arm to have that freedom.'

No matter what profession you have chosen, you have to deliver the goods with consistency every time. As graphic designers, this is especially true. We have to be consistent in our time management skills as well as the product we produce for our clients.
Do you set a schedule for yourself to separate your personal time from work time? Or do you fly by the seat of your pants leaving your best ideas to come at three am when you know you have a seven am deadline? Do you work the same way, using the same work patterns every time? Is there a method to your madness? And when was the last time you saw the top of your desk?
These are all part of creating an effective atmosphere to do your best work. Let's explore the reasons behind wanting consistency in your work habits.
Set A Schedule To Separate Personal Time And Work Time
Do you set a schedule for yourself to separate your personal time from work time? Most of us work from home at least part of the time and life has a way of interfering with the work process, whether it's kids, the dog, or the phone. All of it cuts into time we could be using more effectively.
Success can be measured by the amount of consistency in your life. Post a calendar on the office door and put a work schedule on it. Even if it's only two hours a day, be consistent. Post reminders on the refrigerator and the bathroom mirror. Tell all your friends and family not to call during that time unless it is an emergency. Put the dog out, go get a drink, go to the bathroom if you need to, before it's time to go to work.
When you work out in the real world, these are things you would do without thinking about it. These are all patterns of consistency.
Be Consistent, Be Organized, Increase Efficiency
Do you work the same way? When you sit down at your desk to work for a client, do you approach it the same way for every client? I know you're sitting there saying to yourself it can't be done because all clients are different, right? And you are partially right, all clients are different, but the manner in which you take care of them has to be consistent.
Do your clients have organized folders, or is it the pile near the file cabinet, next to the pile of research material you were going to read last week? Did you create thumbnail sketches and took notes when you meet your new client? If you didn't, it will make your job a lot harder to start as well as finish.
If you get into a habit of being consistent with every client, you will develop habits, and you will forget fewer things that are important to each project. This leads to increased efficiency. And increased efficiency leads to working smarter, not harder, which has a direct connection to your bank account. I personally like that last part about having a direct connection to my bank account. I like to get paid, as I'm sure everyone else does too.
Clean Your Desk – Make More Money
When was the last time you saw the top of your desk? Has it been months, possibly years? Here's a heads-up for you. A cluttered desk is not the sign of a clear mind. Recently, the Today Show did a series of reports on organized people vs. cluttered people. According to the report, people that were organized made more money.
I don't remember the exact day, but it was during February, 2008. What an epiphany! If I clean my desk I will make more money. This simply adds weight to what I already suspected, organization pays. It is absolutely amazing the amount of work I can get done if I know where to find things. Therefore, I have added another step to being more consistent and it works.
Purchase an inexpensive box of manila folders and a small filing cabinet (about $5 at the thrift store), get an ink pen that works and step up about once a week. You might be amazed too.
It Takes Time And Efforts, But It's Worth It
Consistency takes time and effort to work. It's kind of like planting grass seed. Everyday you look at what you planted and think it is never going to grow. Then one day you look out and you need to mow it. By doing a little planning ahead, setting a schedule, and keeping your work area uncluttered you will be able to provide the same quality to your last client as you did to your first. Before you know it, you'll be mowing down objections, clearing a path of creativity, and raking in more money.
Take a thirty day challenge using some or all of these tips to increase your efficiency. See if consistency counts for you too!

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: We're broadcasting from Marrakech, Morocco, here at the U.N. climate summit, but we're covering events closely that are taking place in the United States, and we'll soon bring you voices of protest from the front lines in New York.
Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center are slamming President-elect Donald Trump for naming Stephen Bannon to become his chief strategist. Bannon is the former head of the right-wing outlet, news outlet, Breitbart Media. He took over as Trump's campaign manager in August. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said, quote, “It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the 'alt-right'—a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists—is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house,'” unquote.
The Southern Poverty Law Center accused Bannon of becoming, quote, “the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill,” unquote. Even former Breitbart employees have spoken out about what the site became under Bannon's watch. The site's former editor-in-chief, Ben Shapiro, recently said that staffers are now openly pushing white ethno-nationalism. Donald Trump announced Bannon would become chief strategist on Saturday. Trump has also tapped RNC Chair Reince Preibus to serve as his chief of staff.
Steve Bannon has also faced questions about domestic abuse. He was charged in 1996 with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. A Santa Monica, California, police report said Bannon grabbed then-wife Mary Louise Piccard “by the throat and arm” and threatened to leave him with—to leave with the couple's twin daughters. Bannon pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were dropped later that year when Piccard did not appear in court. Piccard claimed in divorce proceedings that Bannon pressured her not to testify. Piccard also said in a sworn 2007 court filing that Bannon made anti-Semitic comments when the two argued over whether to send their daughters to a private school. According to one document, Piccard said, quote, “He said that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats' and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews,” unquote.
Joining us in New York is Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
So, Richard Cohen, you got the news, with everyone else, that Steve Bannon would be the chief strategist for Donald Trump. Your thoughts?
RICHARD COHEN: Well, it was incredibly disheartening, Amy. You know, the night that Trump was elected, he said that he was going to be the president for all Americans, that he was going to bind the wounds of division—wounds, of course, that he had caused. And now we see him doing the opposite, you know, appointing someone who was very proud to give a platform to the alt-right. And, you know, the alt-right is nothing more than the rebranding of white supremacy, white nationalism, for the digital age. So, Trump says one thing the day he's elected, does something else at this point. It's really discouraging, really disheartening. And, you know, it doesn't portend well for his administration, I'm afraid.
AMY GOODMAN: Richard, describe more fully what is the alt-right. What is the Breitbart News website and the significance of Bannon now being the number two man for President—soon-to-be President Trump?
RICHARD COHEN: You know, when—Breitbart traditionally was a very conservative website. But under Bannon, it's become a cesspool for white supremacy, according to one of his former colleagues. You know, the alt-right is white nationalism. It rejects multiculturalism. It's opposed to immigration. You know, the godfather of the alt-right is a fellow named Richard Spencer. His motto is “All men are created unequal.” He believes that black people are intellectually inferior. He calls for, you know, the peaceful ethnic cleansing of our country. He was ecstatic when Trump was elected, and, I'm sure, equally ecstatic now that Bannon is in the White House.
AMY GOODMAN: Talk about Bannon's background. Talk about his operating of Breitbart News.
RICHARD COHEN: Yeah, you know, look, I don't want to talk about Bannon's personal background. I'll just talk about what he's done at Breitbart News. I mean, anyone can go and look at the archives there and see unbelievable stuff. Two weeks after the Charleston massacre, for example, you know, they ran an article talking about how people should proudly fly the federal—the Confederate flag. They've talked about Islam as a religion of a rape culture. He mocked women who are, you know, the victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. It's obsessed with kind of, you know, the so-called scourge of black-on-white crime. It's racist. It's misogynist. It's anti-Semitic. It's everything that this country should not be.
AMY GOODMAN: Former Breitbart employees have spoken out. This is the site's former editor-in-chief, Ben Shapiro, who wrote, quote, “Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website, with [Milo] Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.” This is Shapiro speaking to CNN earlier this year.
BEN SHAPIRO: Steve likes to think of himself as the big bear tearing everybody else down because he's a big power player. And, look, it's got him where he is now. I think that, again, Steve Bannon—I tweeted this morning, imagine that one of the worst people you know is heading up a presidential campaign, and that's pretty much, you know, where I'm at this morning.
AMY GOODMAN: You've been listening to—Richard Cohen, your response?
RICHARD COHEN: Trump knew what he was doing. You know, he ran a racist campaign from the first day that he came down the escalator at Trump Tower. You know, he vilified Mexicans. He vilified Latinos. He vilified women, black communities, Muslims. And of course, you know, he brought Steve Bannon in because Steve Bannon reflected his views. And unfortunately now, he hasn't pivoted, despite his words after the election, and he's continuing to embrace Bannon. I wish he would change.
AMY GOODMAN: Richard Cohen, as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, you know, I asked you first about Bannon. What about Donald Trump and his election, and what this means, and the report that you've put out, Richard, through the Southern Poverty Law Center, of the number of attacks this week on vulnerable people, and, overall, your response?
RICHARD COHEN: Well, look, the—you mentioned 200 attacks. The number is well over 300 now. And, you know, they're happening everywhere. A lot are happening in schools. We're seeing them in places like Wal-Mart, Starbucks. We're seeing them, you know, just at traffic stops, where people are being—you know, people of color are being harassed by people who are passing them and screaming “Trump!” You know, it's an ugly, incendiary thing.
Last night, Donald Trump was on 60 Minutes, and he said, “Stop it.” And, of course, he also said it only happened one or two times. He terribly downplayed it. You know, so Trump needs to say more than “stop it.” He needs to speak out forcefully against all forms of bigotry. And then he has to follow talk with the walk. He has to stop putting people like Bannon in the administration. He has to throw them out and assure the American public that no one with hate crime ties, no one with hate in their hearts, is going to have any role whatsoever in our democracy.
AMY GOODMAN: So these reports around the country of these assaults, of people marching through schools and saying “Build that wall” or “Make America white again,” the reports we have from Philadelphia to Boston, something unprecedented, where the schools are sending counselors into the classrooms because these kids are so frightened—
RICHARD COHEN: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: —after the election of Donald Trump.
RICHARD COHEN: Look, they were frightened before the election. They were frightened by the rhetoric that Donald Trump was spewing during the election. We did a big survey during the election asking teachers what was happening in their schools. We never used Trump's name in the survey, but we didn't have to. A Thousand teachers wrote back and talked about the horrible things that were happening in their school, you know, an incredible increase in bullying, an incredible increase in ugly—in ugly talk, heartbreaking stories of young children in elementary schools really being fearful, coming up to a teacher every day saying, “Has he built the wall yet? Are my parents going to be deported?” So, you know, this is just a continuation of what we saw in the campaign, but it's really been quite intensified since the day of the election.
AMY GOODMAN: Richard Cohen, is there anything you want to add before we go to the voices of the streets of New York, tens of thousands of people continuing to protest? This was before the appointment of Steve Bannon to be the number two man for a President Trump.
RICHARD COHEN: You know, I would just urge people to stand strong, be careful, don't give up hope. One of the sad things of the election was, you know, 43 million Americans who were eligible to vote did not. That's 100 million people. I don't know how those 100 million people would have voted, but I think our democracy will be healthier when everyone speaks. And so I hope this energy that we're seeing in these demonstrations translates into increased political participation in our country.
AMY GOODMAN: And, Richard Cohen, finally, how Donald Trump has responded to the attacks on people of color, on immigrants around the country?
RICHARD COHEN: He hasn't done enough. He has minimized the number of attacks. He said there's one or two; there have been hundreds. His alter ego at Breitbart has said that they're all just a hoax and a fraud. He needs to do much, much more, if America is, you know, going to be a country that embraces all of its citizens.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, Richard Cohen, I want to thank you for joining us from New York. Democracy Now! is in Marrakech, Morocco, for the U.N. climate summit. But I can tell you every other word out of people's mouths here from around the planet is “Donald Trump.”
RICHARD COHEN: Thank you, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN: Another issue, of course, is his climate denial, of deep concern to people here at the U.N. climate summit. Richard Cohen is president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. We'll link to his latest report at democracynow.org. When we come back, though, voices from the streets, protests in the United States. Stay with us.
Macedonia, OH - An Akron man tried to avoid an arrest on shoplifting charges by jumping into a Macedonia police cruiser, according to a report released Monday.Kevin Moultry, 45, is jailed on $100,000 bond after his initial appearance Monday in Stow Municipal Court. He is charged with aggravated robbery, theft, attempted assault on a police officer.Moultry and two others walked around Walmart about 11:30 p.m. Saturday. They filled a cart with $193 worth of steak, shrimp, tilapia, lobster, chocolates and Skittles, according to police reports.Moultry pushed the cart out of the store without paying, police said. He packed up a friend's Nissan SUV as a Walmart security guard who monitored the trio alerted a Macedonia police officer. The officer arrived and asked Moultry if he stole anything, and Moultry told the officer that he didn't. He also denied the officer's request to search the Nissan. The officer went and looked in the windowof the car and saw the items in the backseat, police reports say.Moultry ran around the parking lot and jumped into the officer's cruiser, police said.The officer grabbed Moultry through the open window and used a stun gun on his chest, according to police reports. Moultry stepped on the accelerator and drove the cruiser into the back of the Nissan SUV with the officer hanging through the window, police said. The vehicles were only several feet apart. He continued pressing on the accelerator in the hopes the cruiser could push the SUV out of the way, according to police.The officer reached into the car and put it in park. Moultry punched the officer two or three times in the face, then jumped out of the other side of the cruiser, police said. Moultry ran back into Walmart, shed his hat and coat and tried to leave the store.Officers from Northfield Village and the Summit County Sheriff arrived to help. Moultry ran from around the parking lot avoiding cruisers. Another Macedonia officer arrived and struck Moultry when he darted from behind a parked car, according to police. Moultry was thrown to the ground and arrested.He was treated by paramedics and was taken to Hillcrest Hospital. His injuries are not considered life-threatening, according to police. The officer had a bruised and cut lip from being punched.The other man with Moultry, Robert Mayberry Jr., 57, of Elyria, pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanor obstructing justice in connection with the incident.He was fined $100. The woman fled from the area during the incident and has not yet been identified by police.
Josh Colle remembers the “glory days” of the TTC, more than two decades ago, when the transit system was a thing to be emulated around the world.
His dad, Mike Colle, was chairman of the commission then, and he would often field requests from European or Asian counterparts wanting to come to Toronto or have him travel to them to talk about the tricks of the trade.
Now, the TTC is groaning to keep up with record ridership, suffering from years of inaction on expansion, and modernizing too slowly for impatient, travel-weary commuters. And now it's Mr. Colle, the junior, who is poised to assume the chair of the Toronto Transit Commission.
If approved by city council, he will become one of the more recognizable politicians in the city, serving in the John Tory administration. The 41-year-old councillor describes himself as a realist when it comes to how much can actually change during the next term.
“I do think there has to be a greater emphasis on existing levels of service and the experience of a rider and the value they get from their fares,” he said Monday as he descended the steps of St. Patrick Station into the heart of the subway grid.
“The fixation always seems to be on expansion and I get that. It's great debate and it's sexy. But most people on this train, they're going to talk about crowding, reliability, the fact that five years ago for them to get to work or home, it took this amount of time and now it takes this much longer.”
The councillor has some ideas for tangible changes in the short term, chief among them the unfurling of a robust system of express buses. He said the TTC also has to make “way more progress” on the Presto electronic fare card and reinstate some of the bus routes cut during the Ford years.
He'll have to grapple with finding the money to pay for all that, and Mr. Tory's campaign pledge to freeze transit fares next year.
“The challenge with fares is: Do you artificially freeze them to keep the sting away from people's pocketbooks, or do you just take the approach where it's a much more modest, regular, predictable increase that people can plan around. Unfortunately, politics get in the way of that.”
Mr. Colle agrees that riders have paid “a lot” and the first approach would be to find the money elsewhere, but “easier said than done.” The TTC also has to get better at generating revenue through the system, he argued, with retail opportunities, or by marketing its brand like New York City or the London Tube do.
And while he doesn't want the commission to get “swallowed up” by expansion debate, he supports Mr. Tory's SmartTrack plan.
On a Downtown Relief Line, he said: “My fear with the DRL is that everyone thinks it's going to bring world peace and feed hungry children. It's a route we're obviously working towards and commitments have been made, but I'm a bit confused as to why people feel it's such a cure-all.”
On a mid-afternoon ride on the University-Spadina line, one of the new trains is blissfully crowd-free as the councillor boards, heading north. No one showed signs of recognizing Mr. Colle, although commuters did look bemused by the impromptu photo shoot.
The second-term representative for Eglinton-Lawrence doesn't usually take transit to work because he has to drop his children off at school, but he uses it to get to constituency commitments, especially around Lawrence Heights.
“Let's see if this elevator is done,” he says at Lawrence West station. Up the escalators, there are orange pylons and a fenced off area with a sign thanking riders for their patience. The elevators are due to open later this month, after eight years of being shut down, Mr. Colle said. Problems with tendering and changes to the project including a platform extension caused it to drag on.
It begs a question, though. “Maybe we're great transit operators, but maybe we're not great project managers,” the councillor said. “I think those are some of the discussions this commission has to have, and this council.”

Despair; Murky, Dank Nothingness; Melody Drenched in Filth; and Monolithic Feedback are some of the words that come to my mind as I listen to the new HAGGATHA album entitled V that is coming out via Nerve Altar//Mass Deadening on Jan. 2oth. These Vancouver dealers of CAUSTIC DOOM have fucking done it again and created a record that will be my soundtrack for getting high as fuck for a while to come. V has the kind of riffs that just drip black resin, but it's the notes of empathy that draw me in more than anything. When you hear HAGGATHA it's easy to realize that this band is one of the sickest doing it right now and should be heard by all! That is why CVLT Nation is way beyond honored to be sharing V in full below! Stay tuned for our full review of the new HAGGATHA LP, and if this band ever comes to your town, do not miss the show…TRUST ME – THEY ARE SICK LIVE!!!…NERVE ALTAR pre-order in effect HERE & MASS DEADENING pre-order in effect HERE!
Ballot access is a long, complicated, expensive slog for third parties and independent candidates, and states often throw silly spanners into the works just to make it more complicated.
The state of Connecticut, for example, had a law requiring that anyone who collected signatures for ballot access has to be a resident of the state.
Since the ballot petitioner economy is more or less built on itinerant activist pros or semipros, this requirement made the already difficult job of ballot access even harder.
The Libertarian Party of Connecticut sued over the law, with the help of the ACLU of Connecticut, and won this week.
Excerpt from the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Janet C. Hall:
the challenged petitioning statutes, which require that petition circulators in Connecticut be residents of the State of Connecticut, contravene the Plaintiff's First Amendment rights. The Court has also determined that the loss of First Amendment rights of Plaintiff constitutes an irreparable injury, that the balance of equities favors an injunction, and that an injunction is in the public interest. In light of this Court's conclusion of unconstitutionality of a portion of Conn. Gen. Stat. § 9-453e that requires a petition circulator to be a resident of Connecticut...[the state is forbidden to continue enforcing only those aspects of the law relating to the collector being a state resident]

BREAKING NEWS UPDATE
Everyone Loves Freedom
Mr. Pi has been captured and imprisoned. He was last seen wearing Raspbian and a 512MB hip jacket. The only way for him to survive is by someone entering in his serial number, found by typing ‘cat /etc/proc, in at the local Pi Embassy.
We have smuggled in a few lines of code on a dusty and bitter Arduino that allows Mr. Pi to send “tweets”. Mr. P will tweet us any information he can @FreeMrPi. We are helping him triangulate his current IP address so we can get him out of that terrible place.
The first person to correctly identify his serial number to the embassy will get to have Mr. Pi live with them in their home forever.
Task:
Let's get Mr. Pi to a safe home.
Prize:
A Model B Raspberry Pi. (We will actually send you a new one). Or if you already have a Pi, we will make a donation to the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
Aim/Goal/Why?
The Raspberry Pi is a cool tool with lots of uses but it has the potential to expose new users to vulnerabilities if not properly secured. We are hoping for an educational experience on how to secure all devices and some fun too. The goal is not to teach DDOS attacks as the Pi would be an easy target to overwhelm.
Entry:
Follow @FreeMrPi on Twitter to get the latest information on how to penetrate the enemy camp.
Attack Surface:
The Pi is running the default install of Raspbian with a few extra surprises added by the mean captors.
The Raspberry Pi's is housed in a secure datacenter. Please do not try to gain physical access. They will distroy Mr. Pi.
We want this to be educational – not impossible or a cake-walk. Please contact us if you have any suggestions.
Some Inspiration Before the Rules:
Rules:
There are no rules. Just kidding, always rules. Users must be 18 years or older (or have written permission from a parent or guardian prior to entering). Participant must be eligible to win this contest and receive a prize in their country (know your laws). Do not break any laws when attacking this sweet Pi. For example, do not turn your neighbor's computer into a Pi cracking bot. This action will result in a forfeit and unfortunately we will have to comply with any law enforcement officers. Winner's shipping costs cannot exceed 15 US Dollars. Unfortunately, we can also not ship where the United States does not allow shipping. If legally able, we would still encourage you to play and donate your winning elsewhere . If there is a tax for winning a $50 item in your country, again you are responsible for paying (sorry). If you have physical access to the Pi's being hacked (e.g. datacenter employee), you are ineligible to win. ThomasLoughlin.com has the right to republish how you attacked and hardened the Pi. Full credit will be given to the author.
OTTAWA — Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz is appointing a seven-member advisory council to develop a short list of Canadian women who could appear on the next series of banknotes. The bank has already issued an open call for nominations, which runs to April 15 and has had more than 18,000 submissions. Poloz says the council will develop a list of three to five candidates and he and Finance Minister Bill Morneau will discuss the names, with Morneau making the final decision. The council members are: writer Gurjinder Basran; Michael Redhead Champagne, youth activist and founder of AYO! (Aboriginal Youth Opportunities); Margaret Conrad, professor emerita, University of New Brunswick; Francine Descarries, sociology professor, Universite du Quebec a Montreal; Perdita Felicien, world champion hurdler; Merna Forster, historian and author; Dominic Giroux, president and vice-chancellor, Laurentian University.Poloz and Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor, are making the announcement at Roberta Bondar Public School in Ottawa, where students from that school and from Ecole elementaire publique Gabrielle-Roy are showcasing art featuring inspirational women. "It's great to see women from different times and places inspiring children today," Poloz said. "We hope that this new banknote will inspire all girls and boys to see themselves as notable—perhaps even one day 'bank-notable' —contributors to Canada." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last month that a woman would be featured on the next issue of banknotes due out in 2018. Like HuffPost Canada Business On Facebook

Patrick O'Brian 's acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as "a masterpiece" (David Mamet, New York Times), "addictively readable" (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and "the best historical novels ever written" (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which "should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century" (George Will). Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O'Brian's twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format. In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O'Brian wrote several books including the novels Testimonies, The Golden Ocean, and The Unknown Shore, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture's biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherriere's memoir Papillon. O'Brian died in January 2000.

Be it Kickstarter, be it IndieGoGo, be it whatever new flavour of eBusking comes to pass, crowdsourced funding of indie games' development is a remarkable and wonderful addition to this ever-changing industry. It will lead to great things, I am quite sure. But it does present a number of issues for the media – or at least for this particular site, whose loose remit is ‘post about what we're personally interested in.' Lately, that comes with an additional responsibility.
1) If we post about a Kickstarter project, we're essentially implying our readers should donate to it. Everyone makes their own spending decision based on their own feelings and research of course – but it can still be the case that for many of our revered readership, the deal wasn't even on the table until it appeared here.
2) Without having played the game(s) in question, and most likely without seeing anything meangingful of it for many months to come, we can't attest to that project's quality, to the likelihood of the results being as described, or of it even coming to pass at all. This is why ‘celebrity' KS projects tend to get covered more frequently here – the odds of a big name pulling off what they promise would seem to be much higher than an apparent unknown living up to their claims. 3) We receive several emails about new KS projects each and every day. That's on top of all the mails about other indie projects, and mainstream press releases, and updates to MMOs and F2p games and and and. We can barely read about them all, let alone post about them all – and, even more crucially, let alone post about them from an suitably educated position that ensures we're doing our duty to you guys. 4) If we do post about one, that might well be instead of posting about another KS project – or an already existent indie game that you could pay for (or not) and play right now, rather than months or years down the line. 5) Occasionally an indie or KS-funded game leverages its community to mass-mail us in the hope of posting about it. As well as being a practical complication to doing our jobs (imagine if your inbox suddenly filled with essentially the same message, dozens or hundreds of times over), it presents a huge moral dilemma. Some might argue that it's passion at play and deserves coverage as a result. I'd argue that's mob rule – so if we post about it, we're posting about it for the wrong reasons, because we've been battered into submission rather than because we're enthusiastic about it. If a big publisher did similar, and if we posted as a result, it would be a scandal. 6)This sounds horrifically arrogant, but the extent of RPS' reach means that we can potentially alter the fortunes of KS projects we do post about. That's a frightening responsibility as much as it is an exciting one.
The golden ideal, of course, is getting to play some aspect of Kickstarted games before we decide whether to post. Trouble is Kickstarter basically exists to fund games that don't. Though even that's changing – we're seeing more and more projects that are already significantly into development but opt to switch to crowdsourced funding, and that presents a whole new dilemma. Support projects that already have money, or those that don't.
So, while we do have plenty of our own ideas about how to approach the crowdsourced revolution, I'd like to open it up to the floor. What are your requirements for placing your faith in a KS project? How do you feel about our covering stuff of lesser or non-existent heritage? Should an ambitious but unproven KS game from an ambitious but unproven dev be posted about at, potentially, the expense of an indie game that's already on sale (edit – I mean this in mean in terms of the quantity of games we can physically, as mere mortals, hear about, research, in ideal circumstances play and then post about in a given day/week/month/lifetime)? How much information should we track down on a KS project before we cover it?
Again, our decisions will be ultimately our own and, as with the Kickstarter stuff itself, mob rule won't force our hand, but I am very interested in what those outside the gaming press feel are the essential factors and best practices in this brave new world of paying for a game before it exists.
UC Berkeley alumnus Assaf Pashut officially opened the doors to The Flying Falafel in Downtown Berkeley on Saturday.
The falafel shop, located at 2114 Shattuck Ave., is the second location for The Flying Falafel chain, owned by Pashut. Pashut opened the first location about three years ago in San Francisco.
Pashut's first exposure to the falafel-making business occurred when he was a student at UC Berkeley, where he would set up “Falafel Friday” booths on Sproul Plaza for club fundraisers.
As his falafel began to gain popularity among fellow students and the community, Pashut decided he would try to expand his business to the local farmers market. This is where he began to attract loyal customers for the past eight years.
“I was always afraid to start a restaurant — you hear all these horror stories about losing your life savings,” Pashut said.
Pashut clearly remembers the moment three years ago that changed his mind about entering the restaurant business.
“I lived in San Francisco and got falafel from a nearby place one day. I asked the guy working there for extra cucumbers. He said he'd have to ask his manager, then came back and told me it'd cost an extra dollar,” Pashut said. “I'm thinking, ‘Man, really? They're so generous in Israel with food, and here you have to pay extra for cucumbers?' I vowed that I was going to open a restaurant after that.”
Pashut said he was traveling abroad when a real estate agent called, asking if he was interested in property that had become available in Berkeley. Pashut said yes, and within about three weeks the restaurant was open.
“I want to make sure I meet every single customer here in Berkeley and ensure that everyone feels like a king and queen,” Pashut said.
Customers at The Flying Falafel can order their falafel in either a whole wheat pita bread pocket or plate. The falafel is available in two flavors, organic sesame and spicy, which cannot be found anywhere else, according to Pashut. A variety of vegetables and sauces are also offered as toppings.
“They're offering something a little different than other Mediterranean restaurants in their genre,” said Matthew Jervis, vitality director of the Downtown Berkeley Association. “So I think they fit in really nicely.”
Other surrounding restaurant owners seem unaffected by the opening of The Flying Falafel. Many are eager to see the diversity in Berkeley's food scene. Mohamed Aboghanem, a chef at Saha Mediterranean restaurant, said The Flying Falafel offers good falafel quickly.
“It's all coming full circle for me. One decade later, I'm coming back to Berkeley,” Pashut said.

Though we learned Thursday that Major League Soccer bought Chivas USA from Jorge Vergara and Angelica Fuentes and that there would be an eventual rebranding, it is worth considering the future of the proposed rebrands we reported about on Monday.
The "Los Angeles SC" and "Los Angeles F.C." names and crests trademarked by Chivas Guadalajara Licensing LLC in Carson, California are essentially dead now, and MLS Commissioner Don Garber said as much during his conference call about the sale Thursday.
"I'm sure as the Vergaras were going through the process of whether they were going to sell, or whether they were going to keep the team, my guess is they were thinking about whether or not they would rebrand."
But here's the kicker:
"It's not really relevant to what we're talking about here, since they no longer own the team."
Garber elaborated that the league did not register the trademarks. This is something they nearly always do when it comes to MLS team names and logos.
Could the league buy those trademarks from the Vergaras? I sincerely doubt it. Though the public face of the sale has been amicable, I am guessing there aren't going to be a great deal of interactions between MLS and Vergara moving forward, least of all when it comes to business.
So consider these rebrand ideas dead. Don't expect to see those crests on anything official related to the team currently known as Chivas USA, ever. On the bright side, the large number of people who voted in our poll Tuesday about the crests and picked the "start over, both crests are bad" option will have their way.

Netflix has hit a new milestone: More U.S. television households now have the streaming service than a digital video recorder, according to a recent study.
About 54% of U.S. adults said they have Netflix in their household — while 53% have a DVR, according to Leichtman Research Group's annual on-demand study. It's the first time that households with Netflix (including those that use shared accounts) have surpassed the level of those with a DVR in the history of LRG's studies. In 2011, according to the research firm, 44% of TV households had a DVR and 28% had Netflix.
Netflix has now eclipsed DVR usage despite the latter having a years-long head start. TiVo's first digital video recorder shipped in 1999, while Netflix debuted its video-streaming service in 2007 and started the shift away from its DVD-by-mail business. As of the end of 2016, Netflix had 49.4 million streaming subscribers in the U.S., up 10.5% year over year. LRG president Bruce Leichtman noted that Netflix's penetration is boosted by password sharing, with previous surveys indicating nearly 20% of Netflix customers share account access with those outside their household.
About 23% of all adults in TV homes stream Netflix daily, according to LRG's survey of 1,211 consumers 18 and older conducted in January 2017, compared with 6% who did in 2011. Overall, 64% of respondents said they get a subscription video-on-demand service from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and/or Hulu.
Meanwhile, Netflix's stock was upgraded Monday by UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson, from “neutral” to “buy,” citing subscriber momentum in Europe and Latin America as well as remarks by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts who said last week at an investor conference that in a little more than 90 days since integrating Netflix into its X1 platform, more than 30% of X1 customers are using Netflix.
Comcast's early results with Netflix on X1 are “encouraging,” Mitchelson wrote. “We expect ongoing churn reductions as Netflix adds more U.S. pay TV integration deals and as X1 penetrations rise.” Comcast has said about half its 22.5 million video subs have X1.
All that said, traditional linear TV is not dead in the water by any means. As Leichtman pointed out, 46% of adults say they often flip through channels to see what's on TV.
Clarification: This article has been updated to note that Leichtman Research Group's study included households that use shared Netflix accounts. According to LRG, previous surveys indicate that nearly 20% of Netflix customers share passwords with those outside their household.

Key output from the debug statements: (..) forrtl: error (75): floating point exception IOT trap (core dumped) ..so the data value is unbfeasibly large, but why does the sum-of-squares parameter OpTotSq go negative?!!
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt 22. Right, time to stop pussyfooting around the niceties of Tim's labyrinthine software suites - let's have a go at producing CRU TS 3.0! since failing to do that will be the definitive failure of the entire project..
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt getting seriously fed up with the state of the Australian data. so many new stations have been introduced, so many false references.. so many changes that aren't documented. Every time a cloud forms I'm presented with a bewildering selection of similar-sounding sites, some with references, some with WMO codes, and some with both. And if I look up the station metadata with one of the local references, chances are the WMO code will be wrong (another station will have it) and the lat/lon will be wrong too.
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt I am very sorry to report that the rest of the databases seem to be in nearly as poor a state as Australia was. There are hundreds if not thousands of pairs of dummy stations, one with no WMO and one with, usually overlapping and with the same station name and very similar coordinates. I know it could be old and new stations, but why such large overlaps if that's the case? Aarrggghhh! There truly is no end in sight.
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt 28. With huge reluctance, I have dived into 'anomdtb' - and already I have that familiar Twilight Zone sensation.
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt Wrote 'makedtr.for' to tackle the thorny problem of the tmin and tmax databases not being kept in step. Sounds familiar, if worrying. am I the first person to attempt to get the CRU databases in working order?!!
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt Well, dtr2cld is not the world's most complicated program. Wheras cloudreg is, and I immediately found a mistake! Scanning forward to 1951 was done with a loop that, for completely unfathomable reasons, didn't include months! So we read 50 grids instead of 600!!! That may have had something to do with it. I also noticed, as I was correcting THAT, that I reopened the DTR and CLD data files when I should have been opening the bloody station files!!
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt Back to the gridding. I am seriously worried that our flagship gridded data product is produced by Delaunay triangulation - apparently linear as well. As far as I can see, this renders the station counts totally meaningless. It also means that we cannot say exactly how the gridded data is arrived at from a statistical perspective - since we're using an off-the-shelf product that isn't documented sufficiently to say that. Why this wasn't coded up in Fortran I don't know - time pressures perhaps? Was too much effort expended on homogenisation, that there wasn't enough time to write a gridding procedure? Of course, it's too late for me to fix it too. Meh.
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt Here, the expected 1990-2003 period is MISSING - so the correlations aren't so hot! Yet the WMO codes and station names /locations are identical (or close). What the hell is supposed to happen here? Oh yeah - there is no 'supposed', I can make it up. So I have :-)
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt Well, it's been a real day of revelations, never mind the week. This morning I discovered that proper angular weighted interpolation was coded into the IDL routine, but that its use was discouraged because it was slow! Aaarrrgghh. There is even an option to tri-grid at 0.1 degree resolution and then 'rebin' to 720x360 - also deprecated! And now, just before midnight (so it counts!), having gone back to the tmin/tmax work, I've found that most if not all of the Australian bulletin stations have been unceremoniously dumped into the files without the briefest check for existing stations.
FOIA\documents\HARRY_READ_ME.txt As we can see, even I'm cocking it up! Though recoverably. DTR, TMN and TMX need to be written as (i7.7)./code>

The Canadian navy will retire its aging supply ships and will have to wait at least 18 months before new ones arrive, federal and military officials confirmed on Friday.
The gap is the result of a bottleneck in the Harper government's national shipbuilding strategy because one of the yards where civilian-grade vessels are being built can only handle one major project at a time.
Officials were forced to choose between replacing the navy's 1960s vintage supply ships and the aging coast guard icebreaker Louis St. Laurent.
They chose the replenishment ships, which have been the subject of an on-again, off-again procurement process for nearly a decade.
The new joint support ships, based on a German design, will begin construction in late 2016 with a target of having them in service by 2019-20, almost two years later than the last estimate contained in last spring's federal budget.
The gap for the navy's supply ships, however, means Canadian warships will have to rely on other allies for fuel and ammunition when deployed overseas.
Officials, speaking on background because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Friday that's not unusual; allies have been called upon in the past whenever one of the existing ships — HMCS Preserver or HMCS Protecteur — was in drydock for repairs and upgrades.
In the meantime, one coast guard official said the icebreaker will remain in service until 2021-22, but it will require as much as $55 million in refits and upgrades to keep going over 10 years.
"We're really lucky the Louis St. Laurent is in as good condition as she is currently," the official said. "She has been well maintained over the years and we have invested in her."
Foreign ships 10% cheaper
Senior defence and public works officials overseeing the program recognized in 2011 soon after the companies were identified that SeaSpan Shipyards in Vancouver would face construction congestion, say documents released to The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
They have been working since then to figure out a solution.
The roughly 500 pages of documents and briefings from the joint support ship project office also show that in 2008, military planners examined the option of buying replacements offshore.
The analysis showed that the navy could get its ships faster and likely about 10 per cent cheaper than by contracting with a Canadian yard.
The examination was done after the Harper government decided in the summer of 2008 to halt the first round of procurement — started under the Liberals — and to begin anew. Bids submitted during the first round came in dramatically higher than the government's budget envelope.
Officials acknowledged Friday that the decision to include the supply ships in the government's strategy has meant delays, but it will ultimately mean the military gets the ship it wants.
The cost of building in Canada, where shipyard labour rates are higher than competing nations, has been the subject of scrutiny. Analysts and internal reports have suggested the country is paying a steep premium per ship to support the industry.
Opposition New Democrats were quick on Friday to paint the decision as another procurement failure.
"Let's be clear: these critical shipbuilding projects are facing delays because of the Conservative decision to cancel the Joint Support Ship procurement process in 2008," NDP defence critic Jack Harris said in a statement.
"That restart means that the Canadian navy will now face a two-year gap in resupply capacity, during which time Canada will have to rely on allies for essential resupply capabilities. The Canadian navy's capacity to conduct independent marine operations during this period will be greatly reduced."
A recent report by the parliamentary budget office suggested that had the Conservatives stuck with the original program, the navy would already have its ships, and likely for less money than what they'll eventually pay.
New photos of Omran Daqneesh, the now five-year-old boy whose bloody face became the poster child for Aleppo's suffering have emerged.
ABC News reports:
A new photo of Omran Daqneesh, the 5-year-old boy whose image became a symbol of the suffering in Aleppo after he was photographed following an August 2016 attack, surfaced Monday after he and his family were interviewed by a pro-government channel in Syria called Al Mayadeen TV.
The image of Omran is the first one seen publicly since the picture of him bloodied and dusty in the back of an ambulance in Aleppo went viral after he was rescued from a destroyed building in the besieged city's Qaterji neighborhood following an airstrike.
Omran's family never fled the city after the attack and ABC News is told they remain loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In the family's Al Mayadeen TV interview, which airs tonight, Omran's father tells pro-Assad journalist Kinana Allouche that rebels and international media only used his son's image to attack the Syrian government.
“They wanted to trade in his blood and publish his photos,” he said, according to reports.
The father added that Omran's 10-year-old brother, Ali, was killed in the same strike that injured Omran.
According to the doctor who treated Omran after the August 2016 attack, he was covered in dust and bleeding from the head.
“Omran was scared and dazed at the same time. He wasn't crying at all. It seemed like he had been asleep when it happened,” Mohammad, who treated Omran, told ABC News.
Mohammad said Omran suffered one simple wound to the scalp and was discharged from the hospital after two hours.
Mozart pleases his public
The years 1650 to 1750 were a period of feverish invention and technical ingenuity in music that reached an apotheosis in Handel's sublime oratorios and Bach's cantatas and Passions. Bach was probably the cleverest composer who ever lived; the mind-boggling complexity of much of his late music, in particular, has yet to be matched by any composer. But, as often happens in musical history, the generation after Bach stripped away much of the older composers' harmonic complexity, writing instead with a dramatically simpler palette of harmonies. The likes of Gluck, Mozart and Haydn created a whole new style based on, essentially, four major chords. Much of their music is based on the tonic, dominant and subdominant – just like much of rock'n'roll. Status Quo and the Ramones, say, have shown that the old formulas are the best. Some of Mozart's most memorable tunes in his opera The Magic Flute are based on very simple harmonic blocks of three or four chords.
Mozart – unlike most composers before him – was able to make a living independent of an institution or a single aristocratic patron, but he lived or died by what the public wanted to hear. If people came to hear one of his operas a second time, he made more money on receipts. He twigged that great tunes were what people were drawn to, and that if he enticed and delighted his audience he was more likely not only to get another commission, but also people were more likely to return to hear his works a second and third time if his tunes were memorable.
Mozart was a melodic genius. The perfection of the shape of his tunes is what strikes me, his wonderful sense of the rise and fall of a tune and what makes it catch the ear. Those great melodies embed themselves in our heads. This gift for melodies is very rare. I think Mendelssohn, too, a century later, was a composer who had an incredibly easy natural gift and wrote some very nice tunes. In my lifetime? Carole King has written beautiful songs, but only a handful. Richard Rodgers was someone who couldn't write a decent tune. But if you want the sheer unstoppable flow of Mozart, or Schubert, then you only have Lennon and McCartney.
Schubert invents the three-minute pop song
Most pop songs are based on a dozen or so of the most familiar chord sequences that were "discovered" in the late 18th century. In the present age, someone such as Adele is an original singer because of her voice, her attitude and her style. But the chords and sequences she and most pop writers are using have been around for a very long time. Perhaps the originator of the three-minute pop song was John Dowland, way back in Shakespeare's time, but I think the modern pop song was created by Schubert.
Schubert was a remarkable talent. Melodies poured out of him. He wrote 600 songs, and, like today's songwriters, his intention was to write music that would be instantly enjoyable. There's not a moment where he is trying to catch you out or where you have to listen 10 times before you get your head around a song. He wants you to get it first time; there's verse-chorus, voice and piano underneath, and he wants you to remember the chorus.
Some of these simple rules of songwriting just continue to be the simple rules of songwriting, and there's nothing much about Adele or Simon & Garfunkel or Leonard Cohen's songs that would have seemed alien to the Viennese composer in terms of the chords, or the shape, the way the verse leads into the chorus, or the piano accompaniment. In fact, the thing that would strike Schubert as most odd about an Adele song is the fact that a woman wrote it rather than being its object.
Schubert came to many of the same conclusions as modern songwriters – that writing random song after song is no use, that creating 20 songs and a journey is a much more satisfying form. And so that's what he did with his song cycles. They are longer pieces where people go on a journey and each song forms the next bit of the story.
The fact is that if you strip that all away and ask what it is he is trying to do, he's trying to write songs about love (or, let's face it, unrequited love) or trying to get to grips with the mysteries of life – and do so in a way that is instantly enjoyable. He was a young man (by our standards, very young) so there is some naivety to the songs and there's a delicacy which, for some people, doesn't fit in with the modern world. But leaving that aside, he is trying to create something that is instantly liked by lots of people and enjoyed by them either in their own homes or in a salon.

That is not really very different from what Adele is doing. Her songs are based on a piano format, with verse-chorus, addressing the issue of love and romance and shaping the voice around that; emotions are expressed; the length; the format – Adele wants her songs to be instantly enjoyed.
Beethoven and the cult of the turbulent genius
Beethoven changed the point of what music was. He and his music became indivisible: it was a reflection of his inner turmoil. His work sits at the time of a broader cultural movement where artists and poets were doing the same, but what became a musical commonplace was begun by him. Seventy groups such as Yes and Pink Floyd tried to do the same thing and express big ideas in instrumental sections on concept albums.
Generally, Beethoven's impact has been felt much more strongly in classical music than in pop, because he wrote about his emotions without words. When, at the end of his life, he writes his desperately bleak and private string quartets, it's like having a pscyhoanalytic session with him.
But the cult of the isolated, divine or demonic genius – of which Beethoven was the first outstanding musical example – was developed to a whole new level by Berlioz. We have this French composer to thank for the image of the deranged, hair-challenged, isolated composer, one that persists to this day. He himself was a borderline psychopath at the forefront of the mid-19th century's obsession with doomed love, death and destiny, and wrote music on an epic scale, music that would embrace all life. He was obsessed with Beethoven – as we still are today, possibly to too great an extent. We've constructed this great building of Beethoven-the-man on top of his music, but if you strip that away and ask what's going on in this music, it's not always the same thing.

Liszt lets music tell the story
Beethoven developed the idea that you can tell a story in music. In his Pastoral Symphony he goes for a walk in the country; he sees peasants merry-making, there's a thunderstorm … but that piece is all about the composer, his feelings and his responses. Liszt, however, created the concept that the music itself could tell the story. He moved away from the idea of music as an abstract entity towards orchestral music as a representation of something extra-musical with his symphonic poems. Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo followed the path of an actual period in the life of the 16th-century Italian poet – even weaving in a traditional gondoliers' folk song and creating an anguished first section about the mental asylum where Tasso was imprisoned for a while. The form of the piece was, crucially, dictated by the story. The climax of his Hunnenschlacht (The Battle of the Huns), devoted to Kaulbach's 1850 painting of Attila the Hun's battle against the Christian Roman empire, contains the kind of heavyweight flourish you have heard in the scores of countless Hollywood adventure films. In his tone poems, Liszt provided the template for generations of film composers. If I was scoring a battle scene for a film, I would use many of the techniques that Liszt first employed. His influence is enormous, and he had a huge effect on music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – so much so that I find myself wondering why we don't love him better today. I think it comes down to the fact that he wasn't a natural melodist. But to my mind, Liszt is the giant, the key composer of the 19th century, one who turbo-charged music.
Dvorák's sampling sparks a debate
Composers have always borrowed elements from each other and from ethnic music. Music doesn't observe racial or national boundaries. Can you "own" it? Nowhere were the moral questions surrounding this more sharply highlighted that in the US in the late 19th century, where the Czech composer Dvorák found himself at the centre of a highly divisive debate. The source melodies for his New World symphony were borrowed – whether deliberately or absorbed unconsciously – from Native American and African American folk songs, which raised the question of whether it is legitimate to plunder the music of another community's cultural inheritance and place it in an alien and artificial milieu for a very different audience.
Dvorák had only good intentions – the ennobling of African American culture – but it's important not to see a piece of music isolated from its times. His symphony was written during a period when everything that belonged to Native Americans and African Americans was deliberately being taken away from them by a white culture – and a work by a European composer performed in a New York concert hall was at that time a piece of white culture.
We may never know who wrote the tunes in Dvorák's symphony – maybe he wrote every note himself. But the conundrums are there nonetheless because it became so commonplace for white musicians to rip off the music of black people. Three decades later, Gershwin, with his Rhapsody in Blue, found himself at the centre of a related debate when his incorporation of jazz – perceived as grubby, street music – outraged middle-class concert-goers.
Today, there are people who are antagonistic to popular culture of all kinds, who rant about how there's nothing good on TV, that young people's tastes, habits and fashions are all repellent to them. But it was ever thus. For a "serious" composer such as Gershwin to put jazz into a piece of classical music was deeply threatening and played to a fear that, somehow, it would pollute "serious" music. But you can't make styles stay apart. They will come together no matter what.
As told to Imogen Tilden.

YES ‘Album Series' Tales/Drama USA Tour Reviews
“Shying away from their main stream hits for this tour, as a gift to their fans base, they began their set by playing all six songs of the Drama album. Nearly every song yielded a standing ovation from the crowd and some people stood up alone when the feeling moved them to do so.
The Drama album was followed up by You and me from their 1972 Close To The Edge album and Perpetual Change from their 1971 The Yes Album.
The first set was inspiring and immaculately performed. If anyone in the audience had any reservations about seeing them live without their original line up; those reservations were a distant memory. I would have never imagined that anyone could fill Jon Anderson's shoes. But Jon Davison's soaring vocals match so well you may never know you were listening to a different person.
The band took an intermission and fans made their way to the wine tables in the lobby still high from the opus they just experienced.
When the performance started again they opened with possibly their most inspiring song from Tales from Topographic Oceans; The Revealing Science of God (Dance of the Dawn). It was nearly 20 minutes of seat gripping bliss.
It would not be a Yes concert without at least one Steve Howe solo. Tucked away in the song The Ancient is a little segment they like to call Leaves of Green. When Steve plays it, you can feel his deep connection to this song. I have seen it in live recordings many times in my life but nothing compares to hearing it live.
They ended their set with The Ritual (Nous Somme Du Soleil). Intricate and extraordinary, I am certain that there were members of the audience that had a spiritual moment during this song.
The band received a long standing ovation at the end and treated their fans to a three song encore. Roundabout kept everyone moving on their feet and most the crowd stayed standing for Starship Trooper.
Just as we thought the concert was over the band played tribute to John Wetton of the group Asia, who passed away this January 31st, with the song Heat of the Moment. Changing nothing from the original song it was flawlessly preformed.
As fans walked to their cars everyone was still excited. I could overhear comments about the show. I believe my favorite was, “As an Atheist, music like this could make me believe there is a God”. Yes, for all of the creativity and imagination that went into creating and producing their music, Yes live is still out of this world.” – Lori Dantzler, Flick of the Finger Magazine.
“The pieces were nothing short of a tour de force of musical ambition, complexity and remarkable synchronicity. It sounded outstanding. This version of YES seems to play at a higher level, a more powerful level, like they've been together a decade or more. These guys are on no nostalgia tour. They play it like they mean business, with little intention of slowing down” – Raymond Britt, Chicago Tribune
Visually, YES have stepped up the production on the tour courtesy of video designer Andy Clark and lighting designer Don Weeks, with multiple video feeds featuring Roger Dean imagery, from waterfalls and floating islands to topographic landscapes, bioluminescence, deep sea creatures, jellyfish, and marine life.
“With a large LED background that displayed colorful graphics as well as the occasional YES logo, the band delivered over 2½ hours of classic music that had attendees picking their jaws up off the floor.” – Chris Loomis, SoCal Music Today
But here's a more shocking truth: The version of Yes aboard this year's Cruise to the Edge sounded sharper and more engaged than they have in a decade. – Ryan Reed, Ultimate Classic Rock
“Yes continues with its tradition of symphonic progressive rock that remains timelessly fresh and innovative.” – Tampa Bay Newspapers
This has turned into a triangle now. The story of custody of mango, litchi and jackfruit trees inside the premises of Bihar chief minister's bungalow in Patna has got a new claimant- RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav
The former Bihar chief minister on Friday put forth his claim over the fruit trees. Talking to reporters in Araria, Lalu Prasad said the trees in the CM house were planted during his and wife Rabri Devi's subsequent tenures.
"Litchi, aam ke pedo par mera aur Rabri ka haq hai. Humne hi waha ke ped lagaye they (I and Rabri have first right over mango and litchi trees. We had planted them there)," Lalu said.
Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had earlier accused present chief minister Nitish Kumar of having deployed a posse of policemen to stand guard around all mango, litchi and jackfruit trees at 1, Aney Marg Bungalow.
"This reflects the narrow mindset of Nitish," Manjhi had alleged, adding, "This has been done to prevent a scheduled caste leader from eating the fruits."
Nitish was quick to rubbish the charges. He said he had no idea who had deployed the policemen. "This is a trivial matter. When I came to know about it, I asked the police chief about it. He also had no idea either. I told him to probe the issue and make the matter public."
The chief minister said had he known about it, he would have got all the fruits plucked and delivered to Manjhi. "And if there are some rules involving the cost, I would have paid the amount from my salary for that," he had said.
"I am concerned about awaam (people), and he (Manjhi) about aam (mango)," Nitish said.
Even with this new definition, Bureau says that its average processing time for “simple” cases is 181 days
Just six months ago, I reported that the FBI had quietly changed their FOIA processing queues without alerting anyone or updating their website. And now, once again, the Bureau has changed their standards for FOIA processing - before a request had to be 2,500 pages or more to be classified as large or complex. Now, without any announcement or update to the Bureau's website, the number's down to 51 pages.
According to the FBI's website as of publication, a request still has to be 951 pages or more to qualify as large or complex.
However, according to correspondence the FBI sent on December 8th, the medium track for FOIA requests has been eliminated entirely.
To put the 50 pages into context, that's 10% of a “segment” that the FBI typically processes “complex” cases in.
Even with this new definition, the FBI says that its average processing time for “simple” cases of 50 pages or fewer is 181 days - or slightly more than thirteen times the statutory limit. For complex cases, it's 659 days - nearly fifty times what's allowed by law.
This move also has an immediate impact on the Bureau's statistics for FOIA processing times. The average time to process was undoubtedly higher before they began to include cases of 51-950 pages - by folding those in with “complex” cases the Bureau is able to artificially lower its average processing time for “complex” cases. All this bureaucratic miracle required was completely redefining the definition of complex so that it would include cases that were 1/49th as complex as they were at the beginning of the year.
Of course, all of the Bureau's handling of these statistics should be taken with a grain of salt. According to the same letter sent by the Bureau, they scanned the FOIA request into their system on “06-11-2016.” Assuming they meant November and not June, this is still one day before the FOIA request was actually sent.

Redknapp tips City to retain title... but thinks Arsenal will struggle
Harry Redknapp believes Manchester City has what it takes to retain their Premier League crown but says neigbours Manchester United will push them all the way again.
Redknapp starts the season watching from afar after he left Tottenham in the summer after failing to secure Champions League football for this season.
He expects the usual teams to be in contention with City, United, Chelsea and Tottenham all to challenge.
Same again: Harry Redknapp believes Manchester City will retain their title
But Redknapp expects Arsenal to struggle if they lose influential forward Robin van Persie.
Redknapp, who was recently appointed a Sky Sports Fantasy Football ambassador, said: ‘I suppose City will be favourites and then Man Utd, Chelsea and Tottenham again.
'Arsenal will be in for a tough season this year if they lose Van Persie, I think they've got it all to do and Tottenham could finish above them this year.
Tough season ahead: Redknapp says if Robin Van Persie leaves it could be hard for Arsenal
'[Sir Alex Ferguson] will want to win a trophy this year and they'll push Man City all the way.
'I think Liverpool will do better. People say there's a long rebuilding process going on at the club, but they'll be there. They've got fantastic players in my opinion – [Luis] Suarez, [Andy] Carroll, [Steven] Gerrard, [Jamie] Carragher, Glen Johnson, a great goalkeeper in Pepe Reina and some good central defenders. They should be pushing for the top four.
Watching on: Redknapp is in an unfamiliar position of not starting the season in charge of a team
The embattled frontman of a Christian metal band sentenced to prison for plotting to have his wife killed recently confessed that he and other band members had become atheists, but continued to pose as Christians so they could keep selling records, according to a report by The Christian Post.
Tim Lambesis, 33, lead singer and founder of the band As I Lay Dying, was sentenced to six years behind bars on May 16 for his role in a murder-for-hire plot involving his estranged then-wife, Meggan Lambesis. Lambesis tried to hire a hitman in an attempt to have his wife murdered.
Lambesis' arrest, case, trial and conviction took many of his faithful fans by surprise. Many took to social media to express their disbelief over the allegations and, ultimately, the singer's sentencing.
But according to the Christian Post's report, those fans may have had more faith in Lambesis than he did in the Christian religion, citing what Lambesis said during an extensive interview with Alternative Press conducted shortly before his sentencing.
Images: As I Lay Dying Singer Tim Lambesis in Court
In that interview, Lambesis talked about a YouTube video he made about a month before his arrest in which he addressed fans who felt his new side project, “Pyrithion” was “satanic.”
Lambesis admitted that at the time, he never really gave a straight answer as to whether he was still Christian. He said he was afraid of revealing his true beliefs about God, or lack thereof, because he didn't want to impact his band's record sales, so he chose to say “I'm not a satanist” instead.
“As far as the [YouTube] video I did explain 'Pyrithion''s lyrics… I was trying to put out a fire. I was afraid it would affect As I Lay Dying sales, which would affect my overall income. I was trying to put out the fire by saying the easiest thing, 'I'm not a satanist!'" he explained in the Alternative Press interview.
"Truthfully, I was an atheist. The 'strategy' I had at the time was cowardly. Two of the songs on that record were about coming to grips with the idea that life has no purpose, no meaning. These were negative themes I wasn't 'allowed' to deal with in As I Lay Dying songs. I thought making As I Lay Dying darker would be bad for my career. That was my thinking," he continued.
Lambesis went on to say that many of the Christian bands he had toured with over the years had a similar stance and weren't exactly devout Christians either. He said a few of his fellow As I Lay Dying band members were also no longer Christian.
After a while, the charade became awkward, he said, like the time when an interviewer at a Christian festival asked one of the band members to share his testimony, but he froze on the spot.
Singer Accused of Seeking Hit Man Going to Trial
A judge determined there is enough evidence to send Christian heavy metal singer Tim Lambesis to trial. In court Monday, a witness described how he said Lambesis came to him to hire a hit man to kill his wife. NBC 7's Rory Devine reports. (Published Monday, Sept. 16, 2013)
“We laughed about it afterward, but we were only laughing because it was so awkward," said Lambesis in the interview.
"When kids would want to pray with us after shows, I'd be like, 'Um, go ahead and pray!' I would just let them pray. I'd say 'Amen.' If praying while I have my hand on their shoulder makes them feel better, I didn't want to take that away from them. When they would specifically ask me to pray for something, I'd say, 'I don't really like to pray out loud, but I'll take that with me to the bus," the singer added.
Lambesis' shocking fall from grace began when he was arrested in May 2013 in connection with the murder-for-hire plot.
Until that point, he had enjoyed a successful and lucrative musical career with his San Diego-based heavy metal band, which formed more than a decade ago and released eight albums, including the 2007 Grammy-nominated "An Ocean Between Us."
Beside the many albums, the band was also a mainstay of the San Diego Music Awards (SDMA), nominated in 2012 for Best Hard Rock Album for "Decas" and winning for Best Hard Rock the year before that. In 2005, 2007 and 2008, the band took home the SDMA statuettes for Artist of the Year.
The band was slated to go on a cross-country tour with the Massachusetts metal band Killswitch Engage until Lambesis' arrest last year.
When news of his arrest broke, it perplexed members of the San Diego music community, including SoundDiego contributor Tim Pyles of FM 94/9.
"He's not the idealistic young Christian kid he once was, apparently," Pyles said last spring. "Because that's what [As I Lay Dying] are: a straight-edged Christian metal band. He was a nice guy.”
At his sentencing last month, the courtroom was wrought with drama as character witnesses, including his ex-wife took to the stand to ask a judge to hand down the maximum sentence.
"My name used to be Meggan Lambesis. And up until two years ago, my heart was entirely devoted to him," said Meggan, who now goes by Meggan Murphy.
"I trusted him with everything, including my life," she added. "When the one person who you've been most vulnerable with and the most intimate with, who you've entrusted with every aspect of your life, who has not only desired but planned your murder -- you're left feeling completely exposed and unprotected. Who can I trust now? How can I feel safe?
Murphy said the ordeal will haunt her for the rest of her life, leaving her always looking over her shoulder. She said many of his fans had sent her threatening messages on social media since his arrest.
"The question of who Tim talked to or will talk to will forever haunt me,” she said in that San Diego courtroom. “The scariest thing is Tim's notoriety. He has followers that will do anything for him. It's terrifying to think there are people out there motivated to kill me on his behalf."
After months with the doors closed and the lights off, Wendel Clark's grill and bar is reopening inside Hamilton's iconic Lister Block tomorrow afternoon.
It's the third opening in three years for one of the most visible spots in the city owned building, which has already housed a short lived, disastrous steakhouse, and a previous iteration of Clark's restaurant, which closed just before Christmas in 2016.
At the time, the city said the then-franchise owners were behind on rent. The group that franchises the chain has since taken it over and renovated, and will run it as a corporate location, says Delfina Duarte, the city's manager of facility planning and business support.
"I think that with these changes and new management, that this could be a success," she said.
The previous franchise owners, Louis and Karen Muscat, told CBC News that they weren't properly supported by the Wendel Clark's franchise or the city.
We lost everything in our lives. We're financially ruined. - Louis Muscat, former Wendel Clark's franchise owner
Muscat says he and his wife spent $485,000 to renovate the space when they first took over, and have since had to sell their home to cover debts, after investing money set aside for their retirement.
"We lost everything in our lives," he said. "We're financially ruined. I sold my Corvette to make payroll, and that Corvette meant a lot to me."
"We came to Hamilton for an investment in the city. We met every deadline the city wanted."
Dynamic Hospitality and Entertainment Group, which franchises the chain, did not respond to an interview request for this story.
Operation was a 'risk' for 1st time owners, city says
Duarte said that the Muscats were the only people who applied for the space through the city's RFP process, noting that they were first-time restaurant owners.
"That was a risk," she said. "It's tougher to get off the ground when you're new to the business."
In social media posts, Wendel Clark's has said that Clark himself will be onhand Thursday at the reopening of the Hamilton location. (James Hopkin/CBC)
While two businesses have now floundered in that city-owned space, Hamilton's restaurant community is booming, just steps away. Several restaurants have opened up on James Street North and King William, like The French, Berkeley North, Nique, most recently, Merit Brewing.
Yet in a space that the city owns, nothing has worked. First there was 28 Lister Chophouse Grill, which the city had to seize after the operator stopped paying his bills.
It was plagued by complaints from contractors and staff who claimed they were never paid, as well as grumbling about the quality of the food and prices from the general public.
City invested thousands in space
Wendel Clark's had less overt problems, but Muscat told CBC News that there were times when only two to three customers would be in the restaurant for lunch service.
The city originally invested $267,000 in the ground floor space, back before the steakhouse opened.

Duarte said the city did pay for part of the renovations in the building this time — namely, cutting out portions of a wall so that the bathrooms in the building actually connect with the restaurant.
She says this was "in the city's best interest," as it would cut down on security guard costs for the rest of the building. Duarte could not say exactly how much the renovation cost.
Wendel Clark's reopens on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. The restaurant says that the former Maple Leafs captain will be there for the event.

The New Zealand longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii) is the largest and the only endemic freshwater eel species in New Zealand. (The others are the native Shortfin eel, Anguilla australis, also found in Australia, and the naturally introduced Australian Longfin eel Anguilla reinhardtii). Longfin eels are long-lived, migrating to the Pacific Ocean near Tonga to breed at the end of their lives. They are good climbers as juvenile and so are found in streams and lakes a long way inland. An important traditional food source for Māori, longfin eels are threatened and declining but still commercially fished.
Description [ edit ]
The easiest way to identify the longfin eel is by the length of its fins: the dorsal (top) fin is about two-thirds the length of the body and starts significantly further towards the head than the anal (bottom) fin. In the shortfin eel the fins are of similar length.[2] When a longfin eel bends its loose skin wrinkles distinctively inside each bend, where a shortfin eel's skin is smooth. A longfin's mouth extends past its eyes, further than a shortfin's.[2]
Female longfin eels are larger and longer-lived than males. Males average 66.6 cm but reach up to 73.5 cm in length, with an average age of 23 years (12–35 years).[3][4] Females are considerably larger, ranging from 73–156 cm with an average length of 115 cm. Females attain an age of 20 to 60 years before migrating to sea to breed.[4] Longfin eels in the North Island migrate at a younger age and thus have faster generation times.[5]
Determining longfin sex is difficult as their sexual organs are not determined until they are over 45 cm in length.[6] The only method to determine longfin eels sex is through internal examination and only becomes easy to distinguish when the eels mature and migrate.[3][6]
Life cycle [ edit ]
Like other members of the Anguillidae, longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle: they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water, then migrate to the sea to breed. This catadromous breeding system[7] also ensures randomised mating, creating a panmictic population.[6]
The New Zealand longfin eel is a very long-lived fish, with records of females reaching 106 years old and weighing up to 24 kg.[4][8] They have the slowest growth rate of any eel species studied, just 1–2 centimetres a year.[9]

Longfin eels life cycle like other species of Angullidae eels is rather complex consisting of four distinct life stages which remained a mystery for many decades and still is not fully understood.[3][10]
New Zealand longfins breed only once at the end of their lives, making a journey of thousands of kilometres from New Zealand to their spawning grounds near Tonga.[11][12] Their eggs (of which each female eel produces between 1 and 20 million[3]) are fertilized in an unknown manner, but probably in deep tropical water.[3] The mature eels then die, their eggs floating to the surface to hatch into very flat leaf-like larvae (called leptocephalus) that then drift along large oceanic currents back to New Zealand.[3][11][13] This drifting is thought to take up to 15 months.[3] There have been no recorded captures of either the eggs or larvae of Longfin eels.[11] Upon arriving in New Zealand, the larvae undergo a transformation (metamorphosis) into glass eels, like small transparent adult eels.[3] These occupy estuaries for their first year, during which they develop colouration and become elvers, which resemble small adult longfin eels.[10][14] The elvers migrate upstream, where they develop into adults.[3][10][14]
The recruitment of glass eels into New Zealand's freshwater river networks is a very variable process, thought to be affected by the El Niño and La Niña Southern Oscillations.[12] This is a major reason for the failure of longfin eel aquaculture in the 1970s.[15][3]
Diet [ edit ]
Longfin eels have an omnivorous diet and are opportunistic feeders.[16] Their diet as small eels largely consists of insect larvae.[3][16] When eels become larger, they also feed heavily on fish, including galaxiids and trout.[3][16] There are reports of these eels eating waterfowl as well.
Habitat and distribution [ edit ]
External video The Longfin Eel Migration – River Monsters
Anguilla dieffenbachii is endemic species to New Zealand, widely distributed through the country's lakes and rivers, including the Chatham Islands.[5][3][17]
Longfin eels are often found great distances inland (up to 361 km) along fresh waterways and in high country lakes which are connected to the sea.[5][3][8] Aiding in their inland distribution is their climbing ability in elver (juvenile) stage, under 12 cm in length.[9][14] These migration events frequently coincide with increased temperate, water flow and low light conditions.[3][9][18] At this size the elvers can travel up to 130 km inland over a summer, and have been observed climbing near-vertical surfaces up to 43 m tall.[3] This feat is accomplished through a combination of surface tension (with the water) and friction.[14]
Where in a waterway longfin eels live depends on their life stage. As juveniles, they prefer shallow water (under 0.5 m deep) with coarse substratum and faster than average stream flow (such as that found in riffles).[5][19] Adult longfin eels tend to be found next to or under large pieces of debris and undercut river banks.[19][3]
Significance for Māori [ edit ]
Longfin eels are an important traditional food source for Māori, who have long had extensive knowledge of the timing of their upstream and downstream migrations.[20][9]
Commercial fishing [ edit ]
The commercial fishing of longfin eels began to gain momentum in the 1960s, and by the 1970s there was a 2000 tonne yearly catch.[3][9] The fishery went into decline in the early 1980s, and in the 2000–2001 fishing season only 1079 tonnes were taken.[21] Commercial longfin eel fishing was included in the Quota Management System (QMS) in 2000 for the South Island and 2004 for the North Island. This set limits to the minimum and maximum size (220 grams and 4 kg) and the Total Allowable Catch (TAC).[5][9] As of 2007, the TAC has not been reached in any fishing season since the implementation of the QMS.[5] In recognition of the traditional significance of longfin eels, Māori have a 20 percent allocation of fishery stocks.[22] The capture and export of glass eels in New Zealand has been prohibited.[5]
Aquaculture [ edit ]
There have been a number of attempts at aquaculture of longfin eels. The first were in the 1970s, and did not remain operational for long, with the last farm closing in 1982.[15] The most common reasons for these failures were economic (the high cost of production vs low price for the eels), variable recruitment of glass eels, and the high mortality (death) rates in the farms.[15] Since the early 2000s, there has been renewed interest in the aquaculture of longfins due to the increasing knowledge of their biology and the diminishing stocks of European eels (Anguilla anguilla), but no farms have been built.[15][7][9][23]
Conservation [ edit ]
The New Zealand longfin eel is classified by the Department of Conservation as "At Risk: Declining" under criteria "C(2/1) Total area of occupancy > 10 000 ha (100 km2), predicted decline 10–70%".[1]
Scientists and conservation groups have growing concern for the survival of the species, as they can be legally fished and have a slow reproduction rate, breeding only once at the end of their lifetime.[24][25] In 2003 a scientist predicted their numbers to drop by between 5 and 30% in the following decade.[24]
In June 2012 it was reported that some pet food companies use the nationally threatened eels in their products, sparking outrage by conservationists.[26]

I choose art to resist — to fight terror and to remember. I once drew the Tank Man, and I also have Tank Man tattoo. This year I decided to use performance art to bring the Tank Man back, in the hope that, tomorrow, there'll be even more Tank Men.
All I know of the Tank Man is his plain white shirt, his black trousers, his leather shoes, and the plastic bag and briefcase he carried. The only thing he left the world was that view of him from behind.
I don't know the real identity of the Tank Man. There's a rumour that his name is Wang Weilin, but no one really knows. Who he was before becoming the Tank Man is a mystery; what's become of him after he was the Tank Man is equally a riddle. I don't know whether he lived or died. In my heart, I hope he successfully escaped, and that he's somewhere now, living in quiet and safety.
For me (probably for many of you too), his clothing became him. On June 4, 2016, I “became” the Tank Man for one day in Adelaide, South Australia. I admit that I was somewhat nervous, because my photographer Alycia Bennett and I were alone. We didn't know what would happen. But we set up and we started. Some people gave me the middle finger; security guards asked me to move on. But many Chinese students stopped to take photos. And there were people who greeted me with encouragement.
Next year I hope I will not be alone, and there will be more “Tank Men” in Australia and elsewhere. I'd like to see this form of June 4th remembrance spread: it's simple, calm, and powerful.

Gurugram: The Class 11 student of Ryan International School, apprehended by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for allegedly killing seven-year-old Pradyuman Thakur, has confessed to his crime in front of his father and an independent witness, the agency has claimed before a juvenile court in Gurugram.
To corroborate the 16-year-old student's statement, CBI sleuths took him to a “certain place" on Thursday, the first day of his three-day remand. A special crime team of the CBI, which is questioning him, remained tight-lipped about the exercise, saying it could affect the probe.
The juvenile court in Gurugram on Wednesday sent the student to three days' CBI custody. He is being kept at the Sewa Kutir, a child welfare home, at Kingsway Camp, from where he was brought to the CBI headquarters in Delhi at 10.45am.
CBI has been directed by the court to carry on questioning for seven hours between 10am to 5pm during the custody period. In its note seeking his remand, the agency said that his custodial interrogation was needed to ascertain if there were other people involved in the crime.
The confession of the student has little meaning as of now as such statements need to be recorded before a court under Section 164 of the CrPC. The agency said his statement was yet to be recorded under CrPC Section 164.
CBI officials said the agency is still investigating the case and that admission of crime is just the beginning of a process of collecting corroborative forensic and legally tenable evidence. The agency also wants the teenager to identify the shop from where he had purchased the knife used to slit throat of Pradyuman Thakur, a Class 2 student, on 8 September, CBI told the court.
The agency said the interrogation was needed to reconstruct the scene of crime, to unearth conspiracy, if any, and to collect any other evidence related to the case. “He has admitted his involvement in committing the murder of...in ground floor boys washroom of Ryan International School...in presence of his father..., independent witness, welfare officer of the CBI, etc.," the note said.
In a sensational twist to the Ryan school murder case, CBI announced on Wednesday that it had apprehended a senior student of Ryan International School on Tuesday night in connection with the murder of Pradyuman Thakur rejecting the Gurugram police's theory that the killing was the handiwork of school bus conductor Ashok Kumar.
The CBI has said that there was no evidence against Kumar so far. According to the agency, the Class 11 student, believed to be weak in his studies, allegedly slit Pradyuman Thakur's throat to get the school to declare a holiday in order to defer a scheduled parent-teacher meeting and an examination.
The agency did not find any evidence of sexual assault, a CBI spokesperson had on Wednesday said.
CBI was able to piece together elements of the crime by analysing CCTV footage, scientific and forensic examination, analysis of the crime scene and by questioning students, teachers and staff members of the school. Based on CCTV footage and crime scene analysis, the agency examined all potential suspects and witnesses. The list included 125 teachers and students, officials said.
A lack of an adequate response to the upsurge of neo-Nazi sentiments in Ukraine might eventually lead to the spread of this dangerous ideology to neighboring countries and across the world, a top Russian diplomat has said.
“There is no doubt that if there is no adequate reaction to the raging neo-Nazism in Ukraine, and so far there is no such reaction, this infection would spread over the Ukrainian borders and spread to other countries in Europe and beyond,” Foreign Ministry plenipotentiary for Human Rights, Konstantin Dolgov, was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency.
Dolgov was commenting on the recent decision by Ukraine, the United States and Canada to vote against a UN resolution on countering neo-Nazism, supported by the majority of the UN members.The resolution had been prepared and drafted by the Russian delegation at the UN.
Earlier, Dolgov wrote in his Twitter feed that Ukraine's vote against the resolution could be considered a confirmation of the Kiev's favorable official position towards neo-Nazi movements in the country.
The Russian Foreign Ministry commented that it was “upset and alarmed” by the Ukrainian position, especially given the fact that the people of the country had suffered the atrocities of Nazi Germany and played a major part in the common victory over the evil regime.
Last week Russia's Supreme Court endorsed a lawsuit filed by the Prosecutor General's Office that would recognize the Ukrainian groups Right Sector and UNA-UNSO, known for their neo-Nazi ideology, as extremist, and banning their activities and propaganda within Russia. Several similar organizations, such as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army UPA, Ukrainian People's Self-Defense and Stepan Bandera Trident were also tagged as extremist and banned in Russia.
In a separate development, a group of Russian majority party lawmakers asked investigators to prepare an official letter to the International Criminal Court describing crimes by members of Ukrainian nationalist groups - including the infamous Right Sector - and asking they be recognized as extremist.
Bankruptcy judges in North Carolina and Pennsylvania have admonished the bank over the practice, according to the class-action lawsuit filed last week. One judge called the practice “beyond the pale of due process.”
The lawsuits contend that Wells Fargo puts through changes on borrowers' loans using a routine form that typically records new real estate taxes or homeowners' insurance costs that are folded into monthly mortgage payments. Upon receiving these forms, bankruptcy court workers usually put the changes into effect without questioning them.
It is unclear why the bank would put through such changes. On one hand, Wells Fargo stood to profit from the new loan terms it set forth, and, under programs designed to encourage loan modifications for troubled borrowers, the bank receives as much as $1,600 from government programs for every such loan it adjusts, the class-action lawsuit said. But submitting the changes without approval violates bankruptcy rules and puts the bank at risk of court sanctions and federal scrutiny. When a lawyer for a borrower has questioned the changes, Wells Fargo has reversed them.
Abelardo Limon Jr., a lawyer in Brownsville, Tex., who represents some of the plaintiffs, said he first thought Wells Fargo had made a clerical error. Then he saw another case.
“When I realized it was a pattern of filing false documents with the federal court, that was appalling to me,” Mr. Limon said in an interview. The unauthorized loan modifications “really cause havoc to a debtor's reorganization,” he said.
This is not the first time Wells Fargo has been accused of wrongdoing related to payment change notices on mortgages it filed with the bankruptcy courts. Under a settlement with the Justice Department in November 2015, the bank agreed to pay $81.6 million to borrowers in bankruptcy whom it had failed to notify on time when their monthly payments shifted to reflect different real estate taxes or insurance costs.
That settlement — in which the bank also agreed to change its internal procedures to prevent future violations — affected 68,000 homeowners.
If you don't take action to protect your own privacy, nobody will.
Yesterday, I testified in a Pennsylvania state Senate committee hearing on a bill (SB999) that would prohibit the state from participating in or cooperating with federal indefinite detention under provisions in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act.
My time at the Pennsylvania capitol complex reinforced a very important truth – if we hope to find success in our efforts to protect privacy and rein in the surveillance-state, each and every one of us must get involved and directly engage in the process.
If we sit on the sidelines and depend on politicians to do the right thing, our efforts will end in abject failure.
In the few hours I spent in Harrisburg, I saw literally hundreds of lobbyists. Many clearly represented union interests, as evidenced by their T-shirts. But there were many others who quickly morphed into a well-dressed, homogeneous mass of humanity. They represented a wide array of interests, from banking to insurance, from law enforcement organizations to major corporations.
These men and women not only represented particular positions and policy interests, they represented dollars. Some hearing rooms were packed with people.
Mine was not.
I spoke to a nearly empty chamber. In fact, most of the committee members didn't even bother to show up. I can't think of much more important issue than taking action against indefinite detention without due process. When your own government claims the authority to snatch you up off the street and lock you away without charges, there isn't much it can't do.
But sadly, protecting civil liberties doesn't advance any particular business interest. It doesn't further the agenda of any corporation or government entity. It won't line anybody's pocket with cash or empower any special interest. These issues just relate to the average Jane and Joe.
You and I.
The ugly truth is – the politicians don't care.
Lobbyists and big-money donors don't knock on a representative's office door to demand that they protect privacy or due process. They don't promise a nice campaign donation if the senator casts the “right” vote. They don't show up at committee hearings in mass to make their presence known.
So, nothing happens.
The old adage certainly applies in politics – the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
If we truly care about privacy, civil liberties and the Bill of Rights, we – each one of us – must get involved and start making some noise. Because right now, you can hear crickets chirping at state capitols around the country when it comes to privacy and civil liberty issues.
The bottom line is that until we begin filling up committee hearings, banging down representatives doors and flooding capitol switchboards with calls, we will not have success.
We can't match the clout of lobbyists. We don't have the money of corporate interests. We don't have the organizational structure of unions.
But we do have numbers.
Thousands of people have visited OffNow.org, liked out Facebook posts and retweeted our Tweets. But that simply isn't enough. We must translate this interest into action.
YOU need to call your state senator and representative and ask them to introduce legislation to protect your privacy and stop the NSA. (Model legislation HERE.)
YOU need to keep up with bills in your state and make phone calls before important votes. (Track bills HERE.)
YOU need to attend committee hearings, write op-eds and organize demonstrations.
You actually represent something more important to a politician than money. You represent a vote. And many of you working together represent many votes. That serves as our ace-in-the-hole.
Our numbers can create the kind of squeak necessary to get the attention of the politicians. But without people taking action to protect their own pricacy, we will continue to find our message drowned out by well-dressed moneyed lobbyist and uber-organized special interests.

The Voyage Architecture This is what a Voyage self-driving taxi looks like beneath the surface, which is a fairly standardized architecture for a multi-sensor self-driving car. Each component plays a huge role. Today we're going to walk through our compute, power, and drive-by-wire kit.
The system overview for our Voyage self-driving taxi
Compute Compute very much serves the Plan component of SPA. The brains behind Homer, the first self driving taxi at Voyage, is a Gigabyte AORUS motherboard with an Intel Core i7–7700K Kaby Lake Quad-Core 2.4GHz processor and NVIDIA Titan X GPU. To make sure sensors have an ample data pipe, the machine has 64GB of RAM and 3TB of mass storage distributed across three Solid State Drives for redundancy. Wired in This powerful computing box runs an Ubuntu distribution of Linux, utilizes Docker containers to manage system environments, and the Robot Operating System (ROS) for quick prototyping of perception, motion planning, and controls nodes. ROS is an incredibly versatile robotics middleware that abstracts away all of the complexities of message passing, timing, data structures (for things like point clouds, camera frames, and obstacles), threading, and data recording. While Ubuntu (and therefore, ROS) is not a sufficient real-time operating system (RTOS) that is required for production self-driving cars, it is an incredible tool for prototyping algorithms and getting them tested in real world conditions as fast as possible. It's critical to minimize the time between ideas on the whiteboard and cars on the road here at Voyage, and these tools help us do just that. Want to try ROS on real point cloud data from an actual self-driving car? Check out this open repository on GitHub, put together by one of our engineers. ROS nodes are essentially mini-programs that run independently from each other, but generally have many interconnections. One node may be responsible for reading raw data from a Velodyne LIDAR over an ethernet interface and turning it into a PointCloud2 message. This message, which consists of an array of three-dimensional points and their metadata, can then be ‘published' over the ROS network and consumed by any number of other nodes. One of these consumers, or ‘subscribers', could be responsible for fitting the live incoming point cloud to an existing map for localization, and another node may be running clustering algorithms to detect and track objects. These nodes then publish their own output to the network, which could get consumed by motion planning algorithms even farther down the line. At a high level, this is exactly how the Voyage cars operate. Data is consumed from raw sensors (LIDAR, radar, RTK GPS, cameras, CAN bus messages, etc), processed by a huge collection of smaller nodes that all communicate with each other, and then finally outputs actual control signals to the throttle, brake, and steering wheel through our drive-by-wire units.

Keith Simms poses with Oregon coaches during his in-home visit
(Courtesy of Keith Simms)
Pac-12 Conference pledges from the East Coast are typically the first National Letters of Intent to make their way through the fax machine, thanks for the three-hour time difference.
On Wednesday, that was again the case for the Oregon Ducks, whose first announced signee on National Signing Day was recent Maryland four-star linebacker commit Keith Simms.
After a busy past few days, the 6-foot-3, 220-pound linebacker finally discussed his reasons for choosing the Ducks.
"I picked Oregon ultimately because my relationship with the coaches and players," he said. "I really trust the coaching staff and I feel they are very stable, which is something that is important to me. I had an awesome visit, and honestly it was unmatched."
Considered a battle between Oregon, Virginia Tech and possibly North Carolina in the final weeks, Simms' decision finally turned in the Ducks' favor after a stellar in-home visit.
That chat also gave him the opportunity to meet new defensive coordinator Brady Hoke.
"Coach Hoke is a great guy," Simms said. "He has a lot of football knowledge and I know he runs a 4-3 scheme, which is something that will be beneficial for me down the road. He was definitely a big factor, but that being said, I liked Oregon before his time, too."
Oregon has seven players already on campus and another three set to enroll in spring, but no day in recruiting comes with more pageantry than signing day."
Kicking it off for the Ducks was Simms.

The case against convicted Lockerbie/Pan Am 103 bombing suspect Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi was always thin, at best. Despite all the commotion over his trial and conviction, the entire prosecution case was founded upon the testimony of a single clothing shopkeeper from Malta, Tony Gauci, that supposedly sold the clothes that were believed to be in the suitcase containing the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103. Long after the unremarkable alleged sale, Gauci somewhat incredibly remembered selling the clothes to Megrahi. Megrahi has consistently maintained his innocence.
Megrahi's trial was held in a Scottish court that was constituted in the Netherlands by agreement in order to obtain the extradition of Megrahi for trial. Since the conviction at trial, Megrahi has appealed unsuccessfully, but the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC), which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, had taken jurisdiction of the case and referred it back to court for appeal, which is the posture the case was in when the Scottish Justice Ministry cut a deal to release him to his home country of Libya on compassionate grounds (Megrahi has terminal cancer) in return for Megrahi giving up his appeal.
With no appeal available to press his case, Megrahi has taken to releasing material and briefs that were to constitute the foundation of the appeal, and in that regard has opened a website where the material is posted. One of the filings disclosed yesterday on the website documents a blockbuster finding and allegation by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) on collusion of the Scottish Crown prosecution team and US authorities to effectively buy Shopkeeper Gauci's testimony against Megrahi by paying Gauci two million dollars and Gauci's brother, Paul Gauci, a million dollars:
The SCCRC has recovered undisclosed material which indicates that: (a) The witness Tony Gauci had, at an early stage, expressed an interest in receiving payment or compensation for his co-operation in giving evidence, and that this interest persisted until after the trial (b) that the witness Paul Gauci had " a clear desire to gain financial benefit" from his and his brothers co-operation and that Paul Gauci exercised considerable influence over his brother (c) that the U.S. authorities offered to make substantial payments to the witness Tony Gauci from an early stage (d) that an application for reward monies was made on behalf of the SIO of the investigation team of the Scottish police to the U.S. Department of Justice, after the trial, and that substantial payments were received by both Tony (in excess of $2m) and Paul Gauci (in excess of $1m) after the appeal.
The Scottish Crown prosecution team concealed both the early discussion prior to the trial of financial reward to Gauci for his testimony and the big payoff by the US Government after his testimony and the trial concluded. The prosecution did not reveal the clearly material and exculpatory (in that it gutted the credibility of the sole direct witness against Megrahi) evidence to either the defense or the court. In fact, the investigation and prosecution team put numerous entries into their reports and records that "Tony Gauci has never at any stage sought to benefit" from his testimony, statements that appear to have been designed to mislead.
There were already substantial questions regarding the credibility of Gauci's identification of Megrahi as the purchaser of the clothes (detailed in the above linked document and summarized here). There further appears to have been a series of inconsistent statements by Gauci prior to trial, and several indications that he was not confident in his identification, many of which were also not disclosed to the defense for trial. Although these are allegations not yet proven up in court, the work and findings were done by the SCCRC and carry some serious weight; they are not self serving pablum from a desperate defendant.
The clear inference from the putative facts and findings by the SCCRC is that Gauchi was the crucial witness for the prosecution, was wobbly on the critical identification facts, was looking for a payday out of his involvement and the Scottish Crown got the US to agree to reward him with a windfall in order to firm him up. To be fair, there is often financial payment made to government witnesses from reimbursement of travel and lodging, to money for inconvenience, to payment to informers. But two million dollars to an identification witness? And another million to his brother that did not even testify? And active concealment of the situation? If true, that is blatant prosecutorial misconduct and perversion of justice. Another day at the office for the US Department of Justice.
The lottery payoff to the Gauci brothers purportedly was financed by the US "Rewards For Justice Program", the same program that was used to pay the tipsters on Uday and Qusay Hussein. The Rewards For Justice Program (RFJ) is administered by the State Department and is described by the State Department as follows:
Under this program, the Secretary of State is currently offering rewards of up to $25 million for information that prevents or favorably resolves acts of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property worldwide. Rewards also may be paid for information leading to the arrest or conviction of terrorists attempting, committing, conspiring to commit, or aiding and abetting in the commission of such acts.
In short, the program is designed to entice tipsters and witnesses to come forward with information aiding the investigation and prosecution of terrorism cases. It seems a bit of a stretch to use it to make huge payments to identification witnesses already known to investigators and prosecutors but that are looking for a windfall to give the prosecutors the testimony they want. Not surprisingly, the US Government has concealed their involvement. US authorities were a formal part of the Lockerbie task force investigating the bombing, yet, according to the SCCRC, made no written reports whatsoever regarding this material portion of their involvement in the case.
American politicians, including President Obama and AG Eric Holder, Secretary of State Clinton and many Congress members from across the spectrum howled with outrage at the Scottish Justice Ministry's decision to release Megrahi in return for dismissal of his appeal out of concern that the convicted Megrahi was cut loose in a secret deal by the Brits for oil rights with Libya. Perhaps instead they should investigate whether the US colluded to buy dubious testimony from Gauci in order convict Megrahi in the first place.
One thing is certain, if the evidence uncovered by the SCCRC is accurate, instead of howling US authorities might want to thank Scottish Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill for killing Megrahi's appeal, an appeal that very well may have led to a reversal of Megrahi's conviction based on misconduct involving the Americans. While it is unlikely either the US government or Congress will touch this bit of stench, let's hope the authorities in Scotland take a hard look into the matter.
South Elgin middle school students wore Cubs gear Tuesday in support of a classmate who is in the hospital, recovering from serious brain and skull injuries suffered in an attack in the hallway.
Another student allegedly slammed 12-year-old Henry Sembdner to the ground on Friday, after Henry bumped into the other student in the hallway between classes at Kenyon Woods Middle School.
Henry suffered multiple facial fractures and bleeding on the brain. He was taken to Presence Saint Joseph Hospital in Elgin, and later transferred to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, where he was placed in a medically-induced coma over the weekend. Tuesday morning, he was out of that coma, his breathing tube had been removed, and he was half smiling for the camera.
Classmates planned to wear Chicago Cubs gear to school on Tuesday to show support for Henry, since he counts himself among the team's biggest fans.
Alyssa Andersen has known Henry for years.
“I couldn't even think straight. I was like, ‘I cannot believe that this happened to my friend.' I was like, ‘Oh, no.'” she said. “He's just so sweet. He would do this for anyone else, and he's just the sweetest kid ever.”
At times, Henry's classmates feared he might not survive.
“Seeing him in the hospital and stuff, all the pictures, it's just so sad,” classmate Alex Best said.
Parents also have been moved by Henry's plight.
“I can't imagine what is mother is going through. As a mom, I just every single night when I put my kids to bed I'm just thankful and grateful that it's not my child in that hospital bed,” Jennifer Best said.
Meanwhile, Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said in a Tweet that he has a couple tickets waiting for Henry after he recovers and visits Wrigley Field.
Heard you are a big @Cubs fan Henry. When you are better I have a couple tickets and BP passes waiting for you at Wrigley. #StayStrong https://t.co/VYDFPE9rY0 — Anthony Rizzo (@ARizzo44) February 7, 2017
“We're just heartened by the outpouring of support and compassion. I know the family of the injured student, Henry, feel that way,” District U-46 communications director Mary Fergus said.
Fergus said Henry's condition has improved dramatically since Friday. He has been taken off a breathing tube, and is breathing on his own. He also has been talking, eating, and starting to walk around his room.
While District U-46 officials won't reveal much about the student believed to have caused Henry's injuries, police said he did not return to school on Monday. He was taken into custody Friday, and was detained briefly, but was then released to his parents.
The Kane County State's Attorney's office is considering an array of possible charges against the student who attacked Henry.
Two GoFundMe accounts have been set up to help pay for Henry's medical bills.

How do you play?
We made the game play as simple as possible for maximum fun. During a turn a person draws four cards from the Heebie Jeebie deck. We call this person “The Subject”. That person takes each card and places it face up on the board in the slots 1-4. Each card is read aloud to the other players. We included flavor text for each card to better describe it. After all the cards are out, the other players try to determine which of the four cards drawn give the Subject the Heebie Jeebies the worst. In other words, which of those cards causes the largest negative response. Everyone then takes their voting cards which represent the 1-4 on the board and vote face down which card they think will be chosen. When all votes are in, the Subject reveals the card they find the most disturbing. If the players were correct they get a point, if they are not then they don't. A new turn starts with the next person becoming the subject and so on. The game ends when someone reaches 10 points.

A short history of how the game was created.
In 2008 Heebie Jeebies was born out of the simple joy of making our friends cringe at various disturbing thoughts. From this button pushing we arrived at some of our favorites like “The Word Moist”, “Having an Ant Crawling Around in Your Ear” or “A Stranger Hiding in Your Back Seat”. From those first few ideas the game grew as we tapped into more and more ideas that caused people to shiver, wince and twitch.
With each play test we had of the game people asked to add more of their own Heebies, and we gladly accepted them. Each time we played the game we found two common threads. The first was that with each Heebie Jeebie card that was turned, all players internalize it as their brain painted them a vivid picture of what the card suggests. That alone would cause the other players to experience their own Heebie Jeebie while they then tried to determine if the Subject was bothered as much as they were by that same card. The second thing that happens is that, stories would burst out of people explaining why certain Heebie Jeebie cards bothered them the most. The first time we saw it happen we smiled. Then when it became common we were ecstatic. Knowing what buttons you can push on your friends is one thing, hearing the stories behind that turned out to be a true treasure. Now we're excited to bring you the game so you can share in the same fun experiences we've been having.

Creating your OWN CARD!
It was what you remember about the Pittsburgh Steelers' special teams the most in last week's win over the New York Giants. Penalties. And oh boy, there were a lot of them.
In total, four were accepted with two or three more being declined, canceled out by another. They hurt field position, sometimes in big ways, and made life tougher on the offense.
Speaking with Steelers.com's Bob Labriola, Danny Smith recognizes it has to stop.
“It's high because they're foolish,” Smith said via Steelers.com, responding to how upsetting penalties are.
It's become an increasingly common theme for the Steelers this season and there have been other stretches under Smith, like early last season, where the penalty number was simply far too high.
“We had way too many penalties in this past particular game. And what it is, you're like Salvation Army and Goodwill Industry. You're just giving it away.”
Cute quips aside, Smith says he tries to stress the impact it has on the offense or defense to help the special teamers focus on playing smart, technically sound, and ultimately not hurting the unit that's about to step out onto the field.
“We just gave them 15 yards. There's a huge difference of starting a drive at the 38 and starting a drive at the 23.”
The solution? It's pretty simple, though that doesn't always mean it's easy.
“You just got to keep coaching it, working it. We had way too many of those in those situations.”
Given the dreary weather conditions for this week's matchup against the Buffalo Bills, special teams and field position may be the key influencer on who wins this game. Right now, it's hard not to give the edge to the Bills.
From Jürgen Klopp's first game in charge of Liverpool, it was clear his players understood their duties without the ball and the importance of gegenpressing to regain possession quickly. This 4-1 win over Manchester City, however, was the first time Liverpool have offered such cohesion and intensity with the ball, too – the result was an outstanding performance.
The pressing, of course, was often how Liverpool's moves started. In a formation that looked sometimes like 4-3-2-1 and sometimes 4-3-3, Liverpool's attacking midfielders Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana worked hard to pressure City's full-backs, Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov. Emre Can and James Milner concentrated on closing down Yaya Touré and Fernando, rather than shutting down the full-backs, as has been the case in previous games.
Coutinho robbed Sagna to start the move which led to Liverpool's opener, a clumsy own goal by Eliaquim Mangala. “We gave them some questions in their buildup with our formation,” said Klopp. “So they couldn't start the game how they wanted.”
In possession, Liverpool's attacking charge was led by Roberto Firmino, again deployed in a slightly unusual centre-forward role. Whereas Christian Benteke would have engaged in a physical battle against City's centre-backs and Daniel Sturridge would have sprinted in behind, Firmino started from deeper positions and pulled City's central defenders up the pitch. Within the first 30 seconds Liverpool nearly got in behind through Lallana and Milner on the right, with City's centre-backs moving towards Firmino in an inside-left position.
Whereas Lallana and Coutinho were often located out wide when they were attempting to win the ball, in possession they were usually in a position to support Firmino closely. Both are naturals at drifting between the lines but here they were instead sprinting into the channels to play quick combinations with Firmino. The two Brazilians were on the same wavelength. Firmino swept a lovely ball into Coutinho's path for Liverpool's second, before the roles were reversed as Coutinho's neat, selfless layoff took Joe Hart out of the game and allowed Firmino to convert into an empty net for the third. Lone strikers can often become isolated but that was not a problem for Firmino.
With Lallana and Coutinho moving inside to take up central positions, the attacking roles of Milner and Can were crucial. They defended in central positions but then made overlapping runs towards the touchlines to ensure Liverpool retained width and continually filled the five channels around City's four defenders.
Attacking with five players meant Liverpool risked being caught out on the counterattack but then that's where their gegenpressing proved so useful – City continually struggled to play a positive first pass out of defence, often hurried and forced to turn back in possession. Kevin De Bruyne took up good positions by drifting either side of Lucas Leiva, but City could not find him quickly enough.
Liverpool's system was so effective that when Manuel Pellegrini made changes at the break, introducing Fabian Delph and Fernandinho in place of Touré and Jesús Navas, he organised his players into a system not dissimilar to Liverpool's, matching them in the centre of the pitch. City played few dangerous attacking combinations, however, and had nothing like Liverpool's tenacity when possession was lost.
Klopp had already recorded an impressive victory at Chelsea, but this Liverpool performance offered so much more in possession. The dynamism and intensity of the attacking players meant the fabled gegenpressing was not simply a useful way to defend, but also a brilliant weapon in attack.

For those of you whose primary political interest is stopping the growth of government or even shrinking it, you have to contend with national leaders who say they agree with you but who refuse to deal with immigration. They say immigration is a "social" issue that isn't related to government spending and deficit issues. They couldn't be more wrong. . . .
Let's start with this tidbit from government data provided by the Center for Immigration Studies (Table 13: "Immigrant Households with Children Under 18"):
Roughly ONE-HALF of all immigrant households with kids are accessing the welfare system, especially food and Medicaid welfare.
In this case, "immigrant" includes both authorized and illegal foreign citizens allowed by the federal government to settle in our country. Since 2000, that number each year has averaged around 1.3 million a year -- plus another 1 million births to those immigrant households.
With one-half of those households being poor enough to use the federal, state and local welfare systems, is there anybody blind enough to think that adding 2.3 million people a year to immigrant households is not driving huge increases in government?
That is 23 million disproportionately poor and welfare-using people a decade!
NumbersUSA doesn't take a specific stand on whether government should be bigger or smaller. But we do think it is strange that our government has this humongous program that imports massive amounts of poverty into the country each year. And the welfare use is just the tip of the iceberg. If about half of these households are poor enough to qualify for some form of welfare, that means they can't come close to paying the taxes required to provide for all the extra physical and social infrastructure to take care of the presence of these 23 million new residents each decade.
Even stranger is that this gargantuan driver of bigger and bigger government was promoted and continues to be supported by the Republican National Committee and by the Republican leadership of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
Republican leaders every day castigate Pres. Obama for trying to bloat government, but Republican leaders resolutely refuse to even suggest that the government reduce its importation of welfare-using immigrants.
Why?
The reason should be clear: Republican leaders may say they want to shrink Big Government, but not if it gets in the way of pleasing their cheap-labor corporate donors and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Two key drivers of the growth in welfare usage and bigger government are the chain migration and visa lottery categories of our immigration system.
Those two categories would be eliminated by the Gingrey bill and the Goodlatte bill (a couple of Republicans who are sincere in their concerns about the size of government and the burden on taxpayers).
Click on their names above to see if your U.S. Representative has signed on.
Not a single U.S. Senator -- Republican or Democrat -- has cared enough to even introduce a bill in that chamber.
But Republican leaders in Washington will not allow these immigration reductions or any other to be pushed to the top of their agenda. The word from the leaders is that Republicans are to ignore immigration altogether this year. The intent of the Republican leaders is to ensure that 23 million people continue to be added to the heavily welfare-using immigrant households each decade. That is one form of bigger government that the Republican leaders love.

5 Rules to Follow When Working with SEO in 2016
Even years on, SEO still remains as relevant as ever in the world of online marketing and promotion – marketers are more focused on driving high quality content and organic SEO through their websites and social media than ever, and as a result Google is now fully focused on rewarding genuine services from genuine people. Gone are the days of keyword stuffing where firms would be able to get away with pasting endless keyword chains without reason – and it's wise to be prepared for any changes that are likely to be made to Google's algorithms and SEO guidelines in future. We're over halfway through 2016 – and if you've not already started harnessing the power of SEO for your business, now is the time to take notice of the best tricks of the trade to get yourself seen and soon.
Focus on Mobile Traffic
In 2016, the rule regarding Google optimising your website and preparing your content for mobile browsing is simple – if you don't optimise your site for mobile devices, Google is going to penalise you by throwing you down the rankings. Mobile browsing is growing constantly and it is therefore essential that you at least have a form of responsive design or alternative site in place so that you can be comfortably read and visited by all comers on all devices.
Don't Ignore Local SEO
The power of local SEO is growing rapidly and it's again thanks to changes in Google's algorithms. Local SEO concerns ensuring that you let Google know where your business is based, and, where possible, throw in a few keyword phrases to bolster your appearance rate. Google now tailors search results to searchers' locations, meaning that you'll be more likely to appear in results for searchers close to you if you simply let Google know where you carry out your business. Ignoring local SEO in 2016 may be too big a risk to take.
Voice Searching
The way in which people search is always changing – and with the emergence of Google's voice searching platform, websites not only need to make sure they have relevant keyword phrases in place, but they also need to be coherent and searchable by voice – meaning that there is now a greater need for longer keyword phrases to ensure that you capture this growing, lucrative side of the market.
Watching, Not Reading
Online videos have never been bigger, and it's never been easier for websites to create, incorporate and upload unique, engaging video content for their customers to fall across with ease. Some of us simply prefer watching videos to reading – and according to some sources videos account for a majority share of all searches made through Google. Videos are absolutely on trend right now, making it a great idea to start thinking about how you can appeal to your key audience through the medium.
Be Sociable
Social media is all-pervasive – and a business or enterprise that isn't taking advantage of a Twitter account or Facebook page is truly missing out on connecting with their key audience on a level that drives trust and inspires purchases. It's thought that Google will start indexing social media content frequently in the months to come, meaning that getting yourself out there on the biggest social platforms may well be your ticket to SEO success in 2016 and beyond.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to Matt Taibbi. But before I do, let me read a sentence from a recent paper by Dean Baker, who concludes, “Most of the pension shortfall using the current methodology is attributable to the plunge in the stock market in the years 2007-2009. If pension funds had earned returns just equal to the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds in the three years since 2007, their assets would be more than $850 billion greater than they are today.”
And this — he quotes David Cay Johnston of tax.com: “The average Wisconsin pension is $24,500 a year, which is hardly lavish. But what is stunning is that 15% of the money contributed to the fund each year is going to Wall Street in fees,” which is why we now ask the question, “Why isn't Wall Street in jail?”
Actually, that's the title of reporter Matt Taibbi's new article for Rolling Stone magazine. In the piece, Matt writes, quote, ”Nobody goes to jail. This is the mantra of the financial-crisis era, one that saw virtually every major bank and financial company on Wall Street embroiled in obscene criminal scandals that impoverished millions and collectively destroyed hundreds of billions, in fact, trillions of dollars of the world's wealth.”
Well, I interviewed Matt Taibbi on Sunday about his report. Now I want to play an excerpt of our discussion.
AMY GOODMAN: We're seeing these mass protests in Madison, Wisconsin, and there are other protests that are happening. We see the working poor, the middle class, under tremendous stress, and yet they're the ones who are being hit hardest, not Wall Street. Explain what has happened. Why isn't Wall Street in jail?
MATT TAIBBI: Well, it's an incredible story. I mean, just to back up and provide some context, I think, for this Wisconsin thing, and especially for the Ohio thing, given what their governor used to do for a living —
AMY GOODMAN: Explain.
MATT TAIBBI: Well, he was an employee for Lehman Brothers, and he was —
AMY GOODMAN: This is Governor Kasich.
MATT TAIBBI: Governor Kasich, yeah, and he was intimately involved with selling — getting the state of Ohio's pension fund to invest in Lehman Brothers and buy mortgage-backed securities. And of course they lost all that money. And this, broadly, was really what the mortgage bubble and the financial crisis was all about. It was essentially a gigantic criminal fraud scheme where all the banks were taking mismarked mortgage-backed securities, very, very dangerous, toxic subprime loans, they were chopping them up and then packaging them as AAA-rated investments, and then selling them to state pension funds, to insurance companies, to Chinese banks and Dutch banks and Icelandic banks. And, of course, these things were blowing up, and all those funds were going broke. But what they're doing now is they're blaming the people who were collecting these pensions — they're blaming the workers, they're blaming the firemen, they're blaming the policemen — whereas, in reality, they were actually the victims of this fraud scheme. And the only reason that people aren't angrier about this, I think, is because they don't really understand what happened. If these were car companies that had sold a trillion dollars' worth of defective cars to the citizens of the United States, there would be riots right now. But these were mortgage-backed securities, it's complicated, people don't understand it, and they're only now, I think, beginning to realize that they were defrauded.
AMY GOODMAN: Explain what the crime is. Who has profited? Who should be on trial?
MATT TAIBBI: Well, you know, again, the broad crime in all of this was just fraud. They were taking — these banks were taking, again, these subprime mortgages, and they would have these billion-dollar pools of mortgages where, in some cases, 70 or 80 percent of the loans were to people who had no identification or no jobs or who had put no money down into the mortgage. And then they were taking these loans and applying this phony baloney, hocus pocus math, these derivative instruments, and turning them into AAA-rated investments. And they were marketing, again, these securities to, say, state pension funds as AAA-rated investments, which means credit risk almost zero. So they took the stuff that they knew was very, very risky and very, very likely to default, and they were going to the state of Wisconsin, the state of Ohio, the state of New York, and saying, “Hey, this is almost as safe as — or in fact, it is as safe as United States Treasury bonds. You should buy this, and you'll earn a little bit more than you'll earn if you buy T-bills.” The reality was, they were just taking absolutely worthless stuff and sticking it with these people and then fleeing the scene. This is no different than drug dealers who take a bag of oregano and sell it to you as, you know, a pound of weed. That's exactly the same scam.
AMY GOODMAN: Talk about John Mack and Gary Aguirre.
MATT TAIBBI: This is an amazing story, just because it demonstrates how far above the law these people are. John Mack is one of the most powerful people on Wall Street. Right now he's the chairman of the board at Morgan Stanley. He used to be their CEO. Way back in 2001, when he was sort of between jobs, he had left Morgan Stanley and was interviewing with Credit Suisse First Boston. He was involved in a case that was investigated by the SEC. A hedge fund called Pequot made a very suspicious investment into a company called Heller Capital, which was about to be acquired by General Electric. This hedge fund bought, you know, an enormous amount of Heller stock three weeks before this acquisition by GE of Heller. Credit Suisse First Boston was Heller's investment banker. John Mack was interviewing for the job with Credit Suisse a few days before Pequot made its purchases, and he was in direct contact with the hedge fund guy who made those purchases. Under any normal circumstances, he would be targeted for investigation by the SEC.
AMY GOODMAN: And his name was?
MATT TAIBBI: The investigator's name was Gary Aguirre. And Aguirre —
AMY GOODMAN: And the guy buying up?
MATT TAIBBI: Art Samberg was the name of this hedge fund manager. He was a big star on Wall Street. In fact, there are articles about, you know, how does Art Samberg manage his amazing returns year after year? Well, you know, this was sort of a clue as to how.
Anyway, this SEC investigator named Gary Aguirre wanted permission to go interview John Mack, and his superiors at the SEC told him — they basically told him that he couldn't, and the reason they said was because Mack has, quote-unquote, “powerful political connections.” At the time, he was a Ranger, one of Bush's fundraising Rangers. He would later become a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton. So he played both sides of the fence. This, again, is very typical of Wall Street. And Aguirre, when he pressed the matter, he was fired by the SEC.
AMY GOODMAN: You say in your article that the justice system has actually evolved into a highly effective mechanism for protecting financial criminals, not just not prosecuting them, but protecting them.
MATT TAIBBI: Right. Well, one of the things that I found out when I was interviewing former SEC officials and whistleblowers, people who had been involved in some of these cases, is, you know, when you look at the revolving door situation with all these — the Mary Jo Whites and the Gary Lynches and the Linda Thompsons, these former high-ranking financial cops who leave government service and they go to work in these millionaire partnerships on Wall Street, it creates this collegial atmosphere where it's just a few — a small group of lawyers who all know each other, and they're in this constant merry-go-round, from government, back to private service, back to government again, and they're really in this — it's far too collegial.
There's a scene in my story where the current head of the SEC enforcement, Robert Khuzami, is giving a speech to all these lawyers, and he's saying, you know, “We have a new policy now where if you're a defendant or if you're a company that's being investigated, you can come to the SEC, and we will get you answers as to whether or not the Department of Justice has a criminal interest in your case.” So, essentially, the SEC is now acting as a middleman for these companies, so they can go and find out whether they're going to be criminally prosecuted. Then, once they get that information, they can make a decision about whether or not to settle financially with the SEC. And they pay a settlement. Nobody gets criminally prosecuted. No individuals ever get fined. They pay these fines, and they almost always have a little section in there that says that they do not admit wrongdoing. So, they don't even have to say they're sorry, essentially. These companies go and they pay their fines. No individuals have to suffer at all. And it's all done in a very collegial way.
AMY GOODMAN: You suggest in your piece that Bernie Madoff went to jail because it was rich people who were the victims.
MATT TAIBBI: Absolutely. Every single former investigator or current investigator that I talked to said the same thing: Madoff went to jail because the wrong people suffered. You know, it was famous actors. It was, you know, the glitterati in New York. If these were teachers and firemen and all the usual suspects — you know, look at the — we have a million people in foreclosure in this country right now, and a lot of them are there because of predatory lending and because of this fraud scheme, but there are no criminal prosecutions. I think that's the reality now, is that we don't see anybody being criminally targeted unless their victims were powerful people themselves.
We have two-and-a-half million people in jail this country, you know, more than a million who are in jail for nonviolent crimes. And yet, we couldn't find a single person on Wall Street to do even a day in jail for losing 40 percent of the world's wealth in a criminal fraud scheme? And that tells you that we have — this goes beyond the cliché that rich people have better lawyers and they have an advantage. This is a step beyond that. This is a situation where the system is completely corrupted, and it's true regulatory capture. The SEC and the Justice Department are essentially subsidiaries of Wall Street.

Brace yourselves, woodworking hobbyists, professional artists and budding entrepreneurs.
After more than a year of delays, the Philadelphia-based makerspace NextFab will finally open its doors near Wilmington's West Center City neighborhood on Thursday.
"I'm so excited to get in there," said Jason Aviles, a 33-year-old yoga instructor, entrepreneur and nonprofit director who lives nearby. "I can't wait to take these concepts I have and manifest them using the supplies, expertise and environment that are being made available to us here."
Often described as a gym for innovators, NextFab is part trendy co-working space and part high school shop class.

The 10,000-square-foot space at 503 N. Tattnall St. is outfitted with dozens of tools ranging from bandsaws and lathes to laser engravers with a retail price that would rival most luxury cars.
In exchange for a monthly membership fee, anyone can gain access to the equipment, along with classes on how they can be used to make your own coffee table, fidget spinner or Father's Day nightlight.
But the biggest project for NextFab may be to help rebuild the city it now calls home.
Located in a neighborhood marked by blight and violence, the company is being looked to as a linchpin for Mayor Mike Purzycki's effort to "stabilize" West Center City, the Wilmington Renaissance Corp.'s long-running attempt to build a thriving Creative District and even Gov. John Carney's vision for an entrepreneurial economy.
The company's ability to assist with those efforts helped NextFab land a $350,000 taxpayer grant from the Delaware Economic Development Office in late 2015 – funding that was contingent on its ability to open a Wilmington location and maintain 120 members for three years.

"Sure, there's a certain amount of pressure to perform," NextFab President Evan Malone said Wednesday.
"But I think people want us to succeed," he said. "We're good at what we do, and there will be real economic activity that comes out of this, so I'm not too worried."
Malone first launched NextFab in West Philadelphia amid the Great Recession. The company not only survived the economic downturn but eventually flourished and now occupies two locations in the City of Brotherly Love with 700 members between them.
Carrie Gray, the Wilmington Renaissance Corp.'s managing director, said she first toured NextFab in 2013 and immediately saw its potential for the Wilmington Creative District, a public-private partnership then in its infancy.
"Little did (Evan) know the courtship, and frankly stalking, that would begin," she said.
Today, the Creative District includes a handful of murals, a public arts garden and the first of what will be 12 homes at Fourth and Washington streets built by Interfaith Community Housing and marketed to artists and makers.
Barrel of Makers – the city's first organized collective of painters, woodworkers, glass blowers, engineers, computer programmers and 3-D printer builders – also has been offering programs at the William "Hicks" Anderson Community Center on Madison Street.
Gray said the goal is to eventually seed an artists' colony from West Center City to Market Street, anchored by sites such as NextFab.
"Having something like Nextfab really helps to round out our ecosystem here in Wilmington," she said. "We see this as a huge step forward."

Malone said he had hoped for NextFab to arrive earlier, but the arrival was delayed by the process of selecting the right location. An initial 3,500-square-foot site at Eighth and West streets was abandoned in favor of the current site – a long-vacant photography studio with considerably more space.
NextFab was worth the wait, said Purzycki, who hailed the business as a magnet for young people looking to "exercise their creative ability and enjoy Wilmington."
The neighborhood has been a magnet for violence. The four-block radius around NextFab's new location has been the site of seven shootings in 2017, including two homicides.
"We're going to have lots of flood lighting and security cameras outside," Malone said. "We've also got a buddy system worked out to be sure our customers and safe are not leaving in the evening hours without supervision."
The company's arrival also comes less than a month after the mayor unveiled his "neighborhood stabilization program" for West Center Center, which he promised would include a greater police presence, increased trash pickup and a crackdown on nuisance properties.

"We are going to build this community and make this community safe," Purzycki said during a ribbon-cutting for the business on Wednesday.
He added that the redevelopment effort also would require jobs, and with them, an effort to provide job skills to community residents – skills they can now learn at NextFab.
"Your city stands ready to embrace you," Purzycki told the business. "We're thrilled to have you."
Yet some residents, such as Amira Idris, are hoping NextFab can help provide them with more than a job. She's hoping it helps her build a company.
After earning a master's degree in entrepreneurship from the University of Delaware last year, the 24-year-old founder of Vibrating Therapeutic Apparel was accepted into a 12-week business accelerator program at NextFab in Philadelphia, a crash course in product development that also came with a $25,000 investment.
This month, she signed on to be the first tenant in one of the half-dozen office spaces on the second floor of NextFab's new Wilmington location. There, she hopes to turn her design for a sleeve that relieves phantom limb pain into a final product.
"NextFab has been so wonderful in moving my company along, but I was getting tired of commuting to Philly," she said. "I'm so glad these resources are now available a little closer to home."

Carney said he hopes other entrepreneurs from the University of Delaware make a similar to move to Wilmington, either to NextFab or one of the city's co-working spaces.
"The point of all this is to bring young folks into our city, to bring their talents and cultivate them so they stay here and help us grow our city in very positive ways," he said. "I couldn't be more excited."
Aviles, the co-founder of the artist co-working space Artist Ave Station at Eighth and Tatnall streets, said his excitement is a little different – perhaps even verging on nervousness.
"I'm actually not a builder," he said, despite having landed a free two-month membership.
"I'm kind of like intimidated slightly by it," he said. "But at the same time, I'm excited because I know I'm about to learn and NextFab is going to teach me."

Michigan Breakfast Stout label
The Michigan Liquor Control Commission forced Founders Brewing Co. to change its popular Breakfast Stout beer label. The new label removes a picture of a baby eating a bowl of oatmeal.
(ATTB)
UPDATE:
GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Oh, baby... What now? Apparently, Michigan isn't cool with the Founders
label, either. On Wednesday, Aug. 26, the Grand Rapids brewery announced it was changing the label of its popular seasonal beer because state alcohol regulators took issue with the picture of a baby eating oatmeal on the label -- which, as it turns out, has not actually been registered with the state for many years. "The baby of Breakfast Stout is taking some time away from his crib after being booted from the label in our home state of Michigan,"
on the brewery website. "However, you'll continue to see that familiar face in all other states within our distribution footprint -- and soon!" The label has been an issue in New Hampshire, where a bar-owning state legislator
amending state rules to allow for some images of minors on alcoholic beverage labels as long as they didn't encourage young people to drink.
This Breakfast Stout label is against Michigan rules.
New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan subsequently
the bill and, in late June, the state House and Senate
to change the rules around alcohol advertisements and allow the Breakfast Stout baby to be on shelves there. Thus far, Founders response to the kerfuffle has been largely silent. The brewery is not known for being eager to pick fights with alcohol regulators. In July, the brewery created a new label for the beer, showing an empty bowl and chair at a table where the baby previously was and a note on a refrigerator behind that read, "left the crib for a bit, call me if you need me, 616-522-2720." The number reaches a recorded, tongue-in-cheek message:
Michigan Liquor Control Commission
state "an advertisement or label affixed to a container, covering, carton, or case of containers of alcoholic liquor shall not depict or make reference in any manner to minors." In November, an MLCC investigator discovered the Breakfast Stout label was not actually registered with the state despite the beer having been sold on shelves for about a decade. The investigator allegedly told Founders the label would be found in violation of state liquor code were it properly registered.
and removed all bottles of Breakfast Stout from its taproom at 235 Grandville Ave. SW in Grand Rapids last fall. Bottles were not pulled from Michigan store shelves. Michigan and New Hampshire are not the first states to fuss over Founders labeling. In 2012, Alabama allowed the company to sell its Dirty Bastard scotch ale and Backwoods Bastard barrel-aged scotch ale after initially
. Company co-founder Dave Engbers said Michigan is the only state where Breakfast Stout will be distributed with the new label. The brewery hopes the original label,
when Founders was still a small operation on Monroe Ave. NW, can be returned to Michigan bottles. When the MLCC took issue, "we immediately challenged our marketing team to create a new label to address their concerns, but also maintain the label's characteristics and personality that the beer enthusiast community has enjoyed for nearly 10 years," Engbers said. "We look forward to working with the MLCC in the future to see if bringing back the original label is an option," he said. "In the meantime, it's still the same delicious Breakfast Stout that fans have come to love." Breakfast Stout is a backbone of Founders' "
" marketing. The popular fall/winter beer comes out every September. Founders beer is distributed in 35 U.S. states. The brewery is
by Mahou San Miguel, an international brewer based in Spain that holds a 30 percent stake in Founders. The company recently completed a $40 million brewhouse
that increases its beer output capacity to 900,000 barrels per year.

Learn how you can persist data independently from the pod lifecycle with a hands-on example application
In my previous guide Kubernetes Patterns: Stateless Applications we managed to set up a basic guestbook application. But what about applications which need to persist data independently of the pod lifecycle.
Thats where persistent volume storage and secrets come in. Persistent volumes allow you to persist data independently of the pod lifecycle, while secrets allow you to store sensitive data into a separate space from the pod configuration.
We will demonstrate these features by setting up a simple WordPress site inside our Kubernetes cluster.
Prerequisites
Running Kubernetes cluster
Internet connection
Kubectl connection
If you don't have a running Kubernetes cluster yet, get started with my guide All in One Cluster with kubeadm as we will base this guide on that setup.
Step 1 – Prepare Deployment Resources
We will prepare all Kubernetes Resource files needed for later deployment.
local-volumes.yaml
mysql-deployment.yaml
wordpress-deployment.yaml
First create a directory where we will store all Kubernetes resources.
$ mkdir wordpress-example $ cd wordpress-example
Then download all the example resource files for the WordPress example.
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/mysql-wordpress-pd/local-volumes.yaml $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/mysql-wordpress-pd/mysql-deployment.yaml $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/mysql-wordpress-pd/wordpress-deployment.yaml
And that's it. We are now ready to start with the deployment of the different Kubernetes resources.
Step 2 – Create Persistent Volumes
To store our data persistently we will have to prepare persistent volumes.
Create two persistent volumes by using the downloaded Kubernetes volumes resource file.
$ kubectl create -f local-volumes.yaml
local-volumes.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: local-pv-1 labels: type: local spec: capacity: storage: 20Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce hostPath: path: /tmp/data/pv-1 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: local-pv-2 labels: type: local spec: capacity: storage: 20Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce hostPath: path: /tmp/data/pv-2
Now check that the persistent volumes exist by using the persistentvolumes or pv key.
$ kubectl get pv NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE local-pv-1 20Gi RWO Retain Available 1m local-pv-2 20Gi RWO Retain Available 1m
And that's it, we got our persistent volumes ready to serve claimable space for our pods.
Step 3 – Deploy WordPress Application
Let's setup our WordPress application to claim storage from our prepared volumes. To set up the database we will need to securely store a password. That's where secrets come in handy.
Define a secret object with the name mysql-pass and the key password to store our mysql database credentials.
$ kubectl create secret generic mysql-pass --from-literal=password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
Check if the secret has been successfully created.
$ kubectl get secrets NAME TYPE DATA AGE ... mysql-pass Opaque 1 52s
Let's look a bit deeper into the secret by using the describe key. We can see our password key with the hidden credentials.
$ kubectl describe secrets mysql-pass Name: mysql-pass Namespace: default Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Type: Opaque Data ==== password: 8 bytes
Now create the mysql deployment, by using the mysql-deployment.yaml kubernetes resource. This creates following resources:
Service named WordPress, routing traffic to mysql pod
Persistent volume claim of 20GB
MySQL database deployment Loading credentials from secret object into MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD variable. Persistent volume claim mounting into container
$ kubectl create -f mysql-deployment.yaml
mysql-deployment.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: wordpress-mysql labels: app: wordpress spec: ports: - port: 3306 selector: app: wordpress tier: mysql clusterIP: None --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: mysql-pv-claim labels: app: wordpress spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 20Gi --- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: wordpress-mysql labels: app: wordpress spec: strategy: type: Recreate template: metadata: labels: app: wordpress tier: mysql spec: containers: - image: mysql:5.6 name: mysql env: - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: mysql-pass key: password ports: - containerPort: 3306 name: mysql volumeMounts: - name: mysql-persistent-storage mountPath: /var/lib/mysql volumes: - name: mysql-persistent-storage persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: mysql-pv-claim
Now let's check that our service, deployment and persistent volume claim have been created correctly by using their shorthand notations:
pods = po
= service = svc
= deployment = deploy
= persistentvolumeclaims = pvc
$ kubectl get po,svc,deploy,pvc NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE po/wordpress-mysql-7b4ffb6fb4-65vd9 1/1 Running 0 10m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE svc/kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 3d svc/wordpress-mysql ClusterIP None <none> 3306/TCP 10m NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE deploy/wordpress-mysql 1 1 1 1 10m NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE pvc/mysql-pv-claim Bound local-pv-1 20Gi RWO 10m
We can also verify the claim by looking at the persistent volumes.
$ kubectl get pv NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE local-pv-1 20Gi RWO Retain Bound default/mysql-pv-claim 54m local-pv-2 20Gi RWO Retain Available 54m
Last but not least, let's deploy our WordPress application with the downloaded Kubernetes resource file. This will create:
Service named WordPress, routing traffic to pod
Persistent Volume Claim of 20GB
Deployment named WordPress Loading credentials from secret key into WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD variable and the database hostname defined in the WORDPRESS_DB_HOST variable Mounting volume claim
$ kubectl create –f wordpress-deployment.yaml
Although we are defining the service port of type LoadBalancer, this will in our case jump back to exposing the port on NodePort.
wordpress-deployment.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: wordpress labels: app: wordpress spec: ports: - port: 80 selector: app: wordpress tier: frontend type: LoadBalancer --- apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: wp-pv-claim labels: app: wordpress spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 20Gi --- apiVersion: apps/v1beta2 kind: Deployment metadata: name: wordpress labels: app: wordpress spec: selector: matchLabels: app: wordpress tier: frontend strategy: type: Recreate template: metadata: labels: app: wordpress tier: frontend spec: containers: - image: wordpress:4.8-apache name: wordpress env: - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST value: wordpress-mysql - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: mysql-pass key: password ports: - containerPort: 80 name: wordpress volumeMounts: - name: wordpress-persistent-storage mountPath: /var/www/html volumes: - name: wordpress-persistent-storage persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: wp-pv-claim
Again we check that our service, deployment and volume claim have been deployed without problems.
$ kubectl get po,svc,deploy,pvc NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE po/wordpress-db8f78568-cgpbw 1/1 Running 0 4m po/wordpress-mysql-7b4ffb6fb4-65vd9 1/1 Running 0 23m NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE svc/kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 3d svc/wordpress LoadBalancer 10.98.84.33 <pending> 80:31097/TCP 4m svc/wordpress-mysql ClusterIP None <none> 3306/TCP 23m NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE deploy/wordpress 1 1 1 1 4m deploy/wordpress-mysql 1 1 1 1 23m NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE pvc/mysql-pv-claim Bound local-pv-1 20Gi RWO 23m pvc/wp-pv-claim Bound local-pv-2 20Gi RWO 4m
As we are basing this guide on my All-in-One Cluster with kubeadm we can get the exposing nodePort on the WordPress service and combine it with our node IP in a web browser. This will show us a running WordPress installation.
We have now successfully set up a WordPress application by using a WordPress deployment and a mysql datastore deployment. Both save their data to persistent volume claims.
Step 4 – Testing Persistence Features
Now that we have our application set up, with persistent volumes and their mounted volume claims where to save data, let's see how it holds up.
First, complete your WordPress setup. Afterwards login in to your new WordPress site and generate some test data by installing FakerPress plugin.
On your sidebar go to the FakerPress section and start generating some content. After that you should have many blog posts including images.
Now let's scale down our WordPress and mysql database deployments to 0 replicas, which will wipe out all running pods.
$ kubectl scale --replicas 0 deploy wordpress $ kubectl scale --replicas 0 deploy wordpress-mysql
If we again scale up, our deployments content will reappear thanks to our persistent volume claims.
$ kubectl scale --replicas 1 deploy wordpress $ kubectl scale --replicas 1 deploy wordpress-mysql
We just successfully tested our deployments persistent volume capability.
Conclusion
We have managed to set up a small WordPress application with a MySQL data store. Both applications are able to persist their data independently of the pod lifecycle. We tested this by shutting down all pods of the application and then again starting them to find our data in their previous saved state. We also learned how to save sensitive data to secrets independently from pod resource specifications.

It's been reported by TVA Sports that the Wild have secured the signature of undrafted 21 year old defenceman Guillaume Gelinas of Val-d'Or Foreurs in the QMJHL (Marco Scandella's old junior team). The Wild reportedly beat out two other NHL teams to give him his first professional contract.
On his Twitter feed, Michael Russo is playing down the signing saying that free agency doesn't begin until July 1st, but it's possible that the Wild could have a verbal agreement in place. We'll keep you notified here if this becomes more concrete.
After playing in the QMJHL since 2009-10, Gelinas just had is the best year, scoring 92 points in 67 games which earned him the Emile Bouchard award for the league's best defenceman. He was fantastic in the Memorial Cup and showed great determination to play a length semi-final game while heavily injured.
-Here is his basic info:
Age 21 Position D Height 5'9" Weight 181 lbs Nation Canada Shoots L
-Here's a short description of him from McKeen's Hockey:
Undersized overager who dominated every offensive category by a defenseman in both regular season (67GP-23G-92P) and playoffs (24GP-11G-34P) is also playing for a professional contract.
It's still unclear whether or not he will join the Wild but, if he does, this seems like a low risk/high reward signing that could, at best, give the Wild a surprising new talent that slipped under other teams noses or, at worst, provide more depth in Iowa.
History can be fatal to literature. Aeschylus wrote 80 or 90 plays, and Sophocles 120, yet we have just seven of each. Didymus Chalcenterus of Alexandria reportedly wrote 3,500 books; not one exists today. Between classical antiquity and us, there has been a hecatomb of words. They have been burned, thrown away, lost to mold or pulverized. They have been rubbed off so that vellum and papyrus could be reused. Bookworms have eaten them by the dictionary-load.
Among the works that survived — but only just — is one so beautifully written and so uncannily prescient that it seems to come to us out of a personal dream. Titus Lucretius Carus' “De Rerum Natura,” or “On the Nature of Things,” is a 7,400-line poem in Latin hexameters written in the first century B.C. It covers philosophy, physics, optics, cosmology, sociology, psychology, religion and sex; the ideas in it influenced Newton and Darwin, among others. Yet Lucretius almost went the way of Didymus. In “The Swerve,” the literary historian Stephen Greenblatt investigates why his book nearly died, how it was saved and what its rescue means to us.
About Lucretius himself, we have little more to go on than the lurid story told by the fourth-century church father St. Jerome: that he was born in 94 B.C., went mad as the result of a love potion and killed himself at 43. We can add that he was a disciple of Epicurus, who lived 250 years earlier, and hence of the even earlier Democritus, whose theory of atoms underlay Epicurean ideas. (The original texts of both philosophers also didn't make it, as a surgeon might say with a sad shake of the head in a TV drama; we know them only secondhand.)
Democritus thought that everything was made of material particles, and Lucretius took that as his starting point. Such “atoms,” he wrote, are infinite and eternal; no one made them, nothing can destroy them. They hurtle through the universe, not in straight lines — that way they could never tangle up together to form objects — but with a minuscule “swerve” or “clinamen” in their trajectory. Veering slightly off course, each atom bumps into other atoms and clings or entwines with them for a while; later, their swerve carries them away again.

Humans are made of atoms too, including our souls. If gods exist at all, they are uninterested in us. We are free, liberated by the unpredictability of the swerve, as are all living things. We are all connected, and when we die, our atoms go off to join other atoms elsewhere. Death is only dispersal; there is no need to fear any afterlife, or mutter spells and prayers to absent deities. We do better to live by the simple Epicurean law: Seek pleasure, avoid pain. This does not mean indulging ourselves gluttonously, but cultivating tranquillity while avoiding the two greatest human delusions: fear of what we cannot avoid, and desire for what we cannot have. One extraordinary section describes the frenzies of lovers, who exhaust themselves futilely trying to possess one another. The beloved always slips away. Instead, we should step off the wheel and contemplate the universe as it is — which brings a deep sense of wonder, rather than mere resignation or gloom. “What human beings can and should do,” as Greenblatt summarizes it, “is to conquer their fears, accept the fact that they themselves and all the things they encounter are transitory, and embrace the beauty and the pleasure of the world.”

It was an attractive philosophy, exquisitely expressed, and a few decades later Ovid enthused that “the verses of sublime Lucretius are destined to perish only when a single day will consign the world to destruction.” A world without Lucretius seemed unimaginable — yet that was just what nearly ensued. All ancient copies vanished, except for a few charred scraps in a library at Herculaneum. Some medieval copies circulated, but these too mostly expired from neglect or deliberate destruction, for Epicurean philosophies were uncongenial to Christianity. At last, in 1417, probably in the southern German Benedictine abbey of Fulda, one stray ninth-century copy caught the eye of a Renaissance book hunter from Italy, ­Poggio Bracciolini.
OTTAWA — The Liberal government's ill-defined plan to give Canada's cyberspy agency wide-ranging powers to go on the attack against threats could trample civil liberties, warns a newly released analysis.
The report by leading Canadian cybersecurity researchers says there is no clear rationale for expanding the Communications Security Establishment's mandate to conduct offensive operations.
"The case has not been made that such powers are necessary, nor that they will result in a net benefit to the security of Canadians."
The 71-page report, made public today, was prepared by a team of five researchers from the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa.
Earlier:
It delves into intricacies of the sweeping Liberal security bill, tabled in June, that would give the CSE new authority to conduct both defensive and offensive cyberoperations. The report makes 45 recommendations to safeguard privacy and human rights.
The Ottawa-based CSE uses highly advanced technology to intercept, sort and analyze foreign communications for nuggets of intelligence that are of interest to the federal government. It is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
The secretive CSE has been thrust into the headlines in recent years due to leaks by Edward Snowden, the former spy contractor who worked for the National Security Agency, the CSE's American counterpart.
The Liberal legislation, which followed extensive public consultations, would give the CSE new muscle to engage in state-sponsored hacking and other covert measures. It would be authorized to interfere "with the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign individual, state, organization or terrorist group as they relate to international affairs, defence or security."
Chris Wattie / Reuters A sign is pictured outside the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) headquarters in Ottawa on Jan. 28, 2015.
However, what this exactly means isn't clear, nor does the legislation require that the target of the CSE's intervention pose some kind of meaningful threat to Canada's security interests, the report says.
The previous Conservative government gave the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the national domestic spy service, the power to disrupt plots that threaten Canada, not just gather information about them. Disrupt could mean anything from defacing a website to sabotaging a vehicle.
The CSIS powers stirred controversy, raising fears of constitutional breaches, and the Liberal bill refines them to ensure consistency with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The analysis says the proposed new CSE powers "have the capacity to be at least as invasive, problematic and rights-infringing" as activities conducted by CSIS in the course of its threat-reduction activities.
The case has not been made that such powers are necessary, nor that they will result in a net benefit to the security of Canadians.
The authors recommend the CSE be required to obtain judicial warrants, much like CSIS does, before taking disruptive actions in cyberspace. At minimum, there should be a more robust plan for independent, real-time oversight of the CSE's offensive activities.
They also caution that endorsing state-sponsored cyberoperations has serious international implications, and is "likely to legitimize and encourage other states — including those with problematic human rights records — to do the same."
Yigal Carmon (Hebrew יגאל כרמון) (born 1946)[1] is the president and cofounder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), an organization which monitors and translates Arabic and Persian publications; radio and TV broadcasts; and religious sermons into many languages and circulates them over the Internet.
Carmon was a colonel at Aman, the Israeli military intelligence service, and later counter-terrorism advisor to Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir.
Biography [ edit ]
Yigal Carmon was born in Romania in 1946 and immigrated to Israel with his family at age four. He grew up in Hadera. In high school, he began to study Arabic, and eventually achieved native-level fluency. At age 18, he had his conscription to the Israel Defense Forces deferred so he could study as part of the Atuda program. After earning a degree in Orientalism from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he joined the IDF in 1968 and served in the Intelligence Corps until 1988, reaching the rank of Colonel.[2] He also served in the Mossad.
From 1977 to 1981, he served as an adviser on Arab affairs to the Civil Administration in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. When Menachem Milson was appointed to serve as head of the Civil Administration, Carmon was appointed his deputy. After Milson resigned in September 1982, Carmon served as acting head of the Civil Administration until Shlomo Ilya was appointed to the position in 1983.
In 1988, Carmon was appointed adviser on counterterrorism for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Following the fall of the Shamir government in 1992, he served for a year as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's counterterrorism adviser before resigning in 1993 due to his opposition to the Oslo Accords. From 1991 to 1992 he was also a part of the Israeli delegation to peace negotiations with Syria in Washington.[2]
In 1998, Carmon founded MEMRI.
Carmon has also testified before the US Congress and European parliaments.[3]

On reporting "difficult realities" [ edit ]
According to Ruthie Blum, writing in the Jerusalem Post, Carmon and MEMRI's translations of material appearing in the Arabic and Persian media, "have been received with a combination of angst and ambivalence on the part of the press and politicians who don't like what they're seeing."[3]
Carmon relates that his experience of portraying difficult realities in the Arab-Muslim world: "In 1994-5, before MEMRI was formally established, I taped TV broadcasts of [ Palestinian Authority chairman] Arafat calling for jihad. The reaction to that tape was: 'Kill the messenger'...And I protested by saying, 'But it's not me [calling for jihad]; it's him [Arafat].' To which they replied, 'That doesn't matter.'. Then one day, I asked a very senior journalist with whom I was friendly, 'Why are you criticizing our work? We're merely revealing the truth.' His reply is one I'll never forget: 'There is no such thing as truth,' he said. 'Every news item must be judged by the question of whom it serves. And you are serving the enemies of peace.' Horrified, I retorted, "And you're the one who's considered the reliable journalist, while I'm seen as biased?' So he said, 'If you want to play naive, do it with someone else, not with me. You know I'm right.' 'No,' I said. 'I do not know that you're right. There is such a thing as truth, and it is impartial'[3]
On the English version of Al-Jazeera TV [ edit ]
"If they copy the Arabic version...into English, then they will be committing suicide. Because the whole world will see what role Al Jazeera is playing in making the Muslim world extreme....[On the other hand, if the two channels were to take different stances on global issues, the organization would be] 'speak[ing] from two sides of its mouth'.[4]
Criticism [ edit ]
Journalist Brian Whitaker has accused Carmon of presenting false testimony to Congress when he allegedly misrepresented a Gallup poll. Responding to his charge of having an agenda, Carmon wrote "You are right: we do have an agenda. As an institute of research, we want MEMRI to present translations to people who wish to be informed on the ideas circulating in the Middle East. We aim to reflect reality. If knowledge of this reality should benefit one side or another, then so be it."[5]
Regarding Whitaker's criticism of Carmon's "political background", Carmon responded that:
"You continually refer to my supposed "political background" as if I had something to hide, and I wonder if I am your real target here. As a civil servant and adviser on counter-terrorism to both Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin, prime ministers from opposing camps, my role was not a political appointment. If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so."[5]
Carmon also questioned Whitaker's own biases, stating that:
I note your website is "Al-Bab", ("The Gateway" in Arabic). Would I be justified in concluding that you are not, in fact, completely neutral about the Middle East, even though you are Middle East editor of a national newspaper? I wonder how you would judge an editor whose website was called "Ha-Sha-ar" ("The Gateway" in Hebrew)?[5]
Quotes [ edit ]
"Facts are bipartisan" [3]
"Whatever the agenda, the research has to be scientific. If it isn't - if we were trying to prove that some phenomenon existed when it didn't, or vice versa - it wouldn't be an agenda, it would be bias" [3]
"Public declarations made by Arafat and his associates contradicted the spirit of the Oslo accords and reflected their genuine intentions" [6]
"There is an unholy alliance between the Left and the Right, who say that Arabs have a different culture which cannot and should not be changed. Such a position, of course, is complete nonsense and utterly immoral. Arabs are human beings like we are, and they deserve everything we enjoy." [3]
"The Palestinians...continue to educate their children to jihad by the sword, while telling their critics that jihad has many meanings."[3]

Battles of the Somme
The Great War Arrives in Picardy, September 1914
The German Kaiser Wilhelm II arrived in Bapaume on 29th September with his entourage. He was hoping for a victory over the French Army in Picardy followed by a triumphant march to Paris. (1)
By 22nd September 1914, following the First Battle of the Marne (6th – 12th September 1914) and the First Battle of the Aisne (12th – 21st September 1914), the French and German armies began fighting a series of battles side-stepping one another through northern France in an attempt to outflank the other. These outflanking manoeuvres would take them in a north-westerly direction from the Aisne region towards the French coast. This period of fighting became known as “The Race to the Sea”. When the fighting of the First World War arrived in the Somme and Picardy region in September 1914 the British Expeditionary Force was not involved in the first battles of the Somme at that time.

German trench construction in Bernafay Wood (called Bayernwäldchen by the German Army) east of Montauban from 1915. Between the wooden fence and the supporting wooden wall in the photograph a set of stairs led down to one of the deepest German-built bunkers on the Somme. (3)
During 1915 the German Second Army carried out an intensive programme of construction on its Front Line and Second Line from its northern right flank at Monchy-au-Bois, south across the Ancre river valley and over the gently rolling chalk hills to the Somme river.
From August 1915 the British Third Army, commanded by General Sir Edmund Allenby, began to take over a sector of the Front Line north of the river Somme from the French Army. In December 1915 the new British front stretched from Ransart to Curlu on the Somme river. At this time the British Third Army was sandwiched between the French Tenth Army holding 20 miles of Front Line in the Arras sector and the French Sixth Army holding the Front Line south of the Somme river.
The Somme sector remained quiet over the winter of 1915/1916. The German troops busied themselves securing their defences. On both sides of the wire the troops carried on the daily routines of trench life and training.

Cemeteries on the Somme Battlefields
Crosses for German casualties buried at the German military cemetery of Fricourt on the Somme battlefield.
There are over 250 military cemeteries on the Somme battlefields for the many thousands of casualties who have identified graves. The cemeteries range in size from a few battlefield burials to cemeteries containing several thousand individuals. There are graves marked as unidentified for those whose remains were discovered, but it was not possible to identify them. In the case of the French military cemeteries and burial sites there are graves and ossuaries for the remains of French soldiers. The German military cemeteries are on land granted by the French nation for the burial of German dead, but in most cases the soldiers are buried with up to four individuals in each plot and in mass graves marked as “Kameradengraben” (Comrades Grave).
Monuments on the Somme Battlefields
Monuments and memorials on the Somme battlefields range from monuments dedicated to the memory of thousands of troops whose identified remains are missing, to monuments commemorating a specific military unit or an individual.
Thiepval Memorial to the Missing
Thiepval Memorial to the Missing on the Somme battlefield.
The Thiepval Memorial to the Missing commemorates over 72,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom and South African forces who died in the Somme sector before 20th March 1918 and have no known grave. Over 90% of those commemorated died during the 1916 Battles of the Somme between July and November 1916.

When the NFL calls, it's hard to say no.
Adam Zaruba, Canadian rugby sevens star, is off to try out with the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.
The 26-year-old North Vancouver giant admits it's all about unfinished business.
He played football in high school at Carson Graham and then was recruited to play at SFU but to put it in his words, “it didn't work out.” He redshirted for a year for the Clan, didn't play for his second, was ineligible for his third.
Eventually he found his way to rugby, was quickly spotted by the rugby sevens staff at Rugby Canada as a prospect and by 2014 was a full-time member of the national squad.
Fast-forward three years, and he's made a name for himself on the international rugby stage. Now it's time for a new big stage.
“It will be a really awesome thing for me as an athlete,” he said before flying out to Philadelphia on Friday.
“The window here is very small.”
After his World Rugby Sevens Series season came to an end in May, Zaruba got a call from a South African rugby agent who was developing contacts in the NFL.
“Would you like to try the NFL?” he was asked. It didn't take long for Zaruba to say “yes.”
He was just getting into rest and recuperation mode, but he quickly had to shift gears to not only get into something approaching football shape, but also put together a video of him in action.
He called up UBC Athletics' strength and conditioning coach Joe McCullum. McCullum brought UBC football coach Blake Nill, quarterback Mike O'Connor in to help. PR man Len Catling stepped in to put together a highlight tape.
“He worked out with us and it was very, very good for a kid who hasn't been in that position or that experience for a while,” Nill said of the 6-foot-5, 265 pounds might-be tight end.
“What it would come down to for him, you've got to look at three elements: he has the physical skills, but does he have the technical skills? Maybe to a lesser degree does he have the mindset — which he should have. He's played international rugby at a very high level, it's a level of competing he's proven he can maintain.”
In the past, a football coach might have turned up their nose at a non-specialist athlete, but coaches in all sports are looking more and more simply for the right mix athleticism and character above all else, Nill pointed out. The skills can be taught, but the physical and mental mostly can't.
“That's my philosophy, I recruit genetics,” Nill said. “If you've got the genetics and the mindset to compete, I'll take you any time over a guy who's a complete freak as a technical player, who has a lack of motivation.
“If he was eligible to play university football, I'd be all over him.”
Zaruba's also spent plenty of time in the gym and this past week brought in former SFU strength and conditioning coach Derek Hansen to work on his speed, especially his 40 metre sprint.
“I've been blown away about how many people have put their hand up,” he said. “Nobody asked for anything, they were just excited to help out.”
The Eagles put in their offer a couple weeks ago. He's not closing the door on his rugby career, but the NFL chance was too big.
“After this past season with the sevens, it's going to take a very special opportunity for me to leave, it's such a special group,” he said. “It's a bittersweet moment, the boys are super sad to see me go, but they're super stoked for me, too.”
Canada's sevens coach, Damian McGrath, said he was “delighted” for his giant winger.
“He has such enormous potential both physically and technically I'm not surprised he's being seriously scouted,” he said. “I knew when I first saw him at close quarters he was an X-factor player.
“It's a blow for the program, but we are all supportive of the big man and want him to succeed.”
Though he admits the chance to make a good living in football is very appealing — there's no comparison to the small peanuts he makes in rugby — Zaruba's just excited about the challenge on its own.
“It's a positive thing no matter which way you slice it,” he said. “At the foundational level you have to love sports, the process of sports.
“No one would say money wouldn't be motivating, but this is an achievement (as an athlete) … that I feel I'm capable of doing.”

Just a very last minute gift idea .
Or idea to store away for later use.
. . .
We have some great friends who are both kitchen savvy.
One likes to cook ( and bbq ) and the other likes to bake .
Perfect combo in that household.
But we sure appreciate what these friends of ours have done for us since moving here to Georgia, so I wanted to give them a little kitchen love.
And because they're from the south, a little “Let's Eat Y'all” on the front of his apron………
………….because you're not really a southerner unless you say “y'all”, right?
** Edited: Okay, I now know that we won't fit into the south until we learn to spell y'all correctly. Thanks for the tips on how to spell it in the comment section. Grrrrr……..now the gift has a spelling error. Take us or leave us, right???? Haha!
The half apron is plumped up with some yummy ruffles ………
………and a nice full bow in the back.
A fun little set to gift away.
**Now get in the kitchen, you two!
Would you like to make one of them? Or the other?
…….or maybe both??
I started with the full length apron.
I used an apron we already had, to use as the shape. I folded it in half and then cut out the same exact shape on a folded piece of sturdy polyester/cotton blend. (The finished apron is about 29 inches tall, 10 inches along the top, and 26 inches at its widest point…..in case you don't have one to trace around.)
I set that aside and began cutting my own bias tape to go around the entire apron. You can just buy some bias tape at the store but I wanted mine to match exactly, so I cut my own. To do so, you need to cut thin strips of fabric, cut on the bias. The bias is the diagonal of the fabric. There is a selvage on each side edge of the fabric (it's usually manufactured and sealed looking) and the your cut ends on the opposite ends. Grab your corner where your cut end and your selvage meet and fold it over at an angle, creating a diagonal fold along your fabric………and that's your bias line. Make sense?
Cut right along that diagonal line, giving you an edge to start with……and then start cutting out strips.
I cut my strips out 1.5 inches wide and as long as my fabric would allow. (You can sew strips together to make them long enough too.) You'll need enough to go along all edges of the apron, for the neck loop, and the ties for the back.
Then, fold each strip in half lengthwise and iron flat. Then open it up and fold both raw edges into that center fold and iron again.
Then use your long strips of bias tape to finish off the edges of the apron.
Start with a long strip going from one side, down along the bottom, and up the other side. Then stop. To do this, open up the bias tape, and slide the edge of your apron right inside of the bias tape.
Pin in place.
And use enough pins along the curved edges (if you made yours with curves) to keep the bias tape in place.
Sew along the inner edge of the bias tape, securing it right to the apron.
Then add bias tape along the very top of the apron too.
Next, create a piece of bias tape that is long enough to create a loop for the neck, to go along both upper sides of the apron and then have the ends extend out long enough to tie around the back. (You may have to sew several pieces of your bias tape together to create a piece long enough.)
Then sew all the way along the bias tape, attaching it to the fabric as well as sewing the bias tape closed for the neck loop and the ties. Just start at one end of the bias tape, and keep sewing in one continuous line.
Then, I used my Silhouette machine (found here ) to cut out some heat transfer material and ironed it right to the front of the apron. Nice and personalized.
(Click here to see how else I have used the heat transfer material.)
That was it.
For the Ruffly Apron …
I cut out a base piece of fabric that was a slight “A” line. (Dimensions are listed below….but keep in mind that you can adjust the size of your apron to whatever size you'd like.)
Then I folded under the bottom (21 inches long) and side edges a 1/4 inch, then another 1/4 inch, then sewed in place.
Then I cut out my ruffles. I cut all 3 pieces of fabric 9 inches tall by 40 inches long.
Then I folded over each edge a 1/4 inch, another 1/4 inch, then sewed them into place.
Except for the top ruffle…….I didn't fold over or sew the top edge of the top ruffle because it will be included in the waistband at the top of the apron. (You don't want added bulk in there.)
Then I made a basting stitch along the top of each ruffle, 1/2 inch from the top. (If you look closely, you can see that the basting stitch on the right, is for the top ruffle and there is no folded edge on that one. It's just a raw edge.)
Need help with basting stitches and gathering? Click here for more info.
Then I gathered in the bottom ruffle and pinned it to the bottom of the base piece, about 2 inches from the bottom.
Then I did the same with the next two rows of ruffles, making sure that the top ruffle (with the unfinished upper edge) was at the top. Line up the top ruffle with the top of the base piece and then center the middle ruffle between the two other ruffles. Once all ruffles are pinned in place and look even, sew along that original basting stitch, attaching the ruffles to the base piece.
Now for the waistband and ties.
I cut 2 pieces of fabric that were 4 inches wide and 88 inches long. (I had to sew some pieces together to make them that long.) Then I sewed my two long pieces together with right sides together, using a 1/2 inch seam allowance. However , I left a 19 inch wide gap along the very center of the two strips and didn't sew them together at all for those 19 inches.
(I also sewed each end of the strips into a point and trimmed off the edges just because I like the look of the angled tie ends. But you don't have to do that.)
Then I turned the strip right side out, poked out the ends, folded under the edges of that 19 inch gap a 1/2 inch………and ironed everything flat.
Then I slid the opening of the strip over the top edge of the apron. I matched up the edges of the opening of the strip with the top edge of the apron.
I pinned all along the top and bottom of the waist band section.
Then I sewed all the way around the entire strip……down to each end and angled tip. I sewed about 1/8 of an inch from the outer edge.
Then I added another seam along the shape of the waistband, about 1/4 inch from the outer edge………to really secure the waistband to the apron.
And that was it.
Now, 2 aprons for a very deserving couple of friends.
The 500-home run club has gained a new member.
Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz took Tampa Bay Rays starter Matt Moore deep in the fifth inning of Saturday's game for the 500th homer of his illustrious career. He hit his 499th career home run in the first inning. Your browser does not support iframes.
Ortiz is the 27th major league hitter to reach the milestone and the first since Gary Sheffield did so on April 17, 2009 as a member of the New York Mets.
Entering Saturday, only three players had hit their 500th home run while playing for the Red Sox: Ted Williams (521 career homers), Jimmie Foxx (534) and Manny Ramirez (555). Ramirez was the most recent Boston hitter to achieve the feat, with his 500th coming on May 31, 2008.
Ortiz now has 34 homers this season, which leads the Red Sox and ranks seventh in the American League.

If electric bicycles could be charged just by riding on a powered bike lane, would more people want to use them? A new design concept for an e-bike shows how the system might work, eliminating one of the challenges of this type of transportation–the need for batteries.
“Considering a future where power is everywhere, it makes no sense to me to have large, heavy batteries with short life cycles and polluting manufacturing and recycling processes,” says Offer Canfi, the Royal College of Art graduate who created the design.
Most of the world's electric bikes–especially the 30 million produced each year in China–still use lead batteries. In China, lead production has caused mass poisonings, and recycling often causes even more problems when toxic wastewater is dumped in rivers. Though alternative batteries are becoming more common, they also have their own issues with manufacturing and disposal.
In Canfi's design, energy would be stored in a lightweight capacitor without the heavy metals or chemicals used in a typical battery. A simple attachment could be added to any bike to make it compatible with the system. A special bike lane, embedded with coils, would recognize the bike when it rides by, and wirelessly send it electricity. Solar panels along the roadside could provide enough power to keep the system running.
In addition to making electric bikes a lot greener, Canfi argues that the new system would be easier to use. Without batteries, e-bikes would be lighter, and you'd never have to worry about plugging in the bike to charge. As a bonus, you could also charge the phone or laptop in your backpack as you ride.
“If you consider the current problems that e-bike and other light electric vehicles suffer from, you can see two main things: batteries and range,” he says. “Knowing that I don't have to charge my bike at work, and that if I'm on the power lane I can still easily cycle, makes the choice to ride instead of drive even easier–if you ever tried cycling on a depleted e-bike you know what I mean.”
The system is something that he thinks could be possible in the near future. Although the fast-charging capacitors he envisions aren't available yet, inductive charging lanes are already starting to be used for buses in places like Sweden and Korea.
Every time a new physical media format debuts, the first batch of titles that arrive alongside it are always a wonderfully random mix of hits and pure mediocrity. (Remember when Sony included a copy of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby with the PlayStation 3? Oh, memories.) Thankfully, nothing's going to be any different for the launch of Sony's 4K Blu-ray discs.
The company has announced that you'll be able to truly own — and hold in your hands — 4K content early in 2016, though it's still not specifying an exact street date. As Engadget notes, that actually misses the Q4 timeframe that the Blu-ray Disc association was originally aiming for. When they do hit retail, Sony says its UHD titles will support HDR, which will result in a much bolder, brighter picture if you're got a very new and compatible TV. But enough about all that; you want to know which movies are coming first, and here they are:
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Tomatometer: 52%)
Chappie (31%)
Hancock (41%)
Pineapple Express (68%)
Salt (62%)
The Smurfs 2 (14%)
That's right. Based on pooled critical consensus, the 2008 stoner flick starring Seth Rogen and James Franco is the best of this lot. That's pretty rough! Even if that's somehow your favorite movie ever, do you really need to see it in higher resolution than 1080p? Rest assured, in the very same press release, Sony says a steady flow of titles will follow the launch lineup and points to its growing vault of recent blockbusters and classics that've seen 4K restorations. Those include:
Fury, Captain Phillips, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Men In Black, Ghostbusters, The Fifth Element, Bad Boys, The Da Vinci Code, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Leon: The Professional, Lawrence Of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Guns of Navarone, Taxi Driver, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
So if you still haven't upgraded to a 4K HDTV, worry not: Sony's rollout of UHD Blu-rays probably won't send you to an impulse purchase. Maybe by the end of the year. We'll see.
