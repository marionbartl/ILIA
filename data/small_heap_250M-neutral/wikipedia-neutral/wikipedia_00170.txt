All Saints Episcopal Church (or All Saints) is a church of the Episcopal Church of the United States at 4550 North Hermitage Avenue in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1883, the structure was declared a Chicago Landmark in 1982. All Saints are currently an active church, and is most well known for its community outreach programs that include a food pantry and events that attract all members of its neighborhood.
History
The church was designed by architect John C. Cochrane and built in 1883 at the corner of Wilson and Hermitage Avenues. Previously, the congregation gathered in a nearby Methodist church. The building was created in stick style as shown by the use of vertical beams and decorative shingles and continues to be a rare example of stick style architecture in the city, in addition to being Chicago's oldest wood-frame church. Wood was likely used because other available materials, such as stone, were too expensive. Furthermore, the church's location was outside of Chicago's city limits, where wood construction was not permitted after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. The stained glass windows were originally designed by the Healy & Millet firm. John Hulla designed the adjoining rectory in 1905 in a Tudor Revival style. The congregation intended to demolish and replace the sanctuary in the early 1900s, however the Great Depression stalled their plan.
The church community flourished through the 1950s but in 1960, attendance began to dwindle and by 1992, the church was in danger of being shuttered. despite being declared a city landmark only ten-years earlier. At that time, the congregation's membership was reported to be only about 30, but increased interest and attendance since 1992 prevented the closure of the church. The church's attendance has continued to grow, and some sources have noted that All Saints could be considered the "fastest growing Episcopal congregation in Chicago." In 1992, a renovation plan for the church began and was completed in 2016 with a $2 million renovation plan to address structural issues with the church and restore its exterior design.
The church was recognized with the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Preservation Award in 2017.
Church and community services
The church offers several morning services on Sundays which either follow a low church or broad church format. In addition, the church partners with Ravenswood Community Services (RCS) to provide outreach and aid to disadvantaged members of the community. The church kitchen operates a weekly food pantry with the help of volunteers from both RCS and the congregation, and has sometimes catered to as many as 400 individuals in one night.
Special events
All Saints have been noted for some events that deviate from typical Sunday services. One such special service in the Fall is an annual pet blessing, where members of the congregation are invited to bring their pets to church to receive blessings. In 2010, the service included 74 dogs, 13 cats, one rabbit, one lizard, and several other animals. The Day of the Dead is celebrated along with All Saints' Day in a single service. A New Orleans-style brass band is invited to process into the church and accompanies the choir during this service.
References in literature
Poet Carl Sandburg was believed to be one of early congregants of All Saints. One of their poems, entitled Onion Days, describes a produce seller named Jasper in the following manner:
Jasper belongs to an Episcopal church in Ravenswood and on certain SundaysHe enjoys chanting the Nicene Creed with their daughters on each side of them joining their voices with his.''
Sandberg is thought to be referring to All Saints in this particular passage, as it was the only Episcopal church in Ravenswood.

Grady Wilson is the name of a fictional recurring character on the NBC sitcom Sanford and Son played by Whitman Mayo. The character's name first appeared in the 1972 episode "The Dowry;" however, in this episode they were played by Albert Reed Jr. and they were Fred's cousin. Once Mayo took the role, Grady became a regular on the show.
Character history
Grady is the best friend of Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx), the main character of "Sanford and Son", a junk and antique business in Watts. Grady is portrayed as an elderly man, known for their stooped appearance and their gray hair and beard.  They are most commonly seen wearing an oversized, pale-blue sport coat and walks with a slow shuffle. They often stop by Fred's house to drink and play cards, and they regularly accompany Fred in their various schemes, much to the chagrin of Fred's son Lamont.  They are sometimes referred to by Fred as "Shady Grady" (a nickname that would be referenced in the 1996 pilot of Malcolm & Eddie).
Grady is extremely absent-minded and regularly forgets the names of people they know—especially Lamont, who is Grady's godson. When Grady asks them their name, Lamont often responds by sarcastically giving them a similar name (such as "Lucas" or "Lawrence"), which Grady then acknowledges. (Grady is named after Demond Wilson, the actor who played Lamont on the series. Their full name is Grady Demond Wilson.) They frequently confuse certain words, upon hearing them, for anything similar-sounding (such as referring to the "munchies" as "Munchkins"). Grady often refers to their old age, or their impending death, or the deaths of their and Fred's friends. They also frequently inadvertently insults Fred's sister-in-law Esther, by telling them something Fred has said about them  They are often easily alarmed or surprised, and when excited, they are known to exclaim their catch phrases, "Good goobily goop!" or "Great googly moogly!". Grady also has a habit of being easily upset, usually when complimented, accidentally offended or hearing of illness or impending death striking a friend, sobbing uncontrollably and blowing their nose loudly (Fred often responds to this by telling them irritably "Don't do that, you gonna blow somethin' outta your head that you need!")
For a time during the series' run, Fred was "out of town" (due to a salary dispute between Foxx and NBC), leaving Grady in charge of Fred's business, effectively making Grady the main character on the show. During Fred's absence, Grady moved into Fred's house, and also took over the role of Lamont's comic foil. Like Fred before him, they also quite frequently ran afoul of Lamont's formidable Aunt Esther.
Grady appeared on Sanford and Son from 1973 until 1977. During this time, Mayo also starred in a TV series about the character, Grady. In this series, Grady moves out of Watts to live with their daughter. The show was short-lived, and they eventually returned to Sanford and Son. Mayo reprised the role of Grady again in the show's short-lived spin-off The Sanford Arms, in which Grady is married to their former girlfriend, Dolly. Mayo reprised their role again as a guest star on Sanford.

The is a monument for peace to commemorate Sadako Sasaki and the thousands of child victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. This monument is located in Hiroshima, Japan. Sadako Sasaki, a young girl, died of leukemia from radiation of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.
Overview
The monument is located in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan. Designed by native artists Kazuo Kikuchi and Kiyoshi Ikebe, the monument was built using money derived from a fund-raising campaign by Japanese school children, including Sadako Sasaki's classmates, with the main statue entitled "Atomic Bomb Children". The statue was unveiled on 5 May 1958, the Japanese Children's Day holiday. Sadako Sasaki, who died of an atomic bomb disease radiation poisoning is immortalized at the top of the statue, where they hold a wire crane above their head. Shortly before they passed, they had a vision to create a thousand cranes. Japanese tradition says that if one creates a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish. Sadako's wish was to have a world without nuclear weapons. Thousands of origami cranes from all over the world are offered around the monument. They serve as a sign that the children who make them and those who visit the statue desire a world without nuclear war, having been tied to the statue by the story that Sadako died from radiation-induced leukemia after folding just under a thousand cranes, wishing for world peace. However, an exhibit which appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sadako had achieved their 1000-crane goal and continued to fold more cranes. Unfortunately, their wish was not granted and they died of the leukemia on October 25, 1955. Them main reason of death was from the radiation poisoning from the atomic bomb Little Boy.
Monument
Beneath the main structure hangs a bronze crane that works as a wind chime when pushed against a traditional peace bell from which it is suspended. The two pieces were donated by Nobel Prize winner, Hideki Yukawa.
At the base of the monument is a black marble slab on which is inscribed in Japanese:
The figures that surround the monument are angels, representing that Sadako is in heaven among the other fallen angels who died during the atomic bombing in Hiroshima.
Today, people all around the world have the opportunity to donate cranes that they have folded in honor of Sadako and the others. The paper crane is a symbol of peace, which was their last dying wish.

The Nariño tapaculo (Scytalopus vicinior) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is found in Colombia and Ecuador.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Nariño tapaculo was originally described as a subspecies of Tacarcuna tapaculo (Scytalopus panamensis) and was retained there until after Krabbe and Schulenberg (1997) noted "no particular similarity, either in plumage or in voice, between true S. vicinior and S. panamensis".
Description
The Nariño tapaculo looks similar to several other Andean tapaculos. The male's head is dark gray, the back is dark gray or brown, and the rump is cinnamon with dusky bars. The throat, chest, and belly are lighter gray and the flanks and vent area are yellowish brown with blackish bars. The female is similar, but the back is browner, the throat is lighter gray, and the lower belly sometimes yellower.
Distribution and habitat
The Nariño tapaculo is found on the west slope of the Andes from Colombia's Risaralda and Chocó Departments south to southwestern Cotopaxi Province in Ecuador. There it primarily inhabits the understory of moist montane forest and sometimes forest edges. In elevation it generally ranges from but can be found as high as in Ecuador.
Behavior
The Nariño tapaculo preys on a variety of insects, but little more is known about its feeding phenology. Little is also known about its breeding behavior other than that breeding condition specimens were collected in November, December, and April.
The Nariño tapaculo's song is "a fast series of well-enunciated, ringing notes that starts out with a brief stutter but then may go on for 15-30 seconds, pididi-ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü--ü" .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the Nariño tapaculo as being of The Least Concern. Despite its somewhat small range and unknown population numbers, both are believed large enough to warrant that classification.

History
The earliest known flags of Bahrain were plain red. In 1820, Bahrain signed a general maritime treaty with the British Empire, and as result, a white stripe was added to the flag to signify the treaty and to distinguish it from the flags commonly used by pirates. In 1932, a serrated edge was added to the flag in order to differentiate it from those of its neighbours.
The flag originally had twenty-eight white points, but this was reduced to eight in 1972. On 14 February 2002, the number was again reduced, to five, so that each of the points could stand for one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

Robert Franklin "Bob" Mimm (October 18, 1924 – May 7, 2017) was an American racewalker who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.
Mimm was born October 18, 1924, to Paul Charles Kinaley and Violet Meriam Mimm and was raised by their grandparents, Horace and Bertha Mimm, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they spent their childhood and graduated from McCaskey High School in 1943.
After graduation, they were inducted into the United States Army Air Corps, completing Airplane Mechanics School in 1943 and Aerial Gunnery School in 1944. During World War II, they served in the India-China Division and worked as an airplane mechanic during the Air Transport Command's perilous mission known as "Flying the Hump".
Following their service in World War II, they graduated from Millersville State College in 1950 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. Their first teaching position was in a one-room schoolhouse for Amish children in Blue Ball, Pennsylvania.
They interrupted their teaching career to join the Army Reserve in 1950 and was assigned to the 64th Tank Battalion during the Korean War. A tank commander, they recalled the first round of fire with the 120 mm guns: "I was standing in the torrent and was knocked to the floor of the tank. My ears rang for several days." They attributed hearing deficit to this experience. After active duty in 1952, they remained in the Army Reserves until 1986. They attended Military Police School and became a fully accredited special agent with the Criminal Investigation Division in 1974 and served as president of the division from 1981 – 1983.
When they returned from the Korean War, they went back to teaching school at various locations in Pennsylvania and taught all grades from 1st thru 12th. English and history were their specialties. They also coached junior and senior high school track. Over the years, they furthered their own education and added a Master of Education Administration and Supervision from Rutgers University in 1956 and a Master of Arts in Guidance and Counseling from Trenton State College in 1974. In 1962, they obtained a civilian position with the U.S. Army as Education Advisor of military personnel at Fort Dix, New Jersey. They held the same position while stationed for two years (1966-1968) in Germany and then returned to Fort Dix as Education Advisor until 1979 when they took the position as Equal Employment Opportunity Officer. Bob also taught criminology and sociology courses at Burlington County College in New Jersey. They retired in 1986.
Bob was physically active their entire life. They were a well-rounded athlete in high school and college competing in wrestling, cross-country, gymnastics and track and field. In high school their 5'11 frame weighed 136 pounds. They maintained a thin physique their entire life and was known by the nickname "Fats". In 1955, they responded to an advertisement for a meal and medal to competitors who completed a 15-mile race walk in a specified time at Lake Hopatcong, NJ. They finished under the time limit but was too tired to eat and blisters developed that kept them from walking for several days but the sport piqued their interest. They developed a lifelong love for race walking and began competing in about 25 races a year. They even took a job as letter carrier with the United States Post Office from 1959- 1962 to spend working hours training. Their labors were rewarded in 1960 when they qualified for a berth on the United States Olympic team as a competitive racewalker in the 20K. In 1964 they were the subject of an article in Sports Illustrated. Bob won Eastern, National, North American and Pan American Track Championships in Master's Competition. They competed in World Masters Championships starting in 1975 and brought home the gold medal 10 times for individual performance in to racewalk. Bob was selected three times as racewalker of the year in the Masters category by United States Track & Field. They held national as well as world records in their sport. They also completed numerous marathons competing as a race walker in a field of runners. They were inducted into the USATF Masters Hall of Fame, Shore AC Hall of Fame and The New Jersey Sports Writers Hall of Fame. At age 91 they were still walking five miles a day at Mill Creek Park in Willingboro.
After retirement, they indulged their passion for travel and set foot on all seven continents. Their adventures in over 100 countries mostly involved hiking and mountain climbing.
They had two children with first wife Anne (Weber) - Bonita and Richard - and five children with wife Theresa (Symanowicz) - Randolph, Roberta, Noreen, Clifford, Douglas.
They died at home in Willingboro, New Jersey, at age 92 on May 7, 2017, after battling prostate cancer for three years. Their ashes were distributed on their favorite hiking mountain, Pikes Peak in Colorado, by their family.

Blaxland is a town in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Blaxland is located 65 kilometres west of Sydney in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. It is at an altitude of 234 metres and borders the townships of Glenbrook, Mount Riverview and Warrimoo.
History
Blaxland is named for Gregory Blaxland who along with William Lawson and William Wentworth, led the exploration that discovered a route over the Blue Mountains in 1813. Prior to 1879 the area was known as Wascoe.
The Pilgrim Inn was built c. 1825. It was a significant element in the area for some time, but eventually decayed. The remains, which are now adjacent to McDonald's, are heritage-listed.
The Rev. Joshua Hargrave became a major presence in the area in the early 20th. century, and a significant force in the growth of Blaxland as a village, especially South Blaxland. They built the first church in the area and, with their family and the Calver family, is associated with four homes that still survive: Tanfield in Hope Street, Menahne in Hope Street, Rosedale in View Street and Nardi in View Street. The homes are all heritage-listed.
Heritage listings
Blaxland has a number of heritage listed sites, including:
Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks

Minidoka County is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,613. The county seat and largest city is Rupert.
Minidoka County is part of the Burley, ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.
The name Minidoka is of Dakota Sioux origin meaning "a fountain or spring of water." Minidoka was first used in 1883 as a name for the Union Pacific's Oregon Short Line, a railroad spur in the middle of the Snake River Plain. The spur later became the site of a watering station along the line. The village of Minidoka grew up next to the station. The Minidoka name was then given to a reclamation project under then President Theodore Roosevelt which included the construction of the Minidoka Dam, completed in 1904. Minidoka National Historic Site (in adjacent Jerome County) was part of the original reclamation project and hence shares the name. Minidoka County was created by the Idaho Legislature on January 28, 1913, by a partition of Lincoln County.
Camp Rupert, west of Paul, was a prisoner of war (POW) camp during World War II.

El Gran Silencio is a rock en español band from Monterrey, Mexico that blends a variety of rock, reggae, dancehall, and hip-hop influences with traditional Latin American musical forms such as cumbia, vallenato and Norteño. Their lyrics tend to be bohemian and often talk about life in the “barrio” or poor neighborhoods of Mexican cities, especially Monterrey. As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations and have toured Mexico and the United States.
The music
They are unique on the Mexican music scene with their music being called world beat, cumbia grupero and rap but, their musical style crosses various genres and can combine any number including hip-hop, reggae, norteño, cumbia, rock-and-roll, polka, huapango and vallenato. Much of what keeps it together are Latin folk rhythms and the use of accordion licks. The band has called their work“freestyle norteño popular;” however, founder Tony Hernandez strongly links the music to rock as they say that rock showed that mixing genres is possible and they maintain rock's rebellious nature.
Their work, especially their early work, has received criticism, and some dismiss it as "naco" (low class), as they celebrate subcultures such as chúntaros, barrio youths wearing baggy pants and hip-hop musical tastes. As one of few major Mexican alternative bands with authentic barrio roots, Silencio works to get that culture more accepted by mainstream Mexican society. Life in the barrio is a very common theme in the music. Tony Hernandez often talks nostalgically about life in their hometown of Monterrey, grilling carne asada on the street and playing the Beatles or La Tropa Colombiana along with family and friends. However, their lyrics are more bohemian than materialistic.
Although rap was a major element in their early work, unlike Spanish language rap artists, they perform live with real instruments. They also collaborate with other musicians on projects, to add instruments such as congas, or event to extend the band into ten pieces, with the configuration of an Afro-Caribbean orchestra with brass and percussion sections. The album Chúntaros Radio Poder creates the day in an imaginary radio station, with a number of popular Monterrey DJs of the time taking turns presenting the songs.
History
El Gran Silencio emerge from the poor barrios of the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, founded by brothers Tony and Cano Hernandez in 1993. At first they called themselves La Zona del Silencio, and had only a cheap harmonica and guitar, sing pails and trash cans for the percussion, while saving money for real instruments. After finding a cassette of band of the same name, they changed it to El Gran Silencio, taken from a song by Rodrigo “Rockrigo” González, a singer/songwriter who died in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.
Their very first recording was on a local, independent label, but their first commercial release was Libres y Locos in 1998. It immediately caused waves in the Spanish language rock community, as it combined rap-style lyrics with a ranchera attitude. The single from this album, Dormir Soñando, had some airplay on MTV en Español but did not become a hit on radio until it was covered by Los Chicos del Barrio. Their second album, Chuntaros Radio Poder,(2001) expanded the musical mix, and the rap element faded. This album began with wide mix of styles from those reminiscent of the rock of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, but with heavy Latin American rhythms from norteño to cumbia and vallenato. the album produced the alternative hit, Chúntaro Style.
The band at first recorded in Mexico, but have since done so in the United States. However, their only appearance on US charts is a guest appearance with Juan Gabriel on the Kumbia Kings single No Tengo Dinero.
As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations, including an album with other artists as a tribute to Los Tigres del Norte.
Over it more than twenty-year history, band members have changed, with the bass player changing twice. The first bass player was Julian Villareal and the next César Vulgar Hernandez. When Julian left, they sued the band. The current line up (2015) is Tony Hernández, Isaac Valdez, Ezequiel Alvarado and "Wiwa" Flores .
Appearances
Initially their ambition was to play a club in Monterrey, but since have toured both the United States and Mexico on multiple occasions, with appearances at music and cultural festivals such as the Festival Jóvenes que Muevan II in Guadalajara, Vive Latino 2015, Machaca Fest 2015 and twice at the, Festival Internacional Cervantino, Their second appearance here in 2014 was to represent their home state of Nuevo León.

Hicks Hall, or Hickes' Hall, was a courthouse at the southern end of St John Street, Clerkenwell, London. It opened in 1612, and was closed and demolished in 1782. It was the first purpose-built sessions house for justices of the peace of the county of Middlesex (including the City of Westminster), and became the main court of petty sessions and arraignment for more serious offences, including cases involving plots, attacks and minor transgressions against the state.
The hall stood at the start of the Great North Road, running from London to York and Edinburgh, and was routinely used as the datum point for measuring mileages along that route.
Prehistory and location
From at least the 1540s, the Middlesex justices regularly held their sessions in an inn at the southern end of St John Street. This was one of the closest points in the county of Middlesex to the City of London, lying immediately north of Smithfield Bar, a tollgate on the City boundary. Two inns were used at different times: the Castle, on the west side of the street, and the Windmill, slightly further north on the east side.
In the 1570s, Elizabeth I granted a lease of waste land in the street to the surveyor Christopher Saxton for building a new sessions house, but nothing more is heard of this project.
Hicks Hall
In 1609, James I was petitioned by the magistrates of Middlesex for a new site for a sessions house. The petition was successful, and this time the building was erected, being completed in 1612.
The location chosen was an island site in the middle of St John Street where it broadened out, opposite the Windmill inn, and close to the junction with St John's Lane. The estimated costs of construction alone were estimated at up to £900 (in general commodities ). The building was paid for by the wealthy fabric merchant Sir Baptist Hicks (or Hickes), later created 1st Viscount Campden. At the first session held in the new building, in January 1613, it was resolved that it should be named "Hicks-hall" in honour of its patron.
For 170 years, Hicks Hall was used to hear cases in the county of Middlesex, and is mentioned in many contemporary reports. On 9 October 1660, a grand jury was convened here to try 29 of the men who had signed the death warrant of Charles I, proceedings then continuing at the Old Bailey Sessions House. In 1679, Titus Oates gave evidence here in connection with the "Meal-Tub Plot" against James, Duke of York. In 1682, Count Karl Johann von Königsmarck was acquitted at Hicks Hall of complicity in the murder of Thomas Thynne (although they had in fact almost certainly hired the three assassins). In 1683, William, Lord Russell was condemned to death at Hicks Hall, following their trial at the Old Bailey, for their involvement in the Rye House Plot.
The hall receives a passing mention in Samuel Pepys's diary for 6 December 1660:
In addition to the sessions house, the original intention was to incorporate a small prison in the building, to relieve overcrowding at Newgate. In the event, the site proved too constricted to allow this, but a more modest lock-up was included.
Closure and successor courthouses
By the 1770s the street had become uncomfortably busy and noisy for court business, and the building itself had fallen into disrepair. Although some consideration was given to rebuilding, it was eventually closed and demolished in 1782. Sessions were transferred to the new Middlesex Sessions House on Clerkenwell Green (which, for a time, also became known colloquially as "Hicks Hall"). Middlesex Sessions House closed in turn in 1921, when cases spanning the Inner London area on both sides of the Thames were moved to the Sessions House in Newington.
Legacy
A carved oak chimneypiece, commemorating Hicks' gift, was installed in Hicks Hall in 1618. Following the building's demolition, this was transferred first to the Clerkenwell Green Sessions House, and afterwards to that at Newington, where it survives. It is inscribed:
The site of Hicks Hall remains obvious as a large island in the middle of St John Street, distinguished by the divergence of the building frontages on either side of the street to leave space for two clear thoroughfares. In the late 19th century a set of public toilets were built on the island, described in 1892 as "a modern erection which, if more useful, is less dignified" than the original courthouse.
Use as datum point
Hicks Hall was the notional starting point of the Great North Road, and was used as the datum point for mileages on that road. Measurements were taken from the building's front. The location's use for this purpose survived the demolition of the building itself: it continued until the early 19th century when Charing Cross (the statue of Charles I) began to be treated as the notional centre of London, and the agreed point from which all distances from London were measured. Until the late 19th century, milestones could still be seen on the Great North Road stating the number of miles "from Hicks Hall", or "from where Hicks Hall formerly stood".

The Tilburg Trappers are a professional ice hockey club based in Tilburg, The Netherlands. They previously played in the highest level ice hockey league in the country, but have been playing in the German Oberliga Nord since the 2015-16 season. Founded on 21 October 1938, they were officially recognised by the National Federation on 18 January 1939. The Trappers were crowned Eredivisie champions for the first time in the 1946-47 season, adding another 14 National Dutch Championships, 15 Dutch National Cups and 3 German Oberliga Championships over the years.
The club has an amateur branch, which is a separate legal entity and plays in the highest Dutch-Belgian league (BeNe-League). The Trappers play their home games in the Stappegoor IJssportcentrum Tilburg.

Tardebigge Locks or the Tardebigge Flight is the longest flight of locks in the UK, comprising 30 narrow locks on a stretch of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at Tardebigge, Worcestershire. It raises the waterway , and lies between the Tardebigge tunnel ( long) to the North and to Stoke Prior flight of six narrow locks to the South. The Tardebigge Engine House is also on this stretch.
History
The top lock has a rise of eleven feet, unusually high for a single lock. This lock was built to replace an experimental vertical boat lift. The canal had been constructed and open from Birmingham to the wharf (now known as the Old Wharf) north of Brockhill Lane bridge by 30 March 1807 without the need for locks.
After the Old Wharf, the Tardebigge tunnel runs through the solid rock to the New Wharf, just above Lock 58, the topmost lock in the flight. The canal company was concerned with the expense of the 58 locks needed to take the canal down to the River Severn at Worcester.
The Tardebigge vertical lift was invented by John Woodhouse and installed at their own expense, with excavation and masonry provided by the company. Finished on 24 June 1808, it was housed in a covered shed and used a fixed counterweight of bricks, connected by a set of eight parallel chains and pulleys. Lifting was performed by two men using a windlass. The 64-ton wooden caisson (lifting chamber) was sealed at each end by guillotine gates, as was the lock chamber. It succeeded in lifting 110 boats in 12 hours but was considered too fragile for permanent use. The remainder of the canal was built with locks, and the lift was replaced by one in 1815. The lift mechanism has gone but the outline of its balancing pit may be seen near the lockkeeper's cottage.
Close to lock number 57, the second from the top, is the Tardebigge Engine House, built to pump water up from Tardebigge Reservoir, which is about below the level of the top pound. The original steam engine has been removed, and the building has since been reused as a restaurant and night club at various times. It was converted into four residential apartments in 2012. The reservoir was one of a number of water supplies for the canal.
There is a detailed history by Revd Alan White in their book The Worcester and Birmingham Canal.
In 1992 lock 58 and several of the surrounding structures including the side pond and sluice, lock cottage and bridge were designated as listed buildings.
Inland Waterways Association
At the top lock are plaques commemorating the 1945 founding of the Inland Waterways Association.

Flat Neighborhood Network (FNN) is a topology for distributed computing and other computer networks. Each node connects to two or more switches which, ideally, entirely cover the node collection, so that each node can connect to any other node in two "hops" (jump up to one switch and down to the other node). This contrasts to toplogies with fewer cables per node which communicate with remote nodes via intermediate nodes, as in Hypercube (see The Connection Machine).

Purl or wormwood ale is an English drink. It was originally made by infusing ale with the tops of various species of Artemisia ("wormwood"), especially those of Artemisia maritima, "sea wormwood", which grows in coastal salt marsh and bears the alternative English common name of "old woman" ("old man" being a common name of the related A. abrotanum). Other purgative or bitter herbs such as orange peel or senna might also be used. The drink was commonly drunk in the early hours of the morning at which time it was popular with labourers.
By the middle of the 19th century, wormwood had been forgotten and the recipe was to mull ale instead with gin, sugar and spices such as ginger. It was sold by purl-men from purl-boats on the Thames who were licensed by the Watermen's Hall. The drink ceased to be popular by the end of the 19th century, being replaced by beer, especially the variety known to the English as bitter.
Purl-royal was a similar concoction made using wine in place of ale or beer.
The English took the drink with them to North America and a purl house was opened in New York, where rich punches and possets were popular.
In fiction
Shakespeare mentions purl in their play, The Merry Wives of Windsor. Samuel Pepys recorded in their diary entry for February 19, 1660, "Thence forth to Mr Harper's to drink a draft of purle, whither by appointment Monsieur L'Impertinent". On March 21, 1662, they write, "Thence to Westminster Hall ... Here I met with Chetwind, Parry, and several others, and went to a little house behind the Lords' house to drink some wormwood ale, which doubtless was a bawdy house, the mistress of the house having the look and dress".
Two centuries later, purl appeared in Charles Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop, published in 1840–1841. The character Dick Swiveller makes a show of kindness by bringing from a public house a boy "who bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef, and in the other a great pot, filled with some very fragrant compound, which sent forth a grateful steam, and was indeed choice purl, made after a particular recipe which Mr Swiveller had imparted to the landlord, at a period when they were deep in their books and desirous to conciliate their friendship."
Dickens described the final period of the drink in their last novel, Our Mutual Friend:

Naropa University is a private university in Boulder, Colorado. Founded in 1974 by Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa, it is named for the 11th-century Indian Buddhist sage Naropa, an abbot of Nalanda. The university describes itself as Buddhist-inspired, ecumenical, and nonsectarian rather than Buddhist. Naropa promotes non-traditional activities like meditation to supplement traditional learning approaches.
Naropa was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1988, making it the first Buddhist-inspired academic institution to receive United States regional accreditation. It remains one of only a handful of such schools. The university has hosted a number of Beat poets under the auspices of its Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics.
History
Naropa University was founded by Chögyam Trungpa, an exiled Tibetan tulku who was a Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineage holder. Trungpa entered the USA in 1970, established the Vajradhatu organization in 1973, and then in 1974, established Naropa Institute under the Nalanda Foundation. Initially, the Nalanda Foundation and Vajradhatu were closely linked, having nearly identical boards of directors. In subsequent years they differentiated into more independent institutions.
Trungpa asked poets Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, and Diane di Prima, and the composer John Cage to found a poetics department at Naropa during the first summer session. Ginsberg and Waldman, who roomed together that first summer, came up with the name for the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics.
Naropa's first formal degree programs were offered in 1975–76. These included a BA in Buddhist studies and visual art, MA in psychology, MFA in visual art, and expressive arts certificates in dance, theater, and poetics.
The MA in psychology was originally designed as an extension of Trungpa's Maitri program, a 16-week meditation course held in Connecticut, and based on Vajrayana teachings on esoteric energy patterns within the mind and body. Trungpa asked Marvin Casper to restructure the Maitri program for use at Naropa as a full-fledged graduate degree program in contemplative psychology. Casper went on to chair that department and edit two of Trungpa's books. Initially for the degree, students were required to attend three of the institute's summer sessions, take two Maitri programs in Connecticut, and complete a six-month independent project.
In 1977, at Trungpa's urging, Naropa's administration made the decision to seek regional accreditation. Evaluation visits continued through 1986, and in 1988, Naropa Institute received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In the mid-1980s, Naropa's president, Barbara Dilley, asked Lucien Wulsin to chair the board of directors. One of Wulsin's first acts was to formally separate Naropa from Vajradhatu. Ties with Vajradhatu were further weakened with the physical relocation of Vajradhatu's main center to Halifax, and then by Trungpa's death in 1987.
In 1991 Naropa's board of trustees hired John Cobb, a Harvard-educated lawyer and practicing Buddhist, as president. Thomas B. Coburn served in this role from 2003 to 2009, succeeded by Stuart C. Lord in July 2009.
The university began engaging in electrophysiology research at The Graduate School of Counseling and Psychology when the university introduced new equipment for the study of heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, and respiration during 2012 - 2014. Later, Jordan Quaglia, PhD established the Cognitive and Affective Sciences Laboratory to study Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brainwave patterns in 2016 - 2017.
Spiritual principles
Naropa promotes contemplative education – a term used primarily by teachers associated with Naropa University or Shambhala Buddhist organizations – including activities such as meditation, the Japanese tea ceremony, taijiquan, Christian labyrinth, ikebana, and neo-pagan ritual. Robert Goss comments that
Geoffrey Samuel, Reginald Ray, and Judith Simmer-Brown have traced the Shambhala lineage [Trungpa's teaching] back to the 19th century Rimé movement in Eastern Tibet... When Naropa describes itself as a Buddhist-inspired, nonsectarian liberal arts college, "nonsectarian" translating to the Tibetan rimed. Nonsectarian does not, however, mean secular as it is commonly used in higher education. Nonsectarian is perhaps understood as ecumenical openness to contemplative practices and arts of the world religious traditions that foster precision, gentleness, and, spontaneity.
Goss goes on to note that as with many U.S. Protestant and Catholic colleges and universities, Naropa has faced pressure to establish independence from its associated religious organization, Shambhala International; but unlike many such institutions, it has avoided relegating religion to the periphery of university life.
Naropa's description of contemplative education makes liberal use of Buddhist language and concepts. For example, its catalogue speaks of "students wholeheartedly engag[ing] in mindfulness awareness practices in order to cultivate being present in the moment"..."the development of openness, self-awareness, and insight"...and "interior work" as "preparation for compassionate and transformative work in the world."
As of 2008, contemplative education requirements include all undergraduate students selecting three semester hours of "Body-Mind Practice" such as taijiquan or African dance, as well as three hours of "World Wisdom Traditions" which may include a religion course. In addition certain majors, such as psychology and religious studies, require specialized courses in meditation. In the psychology program, the type of meditation required is specific to Shambhala Buddhism. Besides these requirements, a number of Naropa's professors incorporate a contemplative element into their classroom teaching or course requirements, such as beginning with a bow or a moment of silence or asking students to consider how to integrate their studies into their lives.
For one day each semester, Naropa University holds Community Practice Day, during which regular classes are not held and offices are closed. On this day, members of the Naropa community—students, faculty, staff, and others—are invited to participate in group sitting meditation practice during the morning. Other contemplative disciplines are offered throughout the day. Panel discussions, departmental lunches, and community-service projects are often offered in the afternoon. The stated object of the day is to cultivate togetherness in the Naropa community and to emphasize the importance of leading a mindful, aware life rather than a high-speed, cluttered one.

Violet Tillard (1874 – 19 February 1922) was a suffragette, nurse, pacifist, supporter of conscientious objectors, international famine relief worker and devout Quaker.
Work with the Women's Freedom League
Caravan tour
Tillard became involved with the Women's Freedom League (WFL) in 1908 and soon rose to the position of Assistant Organising Secretary. From May to mid-October of that year they helped establish branches of the League on a caravan tour of the southeast counties of England. The 'Votes For Women' caravan tour passed through Kent, East Anglia, Surrey and Sussex. It was on this tour that Tillard met Muriel Matters who was to remain a lifelong companion. Matters would later write of their friend's courage, sympathy, generosity and selflessness, stating that Tillard, "set one a standard to live by".
Role in the Grille Protest
On 28 October 1908 the Women's Freedom League organised a large demonstration to take place at the Palace of Westminster. It was an organised protest that took place at similar times throughout the Palace of Westminster – outside St Stephen's Entrance, the Old Prison Yard and in the House of Commons. The purpose of the protest was to draw attention to the struggle of women and remove the 'Grille', a piece of ironwork placed in the Ladies' Gallery that obscured their view of parliamentary proceedings.
Violet's role was in the latter part of the demonstration – to remove the offensive grille from the Ladies' Gallery. Tillard was joined in the House of Commons with their close friend Muriel Matters, Helen Fox and two male supporters in the Strangers' Gallery. Fox and Matters both chained themselves directly to the Grille and Matters began addressing the MPs directly, while the males in the Strangers' Gallery showered the house with handbills. Tillard's role was to force a WFL proclamation through the Grille and lower it on to the floor of the House using string. All four protagonists were set upon by attendants but were later released that night without charge. After they were permitted to leave Matters and Tillard immediately rejoined the protest outside St Stephen's portals but were subsequently arrested for attempting to break the police lines.
The pair and eleven other members of the Women's Freedom League spent the following month in Holloway Gaol. Matters later recounted that, despite the ugly prison garb, "Till managed to look so graceful. How Cheerful they are, how philosophic when many were either 'edgy' [or] 'weepy with strain, or rebellion."
Violet's sister and the Women's Freedom League
Violet's sister, Irene Tillard, was also involved with the Women's Freedom League.  They are known to have helped on the caravan tour of 1908, and in August 1909 was arrested with eight other members of the WFL (including Charlotte Despard) for picketing outside 10 Downing Street, London. The picket prevented the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, entering their residence and the group were later sentenced to serve seven days imprisonment or pay fines of 40 shillings. As was the suffragist tradition they intended not to pay the fine and serve their imprisonment. However, as paying the fine did not require the consent of the incarcerated, the group's fines were anonymously paid against their will.
Work between 1910 and the outbreak of war
From May to early August 1910 Tillard accompanied Muriel Matters to Australia where their friend gave lectures focusing on their experiences in Britain agitating for change.
 They are also known to have been in Dublin from 1912–1914, supporting the striking Dublin Transport Workers which was in the period in which the Dublin Lockout occurred.
Conscientious objection to the First World War
During the First World War Tillard was energised into helping conscientious objectors. They were appointed Co-Treasurer of the No-Conscription Fellowship's Maintenance Committee. However, on 23 May 1918 Tillard found themselves once again in court for their agitations. They were on trial for refusing to disclose to police the name of the person who printed the March edition of the No-Conscription Fellowship News. Tillard was found guilty under the Defence of the Realm Act and was sentenced to 61 days imprisonment to be served once again at Holloway.
Famine relief worker in post-war Germany and Russia
In 1919 Tillard travelled to war-torn Germany to help people recover from the effects of the war. They went with a Quaker mission organised by Joan Fry and in December of that year Tillard formally applied to become a member of the Religious Society of Friends. Whilst in defeated Germany they were confronted with immense misery and helped some students in Berlin survive the hardship. They provided relief in Germany as a nurse until October 1921 where they were transferred to famine-ravaged Buzuluk in Russia to help organise the relief work. There they found famine on a grand scale with an estimated five million dead at the conclusion of the food shortage. Confronted with mass impoverishment they wrote:
One feels horrible to live in such good conditions when the people are literally starving at our doors – a boy of sixteen lies dead a few yards away… It isn't so harrowing to see them lying dead. They suffer no more. It is the doomed shadows one sees around the streets and in the homes that are most horrible.
Tillard continued their tireless work with the Religious Society of Friends to help curb the suffering of the masses.
Death
Whilst in Russia Tillard's skills as a nurse were temporarily called upon in the Pavlovka District near their current post in Buzuluk. There, three fellow relief workers had fallen ill with typhus and it was their job to nurse them back to health. They were successful in accomplishing their objective but soon contracted the same disease. Tillard died of typhus on 19 February 1922.
Tillard's death was to feature briefly in the writings of Leon Trotsky who praised their work during the famine:
In our bloodstained and at the same time heroic epoch, there are people who, regardless of their class position, are guided exclusively by the promptings of humanity and inner nobility. I read a brief obituary of this Anglo-Saxon woman, Violet Tillard; a delicate, frail creature, they worked here, at Buzuluk, under the most frightful conditions, fell at their post, and was buried there.... Probably they were no different from those others who also fell at their posts, serving their fellow human beings.... Here we count six such graves… These graves are a kind of augury of those future, new relations between people which will be based upon solidarity and will not be shadowed by self-seeking. When the Russian people become a little richer they will erect (we are profoundly sure of this) a great monument to these fallen heroes, the forerunners of a better human morality, for which we, too, are fighting.

In enzymology, an isobutyryl-CoA mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
2-methylpropanoyl-CoA butanoyl-CoA
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-methylpropanoyl-CoA, and one product, butanoyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methylpropanoyl-CoA CoA-carbonylmutase. Other names in common use include isobutyryl coenzyme A mutase, and butyryl-CoA:isobutyryl-CoA mutase. It uses adenosylcobalamin as a cofactor, which is bound at the enzyme's vitamin B12-binding domain. The mechanism of action of the enzyme is to generate a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical by homolytic cleavage of the cobalt-carbon bond of the cofactor. This radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to initiate the rearrangement reaction.

Kahani Raima Aur Manahil Ki () is a Pakistani drama that premiered on Hum TV on 25 February 2014. It stars Sajjal Ali, Mehreen Syed, Vasay Chaudhry, and Shehroz Sabzwari as its main characters. The drama follows two couples; the first couple hates each other while the second couple loves each other.
Plot
The story revolves around two couples. The first couple is Wamaj and Raima, who have been married for eight years, and although they hate each other, they cannot divorce due to the wills left by their fathers. The second couple is Abrar and Manahil, who love each other but cannot marry due to financial problems. Abrar works at Raima's boutique while Manahil is Wamaj's secretary.
Episodes 1–5
Manahil and Abrar want to marry each other as soon as possible, but they cannot due to Abrar's elder sister Seher, who is not yet married but wants to find a husband as they're passing a suitable age for marriage. Manahil tries to match Seher with an old shopkeeper (Rasheed), but fails, as Abrar sees the shopkeeper and Seher together. Manahil and Seher become good friends, which results in Manahil advising Seher so they can get married soon.
Raima and Wamaj have been married for the past eight years but hate each other. They cannot divorce each other because the one who files for divorce will not be part of the will signed by their parents. They unsuccessfully try to use black magic to get a divorce.
Episodes 6–8
A marriage proposal comes for Seher and they accept. Raima and Wamaj continue to try to make the other file for divorce by faking interest in another person. While Raima takes their friend Numra's husband for lunch, Wamaj starts flirting with a woman who ends up robbing him. When Numra sees their husband having dinner with Raima, they get angry since they are not aware that Raima only pretends to be interested in their husband. Numra advises Raima to date another guy from their boutique, while Wamaj's friend tells them to date someone from their office. Raima tries to date Abrar and tells them that they just wants themselves to be divorced, which they refuse, while Wamaj asks Manahil to be their date, who angrily rejects the invitation.
Manahil unsuccessfully asks their mother if they are allowed to marry Abrar. Them mother tells them that they will only let them marry them four years later, when their sibling is mature enough to earn. Manahil and Abrar are depressed and have no choice but to accept their bosses.
Abrar tells Manahil that they will work for Raima to get more money for Seher's wedding. Manahil tells them that if they work for Wamaj they can get more money to finance their marriage.
Episode 9–12
Raima and Wamaj are plan on making each other feel jealous: Wamaj invites Manahil to their house, and Raima spends a day with Abrar.
Abrar's mother, Zainab, wants them to marry someone. They invite people bringing a marriage proposal, whom are all rejected by Abrar. Manahil goes to Wamaj's house and tries to make Raima jealous by showing them that they care a lot for Wamaj, but Raima is not fooled. Wamaj feels the same when Raima receives flowers and goes out with Abrar.
Seher's husband sees Abrar with Raima and tells them about their affair, Seher asks Abrar about this and they say that they treat Raima as their sister. Manahil's mother, Asiya, is suspicious about their daughter and spies on them They see Manahil with Wamaj and thinks that both are having a love affair. They take their home and tells them that they should marry Wamaj. When Wamaj takes a fake marriage proposal to their house and lies to Asiya that they are around 80 years and was married to a woman before, Asiya rejects this proposal.
After looking at Raima's wealth, Seher tells Zainab about them and tells them that through them they can be rich. Zainab then invites Raima to their house and Seher and Zainab treat Raima like a family member, which annoys Raima.
Episode 13–17
Seher wants Raima to marry their brother-in-law Khudbudeen, whom Raima hates, though they cannot do anything. Asiya wants Manahil to marry Wahaj, and Raima tells them that they are completely okay with the marriage, Zainab thinks that Asiya is interested in Wamaj.
Raima thinks that Abrar is useless and making them work with them is a waste of time and they tell Abrar to quit, Wamaj thinks the same of Manahil and tells them to quit.
Asiya does not tell their daughter to marry Wamaj, and Manahil and Abrar lose their jobs. Khudbudeen tells Seher and Zainab that Abrar has married Raima.
Raima and Wamaj later receive an invitation to their uncle's daughter's marriage, and when they return Raima is shot. Wamaj takes care of them in the hospital, and Raima falls in love with him.
After Abrar is forgiven, Seher and Zainab believe they are telling the truth. Manahil finally tells Asiya that they are not in love with Wamaj and they were only working for him. Seher's husband starts blaming her, saying that their brother is a spoiled boy and refuses to talk to them
Manahil and Abrar are not talking to each other while Raima and Wamaj have fallen deeply in love. Raima's friend, Numra, tells them that Wahaj is acting like a good man, but in reality just wants them to divorce him. Wahaj's friend tells them something similar. Raima tells Abrar to work for Wahaj by bringing them and Wahaj close, and tells them that Manahil is a fraud and only loves their money, Wahaj tells Manahil the same thing, but both refuse.
Episode 18
Because of their jobs, Manahil and Abrar are not talking with each other. After asking Abrar for help, Raima orders Abrar to tell Wahaj that Manahil has a bad reputation. The same plot is being concocted by Wahaj, which Manahil agrees to carry out.
At the park, Manahil and Abrar see each other and both become depressed.
At Manahil's house, Seher and Zainab discuss Manahil and Abrar's marriage proposal. Both families agree to it. Asiya tells them the news, but refuses when they find out their intended spouse is Abrar.
When Manahil and Abrar meet face to face they get into an argument.
Episode 19
Wahaj talks to their friend and says that would do anything to get Raima back and kill Abrar. Their friend calms them down and tells them to be patient.

Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes (natural selection, common descent, speciation) that produced the diversity of life on Earth. Simply, it is also defined as the study of the history of life forms on Earth. Evolution is based on the theory that all species are related and they gradually change over time. In a population, the genetic variations affect the physical characteristics i.e. phenotypes of an organism. These changes in the phenotypes will be an advantage to some organisms, which will then be passed onto their offspring. Some examples of evolution in species over many generations are the Peppered Moth and Flightless birds. In the 1930s, the discipline of evolutionary biology emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis of understanding, from previously unrelated fields of biological research, such as genetics and ecology, systematics, and paleontology. A person who studies Evolutionary biology is called an Evolutionary biologist. The importance of studying Evolutionary biology is mainly to understand the principles behind the origin and extinction of species.
The investigational range of current research widened to encompass the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution, such as sexual selection, genetic drift, and biogeography. Moreover, the newer field of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo") investigates how embryogenesis, the development of the embryo, is controlled, thus yielding a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields of study covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.
Subfields
Evolution is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided into various ways. One way is by the level of biological organization, from molecular to cell, organism to population. An earlier way is by perceived taxonomic group, with fields such as zoology, botany, and microbiology, reflecting what was once seen as the major divisions of life.
A third way is by approaches, such as field biology, theoretical biology, experimental evolution, and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.
More recently, the merge between biological science and applied sciences gave birth to new fields that are extensions of evolutionary biology, including evolutionary robotics, engineering, algorithms, economics, and architecture. The basic mechanisms of evolution are applied directly or indirectly to come up with novel designs or solve problems that are difficult to solve otherwise. The research generated in these applied fields, in turn, contributes to progress, especially thanks to work on evolution in computer science and engineering fields such as mechanical engineering.
Different types of evolution
Convergent evolution
Convergent evolution is defined as the process in which related or distantly related organisms evolve independently. This type of evolution creates analogous structures which have a similar function, structure, or form. For example, sharks and dolphins look alike but they are not related. Likewise, birds, flying insects, and bats all have the ability to fly, but they are not related to each other.
Co-evolution
The influence of two closely associated species is known as co-evolution. When two or more species evolve in company with each other, one species adapts to changes in other species. This type of evolution often happens in species that have symbiotic relationships. For example, predator-prey coevolution, this is the most common type of co-evolution. In this, the predator must evolve to become more effective hunter because there is a selective pressure on the prey to steer clear of capture. Likewise, the relationship between pollinating insects like bees and flowering plants, herbivores and plants, are also some common examples.
Adaptive evolution
Adaptive evolution relates to evolutionary changes that happen due to the changes in the environment, this makes the organism suitable to its habitat. This change increases the chances of survival and reproduction of the organism. For example, Darwin's Finches on Galapagos island developed different shaped beaks in order to survive for a long time.
Mechanism: The process of evolution
The mechanism of evolution focus mainly on Mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating, and natural selection.
Mutation: Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence inside a gene or a chromosome of an organism. Most mutation are neutral, i.e. they can neither harm nor benefit, but can also be harmful or beneficial sometimes.
Genetic drift: Genetic drift is a variational process, it happens as a result of the sampling errors from one generation to another generation where a random event that happens by chance in nature changes or influences allele frequency within a population.
Gene flow: Gene flow is the transfer of genetic material from the gene pool of one population to another. In a population, migration occurs from one species to another, resulting in the change of frequency.
Natural selection: The survival and reproductive rate of a species depends on the adaptability of the species to their environment. This process is called natural selection. Some species with certain traits in a population have higher survival and reproductive rate than others, and they pass on these genetic features to their offsprings.
Evolutionary developmental biology
In evolutionary developmental biology the different processes of development can play a role in how a specific organism reaches its current body plan. The genetic regulation of ontogeny and the phylogenetic process is what allows for this kind of understanding of biology to be possible. Looking at different processes during development, and going through the evolutionary tree, one can determine at which point a specific structure came about. For example, the three germ layers can be observed to not be present in cnidarians and ctenophores, which instead present in worms, being more or less developed depending on the kind of worm itself. Other structures like the development of Hox genes and sensory organs such as eyes can also be traced with this practice.
History
The idea of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, but evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged during the period of the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. It was not until the 1980s that many universities had departments of evolutionary biology. In the United States, many universities have created departments of molecular and cell biology or ecology and evolutionary biology, in place of the older departments of botany and zoology. Palaeontology is often grouped with earth science.
Microbiology too is becoming an evolutionary discipline, now that microbial physiology and genomics are better understood. The quick generation time of bacteria and viruses such as bacteriophages makes it possible to explore evolutionary questions.
Many biologists have contributed to shaping the modern discipline of evolutionary biology. Theodosius Dobzhansky and E. B. Ford established an empirical research programme. Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J. S. Haldane created a sound theoretical framework. Ernst Mayr in systematics, George Gaylord Simpson in paleontology and G. Ledyard Stebbins in botany helped to form the modern synthesis.
James Crow, Richard Lewontin, Dan Hartl, Marcus Feldman, and Brian Charlesworth trained a generation of evolutionary biologists.
Current research topics
Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics and incorporates ideas from diverse areas, such as molecular genetics and computer science.
First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for in the modern evolutionary synthesis. These include speciation, the evolution of sexual reproduction, the evolution of cooperation, the evolution of ageing, and evolvability.
Second, evolutionary biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as paleobiology, where paleobiologists and evolutionary biologists, including Thomas Halliday and Anjali Goswami, studied the evolution of early mammals going far back in time during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (between 299 million to 12,000 years ago). Other fields related to generic exploration of evolution ("what happened and when?" ) include systematics and phylogenetics.
Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., point mutations vs. gene duplication or even genome duplication). They try to reconcile the high heritability seen in twin studies with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome-wide association studies.
One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical population genetics that catalysed the modern evolutionary synthesis must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of molecular evolution. For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting selective sweeps.
Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance. Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift, genetic draft, developmental constraints, mutation bias and biogeography.
An evolutionary approach a is key to much current research in organismal biology and ecology, such as in life history theory. Annotation of genes and their function relies heavily on comparative approaches. The field of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo") investigates how developmental processes work, and compares them in different organisms to determine how they evolved.
Many physicians do not have enough background in evolutionary biology, making it difficult to use it in modern medicine. However, there are efforts to gain a deeper understanding of disease through evolutionary medicine and to develop evolutionary therapies.
Drug resistance today
Evolution plays a role in resistance of drugs; for example, how HIV becomes resistant to medications and the body's immune system. The mutation of resistance of HIV is due to the natural selection of the survivors and their offspring. The one HIV that survived the immune system reproduced and had offspring that were also resistant to the immune system. Drug resistance also causes many problems for patients such as a worsening sickness or the sickness can mutate into something that can no longer be cured with medication. Without the proper medicine, a sickness can be the death of a patient. If their body has resistance to a certain number of drugs, then the right medicine will be harder and harder to find. Not completing the prescribed full course of antibiotic is also an example of resistance that will cause the bacteria against which the antibiotic is being taken to evolve and continue to spread in the body. When the full dosage of the medication does not enter the body and perform its proper job, the bacteria that survive the initial dosage will continue to reproduce. This can make for another bout of sickness later on that will be more difficult to cure because the bacteria involved will be resistant to the first medication used. Taking the full course of medicine that is prescribed is a vital step in avoiding antibiotic resistance.
Individuals with chronic illnesses, especially those that can recur throughout a lifetime, are at greater risk of antibiotic resistance than others. This is because overuse of a drug or too high of a dosage can cause a patient's immune system to weaken and the illness will evolve and grow stronger. For example, cancer patients will need a stronger and stronger dosage of medication because of their low functioning immune system.
Journals
Some scientific journals specialise exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals Evolution, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, and BMC Evolutionary Biology. Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals Systematic Biology, Molecular Biology and Evolution and its sister journal Genome Biology and Evolution, and Cladistics.
Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, Molecular Ecology, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, The American Naturalist and Theoretical Population Biology have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. The journals Genetics and PLoS Genetics overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature.

The collared bush robin or Johnstone's robin (Tarsiger johnstoniae) is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is endemic to Taiwan, living in montane and subalpine forests. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as a least-concern species.
Taxonomy
This species was described as Ianthia johnstoniae by William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in 1906: the specimens were collected by Walter Goodfellow on Yushan (Mount Morrison). It has also been included in the genus Luscinia. The species' eponym is named after Marion A. Johnstone, a well-known aviculturist to whom Goodfellow previously sent a specimen of a lorikeet.
Description
The collared bush robin is about long. The male and female are different. The male has a slate-black head with a white supercilium. The rufous upper breast, mantle and scapulars form a collar. The back is sooty-black, the wings are black and brownish-black, and the tail is black. The lower breast is buffish-yellow, and the belly varies from grey-white to buffish-olive. The beak and legs are black. The female has a less distinct supercilium. The upperparts are mostly dull olive-brown, and the wings and tail are dark brown. The underparts are variable. The throat and breast are warm brown, but the throat is sometimes blackish, and the breast can be pale yellow or yellowish-olive. The juvenile bird can be distinguished from the female by its pale buff streaks and spots.
Distribution and habitat
Endemic to Taiwan, this robin's habitat is montane and subalpine forests, usually at elevations of and sometimes above the tree line. It descends to lower elevations in winter. It lives in undergrowth of coniferous forests with shrubs and bamboo. It can also be seen in parks and along roads.
Behaviour
The collared bush robin is often seen in pairs and also singly. It catches insects by striking from perches, and it also forages for invertebrates on the ground and in low plants. Its calls include tuc notes with pi notes in between, a low grruit, and a combination of piping and grating notes. It sings from a perch, giving a series of phrases each consisting of two or three high-pitched, sibilant notes. Breeding occurs from March to August, and there are two broods per year. A territory is defended by the male and female. The female builds a cup nest made of plants and lays two to three eggs. The collared bush robin sometimes hybridises with subspecies formosanus of the white-browed bush robin.
Status
Suspected to have a stable population, this species has been assessed by the IUCN as being of the least concern.

The Battle of Tang'erli (堂二里战斗) was a series of armed conflicts fought between the nationalists and the communists during Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era, and resulted in the communist victory.
On 27 April 1947, the Communist Central Hebei Independent 7th Brigade secretly approached Tang'erli (堂二里) region from the western part of Ba (霸) county for a sneak attack. The 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade was assigned to the south of Tang'erli (堂二里) to stop Nationalist reinforcements from Tianjin and Shengfang (胜芳), deployed in the regions including Wang Family's Bunker (Wang Jia Bao, 王家堡), Southern Willow (Nan Liu, 南柳), They Family's Bunker (He Jia Bao, 何家堡), Chu River Harbor (Chu They Gang, 褚河港), and Donggu Gang (东沽港). Meanwhile, the 20th Regiment of the valiant 7th Brigade was deployed to the north of Tang'erli (堂二里), and the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade was deployed to the east and west of Tang'erli (堂二里).
As the Communist siege was complete, the inevitable assault begun. The undetected sudden attack took the defenders completely by surprise, and by 11:00 AM in the next morning, the commanding height Rong Family's Tower (Rong Jia Lou, 荣家楼) had fallen into the enemy's hand. As a result, the Nationalist headquarters was completely exposed under enemy fire, and the defenders held out as long as they could but eventually were forced to surrender when reinforcements failed to arrive and breakout was impossible.
The Communists succeeded in taking over 670 prisoners and killing over 270, including most of the nationalist officers. The communists also succeeded in capturing 22 light machineguns, 4 submachine guns, over 30 handguns, over 450 rifles, over 20,000 rounds of ammunitions, and other supplies. The nationalist loss of Tang'erli (堂二里), one of their strongholds near the major city Tianjin meant that the enemy would have another base from which they would launch attacks to harass the nationalists guarding the major city.

Whittingham Hospital was a psychiatric hospital in the parish of Whittingham, near Preston, Lancashire, England. The hospital opened in 1873 as the Fourth Lancashire County Asylum and grew to be the largest mental hospital in Britain, and pioneered the use of electroencephalograms (EEGs). It closed in 1995.
History
Early years
In 1866 the first three Lancashire lunatic asylums, at Prestwich, Rainhill and Lancaster, were deemed to be full. Extra accommodation was urgently needed and to this end the building of Whittingham Asylum "for pauper lunatics" began in 1869. The hospital was designed by Henry Littler of Manchester, Architect to the Lancashire Asylums Board and built of red brick made from clay dug on site. The buildings followed a plan of multiple quadrangles with inter-connecting corridors radiating from a long axial corridor section.
The hospital was officially opened as the Fourth Lancashire County Lunatic Asylum on 1 April 1873, although 115 patients had already been admitted in the previous year, some of whom helped with the building work. The large complex (to be known as St. Luke's Division from 1958) was completed in June 1875; it had an initial capacity of 1100 inmates and included an Anglican church, a Catholic chapel, a recreation hall and a large farm estate. Before long it also had its own railway, telephone exchange, post office, reservoirs, gas works, brewery, orchestra, brass band, ballroom and butchers' shop.
In 1878 a new annexe (known as St. John's Division from 1958) was built on of land to the north of the site. The annexe was completed in 1880 and could accommodate 700 patients and, by the special agreement of the Postmaster General, the hospital's own dedicated Post Office. The hospital contributed £15,500 towards Fulwood Urban District Council's scheme to extract water from Beacon Fell, in exchange for 90,000 gallons of water per day to be supplied, free of charge, to the hospital. This was achieved under the Fulwood and Whittingham Water Act of 1882. In 1884, a sanatorium was established in the grounds for patients with infectious diseases.
In 1892 works began for the grounds to be illuminated by electric lamps; these works were completed in 1894. In 1900 an annexe called Cameron House was opened to the northwest of the main building, joined in 1912 by a third annexe, later to become known as St Margaret's Division in 1958. By 1915 the number of inmates was recorded as 2,820 – more than double the asylum's original capacity.
First World War
In 1918 the New West Annexe (St Margaret's) was commandeered for the treatment of war casualties: patients who died during treatment were buried in the institution's private cemetery at the northern edge of the site. The hospital was returned to civilian use the following year following the cessation of hostilities.
Inter-war years
The National Asylum Workers' Union organised a strike of 429 employees at the hospital in 1918. In 1923, the name "Whittingham Asylum" was dropped in favour of "Whittingham Mental Hospital", a change later reinforced in law by the Mental Treatment Act 1930. In 1929, the Hospital Commissioners noted that an "open door" principle was practised on a number of wards, and the 1930 Act later resulted in the admission of the first voluntary patients. By 1939, the number of patients was 3533, with a staff of 548, making it the largest mental hospital in Great Britain.
Second World War
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Wards 31 to 36 in the West Annexe were again commandeered by the military and mental patients were relocated to other hospitals in the area. The commandeered wards were renamed the Whittingham Emergency Hospital and treated casualties of war, both military and civilian, the first being evacuees from Dunkirk. Following the end of the conflict the wards were returned to civilian use in 1946.
Post-war
In 1948, the hospital became part of the newly formed National Health Service and was renamed "Whittingham Hospital". In the same year it acquired Ribchester Hospital, originally a workhouse.
While working at the hospital during the 1950s, Dr C.S. Parker and Mr Charles Breakall produced an early electroencephalograph (EEG) machine using War Surplus material purchased for £2.10.0d. (£2.50) and conducted pioneering experiments in the field of encephalography and mental illness using patients there. An article was published in The Lancet describing these experiments, and considerable interest was said to have been expressed by the American Department for Space Medicine at the time.
From 1965 to 1968 English rock musician Kevin Coyne worked at the hospital as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse and it was whilst at Whittingham that their son Robert was born. Their 1972 album Case History was in part inspired by their work at the hospital.
Abuse scandal and enquiry
On 18 July 1967, the Student Nurses' Association held a meeting with the senior nursing tutor, submitting serious complaints of cruelty, ill-treatment and fraud in the hospital. The Head Male Nurse then called a meeting of all students in which the students were threatened with actions for libel and slander. Several further complaints were suppressed until the following year when the hospital management committee finally intervened and announced an inquiry into allegations of corruption and abuse. The inquiry divided the allegations into three specific headings: Care of Patients, Organisation of Services and Financial Control. The enquiry heard (among others) the following complaints:
That patients had been left untreated
That some patients had been given only bread and jam to eat or had been given food mixed up and served as "slops"
That some patients had been locked outside, regardless of weather conditions, or in washrooms and cupboards.
That in one ward, students had witnessed patients being dragged about by their hair.
That on ward 3, a male ward, patients were given "wet towel treatment", which involved twisting a cold, wet towel or bed sheet round a patient's neck until the patient lost consciousness. Patients were also seen to have been punched and locked in a storeroom.
On ward S2, another male ward, it was alleged that two male nurses had poured methylated spirits into the slippers of one patient and into the dressing gown pocket of another and set them alight.
It was also reported that some wards were infested with vermin and others were too cold, too hot or too damp. In addition, it was found that there was a culture of petty theft on the wards and of serious fraud and embezzlement in some administrative offices.
In 1968–69, £91,000 was issued from sources for the use of patients, yet only £42,000 was recorded as having been spent in the hospital shop, supposedly leaving the remaining £49,000 unaccounted for.
As a result of the investigation, both the Head Male Nurse and the Matron took 'early retirement'. Two male nurses were convicted of theft and in a separate incident another nurse was jailed for manslaughter after an elderly patient they had assaulted later died. Two other nurses were charged but acquitted.
Documentary
Ray Gosling and Nick Broomfield spent three weeks in the hospital filming a documentary for Granada Television, broadcast on ITV on 26 August 1975. It was Broomfield's first television film.
Decline and closure
During the 1970s and 1980s, new drugs and therapies were introduced to treat people suffering from mental illnesses. Long-stay patients were returned to the community or dispersed to smaller units around Preston. The hospital closed in 1995 and the site subsequently became known as "Guild Park". In 1999, Guild Lodge was opened on the edge of Guild Park, providing secure mental healthcare services to a small number of patients, followed the next year by purpose-built rehabilitation cottages close by.
It is planned to build 650 new homes on the site and to convert some of the hospital buildings for use as apartments. St John's and St Margaret's divisions have been demolished. Due to uncertainty over the construction of the Broughton bypass and the economic downturn there was little further progress, and the remaining buildings were left derelict, a popular destination for urban exploration. In 2014, planning permission was renewed and extended, and demolition of almost all of the remaining buildings resumed. The grade II listed St John's Church and five blocks, including St Luke's main entrance block, had originally been scheduled to be retained, along with some sporting and recreational facilities. Demolition was completed by 2016. In April 2021 Preston council approved urgent repair work to St John's church to maintain the fabric of the building.
Whittingham Hospital Railway
The Whittingham Hospital Railway was a two-mile (3 km) private branch to , built in 1887, to transport coal and other goods. It also provided free transport for staff and passengers. It eventually closed in on 30 June 1957.

Halsbury's Statutes of England and Wales (commonly referred to as Halsbury's Statutes) provides updated texts of every Public General Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Measure of the Welsh Assembly, or Church of England Measure currently in force in England and Wales (and to various extents in Scotland and Northern Ireland), as well as a number of private and local Acts, with detailed annotations to each section and Schedule of each Act. It incorporates the effects of new Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation into existing legislation to provide a consolidated "as amended" text of the current statute book.
Halsbury's Statutes was created in 1929. The full title of this work was The Complete Statutes of England Classified and Annotated in Continuation of Halsbury's Laws of England and for ready reference entitled Halsbury's Statutes of England. As indicated by the title, the new work was to be a companion to Halsbury's Laws of England and therefore bears the name of Lord Halsbury.
The first edition, in twenty volumes, appeared between 1929 and 1931. The new encyclopedia was based on the design of the earlier Butterworths' Twentieth Century Statutes (Annotated), a work in five volumes covering the Acts of 1900 to 1909, which had been kept up to date by annual supplemental volumes. Like its companion, Halsbury's Laws, it was arranged by subject matter. This new work, however, expanded on the previous statutory work in that it included all primary legislation in force at the time of publication.
The second edition in 33 volumes was published from 1948 to 1954.
The current edition (the fourth), in fifty volumes, was published between 1985 and 1992, and is supplemented by an annual hardbound supplement and periodic loose-leaf updates. It is published by LexisNexis Butterworths. Individual volumes are reissued when there has been a significant impact on the subject matter concerned through changes in legislation.
The complete set consists of the main volumes, the index, tables of statutes, secondary legislation and cases, the annual Cumulative Supplement and the quarterly looseleaf service. Halsbury's Statutes is also available as a searchable electronic archive on a paid subscription basis.

Citymeals on Wheels, also called Citymeals, is a meal on Wheels-type nonprofit organization in New York City that raises private funds to provide prepared meals and social support to homebound elderly residents of New York City.
History
Gael Greene and James Beard founded Citymeals on Wheels in 1981 to supplement the government's meal delivery program. Greene had the idea after reading a newspaper article about homebound elderly New Yorkers with nothing to eat on weekends and holidays. Greene approached Beard with the idea, and the two raised money to provide Christmas dinners for 6,000 needy elderly at a cost of $35,000. The success of the program inspired them to continue the following year.
Citymeals has an annual budget of $20 million and had 15,412 volunteers in 2016. The majority of the organization's funding comes from donations from private individuals.
The current executive director is Beth Shapiro, who took over from founding director Marcia Stein in 2011.
On October 29, 2018 Citymeals celebrated the opening of the Joan & Bob Tisch Emergency Meal Distribution Center in Hunts Point, Bronx. Use of the 30,000 foot warehouse was planned in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York, to help Citymeals deal with increased demand during future emergencies.
Citymeals provides around 2 million meals annually, and as of March 2020 has distributed around 60 million meals since its founding in 1981.
COVID-19 Response
Citymeals doubled its staff in March 2020 in order to provide food for increasing numbers of homebound and at risk senior citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. The organization began producing 250,000 meals in the three weeks of the pandemic, with plans to sustain increased meal production. Citymeals began working with 250 meal delivery centers in New York, whereas previously the organization had partners with 30 delivery centers.
Services
Citymeals provides free meal delivery to elderly residents of New York living without food security, and also performs wellness checks on these individuals. The organization contracts with local meal center to prepare and deliver meals on Saturdays and Sundays, as government funding only covers weekday meals and does not cover holidays. Friendly visiting is also an important part of the Citymeals mission, and volunteer groups spend social time with isolated elderly to help their loneliness.
Holiday Meals
Citymeals funding allows government centers to remain open on holidays for those who are able to walk in and volunteers deliver meals to the homebound. Citymeals funds holiday meals for Rosh Hashanah, Thanksgiving, Chanukah, New Year's Day and Easter.
Holiday Food Boxes
When local meal centers close throughout the year for holiday observances, Citymeals will guarantee that homebound clients have food. Boxes of shelf-stable foods such as canned tuna and chicken, shelf-stable milk, cookie, crackers and juices are provided. Citymeals provides holiday boxes for Labor Day, Season's Greetings, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Passover, Memorial Day and Independence Day.
Emergency boxes
Emergency boxes containing non-perishable food out to homebound elderly clients in late fall to provide security through the winter months. Clients are encouraged to keep some food on hand in case a winter weather emergency keeps regular meals deliveries from getting to them. The additional emergency food packages are sent quarterly to recipients on wait lists and/or second meals clients.
Supper Meals
A joint study between Citymeals on Wheels and Cornell University found that 14% of Citymeals' clients relied on the program as their sole source of food. These individuals did not have the means to supplement their one daily home-delivered meal. Citymeals delivers supper meals to these elderly who are the poorest, frailest and most isolated.

The Valley City Post Office, in Valley City, North Dakota, was designed in 1915 and built during 1916–17. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as U.S. Post Office-Valley City.
Its Classical Revival design is credited to the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, and designed "in the spirit" of James Knox Taylor. It was built when post office designs were just beginning to be standardized, but shows individuality and does not follow any of the standardized plans that were adopted in 1915 at the national level. In fact, according to its NRHP nomination, it "was one of the last designs of its kind, and harks back to an earlier era when federal buildings were monolithic, imposing, costly, and built according to Beaux Arts principles of massing." It was described in a local newspaper account in 1916 as "'much more pretentious than most of the federal buildings that are being erected throughout the west when the size of the cities are taken into consideration'".

Lines Written at Shurton Bars was composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1795. The poem incorporates a reflection on Coleridge's engagement and their understanding of marriage. It also compares nature to an ideal understanding of reality and discusses isolation from others.
Background
During 1795, Coleridge met and became engaged to Sara Fricker. They met while Coleridge and Robert Southey planned to create an ideal government called Pantisocracy, and Coleridge intended that they should find a woman to join them in the new community. They eventually married on 4 October 1795 after some hesitation and uncertainty on Coleridge's side which caused them to leave them for London over the course of a few months. During the engagement, they wrote a few poems dedicated to them including the conversation poem "The Eolian Harp" and Lines Written at Shurton Bar. The "Lines" were inspired by Coleridge's walk along the Shurton Bars and they sought to write the poem in order comfort Fricker before their marriage; during their absence, many people opposed their marriage and grew distant from them The poem was eventually published in Coleridge's 1796 Poems on Various Subjects.
Poem
Coleridge begins their poem by incorporating a quote from William Wordsworth, a poet that they would become close friends with following 1795:
The poem continues with words that express Coleridge's closeness to Fricker and are an attempt to comfort them before their wedding:
Further into the poem is an image of alienation:
The poem ends with the soon-to-be experienced act of conjugal love:
Themes
The poem is a love poem that focuses on nature and scenery. The lines focusing on consummation suggest possible doubts within Coleridge on their ability to go through with a real sexual act and a real relationship as opposed to an idealised fantasy. Another cause of concern for Coleridge within these lines is the possibility of having to give up poetry for their marriage. These lines also incorporate the word "flash", which is connected to Jacob Boehme's view of love and to Coleridge's understanding of love as acting in a similar manner to the sunrise. Other psychological concerns that appear in the poem and in their other poetry include feelings of melancholy and alienation. In regards to solitude, the poem is connected to the use of nature in William Collins's "Ode to Evening" as a means to discuss isolation. In particular, Fricker's loneliness is compared to that of a lonely man and to the opening of a rose in order to convince them that their sorrow is not as bad as that experienced by others.
By using a line from Wordsworth's poem "An Evening Walk", Coleridge follows a standard action in poetry that serves to acknowledge the existence of another poet. In a footnote to the poem, Coleridge explains why they chose a line from Wordsworth: "A poet whose versification is occasionally harsh, and their diction too frequently obscure; but whom I deem unrivalled among the writers of the present day in manly sentiment, novel imagery, and vivid colouring". The note then points out that Wordsworth's 1793 collection of poems was received by critics harshly, and that this criticism allowed the poet to come to Coleridge's attention: "A gentleman near Bristol makes it an invariable rule to purchase every work that is violently abused by the Reviewers: and with a very few exceptions I never saw a more judicious selection of recent Compositions, both in prose and verse."
Critical review
When Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects was reviewed, few reviewers paid attention to Lines Written at Shurton Bars. John Aikin, in the June 1796 Monthly Review, states, "The most of [the 'poetical Epistles'], addressed to their 'Sara', is rather an ode, filled with picturesque imagery: of which the follow stanzas [lines 36–60] compose a very striking sea-piece". This emphasis on water was picked up again during the mid-19th century: an essay by Monkshood in the Bentley's Miscellany claims that the "marine melodies" in Lines Written at Shurton Bars are "stanzas sixteen and sweet" that contain "A bit of wave-painting, by the way, that shows how S. T. C. would have appreciated Mr. Ruskin's pictorial analysis of a composite wave, and their protest against the pretty platitudes that pass current on canvas for the real things."
A 23 August 1828 review in the Literary Gazette, in regards to a series of quotes including lines 43–72 from the poem, wrote, "We are now going to quote just a few fragments [...] all of them bearing the stamp of everlasting fame, each and all of the finest poetry. Speaking of change produced in them by happy love".
Hendrik Rookmaaker, in 1984, argues that "Coleridge often uses nature as a sort of 'picture book' with which general statements about life and morality are illustrated" and that "The most interesting example of this use of nature imagery is found in 'Lines Written at Shurton Bar'". The Columbia History of British Poets of 1994 simply describes the poem as "beautiful". In 2001, Lucy Newlyn emphasises the importance of the note included with the poem: "The Note is more than an acknowledgement. It is a public declaration of friendship: a construction of literary myth."

The Neer Impingement Test is a test designed to reproduce symptoms of rotator cuff impingement through flexing the shoulder and pressure application. Symptoms should be reproduced if there is a problem with the supraspinatus or biceps brachii. This test is also associated with the Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Jobe's Test.
Procedure
The patient is asked to sit on the examination table or to stand next to it with arms in internal rotation. Examiner should stand on the side which is being tested. Examiner will place one hand on the patient's scapula, and the other hand on the patient's arm below the elbow. The examiner will passively flex the shoulder forward.
Mechanism
When performing the Neer Impingement Test, the elbow should be extended, humerus in internal rotation and the forearm pronated. When the examiner is passively flexing the arm forward it is causing compression of the structures between the greater tuberosity, inferior acromion process and the acromioclavicular joint.
Results
A positive test is indicated by pain in the anterior or lateral shoulder when in full flexion. It is indicative of problems involving the supraspinatus and the long head of the biceps brachii tendons. The examiner needs to be aware of a false positive test which is due to the patient having limited forward flexion.
History
The Neer Impingement test was created by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Charles S. Neer, II, MD in 1972 based on what they observed as they performed shoulder operations. They noted that there was a significant degeneration in the supraspinatus tendon. They found that when the arm was in flexion and internal rotation it compressed on the tendons under the acromioclavicular joint. Therefore, they created this test to reproduce the symptoms looking for an impingement in that area.

was an entrepreneur and politician, who served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in post-war Japan.
Ōya was born in what is now part of the town of Meiwa in Gunma Prefecture, where their father was a high school principal and their grandfather had been a samurai in the service of Kawagoe Domain. They graduated from what later became Hitotsubashi University in 1918. On graduation they joined the zaibatsu Suzuki Shoten, and from 1925 went to work for Teijin, eventually becoming its president in November 1945.
In their early career, they were praised as a charismatic manager, who introduced new synthetic fibers which made Teijin a market leader in the fabric industry. However, they later are criticized for over-diversification, and for their refusal to surrender authority over the company despite their obvious mental decline in old age, which led Teijin to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1947, Ōya was elected to a seat in the Diet of Japan in 1947 Upper House election from the Osaka electoral district, and was reelected for a second term, serving until June 1956 under Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) banner. From 19 October 1948 – 16 February 1949, they were Minister of Commerce and Industry under the 2nd Shigeru Yoshida administration, as well as interim Minister of Finance from 14 December 1948 to 16 February 1949. During the 3rd Yoshida administration, Ōya served as Minister of Transport from 16 February 1949 to 28 June 1950.
Ōya was married to the singer and writer Ōya Masako.

André-François Boureau-Deslandes (21 May 1689 – 11 April 1757) was a French philosopher.
Deslandes has been viewed as an important precursor of the Encyclopédistes. They were appointed Commissioner of the Port of Brest in 1716, was a corresponding member from La Rochelle of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
Family background
Deslandes was born into an important family in Pondichéry. They were the son of André Boureau-Deslandes (born in Tours) and grandson of François Martin (1634–1706), the founder and first governor of Pondichéry.
Their father André Boureau-Deslandes played a major role in the diplomatic relations between France and Siam, then in India where they became Director General of Commerce in Bengal. On their return to France, they were sent to Saint-Domingue as an officer in the Navy of the kings of France and Spain, and inspector-general of "l'Assiente". They were ennobled by letters in 1703 and died at Léogâne in 1707. In 1686 they married Deslandes' mother, Marie-Françoise, the daughter of the famous knight Martin, the governor of Pondichéry. They had eight children of which six survived, including two who became clergymen. Deslandes' father brought François Martin's Memoirs back to France as books of manuscripts, and they were later published in three volumes.

The Kashima Gatalympics is an event held in the mudflats of the Ariake Sea off Kashima city in Saga Prefecture, Japan. The event takes place every year at the end of May. Participants compete in novelty games such as the mud sumo tournament, the 25m dash and the surf board race. The Ariake Sea has a tidal range of six metres, which on a low tide, exposes the mudflats on which the games take place. It has become a well known event throughout the Saga Prefecture with around 300 athletes participating each year.
History
When the prefecture plan for Saga was published in 1984, it was decided that Kashima City would not have a highway or a Shinkansen connection. Mr. Masahiko Kuwahara, the mayor of Kashima, was also the president of the junior chamber. They created a committee called "Forum Kashima" to improve the city's cultural calendar. As a result, the 1st Kashima Gatalympic event was held on May 3, 1985.
As the Gatalympics became well known, the mudflats that had been previously neglected were improved. As a result, the mudflats became an important and valued symbol for the growth of the city as a whole.
When deciding on a name, initially "The big athletic meet on the mudlats" was proposed. Later, a second name "The Gata-olympic big athletic meet on the mudflats" was suggested. This was eventually being shortened to just the "Gatalympics". The term "Gatalympics" comes from the name of mudflats in Japanese, Kashima Higata (鹿島干潟) and the Olympics.
Events
The 2007 Event was on 27 May. The opening ceremony commenced at 10am, with events from 11am to 3pm.
The 2009 Gatalympics were held on 7 June.
The 30th Kashima Gatalympics took place on 25 May 2014.
In popular culture
The Gatalympics was featured in the anime Zombie Land Saga, bringing wide popularity to the event.

The Diocese of Ballarat is a diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia, which was created out of the Diocese of Melbourne in 1875. It is situated in the Ballarat region of the state of Victoria, Australia and covers the south-west region of the state. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral of Christ the King in Ballarat. Garry Weatherill, formerly the Bishop of Willochra between 2000 and 2011, was installed as the 10th Bishop of Ballarat on 5 November 2011.
History
The diocese was created in 1875, out of the Diocese of Melbourne. The inaugural Bishop was Samuel Thornton. Ballarat is one of five dioceses of the Anglican Church of Australia in the ecclesiastical Province of Victoria.
Cathedral
The Cathedral of Christ the King in Ballarat is the cathedral church of the diocese.
The date of the first Anglican service in Ballarat is problematic. Undoubtedly it occurred soon after the discovery of gold late in August 1851. A history of St Paul's Bakery Hill contends that it was on 12 October 1851, when an open-air service conducted by the Revd J. Cheyne from Burnbank was held in a tent. It was a musical service, with hymns accompanied by violin and flute, and was so well received that an evening service was held by lamplight. Ballarat historian W. B. Withers is vague on early details, saying the Anglicans followed on the heels of the Wesleyans. Spielvogel records that it was the Revd William Sim and the Revd A. Morrison who held a service in a tent in November 1851 not far from the present site of St Paul's Bakery Hill. Yet another Anglican source plumps for the Revd Charles Perks of St Peter's, Eastern Hill who visited and officiated at an outdoor service under the escarpment later overlooked by Christ Church.
Following the survey of the township of Ballarat, a large block of land in Lydiard Street South was set aside for church purposes. There was little building activity until 1854, when the Revd James R.H. Thackeray was appointed in July. In September 1854 collections were taken up for a fund to build a "church and parsonage", services in August being held in the court house. Thackeray's first church was in a tent and in October 1854 a school began in the tent, with William Barton as schoolmaster. There were as many as 80 children crammed into the tent and, in March 1855, Thackeray allowed the school to be transferred to Bakery Hill.
Early in October 1854, Henry Bowyer Lane, government architect at the Ballarat Camp, called tenders for the "Erection of a Church in the Township of Ballarat", according to plans to be seen at their office. Building began in 1854 after £250 had been subscribed, and a ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone. But building proceeded slowly and Thackeray was dismissed in August 1855 when they could not account for the money subscribed for the building fund and even tried to sell off the Creswick church. (Spooner, p. 18; Moore, p. 127; Star, 22 September 1855) The Revd John Potter came to Ballarat from Ballan and, with the support of James Stewart and Adam Augustus Lynn, was able to open a temporary chapel building in Armstrong Street on 16 September 1855. A report in the Ballarat Times on 15 September 1856 noted that "a school house and place of worship will be provided as soon as possible". According to Spielvogel, this was ready by October 1855.
An article in The Ballarat Star on 16 July 1856 describes a meeting to form a Church of England Association in Ballarat. John Potter was in charge and noted that they have been in Ballarat "for twelve months". They also noted that "a small attempt only has been made to procure a building suitable for Divine Worship". The basalt church, designed by Lane in 1854, was finally completed in 1857 by Backhouse and Reynolds of Geelong as contractors for a price of £2,000. It was dedicated on 13 September 1857. The same contractors and architects were responsible for the nearby Lydiard Street Wesleyan Church, built of stone in 1858 for £5000. Christ Church was built of basalt quarried at Bond Street, Ballarat, and measured 76 feet by 36 feet, with cedar furnishings supplied by a Mr Helpin of Geelong. From the 1850s, the choir was important, with a paid choir at least from 1859.
The women of the parish took on the task of sewing the table linens and soft furnishings for the church, led by Loftus Lynn, wife of Ballarat's first solicitor. Adam Loftus Lynn was a leading member of the early church, and they imported a house which was constructed on the site of the Ballarat Club. They had a total of 11 children, who also contributed much to the social activity of the church. Lynn's Chambers in Lydiard Street, opposite the church, commemorates the Lynn family. An article on architecture in the Ballarat Star in 1862 mentions "there has been some talk of building a tower and otherwise enlarging Christ Church, erected some years ago in the early English style of architecture, but the efforts of the congregation seem to have ceased for the present". The congregation asked the Melbourne architect Leonard Terry, who had designed the banks in Lydiard Street, to undertake additions to the existing building in 1867.
In 1868 the sanctuary and transepts were built by Edward James at a cost of £1,792 and in September that year the western half of the church (now cathedral) hall was opened as a school hall. A great celebration for the church came on 11 August 1875, when Samuel Thornton was installed as the first bishop of the new Diocese of Ballarat.
Henry Caselli, who arrived in Ballarat in 1855, and became a member of the Christ Church community, was at some point appointed diocesan architect. They designed many churches around Ballarat and always gave half their services gratuitously, as well as being a generous donor to building funds. Their 20-year-old daughter Georgiana was buried from Christ Church in 1866.
Early in 1882, Caselli and Figgis called tenders for the bishop's registry, council chambers and other facilities for Christ Church. At the time of Caselli's death in 1885, they held a prominent position as a leader of Christ Church, and was accorded a farewell by the bishop on 5 March 1885. From the arrival of Bishop Thornton, there were dreams of building a fine cathedral which would have a frontage onto Dana Street. With this in mind the old vicarage, which dated from 1854 to 1855, was demolished and the present deanery built. A public meeting was held at the Alfred Hall on 10 September 1886 to launch the idea of the cathedral. The diocese conducted a design competition, and of the 24 entries received from leading Victorian architects, the design of Tappin, Gilbert and Dennehy was accepted in early 1887, and a fund was opened for the building, which soon amounted to £1710.
The original plan had been to build the cathedral over the existing church, but there were so many difficulties to the plan that it was decided to begin on a new site on the corner of Dana and Lydiard Streets. The new deanery was completed on 26 April 1888. There was a ceremonial laying of the foundation stone of the cathedral on 30 November 1888, when the Governor, Sir Henry Loch, came to do the honours. John Manifold laid £500 on the stone as a donation to the building fund. But the Depression of the 1890s made money scarce, and the failure of a number of banks saw significant losses suffered by members of the diocese. Many parishioners felt that Christ Church was perfectly adequate as a cathedral, especially when the architect William Tappin estimated that the cathedral would cost £50,000 to build, exclusive of the tower and spire.
Work finally began in 1903, when a tender of £3,624 was accepted for completion of the diocesan offices. New plans were submitted by the architectural firm of Smart, Tappin and Peebles, with work resuming between 1903 and 1908, before it finally stalled. Bluestone for the chapter house was quarried at Redan, and Waurn Ponds stone was used for the doors, arches and traceries. When funds ran out in 1904, and no support was forthcoming from England, the grand cathedral plan was abandoned. The portion of the plan that was erected was called the Manifold Chapter House in 1908, when the first Synod was held in the building in November 1908. It was dedicated on 10 November 1908, at a cost of £12,000.
William Thomson Manifold (1861-1922), a pastoralist from Purrumbete near Camperdown, was a generous benefactor to the Anglican diocese. They were educated at Geelong Church of England Grammar School and Jesus College, Cambridge. They supported Anglican and local institutions, making considerable donations, often with their brothers. The Church of England cathedral and chapter house in Ballarat, Queen's College and Ballarat Grammar School benefited from their generosity. Manifold was vicar's warden of St Paul's, Camperdown, a member of the synod and of the bishop's council.
As time passed, improvements were made to the pro-cathedral, each improvement making the dream of the great cathedral recede even further. In 1923 Bishop Maxwell Maxwell-Gumbleton decided that Christ Church should be remodeled to conform as far as its design would allow, as a cathedral church. The chancel was extended into the nave, and its floor raised. Screens were placed across the transept arches and a throne of blackwood was placed on the south side of the chancel. In 1929 a new organ was installed.
At the end of the 1930s the church was further improved by the erection of a reredos and paneling to the east. A gift from the Friends of Canterbury Cathedral came in 1935, when a stone replica of an 8th-century cross from the cathedral was presented to Ballarat and set into the arch (left hand side) near the altar. The Friends of Canterbury Cathedral made similar gifts to all the other cathedrals in Australia.
In 1972, the front porch was added, and the baptistery moved to the west end of the nave. A major development came in 1989 when the diocesan centre was added, the architect being John Vernon. In 1993 the choir and organ gallery was added. In 2004 a new pipe organ was installed.
In the 1980s, the diocese sold the old cathedral site (the chapter house) and it was used as a disco, called Hot Gossip, for about a decade from June 1988. It was later called The Chapel Nightclub. In 2007, the old chapter house became a residential apartment.
The history of Ballarat diocese was written by John Spooner. Entitled The Golden See, it was published in 1989 and covers the period from the beginning of the colony of Victoria in 1834 until 1975.

Western Maori was one of New Zealand's four original parliamentary Māori electorates established in 1868, along with Northern Maori, Eastern Maori and Southern Maori. In 1996, with the introduction of MMP, the Maori electorates were updated, and Western Maori was replaced with the Te Tai Hauāuru and Te Puku O Te Whenua electorates.
Tribal areas
The Western Maori electorate extended from South Auckland and the Waikato to Taranaki and the Manawatu. The seat originally went to Wellington. With MMP it was replaced by the Te Tai Hauāuru and Te Puku O Te Whenua electorates in 1996.
The electorate included the following tribal areas:
Tainui, Taranaki
History
The first member of parliament for Western Maori from 1868 was Mete Kīngi Paetahi. At the nomination meeting in Wanganui, held at the Courthouse, Paetahi was the only candidate proposed. They were thus elected unopposed. They represented the electorate of Western Maori from 1868 to 1870. They contested the electorate again at the 1871 general election, but of the three candidates, they came last. They were defeated by Wiremu Parata, with Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui in second place.
In the there was some doubt about the validity of the election result, and a law was passed to confirm the result in Western Maori and two other electorates.
From the 1890s to the 1930s the seat was held by various Reform Party MPs. In 1935, Toko Ratana the eldest son of the founder of the Ratana Church won the seat and became the second Ratana MP; they became a Labour MP following the Labour-Ratana pact. From this point until the abolition of the seat prior to the 1996 election the seat was held by Labour MPs.
Toko Ratana died in 1944 and was succeeded by their younger brother, Matiu Rātana. They died in 1949 shortly before the 1949 general election. Their wife Iriaka Rātana stood in their stead, despite significant opposition from those supporting traditional leadership roles, with Te Puea Herangi speaking out against their claim to "captain the Tainui canoe". Only the strong backing of the Rātana church and their threat to stand as a Rātana Independent secured them the Labour Party nomination. They became the first woman Maori MP, getting a similar majority (6317) to their husband in 1946 (his majority then was 6491), but no less than seven independent candidates (and one Kauhananui candidate, K Nutana) stood against her; they got 116 to 326 votes each.
Candidates for the National Party (who usually came second) included Hoeroa Marumaru (1946, 1949 & 1951) and Pei Te Hurinui Jones (1957, 1960 and 1963; also earlier).
Members of Parliament
Western Maori was represented by 15 Members of Parliament:

Election results
Note that the affiliation of many early candidates is not known. There is contradictory information about the affiliation of Henare Kaihau. In Wilson's New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1984, the authoritative work covering parliamentary history, Kaihau is listed as a Reform Party supporter from the party's inception in 1908. Kaihau does, however, appear on a poster of the Liberal Party in 1910. The New Zealand Herald, in its reporting, also lists them as a government supporter, i.e. a Liberal.
Another example of contradictory reporting is for the . Three newspapers, The Marlborough Express, The New Zealand Herald, and the Auckland Star reported political affiliations. Two papers have Māui Pōmare as an independent, whilst the third has them as a Labour supporter. Henare Kaihau is given three different affiliations: independent, Liberal, and Reform. Pepene Eketone is categorised as Labour by two of the papers, whilst the third has them as a Liberal supporter. The Auckland Star lists another Labour supporter, but the name is a composite of first and last names of two of the candidates.

Taxus brevifolia, the Pacific yew or western yew, is a species of tree in the yew family Taxaceae native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a small evergreen conifer, thriving in moisture and otherwise tending to take the form of a shrub.
Description
A small evergreen conifer (sometimes appearing as a shrub), the Pacific yew grows to tall and with a trunk up to diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate ring counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple-leader form, able to grow new sprouts from decapitated stumps. In its shrub form, sometimes called "yew brush", it can reproduce vegetatively via layering.
It has thin, scaly bark, red then purplish-brown, covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a purplish hue to deep red, or even bright orange when freshly cut. The leaves are lanceolate, flat, dark green, long and broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.
The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6–9 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by thrushes and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2–3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time.
Varieties
Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means "creeping, prostrate, and rooting," which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.
Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with typical yew, T. brevifolia (var. brevifolia); there are no studies to support this view. Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographical ranges. For example, T. mairei var. speciosa, which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected for the lack of a "geographic reason" for recognizing it even though it appears genetically distinct.
Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has also been proposed to be elevated to subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having already been used in the genus Taxus for defining geographically separated subspecies of a single species (T. baccata). Further, one recommendation strongly discourages taxonomists from "elevating a 'variety' to a 'subspecies' unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to warrant such an elevation," and that "it is crucial to provide continuity."
Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta. Typical Taxus brevifolia, like most species in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot, composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex. However, Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta differs from var. brevifolia in producing a relatively longer primary shoot with as many five secondary shoots. The epithet, polychaeta, is in reference to the primary shoot resembling a polychaete worm; hence, its common name 'worm cone yew'. Variety polychaeta appears to be relatively rare. It may have been extirpated from the type locality—around Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington—as a result of urban expansion. It is also known from Northern Idaho and Sonoma County, California.
As in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this conclusion. The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved in the study of the genus Taxus for 25 years at the time the varieties were described.
Similar species
Yew foliage is very similar to that of Sequoia sempervirens, the coastal redwood.
Distribution and habitat
Pacific yew is native to the Pacific Northwest. It ranges from southernmost Alaska south to Northern California, mostly in the Pacific Coast Ranges, but with isolated disjunct populations in southeast British Columbia and in Northern Idaho. It grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier environments it is mostly limited to stream-side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops, at least as high in altitude as above sea level. Pacific yew is shade tolerant, but can also grow in sun. The tree's shade tolerance allows it to form an understory, which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.
Uses
Traditionally, the resilient and rot-resistant wood was used by Native Americans to make tools, bows (backed with sinew), arrows, and canoe paddles. Other purposes for yew included making harpoons, fishhooks, wedges, clubs, spoons, drums, snowshoes, and arrowheads. The foliage and bark was used for medicinal purposes. Members of the Pit River Tribe would sell this plant to the Ukiah. The Concow tribe calls the tree yōl'-kō (Konkow language).
Modern-day longbow makers report that a very small percentage of yew trees are of a grain suitable for their craft. The Japanese have used the wood for decorative purposes, and the Taiwanese have valued it as well.
While many parts of yews are poisonous and can be fatal if eaten, the juicy red cup around the seed seems to be edible as long as the seed within is not chewed or swallowed, with a cherry jello-like taste. Birds eat such cups and spread the seeds. Moose feed on the tree in winter in forests of the Rocky Mountains.
The chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (taxol), used in breast, ovarian, and lung cancer treatment, can be derived from Taxus brevifolia and other species of yew. As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized around the 1990s, the Pacific yew was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread use of the paclitaxel was enabled circa 2003 when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species.

"Joy" is a pop/dance song performed by Australian actor/singer Toni Pearen. It was released in March 1995 as the fourth and final single from their debut album Intimate. "Joy" entered the ARIA top 100 singles chart on 19 March 1995 at #75, peaking at #71 the following week. "Joy" was released at a time when Pearen's music career was heading into decline. The album Intimate was unsuccessful and the previous single "Walkaway Lover" had charted lower than their first two singles, although it did make the top forty. "Joy" has so far been Toni Pearen's last single release.

Xin Xiang Qin Dai Hui (), (originally broadcast in Season 1 as Xin Xiang Qin Shi Dai ()), broadcast with the title Dating with the Parents in Australia) is a Chinese companion dating show hosted by Meng Fei and Zhang Chunye. It is made and broadcast on JSBC: Jiangsu Television in Nanjing, China. The show combines elements from two Chinese dating game shows, the first being “Chinese Dating with the Parents”, running on rival network Dragon Television, and the second being Jiangsu Television's own show, “If You Are the One”, which itself is loosely based on the Taken Out format, and which Meng Fei is also a host of.
Introduction and History
Meng Fei (孟非) started the show in March 2018 and whilst it takes many implements from its predecessor show, they said that "While hosting If You Are the One, many parents came to me and said they wanted to join their children on stage. This is the main reason why we started New Chinese Dating Time".
Different from its sister show If You Are The One, New Chinese Dating Time is specially targeting contestants who are looking at getting married. Even though the age of arranged marriages in China has long disappeared, parents in China still played an important in their children's search for a partner due to the influence of China's traditional patriachial system and the values of filial piety.
Being 'filial' to one's parents is one of the most mentioned criteria on the show.
Premise
Each week there would be six candidates with their parents and/or family members on the show. The show alternates between a male version and a female version each week. After the introductions of each family, the children of the six groups of families are sent to the soundproof room. A single candidate of the opposite gender then goes on stage one by one to the face the families of the 6 candidates, whilst not being able to see the faces of their children
The single candidate then plays two videos to reveal information about themselves including their occupation and past relationships. Like on If You Are The One, the families can decide in-between videos whether the candidate is date-worthy for their children by either keeping their light on, or turning their light off. The candidate, the families and the hosts exchange banter with each other when videos are not shown. The children in the soundproof room are able to see the candidate through a separate screen and are also able to communicate with their parents through calling them on the phone in-between videos.
The burst light procedure (simplified Chinese: 爆灯; literally: "burst light") is available for the children in the soundproof room to signify their interest on the candidate. If one of the families' children had activated their burst light, their light can not be turned off, and the family is guaranteed a place in the finalist round.
After both videos have been shown, if there are at least three groups of families still with their lights on, the candidate makes it to the final question round. If there are more than 3 lights left on, the candidate is asked to turn off excess lights until there are three families left. If there are no lights left at the end of both videos, the candidate leaves without a date.
If the candidate is successful to getting to the final round, the candidate then puts forward a question to the three groups of families, followed by inviting the children of the finalist families on-stage for the candidate to ask questions. Following the first round of questions from the candidate to the children of the families, the candidate's family watching proceedings from a different room is asked by the hosts to eliminate one family. It is up to the candidate to follow their family's suggestion or to eliminate another family. The candidate then asks a second round of questions to children of the remaining candidate families. Following that, they are able to choose one of the children from the two remaining groups of families as their date.

Stewart David Yetton (born 27 July 1985) is an English footballer who plays as a striker for, and is assistant-manager at, Southern League Premier South side Truro City.
Career
Early career
Born in Plymouth, Devon, Yetton began their career at Plymouth Argyle in 2003, but found their chances in the first team were limited. After a trial with St Mirren and a month-long loan spell at Weymouth, in which their only appearance was as a substitute in the 3–0 win over St Albans City on 13 November 2004, they moved to Tiverton Town on 11 February 2005. They scored twice on their debut in a 2–0 win at Cirencester Town the following day, and scored ten goals in league and cup during their time at the Devon club.
Truro City
Yetton moved to Truro City late in 2005, with the club then in the South Western League. They proved to be a prolific goalscorer with 200 goals in all competitions by February 2010 as City progressed through the Western League and the Southern League. These included 72 goals during the 2006–07 season (a club record), and six goals in the 8–5 victory over Radstock Town in 2007–08.
Stewart Yetton went on a month's loan at Ivybridge Town at the start of the 2009–10 season for one month to regain fitness from their shoulder injury, scoring four goals in three games. On their first match back from their loan, in the FA Cup Third Qualifying Round, Yetton scored the equaliser for Truro against Mangotsfield United in the 90th minute to earn a replay.
On 20 February 2010, Yetton scored their 200th league goal for Truro City, a late goal against Bedford Town. Their total number of goals at that point was greater than the number of games they had played in the league, and they are the record goalscorer at the club.
After five months on the sidelines with a knee injury during the 2012–13 season, Yetton returned to the Truro squad and scored three goals in three games, although the club were relegated from the Conference South. However, their career at Truro was ended after a training ground incident on 18 April 2013, in which City defender Ben Gerring suffered a broken jaw. Yetton was initially suspended until the end of the season, and was linked with a return to Weymouth. In nearly eight years at Truro, they scored 226 goals in 315 league and cup appearances, also scoring in their last game, a 2–1 win at A.F.C. Hornchurch on 13 April. They became a free agent on 2 May and signed for the Terras on 4 May.
Later career
In 2013 Yetton joined Weymouth and scored 27 league goals in 44 league games in their first season with the Terras. In May 2014, Yetton signed a contract to keep them at Weymouth until the end of the 2015–16 season.
Short spells back at Truro City followed, as well as a stint as a player-coach at Plymouth Parkway in 2018. In December 2018, Yetton rejoined Southern League side Tiverton Town.
For the start of the 2019–20 season, Yetton once again rejoined Truro City, as a player and as assistant-manager to Paul Wotton.
Outside football
In August 2011, Yetton took a five-wicket haul on debut for Old Suttonians Cricket Club, helping them to a nine-wicket win.

Lewis Foreman Day (29 January 1845 – 18 April 1910) was a British decorative artist and industrial designer and an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement.
Biography
Day was born at Peckham Rye, south London, on 29 January 1845. Their father, Samuel, was a wine merchant. Their mother was Mary Ann Lewis. They were educated in France, at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and subsequently in Germany.
They were first employed as a clerk, then, at the age to twenty they worked for the glass painters and designers Lavers, Barraud and Westlake. They moved to the stained glass makers of Clayton and Bell, where they designed the cartoons. In 1870 they worked for Heaton, Butler and Bayne on the decoration of Eaton Hall, Cheshire.
They started their own business in London in 1870, expanding their activities beyond glass painting to a wide range of media including wallpapers for W. B. Simpson & Co., textiles for Turnbull & Stockdale, and tiles for Maw's and Pilkington's.
They were an active member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, one time master of the Art Workers Guild, which they helped to found, and a member of the Council of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) for much of the period between 1877 and their death. They were an influential educator and wrote widely on design and pattern. Their Cantor Lectures on Ornamental Design for the RSA (1886) led to a series of publications, including The Anatomy of Pattern (1887), The Planning of Ornament (1887), Pattern Design (1903), Ornament and its Application (1904), and Nature and Ornament (1908–9). They published in many journals, including the Magazine of Art, the Art Journal and the Journal of Decorative Art. Other books were Windows (1897), Stained Glass (1903), Alphabets Old and New (1898) and Lettering in Ornament (1902).
They were an examiner for the Department of Science and Art and later the Board of Education. They lectured at the Royal College of Art (RCA). In 1910 they wrote a dissenting report to the government Committee of Inquiry into the RCA, in which they argued for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing Arts and Crafts orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials; in this they shared the Committee of Inquiry's reservations about the methods of the RCA's professor of design, W. R. Lethaby.
They also made a critique of what they saw as un-businesslike Arts and Crafts attitudes in Moot Points, a dialogue with their friend Walter Crane.
They served on the consultative committee of the Victoria and Albert Museum when it transferred to its new building in Cromwell Road in 1909, and influenced the arrangement its collections there. Their own work is well represented in the museum's collection.
Their professional association with William Morris and other key figures of the Arts and Crafts movement, such as Crane and W. A. S. Benson, placed them at the centre of contemporary applied arts in Britain, yet, according to their biographer, Joan Maria Hanson, they became neglected in histories of the period.
They married Ruth Emma Morrish In 1873. They had one child, Ruth. The family are buried together on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

The Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group was a political faction within the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1915 by anti-revisionist Marxists who despite previously opposing participation in the First World War now supported it. Its name comes from the three principal protagonists: Paul Lensch, Heinrich Cunow and Konrad Haenisch. They followed the initiative of Parvus in advocating a German victory as a positive step for international social democracy. They mobilised Marxist arguments behind the war effort.
In 1907 Parvus had been a critic of German imperialism, publishing Colonial Policy and the Breakdown during the 1907 German federal election, often referred to as the Hottentot Election.

On the afternoon of 23 March 1988, Deborah Linsley was murdered on a train between Petts Wood and London Victoria stations in Greater London. Although there were about 70 people on the train, and Linsley apparently fought and injured their attacker, only one passenger reported hearing anything suspicious. The killer has not been identified. Stored blood evidence from the scene allowed the case to be re-examined a decade later using DNA technology, and in 2002 it was re-opened with a major publicity campaign. A police reward is on offer.
Background
Deborah "Debbie" Linsley was born in Bromley, Kent, in 1962 to Arthur and Marguerite Linsley. Them father was a retired insurance broker, and Marguerite investigated fraud for the Department of Social Security. By 1988, Deborah had moved out and was living and working in Edinburgh as a hotel manager. They had returned to London to attend a hotel management course, and stayed at their parents' house in Bromley. They also visited their brother Gordon, at whose wedding in two weeks they would have been a bridesmaid.
On the afternoon of Wednesday 23 March, Gordon gave Deborah a lift to Petts Wood station, where they boarded the Orpington-to-London train at 14:16. The intermediate stops en route to London were Bickley, Bromley South, Shortlands, Beckenham Junction, Kent House, Penge East, Sydenham Hill, West Dulwich, Herne Hill and Brixton, with arrival at Victoria scheduled for 14:50.
The train was a 4EPB electric multiple unit number 5115 with compartment stock made up of a mixture of carriage types. Some carriages were of the fully open type with a central gangway running the full length of each carriage; others had unconnected full-width compartments seating twelve, each with a door on each side opening directly to the outside and no means of moving from compartment to compartment within the train. The trailer second carriage Linsley was in (number 15084) was of the latter type, and they may have chosen it because it was one of the few in which smoking was permitted. Following the murder, British Rail emphasised that trains always had at least some corridor-type carriages to give passengers a choice of corridor or non-corridor compartments.
Death
At some point before the journey ended, Linsley was stabbed to death. They sustained eleven stab wounds to the face, neck and abdomen, of which at least five were to the area around the heart. One of these wounds was the cause of death. When the train arrived on to Victoria's platform two at 14:50, a British Rail porter (as was customary) walked through the train. The carriage floor and seat were covered in blood. Some of this was discovered to be that of Linsley's killer, who had been injured in the struggle. Linsley had defence wounds on their hands, and a spokesperson for Scotland Yard said that they may have been trying to defend themselves from a sex attack, though police did not find any evidence of sexual interference.
Linsley's funeral took place at Holy Trinity Church, Bromley on 22 April, and they were buried in a nearby cemetery. The cortege was accompanied by a police escort between the church and cemetery, where Deborah Linsley was buried in the bridesmaid's dress they would have worn at their brother's wedding.
British Rail had been slowly phasing out carriages of the type in which Linsley died, and within a week of the murder it announced that the number used on off-peak journeys—such as Linsley had been travelling on—would be reduced to minimise the chance of passengers being isolated. A broad red band was painted along the cantrail of coaches without corridors to allow passengers to identify them before boarding.
Investigation
The Metropolitan Police's senior investigating officer, Superintendent Guy Mills described the crime as "savage and brutal". They highlighted that because the compartment Linsley was travelling in had no corridor, they had had no means of escape, "apart from through the side doors onto the track". On account of the ferocity of the attack, Mills suggested that it was unlikely to have been the killer's first. The short duration of the BrixtonVictoria journeysix minutessuggested Linsley might have known them attacker.
Although approximately 70 people had boarded and departed the train by the time it arrived at Victoria, the only potential witness appears to have been a French au pair who reported hearing loud screams soon after the train had departed Brixton.
Of interest to police were the following individuals:
A passenger described as "a short, stocky man seen jumping from the train" at Victoria.
A man seen leaving a compartment of the train at Penge East, before reboarding, possibly into Linsley's coach.
A passenger described by police as a "scruffy man with dirty blond hair" who alighted from the train at Penge East. Police released an artist's impression of this man.
A man seen staring at women boarding the train at Orpington.
The weapon was not found, but it is believed to have been five to seven-and-one-half inches long with a heavy blade. The 1988 police investigation produced 1200 witness statements; 650 individuals were questioned and ruled out. The case was featured on the crime reconstruction programme Crimewatch UK on 14 April 1988.
An inquest was held on 16 November 1988. The au pair who heard the attack was criticised by the Coroner for not pulling the communication cord, despite believing that someone was being raped. They said they had been "glued to their seat" and contacted police only after they learned that a murder had occurred. The coroner highlighted that, although passengers reported hearing "a commotion", nobody investigated. The inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
In response to Linsley's murder, British Rail's Eastern Region ordered its guards to proactively patrol their trains and be particularly observant for women travelling alone. Likewise, the police advised that passengers should be vigilant on the railway generally, but particularly to "avoid [carriages] where the only means of escape was directly onto the line or platform".
Case reopened
Linsley's killer had sustained injuries and left blood at the scene, which was collected and stored. DNA science was in its infancy in 1988, but with advances in DNA profiling technology, the case was re-opened in 2002 and a complete DNA profile built from the sample. Linsley's case was raised on the Tonight with Trevor MacDonald programme which aired on 13 September 2002.
The new investigation case was passed to the Met's cold case investigative section, formed in 2000. An extensive publicity campaign was launched in Victoria station, and there was a peak-time television crime-scene reenactment.
In 2013 the leading officer on the case called it "puzzling" that the DNA of Linsley's killer, who was "a probable repeat violent offender" had not been matched to anyone in the DNA database. That same year, police offered a reward of £20,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer. The new investigation also re-examined steps taken in the previous investigation, including tracing Linsley's seventy fellow passengers that day; police say they know the identities of at least fifty of them.
Deborah Linsley's parents publicly appealed several times for the assistance of the public in solving their death. Them mother had died by 2013.
A detective has suggested more recently that not only was the attacker injured and probably bloodied but likely "behaved in a different way after the murder", which friends or relatives may have noticed at the time.

Gerard Thomas (1663–1721) was a late Flemish Baroque painter who specialized in studio and picture gallery interiors. They became a master in Antwerp's Guild of St. Luke in 1688–89, and was dean twice. Many of their paintings reflect a trend in Antwerp painting around 1700 that shows artists—often historical masters from earlier in the century like Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck or Jacob Jordaens—in their studios, surrounded by paintings and sculptures, and teaching the craft to a young apprentice. The masters are often only hinted by the works of art pictured in the painting itself, however.

Under the provisions of the Kearny Code as promulgated in 1846, the first legislature of New Mexico commenced its session on December 6, 1847. The Council consisted of seven members, with Antonio Sandoval, of Bernalillo County, as president, and the House of twenty-one members, with W.Z. Angney as speaker.
It passed an act providing for a convention to consider a permanent form of government for New Mexico, and the delegates for this purpose met on October 10, 1848. It adopted a memorial to Congress asking for a regular territorial government, and declared against the introduction of domestic slavery.
In the next year the military governor called an election for delegates to a convention to frame a territorial form of government.
Meanwhile, Texas, which claimed all the territory east of the Rio Grande, sent Spruce M. Baird, as judge to organize that district into a county to be called Santa Fe. But they were received with such opposition that they did not attempt to carry their instructions into effect. In the spring of 1850, they sent a second commissioner, Robert S. Neighbors, to organize counties of the state of Texas and to hold elections in them of local officers.
This created some excitement, but produced no practical result. Almost at the same time, however, it became well known that the President Zachary Taylor and their cabinet at Washington desired the people of California and New Mexico to organize state governments without delay, in order to settle the question of slavery within their borders, and thus allay the great national excitement on the subject.
A convention was consequently called by Colonel Munroe, the military governor, which met on May 15, and adopted a state constitution, which all concede to be an admirable instrument. The two features which naturally attract most attention are the clear declaration against slavery in the new state, and the appreciation shown of the value of public education. It should never be forgotten that this first constitutional convention in New Mexico, in which native New Mexicans composed over ninety per cent of the membership, took this high ground and maintained it courageously, although by so doing they were placing in jeopardy their own right to self-government.
This constitution was submitted to the people on the 20th of June, and adopted with substantial unanimity. At the same time state officers and a legislature were elected, Henry Connelly being chosen governor, Manuel Álvarez as lieutenant-governor, and William S. Messervy as member of the United States House of Representatives. The state legislature met on July 1, 1850, and elected as United States senators Francis A. Cunningham and Richard H. Weightman, but while Weightman was on their way to Washington to claim their seat in the senate the famous compromise measures of 1850 were passed by Congress, one feature of which was the act organizing New Mexico as a territory, with boundaries including the areas now embraced in New Mexico, Arizona, and southern Colorado. This organic act was passed September 9, 1850.
In general, the leader of the native New Mexicans favored statehood, while the American pioneer element wanted a Territorial organization. All important officials in a Territory are appointed by the President; in a State they are elected by the people.
Judicial branch
In 1846, General Stephen W. Kearny set up a provisional government and system of laws, the "Kearny Code." The Judicial branch consisted of a three-man Superior Court. Judges served in a dual capacity. Each was a trial judge, presiding over a judicial district; together they constituted an appellate court, reviewing their individual decisions.
At the new American court's first session in Taos in April 1847, 17 men were tried for murder, 5 for high treason, and 17 for larceny. Convicted: 15 of murder, one of treason, and 6 of larceny. Every man convicted of homicide was hanged, according to Henry Weihofen.
Prior to United States occupation, the political subdivisions were those created in 1844 by the Departmental Council of Mexico which established seven counties in three districts: Taos and Rio Arriba counties in the Northern district; Santa Fe, San Miguel and Santa Ana counties in the Central district; and Bernalillo and Valencia counties in the Southeastern district. These county names were retained after the occupation of the U.S. although there were county boundary changes. In 1847 the General Assembly of the Territory of New Mexico passed an "Act Regulating the Holding of Circuit Courts." Three circuits were established: The Central, the Northern, and the Southeastern.

The Corn Palace, commonly advertised as The World's Only Corn Palace and the Mitchell Corn Palace, is a multi-purpose arena/facility located in Mitchell, South Dakota, United States. The Moorish Revival building is decorated with crop art; the murals and designs covering the building are made from corn and other grains, and a new design is constructed each year. The Corn Palace is a popular tourist destination, visited by up to 500,000 people each year.
The Corn Palace serves the community as a venue for concerts, sports events, exhibits and other community events. Each year, the Corn Palace is celebrated with a citywide festival, the Corn Palace Festival. Historically it was held at harvest time in September, but recently it has been held at the end of August. Other popular annual events include the Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo in July and the Corn Palace Polka Festival in September. It is also home to the Dakota Wesleyan University Tigers and the Mitchell High School Kernels basketball teams.
History
In the late 19th century, a number of cities on the Great Plains constructed "crop palaces" (also known as "grain palaces") to promote themselves and their products. As the idea succeeded, it spread, including: a Corn Palace in Sioux City, Iowa, that was active from 1887–1891; a Corn Palace in Gregory, South Dakota; a Grain Palace in Plankinton, South Dakota; and a Bluegrass Palace in Creston, Iowa. From 1887 to 1930, at least thirty-four corn palaces were built across the Midwest United States; only the Mitchell Corn Palace has remained intact.
The original Mitchell Corn Palace (known as "The Corn Belt Exposition") was built in 1892 to showcase the rich soil of South Dakota and encourage people to settle in the area. It was a wooden castle structure on Mitchell's Main Street, constructed on land donated by Louis Beckwith, a member of the First Corn Palace Committee. In 1904–1905, the city of Mitchell mounted a challenge to the city of Pierre in an unsuccessful attempt to replace it as the state capital of South Dakota. As part of this effort, the Corn Palace was rebuilt in 1905. In 1921, the Corn Palace was rebuilt once again, with a design by the architectural firm Rapp and Rapp of Chicago. Russian-style onion domes and Moorish minarets were added in 1937, giving the Palace the distinctive appearance that it has today.
In 2004, national media attention was drawn to the Corn Palace, when it received Homeland Security funding. This drew criticism of the Department of Homeland Security and its grant program. In 2007, the Corn Palace subsequently received $25,000 in DHS funding for a camera system useful for purposes including Barack Obama's visit in 2008, and as reported by the Mitchell Daily Republic, to protect a "new Fiberglass statue of the Corn Palace mascot Cornelius" in 2009. This statue sits across Main Street, west of the Corn Palace.
The Palace's domes were renovated in 2015 after shaking in strong winds. The new turrets are made of architectural metals.
Mural construction
The exterior corn murals are replaced and redesigned each year with a new theme, with designs created by local artists. From 1948 to 1971, the artist Oscar Howe designed the panels. Calvin Schultz designed the murals from 1977 to 2002. From 2003 to 2017, the murals have been designed by Cherie Ramsdell. No new mural was created in 2006 due to an extreme drought. Beginning in 2018, designs have been created by Dakota Wesleyan University students. As of 2018, it costs an estimated $175,000 each time the Palace is redecorated.
Twelve naturally-occurring shades of corn are grown by local farmers to create the artwork. Artists' drawings are transferred to black tar paper labeled with codes corresponding to colors, providing a "corn-by-numbers" pattern showing where each colored cob should be nailed. Corn cobs are split in two lengthwise and nailed to the exterior of the building, using approximately 1.5 million nails and 325,000 ears of corn.

Øresundsvej is a street in the East Amager district of Copenhagen, Denmark. It runs from Amagerbrogade in the west to Amager Strandvej in the east.
History
Øresundsvej is the old main street of the village of Sundbyøster. All the farms of the village lined the street in a row, with cultivated land on one side and pastures on the other. The street began to change in 1755 when a royal charter allowed craftsmen and sailors to settle in Sundby Øster and Sundbyvester. The surrounding farmland was sold off in lats in the late 19th century.
The first part of the street was gradually built over with taller buildings after the turn of the century. Several large industrial plants opened at the far end of the street in the 1910s and 1920s. One of them, was Nielsen & Winther, a machine factory and aeroplane manufacturer previously based on Blegdamsvej. The company inaugurated a large factory at Øresundsvej 147 in 1917. The complex was designed by Frederik Wagner. Just a few years later, in 1921, it was taken over by Vølund. NKT opened a large cable factory on a neighbouring site in 1908.
Notable buildings
Amager Kulturpunkt (No. 6), is a local cultural centre that comprises a number of different venues. Amager Bio, a music venue, is located in a former cinema from 1941. Ama'r is a cultural centre specially for children.

The court-martial of Howard Levy occurred in 1967. Howard Levy (born April 10, 1937) was a United States Army doctor who became an early resister to the Vietnam War. In 1967, they were court-martialed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, for refusing an order to train Green Beret medics on their way to Vietnam. They said it "became clear to me that the Army [was using medics] to 'win hearts and minds' in Vietnamese villages - while still burning them to the ground in search-and-destroy missions." They considered the Special Forces (Green Berets) "killers of peasants and murderers of women and children".
Early life and education
Howard B. Levy grew up in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a salesperson. They went to New Utrecht High School and then New York University. They got their medical training at the SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (1961) and interned at the Maimonides Medical Center. They were commissioned as a reserve officer in the Army Medical Corps in 1962, but was deferred until the end of their medical residency in July 1965, at which time they were sent directly to Fort Jackson.
Court-martial, Nuremberg Defense and appeals
A noteworthy aspect of this case was that Levy's attorney, Charles Morgan Jr., raised the Nuremberg Defense, arguing that U.S. troops were committing war crimes in Vietnam and that American soldiers could lawfully refuse to obey orders related to Vietnam service. The Nuremberg trials of Nazi Leaders, which took place after World War II, held that soldiers involved in war crimes could be held liable even though under orders from a superior. A lesser known aspect of the case was that Levy "urged black enlisted men to refuse to serve in Vietnam because 'they are discriminated against and denied their freedom in the United States, and . . . discriminated against in Vietnam by being given all the hazardous duty and they are suffering the majority of casualties.'"
Levy's defense became national news and a cause célèbre among opponents of the Vietnam War because it was based on "both the illegality of the Vietnam War and the Nuremberg principle requiring non-participation in war crimes." The military court disagreed, sentencing Levy to three years at Fort Leavenworth for "conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman" and disloyal statements prejudicial to "good order and discipline." The court did, however, admit evidence of war crimes into testimony. The presiding law officer, Colonel Earl V Brown, surprisingly, allowed both the Nuremberg Defense and testimony in private session that Green Berets were engaged in war crimes in Vietnam. Despite this, because there was no testimony that Green Beret medics were involved in criminal activity or that their medical training was being used for such activity, the evidence was ruled irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible in open court. Levy described this experience years later: "We tried to put the war on trial, but the military court said the truth is no defense."
Levy was released after serving more than two years in prison, but their case continued on through the courts. The first review by a Federal District Court affirmed their conviction. Then, in April 1973, The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the decision on the grounds that the two key provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that led to the conviction "were so vague as to be unconstitutional." The very next year, on June 19, 1974, in Parker v. Levy the Supreme Court reinstated Levy's conviction with a controversial 5-3 decision. Parker v. Levy remains the legal foundation for recognition of "military necessity" as "a weightier interest than First Amendment rights of individuals in the military." Justice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that “Uttering one's belief is sacrosanct under the First Amendment.” After hearing about the verdict, Levy was quoted as saying: "I was unjustly court‐martialed, unjustly sentenced, ...unjustly spent two and a half years in prison, and I believe the Supreme Court ruling was unjust.”
Later career and personal reflections
In 2002, The New York Times interviewed them and found they had "no regrets" over their actions, and that they still considered the Vietnam War "criminal, senseless mayhem." For many years they had been the director of dermatology at New York City's Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx. They were "still critical of America's use of military force, as in Afghanistan and possibly in Iraq." They also told the Times that "he felt an affinity with those Israeli army reservists who have said they would refuse to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of Israeli treatment of the Palestinians".

This article lists diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See, the government of the Catholic Church and the temporal ruler of the Vatican City. 86 countries currently maintain embassies to the Holy See. The Vatican City State, over which the Holy See is sovereign, is the smallest independent entity in the world and its size renders any resident diplomatic community impractical. Therefore, all embassies to the Holy See are located in Rome making Vatican City one of only two sovereign states, the other being Liechtenstein, with no resident embassies located within its territory. This leads to the situation that the Embassy of Italy to the Holy See is based on its home territory, which is also the case for Iceland, Latvia, and Sweden. This also means that an embassy of the Republic of China (more commonly known as Taiwan) to the Holy See is located in Italy, which does not recognize the Republic of China.
Embassies to the Holy See usually do not maintain consular sections, allowing their other embassy or consulate in Rome or another elsewhere to provide services to those holding passports issued by the Holy See. A notable exception is that of the Philippines, whose consular section caters to the Filipino pilgrims to Catholic pilgrimage sites in Italy and the Filipino members of religious congregations.

Robinson Peak is a mountain with an elevation of located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, in Mono County of northern California, United States. The summit is situated on the boundary of Hoover Wilderness, on land managed by Humboldt–Toiyabe National Forest. The peak is set above the west end of Twin Lakes, two miles east of Victoria Peak, and 1.5 mile southeast of line parent Eagle Peak. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of Robinson and Buckeye Creeks, which are within the Walker River drainage basin. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises approximately 3,700 feet (1,128 meters) above Robinson Creek in 1.5 mile.
History
The peak is named in association with Robinson Creek, which in turn is named for Moses Robinson, an early pioneer who operated a sawmill there in the 1860s. The toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.
The first ascent of the summit was likely made by the 1905–09 USGS survey team of George Davis, A. H. Sylvester, and Pearson Chapman, but the first documented ascent was made August 22, 1946, by K. Hargreaves, H. F. Watty, R. F. Dickey, Jr., and Ken Crowley.
Climate
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Robinson Peak is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing moisture in the form of rain or snowfall to drop onto the range.

The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead or more recently The Forum is an American, English language newspaper. It is the major newspaper for Fargo, North Dakota and the surrounding region, including Moorhead, Minnesota. It is the flagship and namesake of Forum Communications. The Forum, as it is commonly known, is the primary paper for southeast North Dakota, and also much of northwest Minnesota. Its average daily circulation was about 47,100 on Sundays and 37,500 on Saturdays prior to reducing its print schedule to semi-weekly. The Fargo Forum was first published on November 17, 1891 by Major A. W. Edwards. However, it traces its lineage to The Republican, which had been founded by Edwards in 1878 and merged into the Forum in 1894.
It has been owned by the family of Norman B. Black since 1917. Publisher Bill Marcil, Jr. is the son of Black's great-granddaughter; they are the fifth generation of the family to run the paper and the company. It took its current form in 1966 when it merged with the Moorhead Daily News, which was acquired by The Forum in 1957.
The Forum is also co-owned with radio station WDAY AM and TV stations WDAY-TV and WDAZ-TV. It used to own KOYY under the call sign WDAY-FM. In spring 2008, The Forum's news staff merged with WDAY-AM's news team, forming one of the first joint radio-print news-gathering operations in the country.
In 2015, higher education reporter Grace Lyden won the NDNA's Rookie of the Year award for their "bulldog tenacity."
In 2020, the newspaper reduced its print schedule to Wednesdays and Saturdays due to economic stress caused by the pandemic.

In enzymology, an isomaltulose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
sucrose 6-O-Alpha-D-Glucopyranosyl-D-Fructofuranose
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, sucrose, and one product, 6-O-Alpha-D-Glucopyranosyl-D-Fructofuranose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose glucosylmutase. Other names in common use include isomaltulose synthetase, sucrose alpha-glucosyltransferase, and trehalulose synthase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .

They continued their studies, gaining a DSc from the University of Glasgow in 1910. In 1911 they took up the position of First Assistant to Professor J. M. Munro Kerr, who held the Muirhead Chair of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the university.
At the outbreak of the First World War they and other women medical graduates offered their services to the government. They were declined as "the battlefield .. [was] no place for women". They decided to set up the Scottish Women's Hospital for Foreign Service. They commanded the Girton and Newnham unit of the hospital at Domaine de Chanteloup, Sainte-Savine, near Troyes, France before being posted to Serbia and, three years later, Salonika.
During their time in Salonika they established a nurses training school for Serbian girls and oversaw the establishment of the only orthopaedic centre in the Eastern Army. They finished their war service as a surgeon at a Royal Army Medical Corps hospital in Constantinople.
In 1921, they were appointed to the Royal Free Hospital in London as consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology. They were the first woman Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the London School of Medicine for Women, becoming the first woman to be appointed a medical professor in the United Kingdom.
On 7 July 1921, McIlroy delivered a paper at the Medico-Legal Society in London. In it, they said that the "most harmful method [of contraception] of which I have experience is the use of the pessary". Dr Halliday Sutherland heard their talk and they later quoted them in their 1922 book "Birth Control". When Marie Stopes sued Dr Sutherland for libel over remarks in the book, McIlroy because a witness for the defence.
They retired in 1934, in their own words 'to gain a few years of freedom' although they continued private practice at Harley Street and other hospitals and clinics throughout London. At the outbreak of the Second World War they came out of semi-retirement to work as a consultant for the maternity service at Buckinghamshire County Council. They were also the senior obstetrician to the Maternity Hospital for the Wives of Officers, Fulmer Chase.
They were active in several professional medical associations: their interest in medical legal matters culminated in them becoming President of the Medico-Legal Society of London; at the British Medical Association (BMA) they were vice-president of the Section of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1922, 1930 and 1932; a member of the Representative Body from 1936 to 1939; a member of the BMA Council from 1938 to 1943, President of the BMA Metropolitan Counties Branch in 1946 and they were also president of the Section of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Royal Society of Medicine.
Publications
Throughout their career McIlroy wrote many articles in journals such as The Lancet, the British Medical Journal and The Practitioner, gave lectures and presented papers at conferences. Them particular interest was pre-eclampsia, pain relief during childbirth, managing asphyxia in newborn babies and social issues. They authored and co-authored several books including;
From a Balcony on the Bosphorus (1924)
Anaesthesia and analgesia in labour - with Katharine G. Lloyd-Williams (1934)
The Toxaemias of Pregnancy (1936)
Honours
For their work during the First World War McIlroy was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1916, the Médaille des Epidemies, the Serbian Order of St. Sava and the Serbian Red Cross Medal.
They were appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 30 March 1920 for their services to medicine and in 1929 they were promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
They were elected as a Foundation Fellow to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
In 1932 they became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians and was elected as a Fellow in 1937.
They received several honorary degrees including a DSc from Belfast of which they were particularly proud.
They were an Honorary Fellow of the Liverpool Medical Institution.
Later life
After the Second World War they returned to their retirement and left London to live with their sister, Dr Janie McIlroy, in Turnberry, Ayrshire, Scotland. They died in the Glasgow Hospital on 8 February 1968, aged 93. They never married.

The SG Barockstadt Fulda-Lehnerz is a German association football club from the Lehnerz suburb of Fulda, Hesse.
The club's greatest success has been to earn promotion to the tier four Regionalliga Südwest in 2022.
History
The club was formed on 2 December 1965 as Turn- und Sportverein Lehnerz and joined competitive football a year later, in 1966. The first three decades of its history the club spent as a non-descript amateur side in local football. TSV for the first time moved up into the higher levels of Hesse football in 1997 when it won promotion to the tier five Landesliga Hessen-Nord, rebranded the Verbandsliga in 2009.
Lehnerz would play the next sixteen seasons at this level, generally achieving good results and finishing in the upper half of the table. It finished runners-up in 2007 and, again in 2012 but failed to win promotion on each occasion. The 2012–13 season proved to be the most successful for the club, winning its Verbandsliga division and thereby direct promotion to the tier five Hessenliga.
In its first season in the Hessenliga the club finished in fourth place. In 2014–15 the club finished runners-up in the league and thereby earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the Regionalliga Südwest. After two draws the club missed out on promotion with Bahlinger SC promoted instead.
In April 2018, TSV acquired the men's first team of Borussia Fulda, which resigned from the Hessenliga, but remained as an association and continued to provide youth teams. The club was renamed SG Barockstadt Fulda-Lehnerz and received a new logo and new club colours. With the addition of the name Barockstadt, the connection to the city of Fulda has been emphasised. On 1 July, all these became official.
Honours
The club's honours:
Verbandsliga Hessen-Nord

Lu Shixin (; 12 December 1929 – 6 December 2019) was a Chinese cancer pathologist. They served as President of the Tumour Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1997.
Biography
Lu was born on 12 December 1929 in Yancheng, Jiangsu, Republic of China. They studied at Dalian Medical University from 1951 to 1956. They subsequently went to Romania to study at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest, earning an associate doctor degree in 1961.
After returning to China, they worked as a researcher at the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and then at the Tumour Institute and Tumour Hospital of the CAMS. From 1988 they served as President of the Tumour Institute.
Lu was a pioneer in molecular cancer pathology in China. They showed that nitrosamines cause esophagus cancer, and discovered a new carcinogenic nitrosamine, N-3-methylbutyl-N-1-methylacetonylnitrosamine (MAMBNA), isolated from the gastric fluid of cancer patients. They studied the molecular mechanism of the carcinogenesis of esophagus cancer, stem cells of the cancer, and its chemical prevention.
They won the National Science Congress Award in 1978, the State Natural Science Award (Third Class) in 1988, and the State Science and Technology Progress Award (Third Class) in 1996. They were elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1997.

Owyhee County ( ) is a county in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,133. The county seat is Murphy, and its largest city is Homedale. In area it is the second-largest county in Idaho, behind Idaho County.
Owyhee County is part of the Boise metropolitan area and contains slightly more than half of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, which extends over the Nevada border, into Elko County. The majority of the federally recognized Shoshone-Paiute Tribe that is associated with this reservation lives on the Nevada side; its tribal center is in Owyhee, Nevada.
History
This area was the territory of Western Shoshone, Northern Paiute, and Bannock peoples and their ancestors for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Americans. Conflicts over land use and resources led to the indigenous peoples being pushed aside.
On December 31, 1863, Owyhee County became the first county organized by the Idaho Territory Legislature. While Boise, Idaho, Nez Perce, and Shoshone counties were organized under the laws of Washington Territory, they were not recognized by the Idaho Territory until February 1864. The original county seat at Ruby City was moved to nearby Silver City in 1867.
Owyhee County's original boundary was the portion of Idaho Territory south of the Snake River and west of the Rocky Mountains. Less than a month after the creation of Owyhee County, Oneida County was formed in January 1864 from the eastern portion of the county. The formation of Cassia County in 1879 took further territory in the east.
Owyhee County's history is closely linked to the mining boom that dominated Idaho Territory in the second half of the 19th century. Silver City and Ruby City developed as boom towns. At its height in the 1880s, Owyhee County was among the most populous places in Idaho. Today it is among the least populous, at 1.4 persons per square mile (0.5 per km2).
Because of pressure from miners and settlers, the federal government made a treaty in 1877 with the Western Shoshone to cede land, and established what is now known as the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in this county and across the border in Elko County, Nevada. The reservation was expanded in 1886 to accommodate people of the Northern Paiute. In the 20th century, the tribes combined and are federally recognized as a single government; the majority of the people live on the Nevada side of the reservation.
There were two railroad lines extending into Owyhee County, the first was the Boise Nampa & Owyhee Railroad which built starting in 1896 from Nampa, Idaho south towards Melba, Idaho and eventually across the Snake River into Owyhee County in 1897, whereupon it crossed Rabbit Creek before arriving in Murphy, Idaho. The first train into Murphy occurred in 1899.
The Boise, Nampa & Owyhee Railroad was acquired by the Idaho Northern Railroad in 1907; the line was taken over by the Oregon Short Line Railroad in 1913 following their purchase of the Idaho Northern Railroad, after which it became known as the Murphy Branch line.
Daily passenger service to Murphy was discontinued in 1942. By 1947, shipping animals out of Murphy was no longer profitable for the railroad. The Murphy portion of the line was abandoned in 1947. In the 1950s, trucks and highways became the dominant mode of transportation. The last train left Melba in 1994, and all rails were torn out in that same year.
The second railroad line was the Oregon Shortline Railroad which built south from Nyssa oregon beginning in 1911, passing through Adrian oregon the line ended after 25 miles in Homedale idaho, in 1922 it was extended Marsing idaho to accommodate additional agricultural traffic.
In 1970 the marsing and homedale depots were closed by union pacific, in 1987 with declining carload the UP offered the line for sale but no buyers were found.
Following the closure of lumber mill in Homedale in the early 1990s the Homedale branch, now reduced to the status of an "industrial lead" generated a total of 49 carloads in 1995 and 42 in 1996. In 1997 Union Pacific filed for permission to abandon the Idaho portion of the line and received no formal protest, the tracks were ripped up the following year.
Owyhee County gained its present boundaries in 1930 after an election approved moving a portion of it near Glenns Ferry and King Hill to neighboring Elmore County. In 1934 the county seat was moved from the nearly abandoned Silver City to its present location in Murphy. In the 21st century, both Silver City and Ruby City are ghost towns, remnant of the mining boom.
Etymology
The name "Owyhee" derives from an early anglicization of the Hawaiian term "Hawaiʻi." When James Cook encountered what they named the Sandwich Islands (now the Hawaiian Islands) in 1778, they found them inhabited by Native Hawaiians, whom the Anglo-Americans referred to as "Owyhees." Noted for their hardy physique and maritime skills, numerous Native Hawaiians were hired as crew members aboard European and American vessels. Many Owyhee sailed to the American Northwest coast and found employment along the Columbia River, where they joined trapping expeditions or worked at some of the fur trade posts.
In 1819, three Owyhee joined Donald Mackenzie's Snake expedition, which went out annually into the Snake country for the North West Company, a Montreal-based organization of Canadian fur traders. The three Hawaiians left the main party during the winter of 1819–20 to explore the then unknown terrain of what since has been called the Owyhee River and mountains. They disappeared and were presumed dead; no further information regarding their whereabouts has been found. In memory of these Native Hawaiians, British fur trappers started to call the region "Owyhee" and the name stuck.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Idaho by area.
Nearly all of the county is high intermountain desert, with plentiful sagebrush and basalt canyons. The Owyhee Mountains in the west dominate the landscape, with Hayden Peak reaching above sea level. The lowest elevation is at the county's northwest corner, where the Snake River is just above at the Oregon border. The Snake forms most of the county's northern border from Oregon to just west of Glenns Ferry in Elmore County. A tributary of the Snake is the Bruneau River, which flows north from Nevada through the eastern section of the county. The Owyhee River starts in the southwestern part of the county and flows westward into Oregon; it eventually enters the Snake at the state border, south of Nyssa.

Politics
Although Owyhee County was amongst the most Democratic in the state in its early history, it has like most of Idaho gradually turned overwhelmingly Republican. In no presidential election since 1940 has the county selected the Democratic candidate, and no Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 has won more than one-third of the county's vote.

Latticial metal complex or grid complex is a supramolecular complex of several metal atoms and coordinating ligands which form a grid-like structural motif. The structure formation usually occurs while on thermodynamic molecular self-assembly. They have properties that make them interesting for information technology as the future storage materials.
Chelate ligands are used as ligands in tetrahedral or octahedral structures, which mostly use nitrogen atoms in pyridine like ring systems other than donor centers. Suitable metal ions are in accordance with octahedral coordinating transition metal ions such as Mn or rare tetrahedral Coordinating such as Ag used.
Nomenclature
The nomenclature is based on [n × m] G, n corresponds to the number of ligands above the metal ion level, m the number below ones. In case of using only one ligand type, the homoleptic grid is formed in a square [nxn] structure. When using different ligands arise heteroleptic complexes, however, compete with the homoleptic. The number of metal ions is always n + m.
Application
The grid complexes exhibit pH-dependent changes in the optical absorption, electronic spin states and reversible redox states. The latticial metal complexes may thus be used theoretically for information storage and processing in the future.
Other Uses
An interwoven grid complex has been used to template the synthesis of a doubly-twisted [2]catenane (otherwise known as a Solomon Link). The unique arrangement of interwoven ligands around the planar array of iron, zinc, or cobalt ions generated the crossing points required to covalently trap the interlocked structure using ring-closing metathesis. Building on this discovery, 2 × 2 interwoven grids were used to template the synthesis of more topologically complex molecules: a six-crossing doubly-interlocked [2]catenane and a granny knot. In 2021, the first report of a 3 × 3 interwoven grid was published. It was used to template the synthesis of a molecular Endless Knot.

Necochea is a port and beach city in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The city is located on the Atlantic coast, along the mouth of the Quequén Grande River, from Buenos Aires and southwest of Mar del Plata. The city proper has 90,000 inhabitants per the and is the seat of government for Necochea Partido.
The neighboring Port of Quequén, located on the eastern bank of the Quequén Grande River, is one of the most important ports in Argentina, and the gateway for the agricultural production of the southeast of the Province of Buenos Aires.
Overview
The area around Necochea was first charted by Jesuit clergymen José Cardiel and Thomas Falkner, who reached the mouth of the Quequén Grande River in 1748. Necochea itself was established as a defensive outpost against Malón raids on October 12, 1881, by National Guard commander Ángel Murga. The new settlement was named in honor of General Mariano Necochea, a military commander during Argentine War of Independence. Founded on a seaside estate owned by Eustoquio Díaz Vélez, jr., the latter's father, General Eustoquio Díaz Vélez, had likewise played an important role during the struggle. A Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway station was opened in 1894, and the Díaz Vélez family established the Villa Díaz Vélez resort in 1902. The neighboring communities were incorporated into the town of Necochea in 1911.
A suspension bridge made Necochea accessible to motorists; inaugurated in 1929, the new bridge was named after President Hipólito Yrigoyen and was one of two identical suspension bridges in Argentina (the other being in Santa Fe). A tram service operated in the town between 1913 and 1940. The inaugural of Port Quequén in 1922 made the area a leading railhead for the agriculture of Argentina; the port handled a million tons of freight by 1954 and would grow to over 3 million tons by 1991.
Necochea became an important domestic tourism destination in Argentina during the 20th century, and the number of registered hotel rooms surpassed 50,000 by 2011; occupation by then exceeded 95% during the summer high season. Its municipal beaches grew to , reaching up to in depth. The 640 hectare (1600 acres) Miguel Lillo Park, established in 1979, is the only public maritime forest nature reserve in Argentina. The park is also known for its swan's lake, tourist railway, and the Regional Historical Museum housed since 1981 in the Spanish Colonial Revival house originally belonging to the Díaz Vélez estancia.
Other local landmarks and attractions include seashore grottoes (notable among them Cueva del Tigre, named for a 19th-century gaucho who reputedly evaded authorities for years by hiding in the grotto later named for him); the Parish of Our Lady of Lourdes (consecrated in 1957); the Necochea Golf Club (founded in 1955); the Fishermen's Pier (1970); the Quequén Grande River rapids; and Quequén port, which features two breakwaters (1908), a lighthouse (1921), and a South American sea lion reserve. The casino was originally inaugurated in 1929; it was later housed in a modernist structure that opened in 1973 and was rebuilt after a 2001 fire, but which burn again in 2020 and no longer exists.
Some of the most popular recurring events in Necochea are the National Festival of Children's Shows (Fiesta Nacional de Espectáculos para Niños), held since 1962 at Miguel Lillo Park on each Epiphany Day (January 6); and the Festival of Cultures (Fiesta de las Colectividades), celebrating the contributions of the numerous immigrant communities and their descendants to both Necochea and Argentina. The festival, held at the end of January, includes stands representing the immigrant cultures common to much of Argentina (Italians, Spaniards, Danish Argentines, Middle Easterners, and Germans, among others), as well as Chileans in the recent years.
Climate
Under the Köppen climate classification Necochea has a very warm oceanic climate with warm to hot summers and mild winters, with rainfall being spread over the year. The somewhat cool summer nights and the rainfall spread prevents it from being part of the various subtropical ranges. January means are around and the winter months are around , the latter being a more typical oceanic value.

The St. Marys River (Shawnee: Kokothikithiipi, in Miami-Illinois: Nameewa siipiiwi) is a tributary of the Maumee River (Miami-Illinois: Taawaawa siipiiwi) in northwestern Ohio and northeastern Indiana in the United States. Prior to development, it was part of the Great Black Swamp. Today, it drains a primarily rural farming region in the watershed of Lake Erie.
It is formed in southern Auglaize County in western Ohio by the confluence of the short East Branch and Center Branch. It flows briefly west to St. Marys, approaching to within two miles of Grand Lake before turning to the north. In northwestern Auglaize County it turns sharply to the west-northwest, flowing past Rockford and Willshire into Adams County, Indiana. In northeastern Indiana it flows northwest through Decatur, then enters Fort Wayne. It hooks around in its last half mile (0.8 km) to join the St. Joseph River (in Miami-Illinois: Kociihsasiipi) from the west to form the Maumee in downtown Fort Wayne.
The World War II-era US Navy vessel St. Mary's River was named after this river.

Ruthild Engert-Ely (9 October 1940 – 5 May 2013) was a German operatic mezzo-soprano and alto.
Life
Born in Frankfurt, Engert-Ely first trained as a kindergarten teacher in their native town. Afterwards they worked as a nanny in London and later worked there as an art dealer. They studied singing at the Hoch Conservatory. Later, further studies followed with Josef Metternich in Cologne.
They made their stage debut at the Theater Osnabrück as Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro. They had their first regular engagements at the Theater Koblenz (1969–1972) and at the Theater Freiburg (1972–1977) where they were the countess in Lortzing's Der Wildschütz. The then Freiburg director and the musical director Marek Janowski supported Engert-Ely in their early years. In Freiburg they were able to acquire their first major roles: Rosina in The Barber of Seville, Octavia in Der Rosenkavalier and Ottavia in L'incoronazione di Poppea. After five years in Freiburg, they moved to the Staatstheater Hannover (1977–1979). There they sang Dorabella in Così fan tutte for the first time; the composer in Ariadne auf Naxos was also one of their role debuts.
Since 1979, they were a permanent member of the Deutsche Oper Berlin (DOB), to which they had been contracted by Siegfried Palm. They debuted there in 1979 as Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro. Other (premiere) roles there included Hansel in Hänsel und Gretel (season 1979/80), Nicklausse/Muse in The Tales of Hoffmann (revival: September 1980), Alisa in Lucia di Lammermoor (premiere: December 1980), Cherubino (August 1981, in the opening performance of the 1981/82 season as a stand-in for Hanna Schwarz; also in the rehearsal in January 1985), Gymnasiast/Groom in Lulu (premiere: February 1982), the composer in Ariadne auf Naxos (house debut; March 1982), Meg Page in Falstaff (revival: April/May 1982; later also in the 1988/89 season), Fenena in Nabucco (among others in March 1981, further in the revival in May 1982), Preziosilla in La forza del destino (house debut in October 1982, further in the revival in January 1987), Fjodor in Boris Godunov (revival/re-recording: February 1983), Lucienne in Die tote Stadt (premiere: February 1983), Flora Bervoix in La traviata (rehearsal: April 1984, with Júlia Várady in the title role), Floßhilde in Das Rheingold (premiere: September 1984) and Götterdämmerung (premiere: September 1985), Fatime in Oberon (premiere: January 1986) and Warwara in Káťa Kabanová (premiere: March 1986; follow-up performances in March 1987). In October 1988, they sang Warwara in Götterdämmerung in the complete Ring cycle at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. In October 1990, they made their role and house debut there as Ortrud in Wagner's Lohengrin. In November 1992, they sang Preziosilla again in a new musical rehearsal of Verdi's opera La forza del destino. In November/December 1992, they took over the role of the crunchy witch in Hänsel and Gretel. In March 1993, they took over the role of Varvara again, this time "with lush vibrato" in mezzo-soprano, in the revival of the opera Káťa Kabanová.
They were officially a member of the Deutsche Oper ensemble until the 1995/96 season. In the course of their career, they sang roles ranging from the lyrical mezzo-soprano to the dramatic mezzo-soprano. At the Deutsche Oper, they also made the change from the lyrical to the dramatic mezzo-soprano part. Occasionally they also took on purely alto roles.
In the 1979/80 season they sang Fenena in a new production of Nabucco at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein (premiere: June 1980, director: Gert Westphal), as well as the Maddalena in Rigoletto (revival: April 1980). In the 1980/81 season they gave a guest performance at the Staatsoper Hamburg. There they sang in the new production of The Tales of Hoffmann (premiere: May 1981; director: Jürgen Flimm) "vocally beautiful and expressive" the voice of their mother and the second voice in the Barcarole. In the season 1980/81, without previous rehearsals, they took over as Cherubino in December 1980 at the Staatstheater Braunschweig in a new production of the opera Le Nozze di Figaro; "the two Cherubin arias became musical highlights of the evening in their intensely sensitive arrangement" In January 1984 they sang Prince Orlofsky in the Strauss operetta Die Fledermaus at the Staatsoper Hannover. They also gave a guest performance at the Staatstheater Oldenburg in 1985 as Kundry in Wagner's Bühnenweihfestspiel Parsifal (director: Michael Rothacker; with Mario Brell as Parsifal and Ks. Heinz-Klaus Ecker as Gurnemanz) and thus became known nationwide; this role was considered their special highlight. In the 1986/87 season they took on the role of Princess Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlos at the Theater Aachen; in the 1987/88 season, Lady Macbeth in Macbeth followed there. In May 1989, with the ensemble of the Deutsche Oper, they gave a guest performance at the International May Festival at Staatstheater Wiesbaden as Warwara in Katja Kabanowa; they "powerfully enhanced the role through intensive acting and magnificent mezzo tones." In November 1991 they appeared as Kundry at the Vienna State Opera. In the opening performance of the Theater Chemnitz they also appeared as Kundry in December 1992 (after several years of general renovation of the house). In 1999 they gave a guest performance at the Musiktheater im Revier in Gelsenkirchen as Herodias in Salome.
In 1982, Engert-Ely sang for the first time at the Bayreuth Festival. From 1982 to 1989, they were a member of the permanent ensemble of the Bayreuth Festival. There, they took on the following roles: 1. Knappe in Parsifal (1982–1985), the alto solo in Parsifal (1984/1985), Grimgerde in Die Walküre (1983), Schwertleite in Die Walküre (1985/1986) and in 1989 Venus in Tannhäuser (director: Wolfgang Wagner; musical direction: Giuseppe Sinopoli).
Engert-Ely frequently gave guest performances in other European countries and overseas. In 1988 they sang the role of Kundry in Parsifal at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. They also appeared in Italy at the Teatro Regio di Torino (1987; as Clytemnestra in Elektra), at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste (February 1988; "impressive" as composer), at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice (1988, as composer), in Genoa (June 1988 as Fricka in Die Walküre; 1997 as Türkenbaba in The Rake's Progress), at La Scala (1990; as Magdalene in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg) and several times at the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania (April/May 1992 as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier, with Renata Scotto as Marschallin in their role debut; 1994 as Venus; 1998 as Klytämnestra).
They also gave guest performances at the Teatro Real in Madrid, at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon, in Paris (February 1989; as Magdalene at the Palais Garnier), in Montpellier (February 1993 as Ortrud, 1995), in Nice (1993 as Clairon in Capriccio; 1995 as Klytämnestra) and in Amsterdam (September 1993 as Kundry; June 1995 as Magdalene).

In the United States, they gave a guest performance in Charleston (June/July 1987 and 1990; as Kundry in Parsifal), at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (April 1990; as Fricka in Die Walküre), at the Washington Opera (1997; as Klytämnestra) and several times at the Hawaii Opera in Honolulu (1999 also as Klytämnestra; 2002 as Herodias in Salome). In May 1994 they sang Venus in Tannhäuser at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.
Engert-Ely also appeared as a concert and song singer. In June 1986 they appeared in a concert of the Berlin Philharmonic under the musical direction of Heinrich Hollreiser; Engert-Ely took over the alto parts in Mozart's Coronation Mass and in Beethoven's Mass in C major op. 86. In October 1988, they sang "with expressive, warm mezzo-soprano, which only lacked the otherwise pleasantly round sound at the very bottom", the alto part in Handel's Messiah in a scenic performance in the DOB. In November 1988, they took over the mezzo-soprano part in Verdi's Requiem with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In November 1991, they sang in the Verdi Requiem in a performance of the Bochumer Symphoniker conducted by Eberhard Kloke in the auditorium of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, in which "her full well-fitting mezzo-soprano with ability for dramatic attack was impressively employed". In recitals they interpreted songs by Robert Schumann, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Franz Schreker and Alexander Zemlinsky among others. They also gave singing lessons.
Engert-Ely was married to the musicologist Norbert Ely. After their marriage, they also performed under the name Ruthild Engert-Ely. Engert died in Berlin at the age of 72 after a serious illness.
Repertoire
Engert-Ely sang a broad repertoire on stage, which included baroque music, operas from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to Giuseppe Verdi, but especially works from the turn of the century, the 20th century and classical modernism.
Them other stage roles included Dorabella in Così fan tutte, Brangäne in Tristan und Isolde, Waltraute in Götterdämmerung, Hansel, later also Gertrud/Hexe in Hänsel und Gretel and Charlotte in the opera Die Soldaten (1983, Deutsche Oper Berlin; season 1987/1988 in Paris).
Recordings
Several sound documents with the voice of Ruthild Engert-Ely exist; however, their main roles are not sufficiently documented on sound recordings.
In April 1987 they performed the role of Schwertleite in a recording of the opera Die Walküre under the musical direction of James Levine at the Manhattan Center in New York City. The recording was released by Deutsche Grammophon. In June 1987 they appeared as the nurse Filipjewna in a recording of the opera Eugene Onegin, which was recorded at the Lukaskirche in Dresden; their partners were Mirella Freni (Tatjana) and James Levine (conductor). The recording was first released in 1988 (still on vinyl), also by Deutsche Grammophon. In a complete recording of Prokovief's opera The Fiery Angel they took on the roles of the fortune teller and the abbess; the recording was also released on CD by Deutsche Grammophon in 1990.
Also live and radio recordings of their performance at the Bayreuth Festival exist. Some of these were published on CD. Philips has released a CD with a recording of Parsifal from the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1985, in which Engert-Ely can be heard in their Bayreuth roles (1st miner and alto solo).
A recording of the Bayreuth Tannhäuser 1989 performance with Engert-Ely as Venus was issued on DVD.

The following lists events that happened during 1904 in Afghanistan.
Internal peace is not disturbed during the year, but there are, as usual, frequent rumours of quarrels in the amir's family and of reconciliations. Early in the year it is reported that the amir has removed their half-brother, Mohammad Omar, from the governorship of Kabul, and placed them and their mother, Bibi Halima, under close surveillance. Later on it is stated that the mullahs have brought about a reconciliation, and that Mohammad Omar has been placed in command of the troops in Kabul. There is some quarrelling between Russian and Afghan soldiers owing to the former destroying some guard-houses erected along the border of Turkestan, but there is no actual outbreak, and the amir at once sends officials of position to inquire into the matter. Owing to the generally oppressive action of the Russians some 4,000 of the Turkoman and Jamshid tribes migrate to Herat, where the amir grants them the Zulfikar Pass territory as their place of residence. Several of the leading followers of Ayub Khan return to Afghanistan and others petition the amir to be allowed to do so.
Incumbents
Monarch – Habibullah Khan
Early summer 1904
The amir injures their hand whilst snipe shooting, and the viceroy at their request sends their own doctor to Kabul to treat him. The treatment is entirely successful, and the amir's pleasure at this is possibly helpful in paving the way for the despatch of the special mission under Louis Dane, the Indian foreign secretary, which leaves Peshawar on November 26 and reaches Kabul on December 12. Its work is reported to be progressing very satisfactorily.
The nature of this work is not made public, but it is not difficult to conjecture what must be the most important points in the discussion between the amir and Mr. Dane. In the first place, Russia, despite their Far Eastern difficulties and disasters, has by no means lost sight of Afghanistan. Both in Turkestan and the north and towards Herat in the south the Russian railway system is fast being completed to within striking distance of the frontier; the question of direct commercial relations between Russian and Afghan officials on the frontier appears to be still open, and Russia can easily create local trouble whenever it suits them to do so. No doubt the amir likes to know what help Britain would give them in a case of "unprovoked aggression," and, on the other hand, the Indian government likes to know how far the amir can defend himself, what number of troops they can put into the field, and what is their state of efficiency. The relations of the amir and of the Indian government with the tribes on the North-West Frontier also require further adjustment.
A formal settlement was arrived at when what is known as the Durand Boundary was agreed on, and the present amir at first seemed anxious that the work of demarcating this boundary should be completed, but latterly they appear to have changed their mind, and the work has been suspended. Lastly, it is thought that an endeavour might be made to secure greater facilities for trade between Afghanistan and India. Whilst the foreign secretary is engaged in important work with the amir at Kabul the amir's eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, is paying a visit to the viceroy at Calcutta. As they are only a lad of sixteen their visit is only regarded as a social one, but one which may bear good fruit later if they come to the throne.

Albert Francis Zahm (1862–1954) was an early aeronautical experimenter, a professor of physics, and a chief of the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Library of Congress.
They testified as an aeronautical expert in the 1910–14 lawsuits between the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss.
timeline of early life and work in aeronautics
Received A.B., University of Notre Dame, Indiana, 1883, A.M., 1885, M.S. 1890; M.E. Cornell University, 1892; Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, 1898. Albert's brother John was on the Notre Dame faculty while Albert was a student there.
Professor of Mathematics, University of Notre Dame 1885-1889, mathematics and mechanics, 1890-1892.
Zahm suggested to Octave Chanute to stage an International Conferences on Aerial Navigation in 1893. Zahm acted as Secretary, with Chanute as Chair.
They were a professor of mechanics (physics) at The Catholic University of America, from 1895 apparently until 1913-1914 (but one source says only till 1908).
In 1901, as part of a pioneering aeronautical laboratory, Zahm built a wind tunnel with financing from Hugo Mattullah. It operated until 1908. It has been described as "America's first significant wind tunnel."
They joined the Aero Club of America shortly after it was founded, in 1905.
Zahm's 1911 book Aerial Navigation described the historical development of experimental aircraft that led to functional airplanes.
Testimony in Wrights vs. Curtiss
Zahm testified as an aeronautical expert in the 1910-1913 patent lawsuits by the Wright brothers who alleged patent infringement against inventor and manufacturer Glenn Curtiss. Their testimony took over a month. They testified on behalf of the Curtiss after declining to testify for the Wrights, possibly because the Wrights refused to pay Zahm to appear as an expert witness whereas the Curtiss interests did. Zahm had been on friendly terms with both sides previously but became a long term adversary of the Wrights during and after the trial. They worked closely with Glenn Curtiss on the controversial 1914 flying tests of the (substantially rebuilt and modified) Langley Aerodrome in an attempt to show that Langley's machine had been capable of powered flight with a man aboard before the Wrights' glider was.
Zahm testified that earlier experimental gliders and glider designs and publications, before those of the Wrights, had included a variety of monoplane and biplane designs, with horizontal and vertical rudders, and steering concepts of ailerons and wing warping. There were complex technical issues, notably whether Curtiss's airplanes used a vertical rudder and ailerons in ways that closely matched the patented design of the Wrights. Experts testified on both sides and sometimes contradicted one another on matters of fact. In the end judge John R. Hazel ruled in Feb. 1913 for the Wrights, and on appeal a higher court agreed with this decision in 1914.
Later years
Zahm became the chief research engineer of Curtiss Aeroplane Company in 1914-1915 and then the director of the U.S. Navy's Aerodynamical Laboratory, 1916-1929.
Zahm became the chief of the Aeronautical Division at the Library of Congress from 1929 or 1930 until 1946, and held the Guggenheim Chair of Aeronautics there.
Zahm died in 1954, and was buried in the Community Cemetery, Notre Dame, Indiana.
Honors
Zahm was invited to be a member of the Cosmos Club of Washington, DC, and received their mail there while on the faculty of Catholic University.
Recipient of Laetare medal at University of Notre Dame, 1925.
Awarded the Mendel Medal at Villanova College in 1930 for their pioneering work in scientific aeronautics.
Daniel Guggenheim Chair of Aeronautics in the Library of Congress, 1929-1946.
Publications, bibliography and archival information
More than 100 of their articles and papers were collected in Aeronautical papers 1885-1945 of Albert F. Zahm, volumes I and II.
They wrote the book Aerial Navigation (1911), and a booklet called Early Powerplane Fathers.
Their papers are kept by the University of Notre Dame.

They had a twin brother, Prince Friedrich Christian, who died three weeks after their birth. Prince Franz Wilhelm is a grandson of Prince Joachim of Prussia, the youngest son of Emperor Wilhelm II.
In 2002 Prince Franz Wilhelm with Theodor Tantzen founded the Prinz von Preussen development company, which restores old buildings in Germany. In 2004, with financing from a group of investors, they purchased the Royal Porcelain Manufactury Berlin, saving it from insolvency.
Personal life
Prince Franz Wilhelm married their third cousin once removed, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia, great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, civilly at Dinard on 4 September 1976 and religiously on 22 September 1976 at the Russian Orthodox Chapel in Madrid.

The Zambia Open is a men's professional golf tournament played in Zambia, that has been part of the Sunshine Tour since 1996, and was co-sanctioned by the European-based Challenge Tour from 2001 to 2004. It was also an event on the Challenge Tour between 1991 and 1993, having previously part of the now defunct Safari Circuit.
History
Lusaka Golf Club has traditionally hosted the Zambia Open, but in 2005 a disagreement with the then sponsors, Stanbic, resulted in the cancellation of the tournament, with a new venue being found for the following year. Under a new sponsorship agreement, the 2008 tournament was held at Chainama Hills Golf Club for the first time, with a prize fund of 750,000 rand. From 2006 to 2010, it was contested as a 54-hole tournament. In 2011, it returned to being played over four rounds, 72 holes.
Former winners include 1991 Masters Tournament champion Ian Woosnam and fellow European Ryder Cup players Christy O'Connor Jnr, Sam Torrance, Gordon J. Brand, Tommy Horton and Brian Barnes.

Kensington Terrace was a proposed mixed-use development project in the Kensington neighborhood of San Diego, California. The project was controversial. The controversy stemmed partly because of its size compared to the existing neighborhood buildings, and also due to neighborhood concerns regarding the impact on traffic and parking, and the demolition of two historically-authentic single-family houses.
Due primarily to the downturn in the economy in 2008, the Kensington Terrace project was never built. Instead, beginning in 2014, a new project, named Kensington Commons, was constructed in its place. Kensington Commons has a reduced footprint at 32,000 SF, is three stories high, and has 34 apartments over 10,000 SF of commercial space.
Project plans
Kensington Terrace was a proposed mixed-use development project that would total of commercial, retail, and residential space. The proposed project site is in the Kensington neighborhood of San Diego, California. It would be on the north side of Adams Avenue, east of State Route 15, and the proposed building would occupy the entirety of the block between Marlborough Drive and Edgeware Road. The main building, covering most of the block, would be the first three-story building on that section of Adams Ave. The ground floor would have of retail space, the second floor would have of office space, and the third floor would be six residential condominia offered for sale. Abutting that building and occupying the remainder of the lot would be a set of three-story row houses.
History
Despite approval by the Ken-Tal planning group, the San Diego Planning commission, and the San Diego City Council, the project's opponents state that the three-story, one-block project is too large to fit into the small-neighborhood feel of Kensington where most of the other commercial buildings are only one and two-story. They believe that the traffic study has numerous factual flaws that are under-reporting the impact the project would have upon streets that already are at or below a failing level of service under San Diego's traffic criteria. They are also concerned about the planned demolition of a home that currently sits on the site. The developers, including Sunroad principal Richard Vann and architect Allard Jansen of Allard Jansen Architects in the community of Kensington in San Diego, requested and were granted a height variance that allows them to build eight feet higher than allowed in the CN-1-3 zone. Residents fear that this will set a precedent for future development patterns. They filed an appeal with the San Diego City Council to require the city to perform a full Environmental Impact Report as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The city council went against the advice of the city attorney's office and approved the project with a 5-2 vote. One Councilmember who voted to grant the appeal, Donna Frye, said in explaining their vote, "This is the height buster project." Residents pledged to file suit under CEQA to force the full EIR to be completed.
The Roy and Dora Bennett house proposed for demolition is a 1923 Colonial Revival. This house was identified during the 1996 Mid-City historical resources inventory as a contributing resource to a potential Kensington Historical District. It is located in the original 1910 Kensington Park subdivision, one of San Diego's oldest 'streetcar suburbs'. The house is adjacent to the old trolley line and is a fine example of a small home from the early years of the Better Homes in America Movement, which was spearheaded by Herbert Hoover when they were Secretary of Commerce under President Warren Harding. Under the California Environmental Quality Act, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be prepared when an historically significant resource is proposed for demolition.
The "Heart of Kensington", a neighborhood non-profit organization, filed a lawsuit against the project on March 5, 2008. According to papers filed with the Superior Court, the group seeks judgment on several points, including:
1. That this Court find that by making the final approvals Defendant has not proceeded in a manner required by law, has not adopted requisite findings, and/or the substantial evidence does not support its decisions;
2. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus declaring that one or more of the decision(s) rendered by Defendant on or about February 5, 2008, and any additional resolution(s) of Defendant relating to, or dependent upon the same, are null and void and of no force and/or legal effect
3. That this Court order Defendant to vacate and set aside each of the decisions made on or about February 5, 2008, and each of the resolutions, administrative approvals, permits, and any other decisions of Defendant with respect thereto;
4. That there be issued a writ of mandamus ordering Defendant to prepare an EIR within a reasonable date from the issuance of said writ of mandate, in the event the Real Parties or other successor owner/develop wish to pursue the Project.
5. That until such time as Plaintiff above's claims can be adjudicated by this Court, Defendant and Real Parties be enjoined, restrained and/or Defendant's February 5, 2008 decisions be stayed from taking effect to preserve the status quo, existing structures and environmental qualities so as to prevent frustration of Plaintiff's and the public's rightful claims and right to judicial review...
The San Diego city attorney's office, who has advised the city council that state law requires a full EIR for the project, has not commented on the pending litigation.
In April 2008 the parties agreed to a compromise that would allow a smaller version of the project to proceed. As part of the settlement, the development consortium agreed to measure to reduce the physical size and traffic impacts for the project. They also agreed to set aside a minimum of 33% of the retail space of the building for non-national chain tenants. In May 2008, demolition of the old structures at the site was completed. New development began in early 2014 and the project is expected to be occupied by the end of 2014.

Peabody Hall is a mixed-use academic and residential building located on the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The original building, known as Seminary Hall, was built in 1855, and was the central building of Western College for Women. That building burned down in 1860 and was rebuilt the following year, only to become damaged by an 1871 fire. Rebuilt again that same year, the building was renamed Peabody Hall, after Helen Peabody the first head of Western College, in 1905. Peabody Hall is one of two residential buildings on Miami's Western Campus still used for their original purposes. It is one of 15 contributing buildings to the Western Female Seminary National Historic District.
History
Peabody Hall is located on Western College of Miami's campus. Western College was founded in 1853 and it modeled the Mt. Holyoke of Massachusetts “system” with its low cost yet high-quality education for women. Helen Peabody, whom Peabody hall is named after, was principal of the Western Female Seminary when it opened for classes on September 20 of 1855. In 1904 Western went from being named A College and Seminary for Women to “The Western College for Women.” From the Western College Memorial Archives website, it states that “For the next fifty years, Western remained a general liberal arts college, primarily under the presidency of William W. Boyd. With the arrival of President Herrick B. Young in 1954, an international focus began. Many international students and faculty were recruited, international travel seminars were instituted, and a global emphasis was added to the curriculum.” Another major decision for the college came in 1971 was men were admitted to Western college as well. Due to financial difficulties, Western College closed in 1974 and the physical facilities merged with Miami University, thus where it stands today. In this year of the Miami University-Western College merger, Peabody was remodeled.
Peabody Hall burnt down in 1861, was rebuilt, then burnt down once again in 1871, and was once again rebuilt. From an unknown source and author, but obtained from the Western College Memorial Archives is a declaration for “Present Properties Needing Change or Improvement.” One of the buildings that addressed a plea to improve the buildings safety was Peabody. The short document quotes, “It is a large dignified structure of high ceilings and wide halls, with an atmosphere which it is desirable to preserve. However, it is not a fireproof building; students are forced to climb its high flights of stairs several times a day—a situation not often conducive to the physical well-being of all young women. And so even though parts of the building can continue, with alteration, to serve admirably for administrative and academic purposes, it is no longer suitable for dormitory use. The elimination of the housing use of Peabody Hall will necessitate the erection of new dormitory facilities.”
Helen Peabody
From the Western College Memorial Archives, “Helen Peabody was born in New Hampshire in 1826. They were the youngest of fourteen children. Helen Peabody graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1848 and remained as a teacher for five years. They moved to St. Louis to be with their brother; however, in 1855 they were encouraged to become the first principal of the Western Female Seminary. Having been a student of Mary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke, Miss Peabody was qualified to establish a "Mount Holyoke in the West." They were principal from 1855 to 1887 when they took a leave of absence for a year. They presided over the 1888 commencement and announced their retirement after thirty-seven years at Western. Miss Peabody moved to California where they died in 1905.”  They are buried in the Oxford Cemetery.
Peabody today
Today, Peabody Hall is only one of the three buildings once used to house students of Western still housing classrooms and offices. Along with administrative offices in the building lies a theatre where children and adult plays were once presented. Student rooms and utilities are all modern and the parlors and guest rooms are furnished with 19th-century antiques. In 1996 an article was released in The Cincinnati Enquirer discussing that the renovation of the 125 –year-old hall was nearly complete. The renovation was a $7 million project. The article goes on to describe how although the building looks as if something from a Dickens novel on the outside, the inside now models everything of the 21st century with its new rooms carved out, a computer room and video production studio added, and most room being hard-wired to a computer network. But to still keep some of the building's character from the 1800s when it was only a part of Western College, designers pick particular paint colors and wallpapers to achieve the historical accuracy. In this year the “new Peabody” also developed a renovated Leonard Theatre, the Windate Writing Center and the Western College Alumni Association Memorial Archives. To this day, witnesses of Peabody Hall claim the building is haunted. Workers on site during the renovation claim that they saw the “ghost” of Helen Peabody. Today, Peabody Hall still makes list of the top most haunted buildings on Miami University's campus.

The Austrian Southeastern Railway or Imperial-Royal Southeastern Railway () or kkSöStB was a state railway in Austria-Hungary, which was formed when the Hungarian Central Railway was (Ungarische Zentralbahn, UZB) was nationalised.
History
On 15 July 1846 the UZB opened the lines from Pest to Waitzen (now Vac), Pest to Szolnok and Marchegg to Pressburg (now Bratislava).
The UZB was nationalised on 7 March 1850 and became the Imperial Royal Southeastern State Railway.
The lines from Pressburg to Waitzen and Cegléd via Félegyháza to Szeged begun by the HZB were completed by the SöStB in 1854.
On 1 January 1855 the SöStB was privatised and became part of the StEG.

Wandering Rocks is a 1967 steel sculpture by Tony Smith, made in an edition of five plus one artist's proof. The Minimalist work comprises five different polyhedral elements painted black.
Description
The five elements of the sculpture have different size and shapes, based on tetrahedrons and octahedrons, with faceted surfaces painted with a semi-gloss black, and are individually named "Crocus", "Dud", "Shaft", "Slide", and "Smomhawk". They measure from to in height and weigh from to . Several of the editions are exhibited in public, typically installed outdoors on a grassed area. The elements have no fixed positions, and their relative positions and orientations may vary according to the requirements of the specific location, so each installation is different.
The work was first created as a full-size plywood mock-up and then replicated in painted metal. The sculpture may allude to the structure of molecules and crystals, or the Japanese rock garden of Ryōan-ji in Kyoto. As Smith described it: "The Rocks were really conceived as one piece, although I didn't think of them as having a fixed spatial relationship to one another. They did, however, have a temporal sequence. I thought of each piece as having an identity but also as a constituting part of a group. In this group, positions were thought of as changing."
Editions
The work was created in an edition of five, plus one artist's proof:
Wandering Rocks (AP) has been displayed in Seattle, Washington, since 2007, and is now at the Olympic Sculpture Park, donated to the Seattle Art Museum by the Virginia and Bagley Wright Collection in 2016 for the museum's 75th anniversary

Felix Kolawole Bajomo (Chief Kola Bajomo) (born 7 January 1947) is a Nigerian politician who was elected a member of the Senate for the Ogun West constituency of Ogun State in April 2007.
Background
Felix Kolawole Bajomo was born on 7 January 1947.  They are a fellow of the Association of Cost and Management Accountants (ACMA) and associate member of the Association of Chartered Stockbrokers (ACS). Before entering politics, they were managing director, Commercial Trust Bank; Executive Director, Union Bank; Executive Director, Savannah Bank, and Chairman of the Federal Housing Authority (2005–2006).
They were at one time Chairman of Gateway Hotels.
They also held the position of President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN).
In 2003, Bajomo ran as the Alliance for Democracy candidate for the Ogun West senate seat, but was defeated by Iyabo Anisulowo, former Minister of State for Education between 1995 and 1998 under the Sanni Abacha administration.
In January 2005, Bajomo switched to the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
Senate career
In April 2007, they ran for the Senate on the PDP ticket and was elected for the Ogun West constituency. They were appointed to committees on Privatization, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Establishment & Public Service, Banking, Insurance & Other Financial Institutions and Appropriation.
In March 2009, they were involved in a scrap between Ogun State Governor Gbenga Daniel and Ogun senators Iyabo Obasanjo-Bello and Lekan Mustapha.
The dispute dragged on into July, with Yoruba Elders backing Governor Daniel while four representatives and the two senators remained in opposition and failing to attend a meeting when president Yar'Adua visited the state.
In May 2009, Bajomo was among ten senators who made a controversial all-expenses-paid trip to Ghana, where they were rumoured to have been influenced by oil companies at a seminar on the Petroleum Industry Bill. The Senate ordered a full investigation into the matter by its Ethics, Code of Conduct and Public Petitions Committee.
However, there were delays in issuing the committee report.
In September 2009, they called for the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other economic experts to inject money into the economy. Speaking about initial public offerings (IPOs) before the recent financial crisis, where many people paid inflated prices, they said that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have dealt with those responsible, but not the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission unless there was clear evidence of fraud.
Earlier they had stated that the N420 billion used by the CBN to bail out five banks did not require appropriation by the National Assembly.

Arturia is a genus of calcareous sponge in the family Clathrinidae which contains 14 species. It is named after Arthur Dendy, a prominent researcher of calcareous sponges. It was renamed Arturia in 2017 because the name Arthuria was already assigned to a genus of molluscs.
Description and biology
Calcinea in which the cormus comprised a typical clathroid body. A stalk may be present. The skeleton contains regular (equiangular and equiradiate) triactines and tetractines. However, tetractines are rarer. Diactines may be added. Asconoid aquiferous system.
Arturia canariensis, for example, is a filter feeder, sieving plankton and other organic material out of the current of water as it passes through the ostia. Both asexual reproduction by budding and sexual reproduction take place in Arturia canariensis. As in other species, each sponge is a hermaphrodite. Sperm is liberated into the sea and some is drawn into other sponges with the water current that passes through them. Fertilisation is then internal and the eggs are brooded in the ascon tubes of the sponge until they hatch. The free-swimming larvae are expelled through the osculi and disperse with the currents. After a few days they settle on the seabed and develop into juvenile sponges.
Species
There are 14 species in the Arturia genus.

Reception
In a 1985 review, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times commended the script and Chaplin's performance and the direction, noting it "captures the special Cornish atmosphere of the piece perfectly." O'Connor wrote "The problem with this psychological study is that dramatically it has no clearly defined resolution." They summarized the series as "a fairly absorbing treatment" but warned those looking for a "tidy" ending would be disappointed.

An organic base is an organic compound which acts as a base. Organic bases are usually, but not always, proton acceptors. They usually contain nitrogen atoms, which can easily be protonated. For example, amines or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds have a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom and can thus act as proton acceptors. Examples include:
pyridine
alkanamines, such as methylamine
imidazole
benzimidazole
histidine
guanidine
phosphazene bases
hydroxides of quaternary ammonium cations or some other organic cations
Factors affecting alkalinity
Most organic bases are considered to be weak. Many factors can affect the strength of the compounds. One such factor is the inductive effect. A simple explanation of the term would state that electropositive atoms (such as carbon groups) attached in close proximity to the potential proton acceptor have an "electron-releasing" effect, such that the positive charge acquired by the proton acceptor is distributed over other adjacent atoms in the chain. The converse is also possible as alleviation of alkalinity: electronegative atoms or species (such as fluorine or the nitro group) will have an "electron-withdrawal" effect and thereby reduce the basicity. To this end, trimethylamine is a more potent base than merely ammonia, due to the inductive effect of the methyl groups allowing the nitrogen atom to more readily accept a proton and become a cation being much greater than that of the hydrogen atoms. In guanidines, the protonated form (guanidinium) has three resonance structures, giving it increased stability and making guanidines stronger bases.
Phosphazene bases also contain phosphorus and are, in general, more alkaline than standard amines and nitrogen-based heterocyclics. Protonation takes place at the nitrogen atom, not the phosphorus atom to which the nitrogen is double-bonded.
Hydroxide donors
Some organic bases, such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, or choline hydroxide are hydroxide donors rather than proton acceptors like the above compounds. However, they are not always stable. Choline hydroxide, for example, is metastable and slowly breaks down to release trimethylamine.

Golden Salamander is a 1950 British adventure film directed by Ronald Neame and starring Trevor Howard, Anouk Aimée and Herbert Lom. It won an award at the 1950 Locarno International Film Festival. It is based on Victor Canning's 1949 novel The Golden Salamander. about a British archaeologist in North Africa who runs afoul of a crime syndicate.
It was shot at Pinewood Studios, with sets designed by the art director John Bryan. Extensive location shooting took place in Tunisia, including the ruins of Carthage. The score was composed by William Alwyn who incorporated Arabic themes into their work. It was given an American release by Eagle-Lion the following year.
Plot
Sent by the British Museum to take charge of the shipping to London of important artefacts, David Redfern's route along an isolated Tunisian road is blocked by a landslide. During a heavy rain they make their way to the town, but not before witnessing a gun-running operation. At the café in the town they meet Anna, a young Frenchwoman who with their brother Max had moved to North Africa during the wartime German occupation of France. Realising that Max is mixed up in the gun-running, Redfern decides to remain silent about what they have witnessed and concentrate instead on their job of removing the artefacts as quickly as they can.
As they spend time in Anna's company, Redfern falls in love with them and decides to help Max escape from the criminal existence in which they have become trapped and send them to Paris where as a talented painter they can make a fresh start. However Max is killed by their associate on the way to Tunis.
Realising that Redfern knows too much about their operations, Serafis, the head of the criminal outfit, and their henchman Rankl plan to kill them and make it look like an accident. With the help of a friend, Redfern is able to escape. Tracked by their enemies during the town's annual boar hunt, they manage to demonstrate to the authorities that the gang have murdered Max.

In molecular biology, the carboxypeptidase A inhibitor family is a family of proteins which is represented by the well-characterised metallocarboxypeptidase A inhibitor (MCPI) from potatoes, which belongs to the MEROPS inhibitor family I37, clan IE. It inhibits metallopeptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family M14, carboxypeptidase A. In Russet Burbank potatoes, it is a mixture of approximately equal amounts of two polypeptide chains containing 38 or 39 amino acid residues. The chains differ in their amino terminal sequence only and are resistant to fragmentation by proteases. The structure of the complex between bovine carboxypeptidase A and the 39-amino-acid carboxypeptidase A inhibitor from potatoes has been determined at 2.5-Angstrom resolution.
The potato inhibitor is synthesised as a precursor, having a 29 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide, a 27 amino acid pro-peptide, the 39 amino acid mature inhibitor region and a 7 amino acid C-terminal extension. The 7 amino acid C-terminal extension is involved in inhibitor inactivation and may be required for targeting to the vacuole where the mature active inhibitor accumulates.
The N-terminal region and the mature inhibitor are weakly related to other solananaceous proteins found in this family, from potato, tomato and henbane, which have been incorrectly described as metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitors.

Salix repens, the creeping willow, is a small, shrubby species of willow in the family Salicaceae, growing up to 1.5metres in height. Found amongst sand dunes and heathlands, it is a polymorphic species, with a wide range of variants. In the UK, at least, these range from small, prostrate, hairless plants at one end of the spectrum to taller, erect or ascending silky-leaved shrubs at the other. This wide variation in form has resulted in numerous synonyms.
Distribution
The plant has a Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate range, and is widely distributed around the coasts of western and northern Europe.
In the UK, the prostrate forms (ssp. argentea and ssp. repens) are characteristically found on sand dunes, growing close to the water table in dune slacks, as well as in coastal heaths and acid grassland, as well as being found further inland on heaths and moorland. The erect form (var. fusca) occurs in fens. The species becomes more confined to moist or wet habitats in the southern and eastern parts of its UK range, and has been recorded from sea level up to (in East Perthshire).
Ecology
Dunes containing Salix repens are recognised as being of ecological importance by the EU Habitats Directive. Over 132 Natura 2000 sites are designated for this habitat type. As the water table lowers within the slack, these Salix-dominated habitats (termed Salicion arenariae) may develop either into mesophilous (neither wet nor dry), or xerophilous (dry) communities. The former may contain species such as Pyrola rotundifolia, Viola canina and Monotropa hypopitys; the latter containing Carlina vulgaris and Thalictrum minus.
Salix repens provides shelter to other species of plant and animal. Its soft, fluffy seed hairs provide nesting material for songbirds, whilst in autumn there is often a rich assemblage of unusual fungus species growing in its vicinity.
Should the dune slack that the plant inhabits become inundated by an advancing dune, it is able to adapt and change its growth form from erect to prostrate. Losing its erect habit, the plant is able to creep horizontally along the front of the advancing dune and survive the changing conditions.
Studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungal associations may assist Salix repens in expanding the ecological niches it can occupy.
Hybrids
Creeping willow may hybridise with other Salix species, typically including goat willow (S. caprea) and downy willow (S. lapponum). One especially rare hybrid (S. x angusensis) was discovered on Ainsdale Nature Reserve, Lancashire in 1993. It is a hybrid between three Salix species: S. cinerea ssp. oleifolia x S. repens var. argentea X S. viminalis.

Steve Swindells (born 21 November 1952) is an English singer-songwriter, keyboardist, party organizer, club promoter and journalist.
Life and career
Early life
Swindells grew up in the Bath and Bristol area, dropping out of art college to play keyboards with the rock band Squidd (which was put together by drummer and fantasy artist, Rodney Matthews). Relocating to London in 1973 and living in squats, they recorded their debut solo album, Messages for RCA in 1974. Produced by their manager Mark Edwards, Swindells felt the production quality to be poor, despite the presence of quality musicians. A follow-up album Swindells' Swallow was recorded, mastered and test pressings manufactured, but the deal fell through.
Departed from their manager, Swindells joined Pilot, recording the 1977 album Two's a Crowd. In 1978 they joined a reformed Hawkwind, renamed as Hawklords, for the 25 Years On album and tour.
1980s
In 1980 they recorded another solo album, Fresh Blood, released by ATCO, but was dropped when it failed to hit sufficient sales, despite reaching No. 3 in the US airplay charts. Swindells would go on contribute songs to Roger Daltrey on "Martyrs and Madmen" and "Treachery" for Daltrey's 1982 compilation album Best Bits, before temporarily turning their attention away from the music business. In 1983, Swindells switched careers to club promoting and party organising.
1990s
In the early 1990s, they decided to re-invent themselves as a journalist, writing the internet column for Time Out under the name Spyder for many years, as well as a gadget/lifestyle colourmn for Attitude, before becoming the editor of the magazine's website. Throughout their career changes, Swindells continued to compose and perform music.
2000s
In 2003, Swindells played keyboards and sang lead vocals in the band Danmingo together with Jerry Richards, Jon Moss and Winston Blissett. Swindells wrote all of the songs, apart from two band collaborations and one co-write with Stephen Meade (aka Shanks) and the late Kent Brainerd. As of 10 December 2013, Swindells had been number 1 on the Reverb Nation Singer-songwriter Chart For London for several days. They then released the double download DanMingo album under their own name.
In 2009, Swindells was instrumental in the formation (or reformation) of the Hawklords, a musical collective of ex-Hawkwind members, playing a special show in memory of artist Barney Bubbles. The show was advertised as a benefit concert 'with a view to setting up a foundation/annual award for innovative album cover design, and a memorial plaque for him'. However, there is no evidence that the proceeds of the concert were used for any of these purposes.
2010–present
In 2010, Hawklords performed a mini tour of the UK. In 2011, the group were active in several appearances across the UK, and a touring line-up underwent a full national tour in October 2011. In 2012, they announced they were working on an album, titled We Are One. In May 2012, via the band's Facebook page, it was announced that, due to health reasons, Swindells would not be participating in the planned 2012 tour and they subsequently terminated their involvement with the band.
Swindells re-discovered two 'lost' albums from 1980: The Invisible Man, and Treachery. They were released on Flicknife Records on 27 February 2012. Their 1980 album Fresh Blood was released on CD for the first time with the label Atomhenge/Cherry Red in August 2009. Their 1974 album Messages, along with a bonus CD of the hitherto unreleased Swindells' Swallow, was re-released by Esoteric Recordings/Atomhenge on 26 November 2009.
Early in 2012, Swindells put together an ad-hoc, 'all star' jamming band called The Plastic Sturgeons. Special guest musicians have included Guy Pratt and Dale Davis. There have only been two gigs to date which were recorded by Roy Weard. As of 10 December 2013, The Plastic Sturgeons have been number 1 in The Reverb Nation London Jam Chart for several weeks.

Simon C. Page is a British graphic designer based in London.  They are most known for creating geometric graphic designs. They created promotional posters for the International Year of Astronomy and for the International Year of Chemistry.
In 2009, they won the Intel Digital Artist: Stars of Tomorrow award.
Early life and education
Page was born and raised in the United Kingdom. According to Page, they were interested in graphic design since they were a child. However, after school they felt that they were more interested in Applied Mathematics and pursued a degree in that discipline. They hold a degree in Applied Mathematics from Queen Mary University of London.
Career
After completing their education, Page joined a property company in a finance position and later got involved in programming and database development. There, they had to create corporate presentations that got them involved in graphic design. In 2007, they participated in a poster design competition that they won.
Towards the end of 2009, Page learned that 2009 was the International Year of Astronomy and designed several posters as a personal project. When the International Year of Astronomy organization saw the posters, they contacted page to seek permission to use them. They granted the permission and the posters were used in promotional events.
In 2011, they designed 10 posters for the International Year of Chemistry. These posters were later used by the International Year of Chemistry in an official capacity. Each of the posters was inspired by a prominent person in the field of chemistry. They designed a poster inspired by Marie Curie's work, which was used to promote a screening of a film about their life. The International Year of Chemistry also offered the poster prints on their website.
As of 2009, Page creates logos, designs and editorial illustrations for organisations and sells prints on their website. They have also worked on designing T-shirts. In May 2012 Simon created their first furniture designs with the launch of their Cuben Space Io Armchair and new wallpaper that was displayed at the International Contemporary Furniture Fare in 2012.
In the media
Page's International Year of Astronomy posters were featured in The New York Times Style Magazine that wrote "The result is a beautiful exercise in conceptual minimalism, with a clear geometric bent that betrays Page's math-nerd origins" and Wired wrote about the posters, "with today's artists' renderings of space becoming increasingly detailed, realistic and flashy, these posters truly stand out."
The New York Times Style Magazine also featured the posters page created for International Year of Chemistry and wrote, "in an excessively cluttered aesthetic environment, Page practices the elegantly reductive, Swiss and Bauhaus-influenced design that they believe appeals to the scientific and non-scientific communities."

The women's light heavyweight (65 kg/143 lbs) K-1 category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the third heaviest of the female K-1 tournaments. There were just three women present at the competition, all based in Europe. Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under K-1 rules.
Due to the low level of competitors, one of the women received a bye straight through to the final. In the end it was Belarus's Ala Ivashkevich who won gold, defeating Russian Elena Solareva in the final. The tournaments only other fighter, Jelena Djuric from Serbia, received the bronze medal.

Ryland Louis Bouchard (born October 16, 1979) is an American vocalist and musician who has gone through many distinct phases, in which they have incorporated aspects of folk, electronica, jazz, psychedelia and avant-garde rock. Previously known as the Kill Rock Stars recording artist The Robot Ate Me, has been labeled by Daytrotter as "One of the most creative and potentially scary minds of our generation" and by Spin Magazine as "purely artistic, baffling, and almost completely uncommercial".
Biography
Bouchard was born on October 16, 1979, in Los Angeles, California.
The Robot Ate Me
In 2002 they released They Ate Themselves, their first record as The Robot Ate Me and played their first shows in San Diego opening for notable touring acts such as Daniel Johnston, Tegan and Sara, Metric, Stars and The Blackheart Procession. Skyscraper magazine described their first release as "Quite possibly the year's most arresting experimental pop record, They Ate Themselves is a dizzyingly vibrant trip through death and multi-layered dissonance".
The controversial and highly experimental On Vacation was released in 2004 in which Adam Gnade declared "It's not even music outside the margins. Here the margins were never there, and if they were to encroach, The Robot Ate Me would probably up and croak." Punk Planet followed suit describing the album as "A hypnotic two-disc record that will score your twisted nightmares and fanciful dreams." Splendid summarized "It is impossible to understand a Robot Ate Me album from a written description."
After the release of On Vacation in 2004 they signed with Kill Rock Stars and toured the US heavily the next few years playing close to 600 shows in the following three years. Their shows relied heavily on audience participation and were known for being fairly unpredictable. As part of their shows they would sometimes be dragged across the floor by attendees, wear masks, scream loudly, have the audience play the supporting instruments for their songs without rehearsal, or abruptly leave after playing one song.
The 2005 release of Carousel Waltz brought a set of minimal American folk songs. The album was lauded by Babysue as a "strangely compelling and uplifting vision of how love affects a person. Soft and focused, these unusual tunes are simultaneously accessible and peculiar. The Robot Ate Me remains one of the most unique acts on the planet. Brimming with credible substance, Carousel Waltz is yet another killer album from an artist who just keeps getting better and better with time..."
2006 brought the avant-garde Good World, which consisted mostly of sparse clarinet lines mixed with minimal percussion and falsetto vocals by Bouchard. Pitchforkmedia asked "Has someone bludgeoned frontman Ryland Bouchard?". And Tinymixtapes declared: "Not since the glory days of punk has an album come and gone so fast and left one with more questions than answers."
Solo work
In 2008 Bouchard released Seeds a hand-crafted limited edition box set with close to two hours of music (divided between an A-Sides CD/vinyl and a B-Sides CD), a DVD of super 8 videos, four 7" vinyl records, letter-pressed lyrics, a hand silk-screened shirt, bag, poster, and a set of illustrations by their longtime collaborator Daniel Gibson. Only 500 copies of the set were made.
In early 2009, Bouchard completed a Take-Away Show video session for La Blogothèque where they performed songs from Seeds.
The 2009 double vinyl release Cowbirds and Cuckoos was released on November 15, 2009, by Swim Slowly Records. The release consists of two hand screen-printed records and photography by Ryland Bouchard. In February 2010 Swim Slowly Records released a digital EP "Better This Than Nothing", a collection of B-Sides from "Cowbirds and Cuckoos".
Super 8
With the release of "Seeds" in 2008 Bouchard also included a DVD worth of videos shot exclusively on Super 8 film. In 2009 they also released a series of Super 8 videos for the "Cowbirds and Cuckoos" release on YouTube. Using mostly a Braun Nizo S580 and Kodak Ektachrome 64T film the videos include footage from various locations throughout Europe, Mexico and the United States. Completed without digital effects the films rely heavily on time lapse, slow motion and other experimental filmmaking techniques.

Sir Basil Urwin Spence, (13 August 1907 – 19 November 1976) was a Scottish architect, most notably associated with Coventry Cathedral in England and the Beehive in New Zealand, but also responsible for numerous other buildings in the Modernist/Brutalist style.
Training
Spence was born in Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India, the son of Urwin Archibald Spence, an assayer with the Royal Mint. They were educated at the John Connon School, operated by the Bombay Scottish Education Society, and was then sent back to Scotland to attend George Watson's College in Edinburgh from 1919–1925. They enrolled at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) in 1925, studying architecture, where they secured a maintenance scholarship on the strength of the "unusual brilliance" of their work. They won several prizes at the college, and meanwhile carried out paid work drawing architectural perspectives for practising architects including Leslie Grahame-Thomson, Reginald Fairlie and Frank Mears.
In 1929–1930, they spent a year as an assistant, along with William Kininmonth, in the London office of Sir Edwin Lutyens, whose work was to have a profound influence on Spence's style, where they worked on designs for the Viceroy's House in New Delhi, India. While in London they attended evening classes at the Bartlett School of Architecture under A. E. Richardson. Returning to ECA in 1930 for their final year of studies, they were appointed a junior lecturer, despite the fact that they were still a student. They continued to teach at ECA until 1939.
Early career
After graduating in 1931, Kininmonth and Spence set up in practice together, based in a room within the office of Rowand Anderson & Paul (at that time having Arthur Forman Balfour Paul as sole partner), in Rutland Square, Edinburgh. The practice was founded on two residential commissions which Kininmonth had obtained that year. Spence also received commissions to illustrate other architects' work, including the Southside Garage, on Causewayside, Edinburgh, in an Art Deco style (although credited to Spence their name appears nowhere on the official warrant drawings and only appears as a signature on the artist's perspective).
In 1934 Spence married, and the Kininmonth & Spence practice merged with Rowand Anderson & Paul. Balfour Paul died in 1938, leaving Kininmonth and Spence in charge of the renamed Rowand Anderson & Paul & Partners. Spence's work was now concentrated on exhibition design, including three pavilions for the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow, and country houses.
The first two of these, Broughton Place at Broughton near Biggar, and Quothquan in Lanarkshire, were executed in traditional Scottish styles at the client's request. The third was entirely modern. Gribloch was designed for John Colville, grandson of the founder of Colville's Iron Works, and their American wife. It was designed in a modernist Regency style, with assistance from Perry Duncan, an American architect hired by the Colvilles when Spence was too busy with exhibition work to progress the project.
Army service
In 1939, Spence was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Camouflage Training and Development Centre of the British Army. They were initially based at Farnham in Surrey, and took part in the D-Day landings in 1944. They were demobilised in September 1945, having reached the rank of major and been mentioned in despatches twice.
Postwar career
Spence returned to Rowand Anderson & Paul & Partners briefly, before setting up their own practice, Basil Spence & Partners, with Bruce Robertson. They were awarded an OBE in 1948 for their work in exhibition design, work which they continued with the Sea and Ships Pavilion for the 1951 Festival of Britain. That year they opened a London office, moving there permanently from 1953. A second office was opened in 1956 at Canonbury, which became the creative hub of the practice. Spence was a External Professor of Architecture at the University of Leeds from 1955 to 1957 and from 1958 to 1960 they were the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects.
Coventry Cathedral
On 14 November 1940, Coventry's Anglican Cathedral was extensively damaged by German bombing, a year into World War II.
In 1944, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott submitted a design proposal to rebuild the cathedral but this was rejected by the Royal Fine Arts Commission. In 1950, a competition was launched to find the most suitable design from a Commonwealth of Nations architect. Over 200 entries were received, and Spence's radical design was chosen. Work began in 1956 and the structure was completed in 1962. Spence was knighted in 1960 for their work at Coventry, while the cathedral was still being built.
On 23 February 2012 the Royal Mail released a stamp featuring Coventry Cathedral as part of its "Britons of Distinction" series.
Later work
In 1959, Spence secured two important commissions, for the British Embassy in Rome (completed 1971), and for the Hyde Park Cavalry Barracks in London (completed 1970). They were also responsible for designing the high-rise Hutchesontown C housing in Glasgow. These were intended to replace the notorious slum tenements in the Gorbals area of the city. A combination of social deprivation and exclusion in the relevant areas, coupled to poor execution of their designs meant that the developments created as many problems as they solved, and led to their demolition in 1993.
Spence was also responsible for modernist buildings on The Canongate in Edinburgh, opposite the new Scottish Parliament and in view of Holyrood Palace. This area is named Brown's Close and was listed in 2008. Other work in the 1960s included the concept design for the executive wing of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings in Wellington, nicknamed "The Beehive", Edinburgh University Library, and Abbotsinch Airport (now Glasgow Airport).
In 1960, Spence designed Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh's Braid Hills area (based on the same angled fin concept as found at Coventry Cathedral). They also designed Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which was unveiled in Snowdonia, north Wales, in 1968.
Also in 1964, with support from the Nuffield Foundation, the University of Southampton built a theatre on its campus. Spence worked closely with Sir Richard Southern as consultant for the interior design and layout of the theatre.
The Spence practice was rearranged in 1964, with the Canonbury office being renamed Sir Basil Spence OM RA, and the second London office Spence Bonnington & Collins. The Edinburgh office was also renamed for its partners, Spence Glover & Ferguson. From 1961 to 1968, Spence was Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy.
Through the 1970s, Spence continued to work on public and private commissions, universities and offices including Aston University Library and Management Centre. Their last work was for an unexecuted cultural centre for Bahrain, which they worked on during illness in 1976. Some of their final commissions were built after their death; for example, their design for the new Glasgow Royal Infirmary was completed in 1981.
Spence died in November 1976 at their home at Yaxley, Suffolk and was buried at nearby Thornham Parva.
Their practice, Spence, Ferguson and Glover, continued until 1992 before being disbanded.
Assessment
In 2006, they were the subject of a BBC Scotland documentary, Rebuilding Basil Spence, which revised their place in 20th-century British architecture and asked why they had been for so long overlooked. In 1993 Spence's Hutchesontown C complex was listed by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of Scotland's sixty key monuments of the post-war years, in the same year as it was demolished.
In August 2010, English Heritage recommended that the Spence-designed Sydenham School be given Grade II listed status: the building was due to be demolished to make way for a new building. However the government's decision was that the school was not of sufficient merit to warrant listing.

The American Samoa national rugby union team, also known as the "Talavalu", represents American Samoa in international rugby union.
The Talavalu is the name of a traditional Samoan war weapon, originally carved out of ironwood. As can be seen on the right side of the American Samoa Rugby Union logo, it resembles a club but has eight diamond-shaped teeth carved on one edge. Translated, "tala" is teeth, and "valu" is eight.
History
National development of rugby union in American Samoa has been overshadowed by the popularity of American football since the 1970s. Unlike neighbouring Samoa, American Samoa has had limited international rugby competition. Most of American Samoa's matches have been played at the South Pacific Games.
American Samoa's first international 15's match was at the 1983 South Pacific Games in Apia, where they lost 55–0 to Western Samoa (as it was then called). They did not make the final stages of that tournament. American Samoa fared much better at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Port Moresby, notching up wins against the Solomon Islands and French Polynesia. While they lost 34–7 to Western Samoa in the final, the American Samoans won the rugby 15's silver medal.
The South Pacific Games (now called the Pacific Games) subsequently switched to hosting rugby 7s in preference to rugby 15s, and the ASRU, while still eligible for the FORU Oceania Cup, turned more of its attention toward the seven-a-side form of the game. American Samoa competed at the Pacific Games Rugby 7s in 2011, and the Oceania Rugby 7s in 2011 and 2012.
In 2015 the Talavalu made their first appearance at the Oceania Rugby Cup. They won their first match against the Solomon Islands 30–15. In their second game, they lost to Papua New Guinea 36–22. Their third game against Tahiti was also a loss, 8–20. The Talavalu's finished the tournament in third place.
Diaspora
Due to limited opportunities at home, notable American Samoan players have been selected in other national teams instead of American Samoa. Frank Solomon was the pioneer, playing for in the 1930s; and Jerome Kaino was a key member of New Zealand's Rugby World Cup-winning teams in 2011 and 2015.
American Samoans that have represented include Mose Timoteo, Valenise Malifa, the Suniula brothers (Andrew, Roland and Shalom) and Junior Sifa.

The March Route of Rochambeau's Army: Hutchinson Road is a historic road section in Andover, Connecticut. The section of Hutchinson Road, laid out in the early 18th century and formerly an alignment of United States Route 6, formed part of the 1781-82 march routes of Rochambeau's army which contributed to American victory in the American Revolutionary War. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
Description and history
Hutchinson Road is located in western Andover, paralleling the modern alignment of US 6, which runs roughly northwest to southeast a short way to the west. A former alignment of US 6, it is accessed from Hendee Road, extending both north and south to dead ends shortly before reaching US 6. The historic section of the roadway consists of the portion south of Hendee Road. It is an asphalt-paved roadway, with a right of way wide, lined for most of its distance by stone walls. The road section is about long, and is lined with electric utility poles. The segment includes just one building: White's Tavern, which is also historically associated with the Rochambeau march. The road section is one of multiple properties along the march route evaluated in a 2001 study.
The road section is part of a road laid out in the early 18th century, connecting the capital at Hartford with the important communities of Lebanon and Norwich in the southeastern part of the state. This road is identified on maps prepared by French engineers who determined the Rochambeau army's march route in 1781. White's Tavern is known to have quartered French officers during both the southward march in 1781 and the northward march in 1782. The army encamped in the area north of Hendee Road on the 1782 march. The road remained a major regional through route, with improvements made in both the 19th and 20th centuries, until the new alignment of US 6 bypassed it. The area's landscape continues to retain an appearance reminiscent of the 1780s.

Alejandro Fernando Amenábar Cantos (born March 31, 1972) is a Spanish-Chilean film director, screenwriter and composer. They have won nine Goyas—including a Goya Award for Best Director for their 2001 film The Others—and two European Film Awards, among other honors. They have written (or co-written) the screenplays to all seven of their films and composed almost all of their soundtracks.
Early life
Amenábar was born in Santiago, Chile, to a Chilean father, Hugo Ricardo Amenábar and a Spanish mother, Josefina Cantos. They own both Chilean and Spanish citizenship. Their father worked as a technician at General Electric, while their mother decided to stay at home and take care of the children. Alejandro is the younger of two brothers; their older brother, Ricardo, was born in 1969.
Josefina's older sister had moved to the capital of Chile, Santiago, and they invited Josefina to join them there. In Santiago, Josefina met Hugo. Alejandro was born there in 1972.
In August 1973, their family moved to Spain. The family settled in Madrid, living in a camping caravan. When Alejandro was six years old, they moved to a complex on the outskirts of the town of Paracuellos de Jarama (Madrid).
Studies
Alejandro and their brother did not watch much television. From the age of 15, Alejandro would dedicate their time to going to the cinema to watch movies. Other than theater, their passions were writing stories and reading books. According to Alejandro's mother, Alejandro had the capacity to absorb everything they read. As a child, they also composed melodies with the keyboard and guitar with the same ease as when they wrote their stories.
Alejandro started their studies at the Padres Escolapios de Getafe school. In their second year of high school, they transferred to the Alameda de Osuna institute, in the north-east of Madrid. The school was not close to where Alejandro was living; however, their parents, who were very concerned about their education, decided to enroll them in that institute because it was known as one of the best schools in Madrid.
Before they became a director, Alejandro worked as a stock boy in a warehouse and as a gardener, until they had enough money to buy their own home camera. They did not want to start their university studies in cinema before ever having touched a camera. Amenábar entered the Information Sciences Faculty at Madrid's Complutense University, where after numerous scholastic failures they decided to give up studying cinema and they began directing. The advantage from having attended university was that they met people who later in life would become very important throughout their career (that was the case for Sergio Rozas and Carlos Montero, through whom they met Eduardo Noriega). At university, they also met Mateo Gil, a friend and companion, and the pair made a pact to always support each other's projects.
Film career
Between 1991 and 1994, Amenábar made three short films which in a very significant way influenced their first full-length films: La Cabeza, Himenóptero, and Luna.
Knowing José Luis Cuerda helped Alejandro greatly in their career. A friend of José Luis Cuerda gave them the script of Himenóptero so they would give their opinion. Thereafter, Cuerda was interested in Amenábar's work. This led to them becoming the producer of Thesis (1996), which is one of Amenábar's most recognized films, putting their name on the map. Thesis was a thriller set in the School of Information Sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid. Through this film, they gained the attention of critics in the Berlin Film Festival and won seven Goyas, including Best Picture and Best New Director.
In 1997 they made Abre Los Ojos, a science fiction movie that had notable success at international festivals such as Berlin and Tokyo. Impressed by the movie, Tom Cruise bought the rights to adapt and produce the film, starring in a remake, Vanilla Sky.
Their third full length film was The Others, a ghost story starring Nicole Kidman. It was very successful at an international level, especially in Spain, where it was the most viewed film that year. The Others were also very popular in the United States, where it was at the top of the box office for several weeks. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001, won eight Goyas, including the Best Picture and Best Director, and was nominated for best European Film Movie.
In 2004 Amenábar released The Sea Inside, a real life-story about a quadriplegic Ramón Sampedro (played by Javier Bardem), which addressed issues such as euthanasia, abortion, or “the right to a dignified life.” The movie won 14 Goyas, including the best movie and best director, and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004.
In 2008 Amenábar released their next film, called Mists of Time; however they later changed the name to Agora. The film starred big-name actors including Rachel Weisz and Max Minghella. Agora premiered on October 9, 2009, and with a budget of 50 million euros, it is the most expensive Spanish film in history.
After a hiatus of almost seven years, Amenábar returned in 2015 with the thriller Regression, starring Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson. The film had its world premiere at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in September 2015, where reviews were lukewarm.
Amenábar is also the composer of the soundtrack of their films, as well as others, such as Butterfly's Tongue directed by José Luis Cuerda and Nobody Knows Anybody directed by Mateo Gil.
Personal life
In 2004, Amenábar came out as gay. On 18 July 2015, they married David Blanco. Amenábar was raised Catholic, but later became agnostic and is now atheist.

Fiji vs Ireland
Fiji and Ireland, who had finished at the top of their respective groups, faced off at Queensland's Gold Coast. At stake was the chance to play Australia in the semi-final. Fiji had lost prop Iowane Divavesi to a two-match ban for tripping just hours before the match.
Amhrán na bhFiann was performed as the Ireland team's national anthem before the match. Fiji opened the scoring early with their captain Wes Naiqama from the half way line finding space down the right side of the field and scoring on the 2-minute mark. They then converted their own try so the score was 6 nil. About 5 minutes later Ireland responded with their own 50-metre runaway try down the right side thanks to winger Damien Blanch. Pat Richards kicked the extras so the scores were level at 6 all. In the 25th minute Fiji were penalised just over 40 metres out from their own line and the Irish decided to take the shot at goal. Richards' attempt went wide so the score remained unchanged. Fiji scored again about 5 minutes later when from close-range, Akuila Uate ran from dummy half on their wing infield to find a gap in the defence and score near the uprights. Naiqama's conversion was successful so Fiji led 12 - 6. It was Ireland's turn to score again and they did so in the 46th minute when from within Fiji's 10-metre line, captain Scott Grix decided to run from first receiver, charging through a gap and getting the ball down. Richards' kick to level the scores hit the upright and missed, so Fiji remained two points ahead at 12 - 10 and this was the score until half-time.
About a minute into the second half Fiji were up at their opponents' try-line when hooker James Storer ran from dummy half and crashed over but was held up by the defence. After repeated raids on the Irish try-line and despite some enormous drop-outs from Pat Richards, Fiji kept on coming and scored just on 55 minutes, when from close range Jason Bukuya found a gap in the defence and reached out to plant the ball down. Naiqama's conversion was successful so Fiji led 18 - 10. A few minutes later Fiji were again down close to Ireland's try-line when they got a penalty for a ruck infringement. Naiqama decided to take the shot at goal and didn't miss, so the score was 20 - 10 in favour of Fiji with seventeen minutes left on the clock. Ireland continued to be under siege and 10 metres out from their line, Fiji's halfback Aaron Groom stabbed a kick in behind the defence for Jarryd Hayne to chase and put down after clipping one of the uprights in their haste in the 66th minute. The video referee awarded the try and Naiqama kicked the simple conversion so Fiji had a comfortable lead at 26 - 10. Ten minutes later Fiji scored again after continuing to attack Ireland's line, this time Uate crossing out wide on the right wing. Naiqama's kick from the sideline hit the upright and missed, so with just over 5 minutes of the game remaining, the score was 30 - 10. Ireland got one more chance to attack Fiji's line in the closing minutes and it was Blanch who scored for them again, benefiting from a good offload from Lee Doran close to the try-line. Richards missed the conversion attempt so the final score was Fiji 30, Ireland 14. The Bati would play Australia next, with the winner of that match going to the World Cup Final, while the Irish exited the tournament with A$75,000 prize money.
Semi-finals
New Zealand vs England
In a re-play of both sides' last match, New Zealand once again faced England, this time for the right to play in the World Cup final. English coach Tony Smith left it to within an hour of kick-off before naming their team for the match. Kevin Sinfield was dropped from their position on the bench. Ben Westwood was promoted from the bench to the run-on side. For New Zealand Jason Nightingale was replaced by Sam Perrett. Sika Manu's faster than expected recovery from an eye socket injury saw their return with David Kidwell dropped in their place.
No British side had won a test match in Brisbane since Wales had defeated England at Lang Park during the 1975 World Cup. New Zealand had lost their last 8 international matches in the city.
This time when the Kiwis performed their haka, the England side stood in a line ten metres away and faced them.
In the ninth minute New Zealand were on the attack courtesy of a mistake from England and got the first try of the match, passing to Sam Perrett on the right wing who crossed out wide, then improved their kicker's position before putting the ball down. Jeremy Smith's conversion was successful so England trailed 6–nil. England, also benefitting from some New Zealand mistakes, were attacking the Kiwis' line and threw the ball out wide to the right wing as well and Ade Gardner dived over in the corner just before the fifteen-minute mark. The video referee showed that Gardner's toe touched the sideline before they grounded the ball so the try was not given. Four minutes later the Kiwis were back down at England's end when Lance Hohaia got over for a close-range try. Smith's kick went wide so the score was 10–nil in favour of New Zealand with a quarter of the match gone. Rob Purdham's restart kick went over the sideline on the full so New Zealand got the ball back and in the following set of six they scored again through Jerome Ropati. Smith's kick was good this time, so the Kiwis had 16 unanswered points. Then in the twenty-ninth minute England had an opportunity in attack down at New Zealand's end and kept the ball alive, the ball going to captain Jamie Peacock who forced their way over from close range. Purdham missed the conversion attempt so the score remained 16–4 in favour of the Kiwis. A New Zealand knock-on less than two minutes from half time saw the English get a scrum a few metres into the opposition's half. In a bold set move from the scrum base, England's loose forward Purdham broke away with the ball and immediately kicked it ahead for Danny Maguire racing through to regather and dive over by the goal posts. The video referee ruled that the chaser was only just in line with the kicker so the try was awarded. Rob Burrow was given the conversion attempt and kicked it, so England were back within a converted try at 16–10 at the half-time break.
After a few minutes of the second half, England second-rower Gareth Ellis was forced from the field with a rib injury. Both sides had attacking opportunities during the first 16 minutes of the half, but it was New Zealand's Bronson Harrison who scored first after receiving a good short ball from halfback Nathan Fien on England's twenty metre line which saw them cut through the defence, step past the fullback and score by the uprights. Smith's conversion meant the score was New Zealand 22, England 10 with twenty-two minutes of the match remaining. After a bomb from England which Hohaia failed to take securely, England were on the attack again. They moved the ball out through the hands to the right, and centre Martin Gleeseon dragged themselves through the defence to reach out and score in the sixty-first minute. Burrow kicked the sideline conversion so England were back within a converted try of New Zealand at 22–16. The Kiwis then got repeat sets down near England's line and were the next to score: Fien kicked the ball over towards the goal posts and as it came down in-goal two English defenders failed to secure it and Jerome Ropati was there to fall onto it. Benji Marshall was given the conversion this time and kicked it successfully so the score was 28–16 with ten minutes to go. Three minutes later England gave themselves a glimmer of hope when Maguire found space between New Zealand's defence and ran through it from fifteen metres out to score by the posts. Burrow's conversion meant that England were back within six points with six minutes of the game left to go. However the English were let down by further handling errors and New Zealand were the last to score after England again failed to defend against a bomb out to the left, Marshall putting it down in the corner at the seventy-eighth minute, placing the game beyond doubt. Smith missed the sideline conversion so the final score was 32–22. England then went home with A$130,000 prize money and New Zealand had booked a place in the final the following week.

Confession inscriptions of Lydia and Phrygia are Roman-era Koine Greek religious steles from these historical regions of Anatolia (then part of Asia and Galatia provinces), dating mostly to the second and third centuries.
The new element that appears, the public confession of sin and the redemption through offerings (), unknown to traditional Greek religion, has made scholars to name this social phenomenon as oriental. The religious thought and the use of vernacular Koine Greek, full of innovative orthography, syntax and grammar, suggests that they may also represent something at the root of religion in Phrygia and Lydia. Marijana Ricl has argued that the practice of confession is a reminiscence of Hittite religion. According to Schnabel E.J it was a counter-move prompted by the increasing success of the Christian missionaries. Indeed, beside the scheme of confession and redemption, the phraseology and terms are reminiscent of Greek New Testament: (sin), (advocate), (servant of God), (master), (king). Another point for discussion is the punishment of sexual transgressions, which further relates the inscriptions to Christianity and the concept of chastity in Hellenistic philosophy and religion, in contrast to the previous perception of sexuality inside the religion (Hieros gamos, Sacred prostitution, Aphrodite Pandemos).
Some indicating names or epithets of deities engaged in the inscriptions are: Men (Axiottenos, Artemidoros), Meter (mother), Zeus (Aithrios, Keraunios, Soter), Apollo, Hypsistos, Anaitis, Attis, Dionysos, Hades, Herakles, Sabazios, Batenos, Nemesis, Asclepius, Tyrannos, Basileus, Theos Strapton and Bronton, Hecate, and Artemis.

Ritual dialogue of Theodoros with the Gods (Lydia, 235/236 AD)
According to George Petzl, a trial of sacred theatre did take place in the sanctuary; Theodoros was convicted and jailed. Zeus was impersonated by a priest. According to Ender Varinlioglu, (jail) is used metaphorically. Blindness was the jail or punishment upon Theodoros in order to be saved from their licentious sexual activities.

In phonology and historical linguistics, feeding order is a situation in which rule A creates new contexts in which rule B can apply; it would not have been possible for rule B to apply otherwise.
If there are two rules, rule A which looks like x → y and rule B which looks like y → z, then the following is a feeding order:
A: x→y
B: y→z
The opposite of feeding order, the situation in which rule A destroys a certain context so rule B can no longer apply, is called bleeding order.
Examples
A good example of feeding order can be seen in English, where preglottalization can be considered as rule B. As a consequence of this rule, all voiceless plosives which make part of a word-final consonant cluster are glottalized. This can be seen in the form looked, with the underlying representation . It is pronounced . Another rule in English which is called fortis stop insertion shall be considered here as rule A. This rule inserts a voiceless plosive for example in (prince), so that the new form of the word becomes . Because a new phonological context has been created in which rule B can take place, the final output form of prince is .
Counterfeeding order
If the order of rules which are in feeding order is reversed, this is said to be a counterfeeding order.
If we have two rules, rule A which looks like x → y and rule B which looks like y → z the following is a counterfeeding order:
B: y→z
A: x→y
An example of this can be seen in French, where petite nièce ("little niece") is pronounced . If the rule which deletes word-final in French had been applied before another rule which deletes word-final consonants before another consonant, this would have been an example of feeding order and the "final output" form (surface form) would have been instead.
A counter-feeding order very often creates phonological opacity. In the given case, it is the application of the rule deleting word-final consonants which has thus become opaque in French.
In historical linguistics, a sequence of rules in counterfeeding order is called a chain shift. A chain shift can be presented graphically like the following:
a→b→c→d
where only one rule can apply. The result is that what was originally a becomes b, what was originally b becomes c, what was originally c becomes d, etc. In essence, each sound "shifts" one position to the right. A good example of such a chain shift occurred as part of the Great Vowel Shift, which took place historically in English starting around 1500 AD. The long front vowels were raised one position, and the original high front vowel became a diphthong:

The 2020 Port of Montreal strike began at 7:00 AM on August 10, 2020 after Local 375 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (Syndicat des débardeurs du Port de Montréal) walked off the jobsite. The local had previously voted for an indefinite strike. The strike is part of a dispute dating back to 2018, when the union and management were unable to negotiate a new contract.
Background
The Port of Montreal is Canada's second busiest port of entry with approximately $100 billion worth of goods passing through the port each year. Approximately 1,150 workers are part of CUPE local 375. Working without a contract, CUPE members participated in a series of daytime walkouts during the summer of 2020. On July 27, CUPE launched a four-day protest strike.On July 29, acts of violence and intimidation perpetrated by union members were reported as tension escalated between parties. Again, on August 3, another partial four-day strike was initiated by the Union. In response, management changed working conditions, including premiums offered. On August 4, 99.22% of eligible workers voted in favour of an inifinite strike.
Strike
Shortly after the strike began, the governments of François Legault (Quebec premier) and Doug Ford (Ontario premier), asked for the federal government to intervene to force the strikers back to work. This request was denied, with Labour Minister Filomena Tassi writing that "Our government has faith in the collective bargaining process, as we know the best deals are made at the table." Tensions were heightened during the finals days of the strike after the Maritime Employers Association announced its intention to use replacement workers to unload the sitting containers on August 19. However, A truce was agreed upon on August 21 which allowed the port to reopen two days later. The two sides agreed to resume contract talks and the union pledged to continue working without a labour stoppage for the next seven months after which time the union would resume its right to strike.

In enzymology, a dichloromuconate cycloisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
2,4-dichloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate 2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,4-dichloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate, and one product, 2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4-dichloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme participates in 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation. It employs one cofactor, manganese.

Science Vs is a science podcast created and hosted by Wendy Zukerman. The show takes a myth-busting approach to controversial topics and current events, with fact checking and research of the scientific literature, as well as interviewing relevant experts. A typical show will have over a hundred citations and involve background interviews of dozens of scientists in addition to the scientists who speak on the show.
History
The show was first produced and distributed in 2015 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) as part of ABC Radio's First Run podcast program. Science Vs was bought by Gimlet Media, a Brooklyn-based digital media company. Originally, Zukerman had to do all the research herself, but under Gimlet they were able to hire a dedicated research team. Episode topics have included immigration, gun control, ghosts, climate change, acne, and antidepressants, among others. Zukerman has said that the idea for Science Vs came from news headlines about Gwyneth Paltrow wanting women to participate in a "health practice" of vaginal steaming, which they thought could combine science with humor. Zukerman summarized their podcast's position against false equivalences, saying, "If there's a 95 percent consensus among scientists, you report the consensus."
In 2019 the show, along with other Gimlet Podcasts, was acquired by Spotify.
In February 2022 Zukerman announced that in response to COVID-19 misinformation spread by The Joe Rogan Experience, another Spotify podcast, Science Vs would suspend regular programming and air only shows that fact-check other Spotify podcasts. Zukerman called the platform's support of Rogan's COVID-19 misinformation "a slap in the face" in an email to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.
The February 25, 2022 episode of the podcast was devoted to refuting claims about the COVID-19 vaccine made on an episode of Rogan's podcast by virologist Robert Malone.
Reception
The show was a 2020 nominee for a Podcast Award, and the host Wendy Zukerman is a nominee for a 2021 Podcast Academy "Ambie" Best Host Award.
It was Spotify's #1 Science podcast in the US and #20 overall.

Viktor Aloisius Reko, (born 3 August 1880 in Vienna) was an Austrian teacher and scientific author who moved to Mexico in 1921.  They are best known for their popular book Magische Gifte: Rausch- und Betäubungsmittel der Neuen Welt ("Magic Poisons: Inebriating and Narcotic Substances of the New World"), first published in 1936. This book recorded a number of second-hand observations on New World psychoactive drugs, paraphrased from notes they took of conversations with their cousin, the eminent Mexican ethnobotanist Dr. Blas Pablo Reko, including the first published refutation of Dr. William Edwin Safford's uncharacteristically untenable assertion that teonanácatl was not a mushroom, but a cactus.
Reko's book also covered the following drugs, many of which were not mentioned in the earlier book Phantastica by Louis Lewin: sinicuichi (Heimia spp.) for which they claimed psychoactivity, Ololiúqui (Turbina corymbosa), peyotl (Lophophora williamsii), marihuana (Cannabis sativa), toloachi (Datura stramonium var. tatula), ayahuasca, colorines (Erythrina and Sophora species), coztic-zapote (Pouteria campechiana), (Gelsemium sempervirens), camotillo (Dioscorea composita), and cohombrillo (Ecballium elaterium). The second edition also contained chicalote (supposedly obtained from a cross between Argemone mexicana and Papaver somniferum), minapatli (Sebastiania pavoniana, Mexican jumping bean), and herbas locas (Dioon edule, Astragalus amphyoxys, and Oxytropis lambertii).
Victor A. Reko became a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences.

In the early 1960s they followed the recommendation of friends to move to New York. Albert Ayler heard them in a dining club and introduced them to Bernard Stollman, the owner of the experimental jazz label ESP-Disk. Them most influential albums, Sings (1965) and College Tour (1966) were made for this label.
Them best known recording is a nearly fourteen minute version of the traditional song "Black Is the Colour (Of My True Love's Hair)" (from Sings), which is rendered in a haunting, anguished wail.
In the late 1960s, they spent time in Europe and then left the music world to raise their son (born in 1969) in California. Almost 30 years later they recorded the album Love Songs in 1996 and began performing in public again. This included reunion concerts with pianist Burton Greene at two music festivals in May 2003: Visions Festival in New York and Le Weekend in Stirling.
In 2004 they released You Thrill Me: A Musical Odyssey, a collection of rare and unissued recordings from the years 1962–1979. ESP-Disk reissued Sings and College Tour on a single CD (The Complete ESP-Disk Recordings) in 2006.

The Town Walks are a series of public walks in Dorchester, Dorset, England, along the former Roman defences of the town.
Description
History
The first defences of the Roman town of Durnovaria were an earthen bank and ditch, constructed not earlier than 130 AD. Stone walls were built along the front of the bank at a later time, perhaps in the 4th century. During the medieval period the defences continued to be in use, the ditch being recut in the 14th or 15th century. By the 17th century the walls had mostly disappeared: John Speed's Map of Dorsetshyre, of 1610, showed the defences as "The ruins of the ould wall".
Between 1702 and 1743 the embankments were landscaped to form a series of walks. Hutchins' Map of Dorchester, of 1772, shows tree-lined avenues along the lines of the Roman defences.
Today
The Town Walks are Grade II listed; the corresponding Roman walls are a scheduled monument.
The Walks follow the west and south sides, and part of the north and east sides, of the original rectangular defences. There are six tree-lined walks: North Walk and Colliton Walk in the north-west; West Walks and Bowling Alley Walk in the south-west; South Walks and Salisbury Walk in the south-east.
There is a surviving fragment of the Roman wall, on Albert Road near the corner of Princes Street. It is Grade II listed.

The 1976 Major League Baseball lockout occurred from March 1 to March 17. The lockout was instituted after the expiration of the league's Basic Agreement. A primary issue addressed during lockout negotiations was the longstanding reserve clause and the players' desire to become free agents. The lockout did not result in any regular season games being canceled.
Background
Following the expiration of the league's Basic Agreement between the owners and the players, there were rumors of a potential lockout due to the inability of the two sides to negotiate a new deal in a timely manner. The Major League Baseball Players Association asked a caucus of team owners if a lockout would happen, but the group told union director Marvin Miller that it "wasn't their decision to make." Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn stated in a meeting with the league's 24 owners that because there was no agreement in place between the owners and players, dates and times for the upcoming spring training had not been set. On January 15, 1976, Miller met with the Owners-Players Relations Committee for three hours to discuss issues in an attempt to work towards a deal before a potential lockout. The league's pension plan was discussed and Miller advocated for spring training games not to be cancelled in any circumstance. No deal was met at that meeting.
One of the largest issues looming over negotiations was the prospect of free agency. Baseball's longstanding reserve clause began to fall into question as players sought to have more freedom in where they played. The first instance of the reserve clause being challenged was the Supreme Court case Flood v. Kuhn where St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to be traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1969. The court ultimately ruled against Flood in 1972, but comments made by the justices on the case were used to later nullify the reserve clause in the December 1975 Seitz decision, effectively creating free agency in baseball. With the possibility of a lockout less than a month after the decision, free agency rules and guidelines became a key issue to be negotiated between the owners and players.
Tensions rose as the two sides could not agree to come to a new deal. Marvin Miller claimed that a refusal by the league's team owners to open spring training camps to the players would be a violation of their contracts, thus making them free agents, comparing it to the Catfish Hunter breach of contract scenario from 1974.
The team owners were often blamed as the agitator in the dispute, receiving criticism from various sports media members. Newsday writer William Nack wrote in a February edition that "the owners have since carried on ad nauseam, to put it with charity, and contrived to emerge ironically as graceless, irrational fugitives running naked through the streets of perhaps the most graceful, rational of American games." Longtime sportswriter Red Smith called the owners' actions "childish" in their column for The New York Times.
Lockout
The lockout was initiated by the owners on March 1, 1976. The lockout was not total as Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck opened spring training camp to some of their players. MLB and the MLBPA met for five hours on March 2 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to discuss the reserve clause amongst other issues, but little progress was reportedly made. MLB offered that players must have eight years of service time before being eligible for an option year in their contract, a proposal that union director Marvin Miller deemed "unacceptable." American League president Lee MacPhail rebutted by saying that Miller was "making a mountain out of a molehill." Early in the lockout, there was alleged indication that the ownership group was backing down. On March 2, the Atlanta Braves opened spring training camp to a handful of non-roster players, and several other teams reportedly told their players to get ready for spring training.
The two sides met again on March 3 in Miami Beach for two and a half hours. The players argued that they should be able to have an option year after one year of service, colloquially dubbed the "one-one rule." The owners argued that they could not allow the Seitz decision that granted Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally free agency become the norm. The owners made a revised proposal that would allow players to seek free agency after six years of service time, but Marvin Miller said that MLB was not willing to hear out the MLBPA's counter-proposal.
More owners began to ease their lockout stance; Jim Kaat and Steve Carlton were among 22 Phillies players at spring training camp by March 4.
MLB and the MLBPA conducted another meeting on March 5 in New York City. The meeting lasted for one hour and was abruptly ended in a reportedly negative fashion. The reserve clause was once again discussed but no notable concessions were made. Marvin Miller conducted an MLBPA press conference March 6 to address the meeting, stating that the dealings were professional but not progressive. They announced that the MLBPA was setting April 25 as a deadline for negotiations to conclude, threatening that they would argue breach of contract otherwise and seek to grant players free agency. MLB released a statement, claiming that the players were obligated to comply in the creation of a new reserve system. Following the March 5 meeting, no further meetings were scheduled but the two sides stayed in contact through the phone.
Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, who largely separated themselves from the dispute between MLB owners and the MLBPA, began to receive calls to alleviate the problem before regular-season games were cancelled. As commissioner, Kuhn held the power to open up the spring training camps and effectively end the lockout.
By March 9, strife developed between MLBPA director Marvin Miller and several players. Some players began to call for Miller to ease up in negotiations and give more credence to the owners' stances. Cincinnati Reds superstars Johnny Bench and Pete Rose claimed that Miller was not listening to the players. Bench joined Tom Seaver and Joe Torre in a trio advocating for a quick resolution so that play could resume. Montreal Expos pitcher Woodie Fryman said that they did not care which way the negotiations swung, just that they wanted to play.
MLB and the MLBPA met again on March 9 in New York City to no avail. The meeting reportedly featured "raised voices" and obscenities coupled with no progress towards a deal. Miller alleged that MLB was misleading the players on the status of the negotiations. Despite the hostile nature of the meeting, the sides agreed to meet again in Florida on March 11 and 12.
On March 10 in Tampa, Florida, MLB met with a contingent of roughly 50 players for two and a half hours to discuss the situation. Johnny Bench, who was among the group of players in the meeting, shared a sense of pessimism, as did MLBPA director Marvin Miller. Bench noted that many players were training on high school and collegiate fields in Florida and paying their own housing fees because they did not have access to team facilities. The groups reconvened in St. Petersburg, Florida on March 11, meeting for two hours but leaving disappointed. A group of players decided to cancel the voluntary practices they were holding at Eckerd College as they believed practicing during the lockout could only stand to benefit the owners.
On March 14, Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn announced that the regular season would occur and that the regular season would commence on the scheduled April 8 opening day. At the time, Kuhn stated that they had would open spring training once they saw considerable progress between MLB and the MLBPA. At a meeting, Marvin Miller made a new proposal that would institute a one-year test trial of the "one-one rule" so that the two camps could witness its cost-effectiveness and make a later decision. The meeting lasted into the night and negotiators were seen walking around the hotel premises and discussing, leading the media to believe an agreement was imminent. Another meeting was set for the morning of March 15.
On March 16, the ownership group gave their final offer which included an acceptance of the players' much-desired one-one rule. AL President Lee MacPhail said that MLB "bit the bullet" on the rule and added that spring training camps would not be opened until the deal was accepted. MLBPA Director Marvin Miller described the offer as a sudden turnaround from previously hostile negotiations and said that the players would convene to discuss the following day. On March 17, Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn ordered that training camps be opened immediately, effectively ending the lockout. At the time, the MLBPA had not accepted or declined the owners' "best and final" offer. Miller stated that the MLBPA did not vote on the owners' proposal because it did not address issues that were important to the players' union.

The Journal of Global Drug Policy and Practice describes itself as open access peer-reviewed public health journal. Critics say it is biased, not peer reviewed, and not a legitimate scientific journal. It is funded by the US Department of Justice.
Background
The journal published online quarterly by the Institute on Global Drug Policy and the International Scientific and Medical Forum on Drug Abuse. These are both part of the Drug Free America Foundation, an organization that has referred to harm reduction efforts as "harm promotion", and characterized such efforts as "a tactic to normalize drug use". The stated goal of the Institute itself is as follows:
The Institute is charged with creating and strengthening international laws that hold drug users and dealers criminally accountable for their actions. It will vigorously promote treaties and agreements that provide clear penalties to individuals who buy, sell or use harmful drugs... The institute supports efforts to oppose policies based on the concept of harm reduction.
Criticism
The publication has been criticized for having a political agenda to combat harm-reduction policies. It is funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice. The president of the Canadian Health Libraries Association has also said it appears to be driven more by a political agenda than by science:
"That journal, which looks legitimate, which is being used by the Canadian government to back up various decisions, is supported by groups that believe enforcement is the route to reducing drug use."
Also referring to this journal, authors in the Canadian Medical Association Journal wrote,
Efforts to undermine the science specific to HIV prevention for injection drug users are becoming increasingly sophisticated. One new and worrisome trend is the creation of internet sites posing as open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journals. One such example, funded by the Drug Free America Foundation, contains a review of the research supporting needle exchange program and declares that the "effectiveness of NEPs [ needle-exchange programs ] to reduce HIV among IDUs [ injection drug users ] is overrated;" it further claims that the WHO position on needle exchange programs "is not based on solid evidence."
An opinion piece in The Lancet Infectious Diseases stated "To our knowledge, this is the first time a lobby group such as the Drug Free America Foundation has created for itself a venue for the dissemination of opinion essays, which to the untrained eye could easily be mistaken for a scientific journal".
Use by Canadian Government
In 2007, the Canadian Minister of Health, Tony Clement, cited the journal to justify the Canadian Government's objections to harm-reduction programs.

Phyllis A. Wallace (1921–1993) was a distinguished African American economist and activist, as well as the first woman to receive doctorate of economics at Yale University. Them work tended to focus on racial, as well as gender discrimination in the workplace.
Early life
They were born Annie Rebecca Wallace in Calvert County, Maryland, on June 9, 1921 to John Wallace, a craftsman, and Stevella Wallace. They attended a well ranked yet segregated high school, Frederick Douglass High School, graduating in 1939.
Despite ranking first in their high school class, state law at that time would not allow them to attend the all-white University of Maryland. They attended New York University, receiving a bachelor's degree in economics in 1943, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.
They later attended Yale University, earning a master's degree in 1944 and a PhD in 1948. A mix of encouragement from their Yale economist professor and work at a federal-defense agency made them decide to pursue a career in international economics.
Career
Them work began studying economic growth in the Soviet Union, but later transferred to a focus in workplace economics, joining the senior staff of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1965. They became a voice for anti-discrimination in the workplace, and was an important part of the anti-workplace-discrimination contingencies of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Them work shifted again towards economic issues with urban minority youth when they began working for Metropolitan Applied Research Center (MARC).
Wallace joined the faculty of MIT in 1972 as a visiting professor, and was tenured as full professor in 1974, in the Sloan School. Them appointment made them the first woman to gain tenure at Sloan. Wallace retired from active teaching in 1986.
Achievements
Wallace was the first African American and the first female president of the Industrial Relations Research Association. They also garnered several awards for their accomplishments, including National Economic Association's Westerfield Award in 1981, and awards from several universities, including Yale (1980) and Brown (1986).

Salça is a category of thick, deep red paste made from peppers or tomato and salt, originating in Turkey.
Varieties
Biber salçası
Biber salçası (literally "pepper paste"; also called kırmızı biber salçası, literally "red pepper paste") is made from red chili peppers or sweet long peppers and salt. The peppers' stems and seeds are removed, and then the pepper is crushed and salt added.
The crushed peppers are sun-dried for six to seven days (depending on the strength of the sun) until the mixture develops intense sun-dried flavor and a pasty consistency.
It is a part of the cuisine of Anatolia and is enjoyed by different ethnic groups in the region. It is used mainly for flavoring main dishes, as well as to fill pide and börek. Another common use is as a spread, typically on bread or crackers.
There are two main varieties of biber salçası:
Acı biber salçası (literally "hot pepper paste"), made from red hot chili peppers
Tatlı biber salçası (literally "sweet pepper paste"), made from sweet red peppers
Domates salçası
Domates salçası is tomato paste made from concentrated pureed in season tomatoes either overheat or under the sun during the late summer months.
Traditional methods of making homemade Turkish tomato paste include grinding or pureeing peeled tomatoes, removing the seeds with a Turkish colander called a süzgeç and then mixing with salt. The paste is then reduced under the sun over three to four days. The paste must be stirred frequently when sun-drying to prevent spoiling. Some people reduce the puree over an open fire to speed up the process.
Commercial types of tomato salça are cooked in large factories rather than sun dried and do not have the same intense flavour or colour.

The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) is a 1,677-bed acute hospital located in Govan, in the south-west of Glasgow, Scotland. The hospital is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital and opened at the end of April 2015. The hospital comprises a 1,109-bed adult hospital, a 256-bed children's hospital and two major Emergency Departments; one for adults and one for children. There is also an Immediate Assessment Unit for local GPs and out-of-hours services, to send patients directly, without having to be processed through the Emergency Department.
The retained buildings from the former Southern General Hospital include the Maternity Unit, the Institute of Neurological Sciences, the Langlands Unit for medicine of the elderly and the laboratory. The whole facility is operated by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.
While some parts of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have their own distinct identity and dedicated specialist staff, such as the Royal Hospital for Children, each is completely integrated with linkages for patient transfer, diagnostic services, emergency care and even a rapid access lift from the emergency helicopter pad on the roof of the adult hospital. For example, the new children's hospital is not only linked to the adult hospital but also both the adult and children's hospitals are linked to the redeveloped maternity building and to the Neurosciences Institute.
The hospital hosts services relocated from the Western Infirmary, the Victoria Infirmary including the Mansion House facility, some services from the Royal Infirmary and a range of inpatient services from Gartnavel General Hospital. In addition, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, previously based at Yorkhill, was moved to a new building adjoining the adult hospital and renamed the "Royal Hospital for Children".
The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is one of the largest acute hospital campuses in Europe.
History
In 2008, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde submitted a business case to the Scottish Government for a new acute hospital to replace facilities at the Western Infirmary and Victoria Infirmary, and to relocate the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, to a new building adjoining the new adult hospital. Designs were unveiled for the hospital campus in November 2009, with public funding being approved. The adult hospital, children's hospital and laboratory buildings were designed by Nightingale Associates, with construction carried out by Multiplex, who previously built Wembley Stadium.
At the time of construction the hospital, originally named the South Glasgow University Hospital, was Scotland's largest ever publicly funded NHS construction project, costing £842 million to build. it was built on and around site of the old Southern General Hospital, with construction starting in early 2011. Originally to be called South Glasgow University Hospital, it was granted the right to use the name "Queen Elizabeth University Hospital" by Queen Elizabeth II. It was originally hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2014, but medical services did not start to be transferred until April 2015, when the first services began being transferred from other hospitals and was fully operational by summer 2016.
A physical above ground link for patients and staff from the main building into the Maternity and Neurosciences Institute buildings was constructed, allowing most of the campus to be traversed without going outside. The main hospital facilities are also linked to the laboratory buildings via a tunnel and pneumatic tube system.
The retained buildings from the former hospital, notably the Institute of Neurological Sciences, also started to receive external and internal refurbishment, with a cosmetic panel cladding being applied to the outside of the building in order to bring its appearance in-line with the new hospital buildings at a cost of circa £40 million.
When the hospital opened its doors, locals nicknamed it the "Death Star" due to its star-shaped design, large size and the landing pad for aircraft on the roof.
In February 2020, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde started legal proceedings against Multiplex, Capita Property & Infrastructure, and Currie & Brown for an estimated £73 million in losses and damages relating to technical issues at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children.
Services
Adults' hospital
The adult hospital - in height, 14 storeys with four 'wings' - features 1,109 patient rooms. Rooms within general wards have an external window view. Each room is equipped with private shower and toilet facilities in addition to entertainment such as television and radio. The first floor houses a 500-seat hot food restaurant and a separate cafe. The atrium features shops and banking machines and a lift system that automatically guides users to the lift that will take them to their destination most efficiently. In addition to a canteen and coffee shop, the atrium in the adult hospital building also contains retail outlets including: Marks & Spencer; WHSmith; Camden Food co; and The Soup & Juice Co. There are also cash machines located in the hospital. It is estimated that the hospital serves 41% of Scotland's population.
Children's hospital
The Royal Hospital for Children, while retaining a somewhat separate identity, is adjoined and integrated with the adult hospital. With 256 beds and five floors, it replaced the Royal Hospital for Sick Children located in Yorkhill, Glasgow.
Maternity Unit
The maternity unit, which was built in 1970 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, is situated directly across from the children's hospital facilities.
Institute of Neurological Sciences
The Institute of Neurological Sciences (INS), which was built in 1972 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, provides Neurosurgical, Neurological, Clinical Neurophysiology, Neuroradiological, Neuropathology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery facilities for the West of Scotland. The department has two buildings, connected by a two storey link bridge. Firstly the larger INS building, which contains critical care, 6 operating theatres, diagnostic imaging services and 4 inpatient wards, as well as the Clinical Research Facility (CRF). The second building is the Neurology Block, which contains an outpatient department, Clinical Neurophysiology, two inpatient wards and the West of Scotland Maxillofacial Prosthetics service. The Physically Disabled Rehabilitation Unit (PDRU) is connected to the Neurology Block and provides specialist Neurorehabilitation services to NHSGGC patients. Attached to the INS surgical building is The Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Unit for Scotland which provides a spinal injuries service to the whole of Scotland. This unit contains two wards and an outpatient/rehabilitation facility. Approximately 60% of the INS services' workload is emergency care.
Langlands Building
The medicine for the elderly unit, which was built in 2001 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, is housed in the Langlands Building at the southern end of the hospital campus and is linked to the rest of the hospital via the Institute of Neurological Sciences' link bridge connection with the QEUH.
Laboratory
The laboratory, which was built in 2012 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, provides centralised laboratory services for the whole of Scotland.The building hosts medical laboratory space to support blood sciences, medical genetics, medical pathology and microbiology. It also houses the hospitals facilities management offices and staff. The mortuary is also based here and is located in the basement. It is staffed by more than 800 people and also undertakes research.
Transportation
The campus features an "Arrival Square" which is located at the front entrance of the adult hospital and is intended to function as the hospital's transport interchange. With patient drop-off zones, access to bus services serving the city and its suburbs, a boardwalk connecting the adult and children's hospitals and a taxi stand. Around 90 buses an hour service the facility. 500 bicycle racks are provided for those cycling to the campus.
The nearest railway station is Cardonald railway station and the nearest Glasgow subway station is Govan subway station.
Automated guided vehicles
The adult, children and laboratory buildings within the hospital are equipped with a fleet of 26 automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to carry supplies, using dedicated lifts and a network of tunnels.
The dedicated lifts that are used by the robots are separated for clean and dirty goods and the robots travel in non public corridors located in the basement.

John Gardiner Calkins Brainard (1795–1828) was an American lawyer, editor and poet.
Biography
John Brainard was born in New London, Connecticut, in October 1796, son of Jeremiah G. Brainard, formerly a judge of the Connecticut Superior Court. They were a descendant of Lion Gardiner, an early English settler and soldier, who founded the first English settlement in what became the state of New York. Their legacy includes Gardiners Island, which remains in the possession of the family and is the largest privately owned island in the United States.
Brainard was tutored at home by an elder brother and entered Yale College at the age of 15 in 1811. Biographies agree that they were not an attentive student, and it is uncertain whether they graduated. Nevertheless, on leaving college they were taken on as a student at law in their brother William F. Brainard's office.
By 1819 they had been called to the bar and moved to Middletown, apparently to set up their own practice. In fact, they seem to have been apathetic about a legal career, feeling that their nature was too sensitive for such a profession. Some of their earliest poems are from this period of their life, published in a New Haven literary paper, The Microscope published by one Cornelius Tuthill.
In February 1822, they were engaged as editor of the Connecticut Mirror in a bid to further a literary career. Again, biographies agree that this was not the ideal job for him, and that "his temperament was totally unsuited to rough collissions of editorial controversy". In this role they published a number of their own works within the newspaper, which were well received and led to a literary reputation for Brainard.
They appear to have been well known and well thought of in their community.  They are known to have been a friend of McDonald Clarke, the so-called "Mad poet of Broadway".
In 1824-5 they published a first volume, Occasional Pieces of Poetry by John G. C. Brainard, being reprints of works first published in the Mirror, together with a miscellany of unpublished poems.
By the spring of 1827, they were in failing health, suffering from tuberculosis. They returned to New London, giving up their Mirror role, but continuing to have poems published in it.
They died on September 26, 1828. A number of poets, including John Greenleaf Whittier, wrote poems in their memory. A posthumous The literary remains of J.G.C. Brainard: with a sketch of their life was published in 1832, and revised and republished as The poems of John G. C. Brainard. A new and authentic collection. A number of their poems are reprinted in collections of poems.
Their poem "On the Project of African Colonization" is quoted in Harriet Beecher Stowe´s book Uncle Tom's Cabin at the end of chapter XXXVII "Liberty" although without credit and reference.

The Companies Act 1928 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which regulated UK company law.
Provisions
It introduced the power of the court to make a disqualification order prohibiting a person from being concerned in the management of a company was introduced by section 75. This was subsequently consolidated as section 275 of the Companies Act 1929 and based on the recommendation of the Report of the Company Law Amendment Committee (1925-1926) under the chairpersonship of Mr Wilfrid Greene KC (Cmd 2657). Application for an order was to the court having jurisdiction to wind up the company and could be made by the official receiver or the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company. Except where there had been a conviction the power was limited to cases where it appeared in the course of a winding up that any business of the company had been carried on with intent to defraud and the maximum period for which a disqualification order could be made was five years. The power to make such an order was discretionary. The grounds upon which a disqualification order could be made were later extended by section 33 of the Companies Act 1947 (subsequently consolidated as section 188 of the Companies Act 1948) following the Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment (1945) under the chairpersonship of Cohen J (Cmd 6659).

"In My Defence" is a song performed by Queen lead vocalist Freddie Mercury. It was from the 1986 musical Time by Dave Clark and featured on the Time concept album. The song was not a hit during Mercury's lifetime but was released posthumously in 1992, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart.
Background
The song was written by Dave Clark, David Soames and Jeff Daniels for the musical Time. During the musical, Mercury performed the song as a duet with Cliff Richard; this was the last time Mercury sang live in concert; their last performance would be Barcelona in 1988 with Montserrat Caballé, but that performance was lip-synced. Recorded as a solo project, it was recorded at Abbey Road in October 1985, about six months after Mr. Bad Guy was released. The producers expected that if Mercury was not satisfied with the final song, they would let them record with the rest of Queen, but Mercury found the final version satisfactory. "In My Defence" was first released on the Time LP in 1986. Other versions include '(Ron Nevison Mix)' - released on The Freddie Mercury Album and instrumental version (with vocals for the last line) released also on The Solo Collection. The Ron Nevison mix is very similar to the original, but has different bass and drums, while some string parts were added and others were removed. The 2000 Remix is a remastered version of the Ron Nevison mix and has the same instrumentation mixed differently.
Music video
The music video, made after Mercury's death in 1991, was directed by Rudi Dolezal and was a montage featuring outtakes of past music videos, numerous private shots, as well as highlights of Mercury's career. Dolezal wanted the video that showed Mercury being happy and having a good time; much of the footage is the same as the previous "The Show Must Go On" montage also compiled by DoRo Productions consisting of Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher. It also features several quotations from interviews with Mercury, and ends with the line "I still love you" from "These Are the Days of Our Lives".

The Lament of Swordy Well is a poem written by John Clare in the 1830s.
Synopsis
Clare personifies an old limestone quarry and heath that was close to their home in Helpston, Northamptonshire, and, using its voice, speaks of the despair it felt at the hardships of the poor and the land around it ever since it has been enclosed by the local parish. The poem is one of Clare's most famous protestation poems.
Swordy Well in Marholm, now Swaddywell, is an area of scientific interest. The Langdyke Countryside Trust established Swaddywell Pit nature reserve in 2003.
Poet Paul Farley celebrated Clare's work through this poem on BBC Radio 4 in 2008.

Nyaaringu is the debut studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Miiesha, released digitally on 29 May 2020. Following its physical release in August 2020, the album peaked at number 28 on the ARIA charts.
Speaking about the album, Miiesha said "Nyaaringu is a collection of stories that I feel I wanted to tell or that I needed to speak on. For me it represents my journey and where I'm at now coming from Woorabinda. The interludes in the collection are recordings of my Grandmother speaking. For me they were and always will stay with me as the strongest voice in my life, so I felt they had to be a part of this with me." Nyaaringu is a phrase meaning "what happened" in the Pitjantjatjara language.
At the National Indigenous Music Awards 2020, the album was nominated for Album of the Year. At the 2020 ARIA Music Awards it won Best Soul/R&B Release.
Critical reception
Ali Shutler from NME said "Nyaaringu [is] a fearless debut album that weaves a story about the Indigenous experience", calling it "A soulful R&B record whose tales of discrimination, empowerment and freedom bear relevance well beyond Australia's borders." The Music AU called the album "thematically and communally, powerful."
Tyler Jenke from ToneDeaf said "Arguably one of the strongest debuts in recent memory, and one of the most fitting records to be released during Reconciliation Week, Nyaaringu sees Miiesha Young sharing their story in the way only they can, with a dazzling blend of smooth soulful vocals serving as a statement of self-belief." Geordie Gray from ToneDeaf called Nyaaringu "essential listening", saying "Miiesha deftly weaves stories of community, survival and inherited knowledge. A pivotal masterpiece and an ode to resilience. A heartbreakingly timely debut."
Laura English from Music Feeds called the album "absolutely stunning but the collection of songs goes deeper, exploring the themes of cultural identity and community."
Al Newstead from Triple J said "Miiesha's debut release is one every Australian should hear... Weaving intensely personal and honest storytelling with the kind of warm production SZA or Solange would kill for, Miiesha captures the complexity of the individual Indigenous experience through universally appealing songs."
Simon Winkler from Stack Magazine said the album "...draws upon gospel, R&B, hip hop, soul and spoken word poetry to create something unique, universal and profoundly personal."

Dovid Shlomo Novoseller, a descendant of Rabbis Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev (Kedushat Levi), Samuel Eidels (Maharsha) and Yechezkel Landau , was born in Yarmolintsky on Aug. 19, 1877, and received semicha from Rabbi Moshe Noson HaLevi Rubinstein, Av Beth Din of Vinnitsa.
Novoseller acted as Av Beth Din of Felshtin from 1917 to 1928. During the horrific February 1919 pogrom, Novoseller's wife and two daughters were murdered and they were left for dead. After a miraculous recovery they remarried and in 1928 emigrated to Philadelphia where they became Av Beth Din and founded Cong. Bnai Yehoshua and a free hostel for the Jewish homeless. They also served as president of the Vaad HaRabonim of Philadelphia and vice president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.
Novoseller died in 1966.

Travis Doering (born July 14, 1991 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian systems analyst, writer and film producer.
Career
 They are best known for their work as a security consultant and writer, in both the film and news media. In 2018 Doering revealed one of the largest data breaches in Canadian history effecting millions of customers of defunct computer retailer NCIX. In 2015 via the now defunct website Hacker Film Blog, Doering revealed vulnerabilities in Apple's iCloud platform and the breach and subsequent theft of customer data from internet security software company "Bitdefender". In the film industry Doering has served as a technical consultant providing hacking and information technology dialogue on several film and television productions including the Canadian science fiction series "Continuum", the police procedural "Motive" and the American zombie film "Dead Rising: Endgame”. In addition to their work in media, Doering also serves as a systems analyst providing information security consultancy services for high risk individuals and businesses since 2006. Before writing Doering worked in the casting and production department on many Canadian and American film and television productions.
Security Research
In September 2018, Doering posted an editorial title NCIX Data Breach on the blog of their cybersecurity company Privacy Fly. It outlined a severe data breach at a bankrupt Canadian retailer NCIX in which millions of business records detailing 15 years worth of transactions were sold in a series of backroom deals. The editorial prompted an investigation into the sale by the RCMP and Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, as well as a civil lawsuit. In July 2015, Doering created the Hacker Film Blog where they co-authored an article about a security breach at antivirus maker BitDefender. The story was later picked up by Forbes, The Washington Times, and PC World. Two months later in September 2015, Doering posted a documentary titled "Vulnerability: The Secrets Behind iCloud Hacking”. The documentary exposed vulnerabilities being exploited by an underground hacking collective known as RipSec, whose members breached over eleven thousand iCloud accounts, a significant portion of which belonged to Hollywood celebrities like Amanda Seyfried, Kate Mara, and Jamie Foxx.
Edward Snowden Movie
In September 2013, Doering and Film Director Jason Bourque set out to crowdfund a feature film titled "Classified: The Edward Snowden Story". "Classified" was a biographical feature film based on the life of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, in January 2014 production was shut down and the project was cancelled after losing several key donators due to not reaching their total 1.7 million dollar funding goal. When the production was shutdown Bourque and Doering announced that "Classified" would be split into two separate projects one titled "Vulnerability", a documentary that focuses on IT security and the internet. The second, a feature film based on Snowden's life that would be produced in cooperation with likeminded production companies and film distributors in the near future. In January 2014 existing backers from "Classified" had the option to transfer their donations to "Vulnerability" or have the funds fully refunded. "Vulnerability" was released on September 25, 2015.

Scouting memorabilia collecting is the hobby and study of preserving and cataloging Boy Scouting and Girl Guiding items for their historic, aesthetic and monetary value. Since collecting depends on the interests of the individual collector, the depth and breadth of each collection varies. Some collectors choose to focus on a specific subtopic within their area of general interest, for example insignia issued prior to the 1970s Boy Scouts of America requirement that all insignia have either the fleur-de-lis or the acronym BSA; or only the highest ranks issued by each nation. Others prefer to keep a more general collection, accumulating any or all Scouting merchandise, or Scouting stamps from around the world.
Origins
The collecting of Scouting memorabilia likely began when Scouting was founded in Britain in 1907, though in those early years many did not think to save their items, and so much is lost to history. Early Scouters often sewed awards they had earned, as well as insignia they had traded with other Scouts, directly to woolen campfire blankets. Most of the original Scouting insignia of that period was wool itself and has not survived. Several beautiful examples of these early campfire blankets exist in the collection of the Koshare Indian Museum in La Junta, Colorado.
Purpose
The vast bulk of Scouting items exist, first and foremost, to recognize a Scout for their or their accomplishments in Scoutcraft, to engender feelings of kinship with other Scouts similarly outfitted, and to assist in the practice of their or their Scouting. The collection of Scouting memorabilia is one of the many ways Scouting can be enjoyed, studied, and passed down through one's family. Everything pertaining to Scouting can be collected. The concept of Scouting memorabilia is not limited to cloth and metal insignia, uniforms and awards, but extends to handbooks and advancement pamphlets, postage stamps, magazines, camping equipment issued by a national Scout organization, photographs, coffee mugs, and other items. Some of these areas may overlap with other spheres of collecting, when valued for a connection to a historical event; for instance if a president signs a document related to Scouting, the pen and the document itself may both be considered related to that president and to Scouting.
Living history
Another aspect of collecting is that of living history. There are several individuals and groups who collect period uniforms and equipment in order to re-enact Scouting of the past. Quite popular is the portrayal of Baden-Powell, authentically costumed, reading their last message to Scouts. Indeed, one of the Venturing (Boy Scouts of America) electives is Outdoor Living History.
Campfire blankets
The camp blanket is a significant piece of memorabilia for many Scouts and Girl Guides around the world. Scouts and Guides sew badges onto the blanket to represent all their achievements and events competed in, and out, of Scouting. Camp blankets are often used to display and store badges "earned" in a younger section, e.g. a Guide will sew them Brownie badges onto their blanket or a Scout will sew their Cub badges.
The camp blanket is not limited to fabric badges or patches. The blanket can also include neckerchiefs, pin badges, sashes and other memorabilia. The size, shape and layout of badges on a camp blanket has no guidelines. They can be randomly scattered, or organized in any way chosen by the owner.
Camp blankets can take various shapes but they are broadly found in three forms. 1) A standard blanked with fabric patches or badges sewn on but no change to the shape of the blanket. 2) A "poncho" style where a hole is cut in the center of the blanket, the blanket is then worn over the head. 3) The blanket has a slit cut from one edge to the center to allow the blanket to be worn over the shoulders, fastenings may be added.
Camp blankets tend to be worn at campfires and singalongs in the evening, where an extra layer is a welcome addition to normal clothing as the temperature drops. The blanket can also be used at night as an extra sleeping layer or pillow.
The first use of the camp blanket is unknown, but it can be traced back to Native Americans, who wore them as ponchos around their camp fires.
The blanket often represents experiences in the Guides or Scouts-camps attended, interest badges earned, and interests outside of Guiding and Scouting. Many Guides and Scouts take patches from their home area to large camps or international gatherings to swap with the people they meet, providing them with a memory of their experience at camp.
Evolution
All Scout organizations periodically change the design, name, and availability of their Scouting memorabilia, depending on factors such as changes in society (such as the shift from an agrarian society to an industrial society in 20th century America, or Macedonia's change in flag twice shortly after independence), availability of materials and manufacturing processes available, merging of local districts, councils and in some cases whole organizations, and frequently just artistic whim. The participant patch (usually embroidered or woven) for the first Japanese National Scout Rally was printed on paper, because of the financial situation of that time. Period pieces of Japanese Scouting memorabilia from the U.S. occupation period of Japan are rare, often fetching upward of U.S. $1,000.00.
Organizations and resources for collectors
Many organizations around the world are dedicated to accumulating and disseminating information on various Scouting memorabilia. The Scout collecting organizations Scouts on Stamps Society International (SOSSI), the International Badgers Club, the Scouting Memorabilia Club of Japan, the International Scouting Collectors Association, the Scout Memorabilia Collectors of Canada, and the American Scouting Historical Society are a few of the resources available to collectors of Scouting memorabilia.
Many collectors guides and buyers' guides have been published since the first ASTA Blue Book in 1959, among the most well-known are the Arapaho series, which deal with locality-specific Boy Scouts of America insignia.
World Scout Collectors Meetings
The World Scout Collectors Meeting is an opportunity to view Scouting memorabilia and history, learn more about world Scouting and collecting, meet collectors from other countries, and acquire and trade Scouting items and other collectible objects. Regional and National collectors meeting also are organized.
Regional meetings
The First European Scouts Collectors Meeting (ESCM) was organized in Leuven, Belgium in 1992. Since then every year an ESCM is celebrated in Leuven (Except in 2002. The event was held in Ghent, Belgium.). In 2007 the name changed to "European Scouts and Guides Collectors Meeting" (ESGCM).
As business
Only relatively recently has the concept of marketing such items for monetary gain come into play, though modern Scout councils have become rather market savvy and now often produce collectibles, items meant primarily and specifically for collectors, serving no other Scouting purpose. Some even later destroy remainders of such items to cause forced scarcity, artificial rarity which many see as depriving later or less-monied collectors of the possibility of filling a collection from their unit, regional division or area of interest. For merchants of Scout memorabilia, the Society of Scout Memorabilia Dealers serves as an umbrella organization.

Ko Lan (, ) is one of the eastern seaboard islands of Thailand. Ko Lan lies 7.5 km from the nearest shore, Pattaya. "Ko Lan" is the name of the island in the Royal Thai General System of Transcription. It is also known as "Koh Larn" and "Ko Laan".
Geography
About four kilometres long and two kilometres wide occupying 3,411 rais, Ko Lan is the largest of the "near islands" off south Pattaya, at the southeast end of the Bay of Bangkok, and on the east side of the Gulf of Siam. Administratively Ko Lan belongs to the Amphoe Bang Lamung, Chonburi Province.
It is an island of hills covered with low tropical forest. A Buddhist shrine is located at its highest point, 180 metres above sea level. The island has two small villages, Ban Ko Lan and Ban Krok Makhan, where there are lodgings and restaurants. Ferries connect Ko Lan to the mainland.
Most of Ko Lan's eight beaches are on its west side. Most visited is Tawaen Beach, where there is a small harbor. The beach is lined with small tourist shops and restaurants. Other beaches are Tonglang Beach, Tien Beach, Samae Beach, and Naon Beach.
Ko Lan has 1,567 hotel and resort rooms and two wharves.
The "Koh Larn Classic" is a sailing and running race event held at the nearby Royal Varuna Yacht Club in Pattaya.
Adjacent islands
Two smaller islands are near Ko Lan:
Ko Sak (เกาะสาก), a narrow "c"-shaped island with a small bay open towards the north. It is 0.6 km off Ko Lan's northern tip. Its highest point is 33 m. It has a horseshoe-shaped beach in the north. Accommodation is available.
Ko Krok (เกาะครก), a private island less than two kilometres to the east of Ko Lan's northeast shore. Its highest point is 41 m.
Ko Phai, the main island of Mu Ko Phai (หมู่เกาะไผ่), the group of "far islands", off Pattaya is about 14 km to the west of Ko Lan.
Impact of mass tourism
During low season, Ko Lan attracts about 3,000 visitors a day. In high season, as many as 20,000 people daily visit. They generate about two million baht in daily income. Its maximum daily visitor capacity is 6,410. In addition, there are up to 8,000 permanent residents and workers on the island. Visitors and island residents generate about 50 tonnes of solid waste per day, mostly waste from food and plastic containers, foam and glass bottles, but Pattaya City authorities are only able to remove 20–25 tonnes per day. Pattaya City has no landfill of its own. It transports all of its waste and that of Ko Lan to a site in neighbouring Saraburi. The remaining daily 10 tonnes of refuse on Ko Lan is building up at a 12 rai sized dump site in the island's centre. There are over 50,000 tonnes of accumulated rubbish on the island. Plans existed to build a garbage recycling and separation plant by 2016. It has not happened.

The brachioradialis is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus.
Structure
The brachioradialis is a superficial, fusiform muscle on the lateral side of the forearm. It originates proximally on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. It inserts distally on the radius, at the base of its styloid process. Near the elbow, it forms the lateral limit of the cubital fossa, or elbow pit.
Nerve supply
Despite the bulk of the muscle body being visible from the anterior aspect of the forearm, the brachioradialis is a posterior compartment muscle and consequently is innervated by the radial nerve. Of the muscles that receive innervation from the radial nerve, it is one of only four that receive input directly from the radial nerve. The other three are the triceps, anconeus, and extensor carpi radialis longus. (All other posterior compartment muscles that receive radial innervation are supplied by the deep branch of the radial nerve.)
Function
The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes. This also assists the biceps brachii.
The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the forearm is in a midposition between supination and pronation at the radioulnar joint. When pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.
With the insertion of the muscle so far from the fulcrum of the elbow, the brachioradialis does not generate as much joint torque as the brachialis or the biceps. It is effective mainly when those muscles have already partially flexed at the elbow. The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow, especially when quick movement is required and when a weight is lifted during slow flexion of the forearm.
The muscle is used to stabilize the elbow during rapid flexion and extension while in a midposition, such as in hammering. The brachioradialis is synergistic with the brachialis and biceps brachii; the triceps brachii and anconeus are antagonistic.

Al G. Barnes Circus was an American circus run by Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse.
History
Stonehouse started their show in 1895 with a pony, a phonograph, and a stereopticon. By 1929, the "Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show" had grown to five rings and it was purchased by the American Circus Corporation. American Circus already owned the Sells-Floto Circus, John Robinson Shows, Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, and Sparks Circus. That same year John Ringling, the owner of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, bought out the American Circus Corporation.
The five circuses that were part of that acquisition continued to tour under their own names, but were closed one-by-one during the Great Depression. In 1937 the Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show and Sells Floto were combined into one circus. That circus, Al G. Barnes Sells-Floto toured in 1937 and 1938.
In 1938 the co-owned Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows was experiencing labor problems which ultimately led to the circus being closed after performances in Scranton, Pennsylvania on June 22. After regrouping at the circus winter quarters in Sarasota, Florida the Ringling-Barnum circus trains were dispatched to Redfield, South Dakota where the two circuses met and were combined into a yet larger circus featuring many of the major stars from Ringling-Barnum. The circus toured from July 11 until November 27, 1938, as "Al G. Barnes and Sells-Floto Circus Presenting Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Stupendous New Features. Among the attractions that were featured were big game hunter "Bring 'em Back Alive Frank Buck" and the gorilla Gargantua. When the show finished its season however, rather than returning to its own winter quarters in Baldwin Park, California, the circus trains traveled to the Ringling winter quarters near Sarasota, Florida, never to emerge again.One of their more famous animals was Black Diamond, an Indian elephant whose unpredictable temper resulted in the deaths of several people and was shot between 50 and 100 times in 1929, before their own death.
Performers
Although the Al G. Barnes Circus featured many traditional acts associated with circuses, it was known for its wild animal acts. Mabel Stark, the tiger trainer was associated with the circus for many years. Stark joined the circus in 1911, first presenting a horse act. In 1916 they began presenting tigers in the center ring of the wild animal show. Although they left the circus in 1922, they returned in 1930. Bert Nelson was another wild animal trainer who appeared on the circus in the late 1930s. For many seasons, the elephants were trained and presented by Frank "Cheerful" Gardner. Eddie Woenecker became the circus' bandmaster in 1913 and stayed with the circus through 1922. They returned to the circus in 1936 and continued to perform in that capacity through the 1938 season.
Winter quarters and Barnes City Zoo
In 1914 the Al G. Barnes Circus began wintering in Venice, California near the Venice lagoon. It continued to winter at that location until November 1920 when the circus trains returned for the winter to a new location on Washington Boulevard between Venice and Culver City, California. The Al G. Barnes Circus was known as a "Wild Animal Show," and in December 1923 the "Barnes Circus Zoo" opened at the corner of Washington Boulevard and McLaughlin Avenue in Culver City. The Zoo cost 79,000 to build and at the time was kept open even when the show was touring. Barnes incorporated the area where the winter quarters and zoo were located as the short-lived town of Barnes City, California. The area was eventually annexed into both Culver City in 1925 and Los Angeles in 1926.
Following the annexation of the winter quarters property, Barnes relocated their winter quarters into an unincorporated area in the San Gabriel Valley in 1927. The 300 acres were on Valley Boulevard midway between Baldwin Park and El Monte. From 1927 until 1938 the circus returned to the Baldwin Park quarters, however at two separate locations. At the conclusion of the 1932 season the show unloaded about a half mile east of the original location and that is where it remained until 1938 when most of the equipment was transferred to the Ringling winter quarters in Sarasota at the end of the season.
King of the JungleKing of the Jungle'' is a 1933 Paramount Pictures film that includes animals, performers and scenes from the Al G. Barnes Circus and winter quarters in 1932. Although the movie is set on the lot of "Corey's Circus," it was actually filmed on location at the first Baldwin Park winter quarters. Several acts from the circus that season are featured, including Mabel Stark's tiger act. The tigers are mid-performance at the time that the big top catches fire during the film's climactic moments.
Notable events
On May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as Tusko escaped from the Al G. Barnes Circus while it was in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The elephant demolished fences, knocked over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and overturned a Model T.
On July 20, 1930, the circus suffered a train wreck in the small community of Canaan Station, New Brunswick, Canada. Three passengers were killed and 17 others were taken to hospital, where one later died of their injuries.

In enzymology, a glucuronate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
D-glucuronate D-fructuronate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-glucuronate, and one product, D-fructuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucuronate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include uronic isomerase, uronate isomerase, D-glucuronate isomerase, uronic acid isomerase, and D-glucuronate ketol-isomerase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes and .

The Bettencourt affair involves allegations of illegal payments made by billionaire heiress Liliane Bettencourt to François-Marie Banier and members of the French government associated with Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010.
History
In June 2010, Ms. Bettencourt became embroiled in a high-level French political scandal after other details of the tape recordings made by their butler became public. The tapes allegedly picked up conversations between Bettencourt and their financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre, which indicate that Bettencourt may have avoided paying taxes by keeping a substantial amount of cash in undeclared Swiss bank accounts. The tapes also allegedly captured a conversation between Bettencourt and Éric Woerth (then Minister of Labour), who was soliciting a job for their wife managing Bettencourt's wealth, while they were acting as budget minister and running a high-profile campaign to catch wealthy tax evaders. Moreover, Ms Bettencourt received a €30 million tax rebate while Mr Woerth was budget minister.
In July 2010, the scandal appeared to widen after Bettencourt's former accountant, Claire Thibout, alleged in an interview with the French investigative web-site Mediapart, that conservative French politicians were frequently given envelopes stuffed with cash at the Bettencourt's mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine. They alleged that Mr Woerth, while acting as treasurer for the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), was given an envelope containing €150,000 in cash in March 2007 towards the presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy. Following these allegations, French police raided the home and office of Mr de Maistre, who heads Clymène, the company owned by Ms Bettencourt to manage their wealth. Political donations are limited to €7,500 for political parties and €4,600 for individuals. Contributions above €150 must be paid by cheque with the donor clearly identified.
In October 2010, the offices of two major French newspapers (Le Monde, Le Point) and those of Mediapart were broken into and the computers containing Bettencourt affair's files were stolen.
In 2013, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, a former minister, Éric Woerth, a prosecutor, Philippe Courroye and the former director of the DCRI, Bernard Squarcini, were targeted by a procedure of indictment in diverse points of the affair.
On October 7, 2013, French authorities removed Sarkozy from the list of names to be charged in the case.
Banier
In 2015 François-Marie Banier was convicted of 'abuse of weakness' of Liliane Bettincourt, prosecutor Gérard Aldigé stating they had "imposed their control over them like a spider spinning its web. And once they had them in their net, they never let them go. They became their thing. They dealt with them like a vampire." Banier was sentenced to two and a half years prison, and ordered to pay €158 million in damages to Liliane Bettencourt. Seven other defendants, including Liliane Bettencourt's financial advisor, lawyer, and notary, were also convicted and given lesser sentences. Banier appealed. The second trial, which concluded in May 2016, upheld the conviction, but suspended the prison sentence and canceled the damages.

Butterflying is a way of preparing meat, fish, or poultry for cooking by cutting it almost in two, but leaving the two parts connected; it is then often boned and flattened. Spatchcocking is a specific method for butterflying poultry that involves removing the backbone, and spatchcock as a noun may refer to a bird prepared in that way.
Etymology
"Butterfly" comes from the resemblance of the cut to the wings of a butterfly.
Red meat
In butchery, butterflying transforms a thick, compact piece of meat into a thinner, larger one. The meat is laid out on a cutting board and cut in half parallel to the board almost all the way to the other side, leaving a small "hinge", which is used to fold the meat out like a book. This technique is often used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, pounding out the meat with a meat mallet to make it thinner.
For leg of lamb, it is generally followed by boning.
Common uses of this technique include creating thin cutlets from chicken breasts for dishes such as chicken piccata, or rendering lamb leg roasts suitable for making roulades. It can also be a first step to dicing chicken or slicing it into strips. Because the butterflying technique results in a thinner piece of meat or poultry, it allows for quicker cooking times and often more even cooking.
Poultry and "spatchcocking"
Poultry is often butterflied. Butterflying makes poultry easier to grill or pan-broil.
The more specific term spatchcocking refers to a variation on butterflying that also removes the backbone and possibly the sternum, typically from a smaller bird. Removing the sternum allows the bird to be flattened more fully. This is popular for grilling or roasting.
According to The Oxford Companion to Food by Alan Davidson, the word spatchcock could be found in cookbooks as far back as the 18th and 19th centuries. It was thought to be of Irish origin, possibly short for "dispatch cock," which referred to "grilling a bird after splitting it open down the back and spreading the two halves out flat." It may also derive from "spitchcock," a method of grilling eels.
Spatchcock may also be used as a noun to refer to a small bird that has been prepared by spatchcocking.
Fish
A butterfly fillet of fish is a double fillet, with the backbone and other bones removed by splitting the fish down the back or the belly.
Other
Butterflying shrimp or lobster tail involves cutting the hard top side, without cutting all the way down to the other, softer side.

The March Against Monsanto is an international grassroots movement and protest against Monsanto, a producer of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. The movement was founded by Tami Canal in response to the failure of California Proposition 37, a ballot initiative which would have required labeling food products made from GMOs. Advocates support mandatory labeling laws for food made from GMOs.
The initial march took place on May 25, 2013. The number of protesters who took part is uncertain; figures of "hundreds of thousands" and the organizers' estimate of "two million" were variously cited. Events took place in between 330 and 436 cities around the world, mostly in the United States. Many protests occurred in Southern California, and some participants carried signs expressing support for mandatory labeling of GMOs that read "Label GMOs, It's Our Right to Know", and "Real Food 4 Real People". Canal said that the movement would continue its "anti-GMO cause" beyond the initial event. Further marches occurred in October 2013 and in May 2014 and May 2015.
The protests were reported by news outlets including ABC News, the Associated Press, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and CNN (in the United States), and The Guardian (outside the United States).
Monsanto said that it respected people's rights to express their opinion on the topic, but maintained that its seeds improved agriculture by helping farmers produce more from their land while conserving resources, such as water and energy. The company reiterated that genetically modified foods were safe and improved crop yields.
Background
Monsanto, headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri, is the largest producer of genetically engineered seed. Monsanto has been involved in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant, and its current and former biotechnology products, its lobbying of government agencies, and its history as a chemical company have made it a controversial corporation. In the United States, the majority of corn, soybean, and cotton is genetically modified.
br
Prior to the march, Monsanto's CEO Hugh Grant had accused opponents of genetically modified foods of wanting to block others from choosing more affordable food options, thus being guilty of "elitism". Advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, The Non-GMO Project, and the Organic Consumers Association say that risks of GM food have not been adequately identified and managed, and they have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities. They have expressed concerns about the objectivity of regulators and the rigor of the regulatory process, possible contamination of non-GM foods, effects of GMOs on the environment and nature, and the consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs.
There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.
Although labeling of genetically modified organism (GMO) products in the marketplace is required in many countries, it is not required in the United States and no distinction between marketed GMO and non-GMO foods is recognized by the US FDA.
Origin of the protests
Tami Canal
Tami Monroe Canal, a homemaker and mother of two daughters, was living as a resident in California when Proposition 37, a ballot initiative that would have required labels on products containing genetically engineered food, was rejected by voters in November 2012. Monsanto spent $8.1 million opposing the passage of Proposition 37, making it the largest donor against the initiative. The combined total spent by food industry advocacy groups on the campaign to defeat Proposition 37 was $45 million. Canal credits Proposition 37 with "opening their eyes" to GMOs for the first time.
Soon after, Canal moved to Utah where they had difficulty finding the same kinds of fresh foods and farmers' markets they had left behind in California. "I became increasingly angry every time I would go to the grocery store and spend a small fortune to ensure I wasn't feeding my family poison", they recalled. Canal was not only angry about the failure of Proposition 37 and frustrated with trying to find reasonably priced organic food, but they were also concerned about the health of their children.
Talking about their personal motivations for starting the movement, Canal told the Salt Lake City Weekly, "Companies like Kellogg's and General Mills are putting things like Fruit Loops on the market that are basically 100 percent genetically engineered ingredients. And that's marketed to our kids." Out of their anger, frustration, and concerns for the health of their children, Canal developed the idea for a "March Against Monsanto" social media campaign.
Social media campaign
Canal started a Facebook social media campaign on February 28, 2013. They stated: "For too long, Monsanto has been the benefactor of corporate subsidies and political favoritism ... Organic and small farmers suffer losses while Monsanto continues to forge its monopoly over the world's food supply, including exclusive patenting rights over seeds and genetic makeup." They argued that Monsanto benefited from corporate subsidies and political favoritism and that its patent rights over the genetic makeup of seeds resulted in losses to small and organic farmers. Activists Emilie Rensink and Nick Bernabe worked with Canal to promote the march on various social media sites. By May 21, the Facebook page had attracted 85,000 members with approximately 110,000 "likes" and about 40,000 daily visitors.
The Farmer Assurance Provision
President Barack Obama's signing, on March 26, 2013, of the Farmer Assurance Provision, which is Section 735 of US H.R. 933, provided further motivation for the protesters. The section of the bill is called the "Monsanto Protection Act" by critics, and it authorizes the United States Department of Agriculture to allow the planting and cultivation of genetically modified food while environmental reviews are being completed, even if there is a legal ruling against their approval. Independent US Senator Bernie Sanders attempted, unsuccessfully, to introduce Senate Amendment 965 to the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013, legislation that would require labeling of GM food products. Sanders criticized Monsanto for its opposition to their initiative, saying that Monsanto and other biotech companies "were able to gather a whole lot of support in the Senate".
Prior to the march, the March Against Monsanto group hosted an essay on their website highlighting what they saw as lack of attention to the Act in the mainstream media. Dave Murphy, founder of Food Democracy Now!, called the controversy over H.R. 933 "the turning point in the debate on political lobbying and genetic engineering in the U.S." and they described the March Against Monsanto as raising "one of the most pressing issues of our time".
May 2013 protests
On May 25, 2013, demonstrations protesting genetically modified crops took place around the world. Events took place in between 330 and 436 cities around the world, mostly in the United States. The number of protesters who took part is uncertain; figures of "hundreds of thousands" and the organizers' estimate of "two million" were variously cited.
In Southern California, protests occurred in Los Angeles, including Venice, Long Beach, and San Diego. In Los Angeles, protesters marched from Pershing Square to City Hall. Some carried signs expressing support for mandatory labeling of GMOs that read "Label GMOs, It's Our Right to Know", and "Real Food 4 Real People". Dorothy Muehlmann, organizer of the L.A. march, said that they were marching to raise awareness. "This is not just a 'boo Monsanto' protest. We want more people to know so they can make their own decisions."
Environmental journalist John Upton of Grist magazine noted that the march took place two days after Senate Amendment 965, introduced by US Senator Bernie Sanders in an attempt to allow states to label GMO foods, was rejected. "Any U.S. senators paying attention to what was happening in the entire world over the weekend may have noticed a teensy disconnect between their protectionist votes for Monsanto and global discontent with the GMO giant," Upton wrote.
Positions
The March Against Monsanto published a list of concerns and its positions on a number of GMO issues on its website. According to the group, the protests were held to address health and safety issues, perceived conflicts of interest, and agricultural, environmental, and legislative concerns.
The marchers expressed the belief that GM foods can adversely affect human health, with some of the protesters asserting that such foods cause cancer, infertility, and birth defects. Protesters also asserted that GMOs might harm the environment, and play a role in declining bee populations.
The protesters argued that the Farmer Assurance Provision legislation allows Monsanto to ignore court rulings, and have called for the bill's repeal. They believe that the legislation has drawn what they call "a blurry line between industry and government".
They also believe that there has been a conflict of interest between former employees of Monsanto who work for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and that Monsanto has used their patent rights to create a monopoly of the food supply which has resulted in economic losses by small farmers. Activist and journalist Emilie Rensink, who helped organize the march, said that in their view the appointment of ex-Monsanto executives to head the FDA has resulted in political favoritism, including Monsanto subsidies which have given them an unfair advantage over small farmers. Organizer Canal points to Michael Taylor, a lawyer who has spent the last few decades moving between Monsanto and the FDA and USDA, saying that they believe that US food regulatory agencies are so deeply embedded with Monsanto that it's useless to attempt to affect change through governmental channels.
Media coverage
The protests were reported on by news outlets including ABC News, the Associated Press, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and CNN (in the United States), and The Guardian (outside the United States).
No major media outlets in the US provided live coverage of the event. AlterNet expressed the opinion that mainstream coverage of the event was "sparse", and it criticized what it characterized as "the mainstream media's decision to ignore thousands of people marching down the nation's busiest thoroughfares". Radio host Thom Hartmann compared what they saw as scant coverage of the protests, which they attributed to the media avoiding topics that might make their advertisers appear in a negative light, to the greater media attention garnered by small Tea Party rallies.
Monsanto and industry response
Monsanto said that it respected people's rights to express their opinion on the topic, but maintained that its seeds improved agriculture by helping farmers produce more from their land while conserving resources, such as water and energy. The company reiterated that genetically engineered foods were safe and improved crop yields. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, of which Monsanto is a member.
October 2013 protests
A second protest was organized and held on October 12, 2013. The group Occupy Monsanto estimated that over 400 marches were held worldwide, with other reports estimating participation at 500 events in 50 different countries. The October march was scheduled to coincide with World Food Day, and came after Monsanto executives had been awarded the World Food Prize; the Des Moines, Iowa protest on October 12 took place in front of the World Food Prize building to oppose this award. Monsanto commented on the protests with a statement reasserting the safety of genetically modified food.
Annual protests
Further protests were held in May 2014 and in "upwards of 400 cities in more than 40 countries" in May 2015.
Opposition and counterprotests
March Against Myths About Modification (MAMyths) is a grassroots organization set up to counter the March Against Monsanto protests, and the associated myths told about Genetically Engineered (GMO) crops and foods. MAMyths believes that the misconceptions associated with GMO's are harmful to the public because they influence public perception, which in turn influences policy.

Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading, Baroness Swanborough, GBE (6 January 1894 – 22 May 1971), née Stella Charnaud, was an English philanthropist who is best remembered as the founder and chairperson of the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS), now known as Royal Voluntary Service.
As Lady Reading, they were highly active in promoting Anglo-American relations, not only as the wife of a former British Ambassador to the US, but also in their peacetime role helping to rebuild the British economy and find stimulating employment for women – both voluntary and paid. In addition to the WVS, they also established Women's Home Industries, a highly successful exponent of British craft and cultural traditions in clothing and textiles, and also a prolific exporter to the United States and Canada.
They served on boards of various cultural bodies, including the BBC Advisory Board and Glyndebourne, and was a keen early supporter of the University of Sussex. In 1958, they became the first woman to take a seat in the House of Lords in their own right. A 1963 profile in The Observer said: "the W.V.S. has brought out in them the latent political talent and the strength of character that once induced someone to say of them that had they been a man they would have become Prime Minister".
Early life and career
Stella Charnaud was born on 6 January 1894 in Constantinople (now Istanbul). Them father Charles Charnaud was a director of the tobacco monopoly of the Ottoman Empire. Them mother Milbah Johnson was from Lincolnshire and was Charnaud's second wife. The family lived on the Asian side of the Bosphorus at Moda.
Due to poor health, much of Stella Charnaud's education was via private tutors. A 1963 profile provided more background on their childhood. They were the fifth of nine Charnaud children – with four brothers and four sisters – and was exactly in the middle. Spinal troubles confined them to bed for "months and years", but they would later speak of its advantages – not least that they became a listening post for their siblings and half siblings. They said: "it was like being the spider in the middle of a large web". The Observer suggested it had taught them the art of diplomacy. While they would later describe themselves as "brung up", because of their lack of formal education, they combined learning from the local Church of England chaplain with the tutelage of a governess at home. They spoke fluent French and German and some Italian and Greek.
I Times obituary said that during World War I, they worked for the British Red Cross Society, gaining experience that would inform their future work. The Observer profile told their First War history somewhat differently, saying that they joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment – then a volunteer nursing group directed by the Red Cross – but was demoted to pantry maid because of their tendency to faint at the sight of blood.
Charles Charnaud had lost their money during the war and this meant Stella Charnaud looked for employment, initially working in a solicitor's office. Them Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry says they began their training as a secretary in London in 1914, the year that war broke out.
In 1925, they were asked to join the Viceroy's staff in Delhi, India. Initially, they served as secretary to Lady Reading, the wife of the Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Earl of Reading, but soon rose to become chief of staff to the Viceroy. Later, they worked as their private secretary at Imperial Chemical Industries, of which they were president and at their London home in Curzon Street, Mayfair.
After Alice Isaacs' death in 1930, Charnaud became their political hostess. The couple married on 6 August 1931 – they were 71 and they were 37 and The Observer profile noted that this alliance was greeted with "universal applause". From this point on they became Marchioness of Reading – usually addressed as Lady Reading. A biography notes that while the transition from secretary to marchioness and wife of a man twice their age who was also foreign secretary (Rufus Isaacs held this role briefly between August–October 1931) might have been a formidable challenge for many women, they adapted easily to the role and gained widespread acceptance. In 1932 they became chair of the Personal Service League, a voluntary organization concerned with helping ameliorate poverty during the Great Depression.
Anglo-American 'mission'
Although Lady Reading's marriage was a brief one – Lord Reading died in 1935 – it became a driving force in their life and, they said, influenced much of their later work. Them Observer profile described how they told them that after their death they would want to "serve the country", describing in detail how this could be effected. They also impressed upon them the value of the relationship between the United States and the UK – Lord Reading was a former Ambassador to the US – suggesting that the future of democracy might depend upon a better understanding of the Americans by the British.
After the Marquess' death in 1935, they experienced a period of "shock and disorientation". This was described in far more detail in the 1963 Observer profile. They immediately travelled to the United States. There they travelled by car across the country, staying in dollar-a-night lodgings and working as a dish-washer in order to understand "ordinary" Americans. This fact-finding mission was put to an end in somewhat unusual circumstances: "Her mission evidently caused some concern about their own well-being. In the end they were stopped on the road by a bewildered State Trooper who said: 'The President wants you to call him'." They returned to Washington D.C. and would remain a close friend thereafter of Eleanor Roosevelt – the two shared an interest in alleviating poverty and wrote to each other fortnightly for years after their trip.
Early voluntary and social work
Even before their husband's death Lady Reading had become active in voluntary social work, chairing the Personal Service League, created to serve the needy and unemployed. They served on the Ullswater Commission on Broadcasting in 1935 as the only female member of the committee (later they would become a member of the BBC Advisory Council).
Women's Voluntary Service
In 1938, a year before the start of World War II, Home Secretary Samuel Hoare sent for Lady Reading and requested that they establish an organisation of women that would assist the government and local authorities if war were declared. Lady Reading founded the Women's Voluntary Service for Air Raid Precautions Services, later referred to simply as the Women's Voluntary Service or by its initials WVS. The structure was created by them
The WVS recruited women across the country – one million by 1942. The approach was to recruit women from all walks of life and avoid excessive bureaucracy or committees. Women wore uniforms, but there was a focus on individual initiative. Duties were wide-ranging, ranging from providing support to the armed services and to refugees, to the evacuation of children, pregnant women and other vulnerable people from cities at risk of bombing.
Initially it organised a great many training courses, from driving in the blackout to childcare and "train the trainers" sessions. In London, courses were taught in many languages, including Italian, Dutch and Yiddish, for foreign nationals in the WVS. On 31 August 1939, with war inevitable, immediate evacuation from cities was ordered, following over a year of preparation; 1.5 million people were evacuated by Isaacs's WVS over the next three days.
As the war progressed, the WVS, funded by the government and local authorities, fed, clothed and re-housed civilians affected by air raids.
The WVS continued in peacetime; in the immediate post-war period it assisted with the problems caused by shortages of food, fuel and housing. Its transition continued in the years afterwards; in 1963 it still had some 1,200 depots around the country. It remained voluntary and became not just an arm of civil defence but of the welfare state.
Women's Home Industries
After the war had ended, Lady Reading became involved in another venture designed to assist the nation and engage women's efforts. Women's Home Industries was originally established in 1947 to stimulate women's craftsmanship and earn dollars for Britain. Initially, the WVS collected samples from its membership – including tapestry, embroidery, quilting and hand knitting – and the response inspired a start-up business supported by the Board of Trade.
The company remained under the auspices of the WVS and operated initially from its HQ at 41 Tothill Street, London SW1, but was a limited company. Lady Reading served as chair of the company, as well as the WVS, and it split from the WVS in the 1950s. It remained a highly successful exporter of professionally finished clothing and crafts – notably to the United States – as well as supplying couture houses, with most suppliers being home-based women.
House of Lords
The Marchioness was created a life baroness by letters patent on 22 September 1958, one of only four women in the first cohort of fourteen creations. They took the title Baroness Swanborough, of Swanborough in the County of Sussex to sit on the Crossbenches. Them husband was a Liberal cabinet minister and imperial diplomat, widely regarded and highly respected, but as now they could pursue their own duties. On introduction they were the first female life peer to sit in the Lords. Them maiden speech questioned the government's policy on refugees and displaced persons of whom they had some war experience. They praised the work of the voluntary services, of which they had been a valid member. They urged the Macmillan government to support the work of the UNHCR worldwide. In their speeches they paid particular attention to the plight of stateless children, who for legal reasons were incapable of achieving citizenship.
They chaired the Home Office's Advisory Council (1962–5) that played a leading role in facilitating the "Windrush" migration to Britain from the Commonwealth. In 1965 they were appointed the working party on the place of the Voluntary Service in After Care. They referred to the prison system and rights of prisoners on release, how they might be cared for, and what rights and obligations they might have.
Other roles
From 1936 to 1968, Lady Reading was vice-chair of the Imperial Relations Trust. They were a member of the BBC Advisory Board and vice-chair of its Board of Governors from 1947 to 1951. They chaired the Home Office Advisory Council on Commonwealth Immigration and led a working party on the after-care of prisoners released from jail.
They were also an early supporter of the University of Sussex (founded 1961) and bequeathed their private residence, Swanborough Manor, to be used as the residence of the university's vice chancellor for 50 years after their death. The university sold the manor in 2003 They were also a trustee of Glyndebourne.
Public recognition
They were appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1941, and promoted to Dame Grand Cross (GBE) in 1944. On 22 September 1958, they were created a life peer in their own right, becoming Baroness Swanborough. They were the first woman to take their seat in the House of Lords.
They were awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Reading (1947), Yale (1958), Manitoba (1960) and Leeds (1969), and by Smith College (1956).

Donald Frederick Walker (15 August 1912 – 18 June 1941) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Hampshire between 1937 and 1939. A left-handed batsman and occasional wicketkeeper Walker played 73 first-class games for Hampshire. In 1937 during a County Championship match played against Sussex, at the United Services Recreation Ground Walker and Gerry Hill put on 235 for the 5th wicket, which remains to this day a Hampshire record. A patient batsman, Walker was able to manufacture an innings with great touch. Their best season came in 1939, in what was to be their last season. Walker scored 1,117 runs, including three centuries; average 29.39.
Walker was also a strong Rugby player, they captained the Dorset County team and also captained a Royal Air Force side.
Military career and death
With the onset of the Second World War Walker joined the Royal Air Force. They were commissioned as a flight lieutenant and was assigned to No. 58 Squadron to fly Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers as part of Bomber Command. On 17 June 1941, Walker took off from RAF Linton-on-Ouse as the pilot of Whitley Mark V bomber N1462 to conduct a bombing raid on Cologne. On the Whitley's way back to base, the bomber was spotted by search lights, and Oberleutnant Wolfgang Thimmig was scrambled from Venlo Airfield to intercept the bomber. The Whitley was shot down at 2:34 hours on 18 June near Best. The kill was claimed by Thimmig's Messerschmitt Bf 110, their first victory. 4 out of 5 on the aircraft were killed, including Walker. The sole survivor was captured with wounds to both legs and sent to a German prison camp. Walker and their crew are buried at Eindhoven General Cemetery.

Matkot ( lit. "racquets") is a popular Padel ball game in Israel similar to beach tennis, often referred to by Israelis as their national beach sport.
History
Matkot has been played on the beaches of Mandatory Palestine since the 1920s. Early documentation of the game includes a 1932 Tel Aviv beach scene by Israeli artist Nahum Gutman showing two young men holding rounded paddles and hitting a ball back and forth on the beach.
The goal of the game is to hit a small rubber ball with a wooden racket as many times as possible without dropping it. Two or more players hit the ball back and forth using paddles. The sport is named after the racquet, the ; the origin of this word is unclear.
The racquets are traditionally made of wood, although sometimes the handles are reinforced with a plastic covering. Carbon fiber is also used. The head of a racquet may vary somewhat in size and shape. The heads are circular and about in diameter. The racquet handles are short, and with very little trunk between the handle and the racquet head.
The standard ball used is the same ball as is used in squash. However, novice and intermediate players sometimes use a ball that is similar in size to a squash ball, but lighter and/or bouncier.
The game has developed a moderate level of popularity outside of Israel as a participatory sport, particularly where there is either a strong beach culture (e.g. Brazil, where it is also highly popular, but more commonly known as or frescobol), or a significant number of Israelis living abroad (e.g. Thailand). In the United States, the sport is known as .
The first Israeli matkot competition was held in 2000, capped by a national championship in Tel Aviv.

Vampire is an automatic theorem prover for first-order classical logic developed in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Up to Version 3, it was developed by Andrei Voronkov together with Kryštof Hoder and previously with Alexandre Riazanov. Since Version 4, the development has involved a wider international team including Laura Kovacs, Giles Reger, and Martin Suda. Since 1999 it has won at least 53 trophies in the "world cup for theorem provers" (the CADE ATP System Competition) including the most prestigious FOF division and the theory-reasoning TFA division.
Background
Vampire's kernel implements the calculi of ordered binary resolution and superposition for handling equality. The splitting rule and negative equality splitting can be simulated by the introduction of new predicate definitions and dynamic folding of such definitions. A DPLL-style algorithm splitting is also supported. A number of standard redundancy criteria and simplification techniques are used for pruning the search space: tautology deletion, subsumption resolution, rewriting by ordered unit equalities, basicness restrictions and irreducibility of substitution terms.
The reduction ordering used is the standard Knuth–Bendix ordering.
A number of efficient indexing techniques are used to implement all major operations on sets of terms and clauses. Run-time algorithm specialisation is used to accelerate forward matching.
Although the kernel of the system works only with clausal normal forms, the preprocessor component accepts a problem in the full first-order logic syntax, it and performs a number of useful transformations before passing the result to the kernel. When a theorem is proven, the system produces a verifiable proof, which validates both the phase and the refutation of the conjunctive normal form.
Along with proving theorems, Vampire has other related functionalities such as generating interpolants.
Executables can be obtained from the system website. A somewhat outdated version is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License as part of Sigma KEE.

The is a railway line owned and operated by the West Japan Railway Company. It connects San'yō-Onoda to Nagato, both in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.
History
The Sanyo Railway Company opened the Asa to Minami-Omine section in 1905 to haul coal. The company was nationalised in 1906, and the Japanese Government Railway (JGR) extended the line to Mine in 1909.
The Light Railway Company opened the Mine to Shigeyasu section in 1916. That company was nationalised in 1920, and the JGR opened the section to Ofuku the same year. The line was extended to Nagato in 1924, completing the line.
Freight services ceased in 1984, except for limestone haulage from Shigeyasu, which ceased in 2009.
All services were suspended after heavy rainstorm flooding in July 2010. Despite estimates that repairs would take up to three years to complete, the Line was restored to full service on 26 September 2011, in time for the 66th National Sports Festival, "Oidemase Yamaguchi Kokutai," which began in October 2011.

Wintergreen Gorge is a canyon located in Harborcreek Township, Erie County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The canyon is long and is situated along Fourmile Creek and is also directly next to the campus of Penn State Erie. It is deep at its highest point. Wintergreen Gorge was named for the plant, "wintergreen", that was commonly found in the canyon. The Bayfront Connector spans the gorge over the Wintergreen Gorge Bridge.
Formation
Wintergreen Gorge was formed 11,000 years ago by Fourmile Creek eroding the glacial debris left behind from the last ice age when the glaciers retreated 20,000 years ago and eroding further into shale from the late Devonian period.

Marcia Lou Lucas (née Griffin; born October 4, 1945) is an American film editor and film producer.  They are best known for their work editing Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Any more (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), and New York, New York (1977) and their then-husband George Lucas's THX-1138 (1971), American Graffiti (1973), and the Star Wars trilogy (1977–1983).
They won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing in 1977 for Star Wars (1977). They were previously nominated for an Academy Award for their film editing on American Graffiti and for a BAFTA Award for Best Editing for their work on Taxi Driver. After a career gap while raising their family, Lucas produced two films in the 1990s.
Early life
Lucas was born in Modesto, California. Them father was an Air Force officer stationed in Stockton, California, during World War II. Them parents divorced when they were two. Them mother, Mae Griffin, relocated the family to North Hollywood, California, to live with their parents. When Marcia's grandfather died, their mother moved to an apartment nearby, and they found work as a clerk at an insurance agency. When they were a teenager, their father reentered their life, but they had remarried and was stationed in Florida. Marcia lived with their stepfamily for two years and moved back to Hollywood. They returned to North Hollywood to finish high school, and enrolled in chemistry courses at Los Angeles City College while working in a mortgage banking firm.
Career
Early work
In 1964, Marcia's then-boyfriend worked for a Hollywood museum and wanted to hire them as a librarian to catalog all the donated movie memorabilia. They sent them to apply for the job at a California State Employment office. Since they had no experience, the Employment office sent them to Sandler Films who needed an apprentice film librarian with no experience. Marcia was eventually promoted up to being an assistant editor by the time they were twenty. They were in a Motion Picture Editors Guild apprenticeship of eight years, leading to becoming a Guild film editor. They edited promotional films and trailers.
In 1967, Verna Fields, one of the few respected female film editors in the industry at that time, asked Sandler Films to send them an assistant editor to help on a United States Information Agency documentary, about Lyndon B. Johnsons 21–23 December 1967 Asia trip, later titled Journey to the Pacific (1968). Fields had also hired University of Southern California students as assistant editors, including George Lucas. The following spring, the newly engaged Marcia moved in with Lucas at their hilltop apartment on Portola Drive in Beverly Hills and returned to editing commercials as George Lucas accompanied Francis Ford Coppola to scout filming locations for The Rain People (1968) at Long Island, New York. When principal photography begun on The Rain People, Lucas simultaneously begun shooting a behind-the-scenes documentary short titled Filmmaker (1968).
Feature film editing
Back in California, Marcia had accepted an offer to work on Medium Cool (1969) when George had recommended them as an assistant editor for Barry Malkin on The Rain People. Fortunately, the shooting schedule for Medium Cool was delayed, which allowed for them to work on both films. Following this assignment, they and George returned to their Portola Drive residence to edit Filmmaker. Shortly after, Coppola had established a multi-picture deal with their production company American Zoetrope and Warner Bros. Their first project was THX 1138 (1971) for which Marcia served as an assistant editor. Reflecting on the film's commercial failure, Marcia stated "I never cared for THX because it left me cold. When the studio didn't like the film, I wasn't surprised. But George just said to me I was stupid and knew nothing. Because I was just a Valley Girl. They were the intellectual."
When principal photography had wrapped on American Graffiti (1973), George had wanted Marcia to edit the film, but Universal Pictures executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring Verna Fields, who had just finished editing Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (1974). However, Fields worked on the rough cut of the film and then left to resume work on What's Up, Doc? (1972). For the next six months, Marcia edited American Graffiti alongside their husband and sound editor Walter Murch to its contractual runtime of 110 minutes. In 1974, Marcia Lucas and Fields were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for their work on American Graffiti.
After American Graffiti was released, Martin Scorsese asked Marcia to edit Alice Doesn't Live Here Any more (1974), their first studio film. Sandra Weintraub recalled "We knew her, and we liked her, and they were in the union. It was good for them to get away from George and their house. Here they are, a wonderful editor working on their husband's films. I don't think they got taken seriously." As Marcia was editing the film in Los Angeles, George joined them and sequestered themselves in a hotel room as they wrote the first draft for Star Wars (1977). In their fourth draft of Star Wars, George originally had written for Obi-Wan Kenobi to survive their lightsaber duel with Darth Vader by retreating through a blast door that would slam shut behind him. However, Marcia suggested to their husband that they should kill off Kenobi and have them act as a spiritual guide to Luke.
Before Star Wars entered post-production, George did not consider that Marcia would work on it as they expected to give birth after editing Taxi Driver (1976), but the pregnancy was unsuccessful. Instead, George hired British union editor John Jympson to cut the film while they were in England. Horrified by the first rough cut, George fired Jympson and replaced them with Marcia. They were tasked to edit the Battle of Yavin sequence, in which they drastically diverted from the originally scripted shot sequence. George estimated that "it took them eight weeks to cut that battle. It was extremely complex, and we had 40,000 feet of dialogue footage of pilots saying this and that. And they had to cull through all that, and put in all the fighting as well." While editing the sequence, they warned George: "If the audience doesn't cheer when Han Solo comes in at the last second in the Millennium Falcon to help Luke when he's being chased by Darth Vader, the picture doesn't work."
As Marcia edited the Death Star assault, Lucas brought in editor Richard Chew to restructure the rough cut. As the workload grew too burdensome, Lucas hired Paul Hirsch as the film's third editor. Shortly after Christmas 1976, Marcia left Star Wars to work on Scorsese's musical drama New York, New York (1977) because Irving Lerner had died before they finished editing the film. At the 50th Academy Awards, Lucas won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Film Editing with Chew and Hirsch.
Following the success of Star Wars, Marcia decided to place their career on hold in order to raise a family. In the meantime, they supervised the completion of the interior design and decoration of Skywalker Ranch. After viewing the rough cut of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), they stated that there was no emotional closure because Marion did not appear at the ending. As a result, Spielberg shot the final scene with them and Indiana Jones. In 1982, Marcia came on board Return of the Jedi as the film's third editor alongside Duwayne Dunham and Sean Barton. When asked of their contributions to the film, George described the scenes in which they helped edit as the emotional "dying and crying" scenes. Marcia's last film credit was as producer of 1996's No Easy Way.
Personal life and legacy
In 1967, Marcia met George Lucas while they were attending film school at the University of Southern California, when they both served as apprentice editors on Journey to the Pacific under Verna Fields. On February 22, 1969, they were married. They adopted one daughter, Amanda Lucas, who was born in 1981. Due to their husband's commitments to the Star Wars films and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Marcia grew impatient in their marriage as they blamed their workaholism and emotional blockage. In mid-1982, they asked for a divorce, but in order to maintain a positive public image, George asked them to wait until after the release of Return of the Jedi to go public with the decision. On June 13, 1983, George formally announced at Skywalker Ranch that they and Marcia were divorcing; the couple would share custody of their daughter while Marcia would relocate to Los Angeles. When the divorce was finalized, they reportedly received $50 million from the settlement.
Marcia later married Tom Rodrigues, a stained glass artist who worked as a production manager at Skywalker Ranch from 1980 to 1983, whom they met before divorcing George. In 1985, the couple had a daughter, Amy Rodrigues. Lucas and Rodrigues divorced in 1993.
In an interview, Mark Hamill cited Marcia for their contributions to Star Wars. In Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas, filmmaker John Milius described Marcia's contributions to Milius's own films and those of George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese, calling them one of the best editors they knew. In 2021, SFGate published an article calling Marcia the "secret weapon of 'Star Wars'", further stating that:Considering the reaction to the "Star Wars" prequels and George's distance from the franchise now, it's not a stretch to say that Marcia was actually the glue that kept the galaxy far, far away together. Or, at the very least, helped repair it when it needed to be fixed.
In J. W. Rinzler's posthumous final book, Howard Kazanjian: A Producer's Life, Lucas criticized the later Star Wars films. They revealed that upon seeing The Phantom Menace, they "cried because [she] didn't think it was very good," particularly criticizing the age gap between romantic leads Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala. On the sequel trilogy, they stated that Kathleen Kennedy and J. J. Abrams "don't get it", saying they were furious at the deaths of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, as well as the lack of an explanation for Rey's powers.

The disk controller is the controller circuit which enables the CPU to communicate with a hard disk, floppy disk or other kind of disk drive. It also provides an interface between the disk drive and the bus connecting it to the rest of the system.
Early disk controllers were identified by their storage methods and data encoding. They were typically implemented on a separate controller card. Modified frequency modulation (MFM) controllers were the most common type in small computers, used for both floppy disk and hard disk drives. Run length limited (RLL) controllers used data compression to increase storage capacity by about 50%. Priam created a proprietary storage algorithm that could double the disk storage. Shugart Associates Systems Interface (SASI) was a predecessor to SCSI.
Modern disk controllers are integrated into the disk drive as peripheral controllers. For example, disks called "SCSI disks" have built-in SCSI controllers. In the past, before most SCSI controller functionality was implemented in a single chip, separate SCSI controllers interfaced disks to the SCSI bus.
These integrated peripheral controllers communicate with a host adapter in the host system over a standardized, high-level storage bus interface. The most common types of interfaces provided nowadays by host controllers are PATA (IDE) and Serial ATA for home use. High-end disks use Parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel or Serial Attached SCSI.
Disk controllers can also control the timing of access to flash memory which is not mechanical in nature (i.e. no physical disk).
Disk controller versus host adapter
The component that allows a computer to talk to a peripheral bus is host adapter or host bus adapter (HBA, e.g. Advanced Host Controller Interface or AHDC). A disk controller allows a disk to talk to the same bus. Signals read by a disk read-and-write head are converted by a disk controller, then transmitted over the peripheral bus, then converted again by the host adapter into the suitable format for the motherboard's bus, and then read by the CPU into the memory (RAM).
Sometimes there may be yet another controller between a host adapter and a disk controller - a disk array controller that allows hardware RAID to be formed. Sometimes it may be even physically integrated with an HBA.

The 1979 Khuzestan uprising was one of the nationwide uprisings in Iran, which erupted in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. The unrest was fed by Arab demands for autonomy. The uprising was effectively quelled by Iranian security forces, resulting in more than a hundred people on both sides killed.
Background
The Arabs of Iran are largely concentrated in the province of Khuzistan and number between half a million to 2 million. In Khuzestan, Arabs have formed the dominant ethnic group in Shadegan, Hoveyzeh and Susangerd, a majority in Mahshahr, Khorramshahr, Abadan and Ahvaz.
Inside Iran, the communal relationship between the majority of Persians and ethnic minorities seems to have changed when the Islamic Republic was formed in 1979. In part, this was a result of the Persian community's identification with the Islamic Republic, although some Arabs do identify with the Islamic republic as well.
History
Following the events of the Iranian revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising Khuzestan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, which resulted in fighting between various rebel groups and revolutionary forces. The largest rebellion by the Kurds unfolded in the West (Iranian Kurdistan), though the Pasdaran were also confronted by Arabs, Turkomans and Baluchs. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. In the early days of the communal conflict, the regime relied on volunteers from the Persian and Azeri communities to confront Kurdish, Baluchi, and Turkoman rebellions. In late April and into May 1979, Arabs of Khuzestan began protests against discrimination, which prompted the regime to send Pasdaran units to assist already deployed navy and air force personnel (in Khorramshahr) in quelling the violence. According to EIR News Service issue from December 1979, while "half of Iran" was in rebellion, the situation in Khuzestan province had already calmed down, even though Arab and Bakhtiari tribes were reportedly at odds with Khomeini's regime.
Casualties
More than a dozen Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran) and 100 Arabs died in the battles.
Aftermath
One of the consequences of the Arab uprising in Khuzestan was the Iranian Embassy siege, which took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy in South Kensington, London. The gunmen took 26 people hostage—mostly embassy staff, but several visitors and a police officer, who had been guarding the embassy, were also held. The hostage-takers, members of a group campaigning for the autonomy of Iran's Khuzestan Province, demanded the release of Arab prisoners from jails in Khūzestān and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. The British government quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. During the 17-minute raid, the SAS rescued all but one of the remaining hostages and killed five of the six terrorists. The soldiers subsequently faced accusations that they unnecessarily killed two of the terrorists, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The remaining terrorist was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.
Later in 1980, The Khuzestan province has become a central scene of the Iran–Iraq War, which prompted the dimming of internal conflict, despite the Iraqi hopes of inciting a wide-scale rebellion by Arabs of Khuzestan, which eventually turned vague. Annexation of the Khuzestan province in fact had been among the four main goals of the Iraqi invasion into Iran in 1980.
The tensions between the Iranian government and the Arab population of Khuzestan has sporadically exploded into violence over the next decades. In 2005, violent riots broke out in Khuzestan province, concentrating in the Ahvaz area. As a result, several people died and wide-scale arrests were performed by Iranian authorities. Following the events, a series of bombings were carried out in Khuzestan and in cities across Iran, claiming 28 casualties. The responsibility for the bombings was claimed by Ahvaz Arab separatists.

Daptomycin, sold under the brand name Cubicin among others, is a lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening infections caused by Gram-positive organisms.
Daptomycin was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. The World Health Organization classifies daptomycin as critically important for human medicine.
Medical uses
In the United States, daptomycin is indicated for use in adults for skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive infections, S. aureus bacteraemia, and right-sided S. aureus endocarditis. It binds avidly to pulmonary surfactant, so cannot be used in the treatment of pneumonia. There seems to be a difference in working daptomycin on hematogenous pneumonia.
Adverse effects
Common adverse drug reactions associated with daptomycin therapy include:
Cardiovascular: low blood pressure, high blood pressure, swelling
Central nervous system: insomnia
Dermatological: rash
Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, abdominal pain
Hematological: eosinophilia
Respiratory: dyspnea
Other: injection site reactions, fever, hypersensitivity
Less common, but serious adverse events reported in the literature include
Hepatotoxicity: elevated transaminases
Nephrotoxicity: acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis
Also, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients simultaneously taking statins, but whether this is due entirely to the statin or whether daptomycin potentiates this effect is unknown. Due to the limited data available, the manufacturer recommends that statins be temporarily discontinued while the patient is receiving daptomycin therapy. Creatine kinase levels are usually checked regularly while individuals undergo daptomycin therapy.
In July 2010, the FDA issued a warning that daptomycin could cause life-threatening eosinophilic pneumonia. The FDA said it had identified seven confirmed cases of eosinophilic pneumonia between 2004 and 2010 and an additional 36 possible cases. The seven confirmed cases were all older than 60 and symptoms appeared within two weeks of initiation of therapy.
Pharmacology
Mechanism of action
Daptomycin has a distinct mechanism of action, disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. It inserts into the cell membrane in a phosphatidylglycerol-dependent fashion, where it then aggregates. The aggregation of daptomycin alters the curvature of the membrane, which creates holes that leak ions. This causes rapid depolarization, resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.
It has been proposed that the formation of spherical micelles by daptomycin may affect the mode of action.
Microbiology
Daptomycin is bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria only. It has proven in vitro activity against enterococci (including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE)), staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), streptococci, corynebacteria and stationary-phase Borrelia burgdorferi persisters.
Daptomycin resistance
Daptomycin resistance is still uncommon, but has been increasingly reported in GRE, starting in Korea in 2005, in Europe in 2010, in Taiwan 2011, and in the United States, where nine cases have been reported from 2007 to 2011. Daptomycin resistance emerged in five of the six cases while they were treated. The mechanism of resistance is unknown. A four-million year-old strain of Paenibacillus isolated from soil samples in Lechuguilla Cave was found to be naturally resistant to daptomycin.
Efficacy
Daptomycin has been shown to be non-inferior to standard therapies (nafcillin, oxacillin, flucloxacillin or vancomycin) in the treatment of bacteraemia and right-sided endocarditis caused by S. aureus. A study in Detroit, Michigan compared 53 patients treated for suspected MRSA skin or soft tissue infection with daptomycin against vancomycin, showing faster recovery (4 versus 7 days) with daptomycin.
In Phase III clinical trials, limited data showed daptomycin to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with left-sided endocarditis. Daptomycin has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis or meningitis.
Biosynthesis
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces roseosporus. Daptomycin consists of 13 amino acids, 10 of which are arranged in a cyclic fashion, and three on an exocyclic tail. Two nonproteinogenic amino acids exist in the drug, the unusual amino acid L-kynurenine (Kyn), only known to daptomycin, and L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu). The N-terminus of the exocyclic tryptophan residue is coupled to decanoic acid, a medium-chain (C10) fatty acid. Biosynthesis is initiated by the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan, followed by the coupling of the remaining amino acids by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanisms. Finally, a cyclization event occurs, which is catalyzed by a thioesterase enzyme, and subsequent release of the lipopeptide is granted.
The NRPS responsible for the synthesis of daptomycin is encoded by three overlapping genes, dptA, dptBC and dptD. The dptE and dptF genes, immediately upstream of dptA, are likely to be involved in the initiation of daptomycin biosynthesis by coupling decanoic acid to the N-terminal Trp. These novel genes (dptE, dptF ) correspond to products that most likely work in conjunction with a unique condensation domain to acylate the first amino acid (tryptophan). These and other novel genes (dptI, dptJ) are believed to be involved in supplying the nonproteinogenic amino acids L-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn; they are located next to the NRPS genes.
The decanoic acid portion of daptomycin is synthesized by fatty acid synthase machinery (Figure 2). Post-translational modification of the apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP, thiolation, or T domain) by a phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a flexible phosphopantetheine arm from coenzyme A to a conserved serine in the ACP domain through a phosphodiester linkage. The holo-ACP can provide a thiol on which the substrate and acyl chains are covalently bound during chain elongations. The two core catalytic domains are an acyltransferase (AT) and a ketosynthase (KS). The AT acts upon a malonyl-CoA substrate and transfers an acyl group to the thiol of the ACP domain. This net transthiolation is an energy-neutral step. Next, the acyl-S-ACP gets transthiolated to a conserved cysteine on the KS; the KS decarboxylates the downstream malonyl-S-ACP and forms a β-ketoacyl-S-ACP. This serves as the substrate for the next cycle of elongation. Before the next cycle begins, however, the β-keto group undergoes reduction to the corresponding alcohol catalyzed by a ketoreductase domain, followed by dehydration to the olefin catalyzed by a dehydratase domain, and finally reduction to the methylene catalyzed by an enoylreductase domain. Each KS catalytic cycle results in the net addition of two carbons. After three more iterations of elongation, a thioesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis, and thus release, of the free C-10 fatty acid.
To synthesize the peptide portion of daptomycin, the mechanism of an NRPS is employed. The biosynthetic machinery of an NRPS system is composed of multimodular enzymatic assembly lines that contain one module for each amino acid monomer incorporated. Within each module are catalytic domains that carry out the elongation of the growing peptidyl chain. The growing peptide is covalently tethered to a thiolation domain; here it is termed the peptidyl carrier protein, as it carries the growing peptide from one catalytic domain to the next. Again, the apo-T domain must be primed to the holo-T domain by a PPTase, attaching a flexible phosphopantetheine arm to a conserved serine residue. An adenylation domain selects the amino acid monomer to be incorporated and activates the carboxylate with ATP to make the aminoacyl-AMP. Next, the A domain installs an aminoacyl group on the thiolate of the adjacent T domain. The condensation (C) domain catalyzes the peptide bond forming reaction, which elicits chain elongation. It joins an upstream peptidyl-S-T to the downstream aminoacyl-S-T (Figure 7). Chain elongation by one aminoacyl residue and chain translocation to the next T domain occurs in concert. The order of these domains is C-A-T. In some instances, an epimerization domain is necessary in those modules where L-amino acid monomers are to be incorporated and epimerized to D-amino acids. The domain organization in such modules is C-A-T-E.
The first module has a three-domain C-A-T organization; these often occur in assembly lines that make N-acylated peptides. The first C domain catalyzes N-acylation of the initiating amino acid (tryptophan) while it is installed on T. An adenylating enzyme (Ad) catalyzes the condensation of decanoic acid and the N-terminal tryptophan, which incorporates decanoic acid into the growing peptide (Figure 3). The genes responsible for this coupling event are dptE and dptF, which are located upstream of dptA, the first gene of the Daptomycin NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster. Once the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan residue occurs, the condensation of amino acids begins, catalyzed by the NRPS.
The first five modules of the NRPS are encoded by the dptA gene and catalyze the condensation of L-tryptophan, D-asparagine, L-aspartate, L-threonine, and glycine, respectively (Figure 4). Modules 6–11, which catalyze the condensation of L-ornithine, L-aspartate, D-alanine, L-aspartate, glycine, and D-serine are encoded for the dptBC gene (Figure 5). dptD catalyzes the incorporation of two nonproteinogenic amino acids, L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu) and Kyn, which is only known thus far to daptomycin, into the growing peptide (Figure 6). Elongation by these NRPS modules ultimately leads to macrocyclization and release in which an α-amino group, namely threonine, acts as an internal nucleophile during cyclization to yield the 10-amino-acid ring (Figure 6). The termination module in the NRPS assembly line has a C-A-T-TE organization. The thioesterase domain catalyzes chain termination and release of the mature lipopeptide.
The molecular engineering of daptomycin, the only marketed acidic lipopeptide antibiotic to date (Figure 8), has seen many advances since its inception into clinical medicine in 2003. It is an attractive target for combinatorial biosynthesis for many reasons: second generation derivatives are currently in the clinic for development;
Streptomyces roseosporus, the producer organism of daptomycin, is amenable to genetic manipulation; the daptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in S. lividans; the lipopeptide biosynthetic machinery has the potential to be interrupted by variations of natural precursors, as well as precursor-directed biosynthesis, gene deletion, genetic exchange, and module exchange; the molecular engineering tools have been developed to facilitate the expression of the three individual NRPS genes from three different sites in the chromosome, using ermEp* for expression of two genes from ectopic loci; other lipopeptide gene clusters, both related and unrelated to daptomycin, have been cloned and sequenced, thus providing genes and modules to allow the generation of hybrid molecules; derivatives can be afforded via chemoenzymatic synthesis; and lastly, efforts in medicinal chemistry are able to further modify these products of molecular engineering.
New derivatives of daptomycin (Figure 9) were originally generated by exchanging the third NRPS subunit (dptD) with the terminal subunits from the A54145 (Factor B1) or calcium-dependent antibiotic pathways to create molecules containing Trp13, Ile13, or Val13. dptD is responsible for incorporating the penultimate amino acid, 3-methyl-glutamic acid (3mGlu12), and the last amino acid, Kyn13, into the chain. This exchange was achieved without engineering the interpeptide docking sites. These whole-subunit exchanges have been coupled with the deletion of the Glu12-methyltransferase gene, with module exchanges at intradomain linker sites at Ala8 and Ser11, and with variations of natural fatty-acid side chains to generate over 70 novel lipopeptides in significant quantities; most of these resultant lipopeptides have potent antibacterial activities. Some of these compounds have in vitro antibacterial activities analogous to daptomycin. Further, one displayed ameliorated activity against an E. coli imp mutant that was defective in its ability to assemble its inherent lipopolysaccharide. A number of these compounds were produced in yields that spanned from 100 to 250 mg/liter; this, of course, opens up the possibility for successful scale-ups by fermentation techniques. Only a small percentage of the possible combinations of amino acids within the peptide core have been investigated thus far.
History
Daptomycin, originally designated as LY 146032, was discovered by researchers at Eli Lilly and Company in the late 1980s from the actinomycete Streptomyces roseosporus. LY 146032 showed promise in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of infection caused by Gram-positive organisms. Lilly ceased development because high-dose therapy was associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myalgia.
The rights to LY 146032 were acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 1997, which following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2003, for use in people older than 18 years, began marketing the drug under the trade name Cubicin. Cubicin is marketed in the EU and in several other countries by Novartis following its purchase of Chiron Corporation, the previous licensee.

Florent Mols (11 March 1811, Antwerp - 17 January 1896, Antwerp) was a Belgian painter who specialized in landscapes and genre scenes. Their most familiar works were created as a result of trips to Greece and Egypt.
Biography
They were born to the Jonkheer François Mols (1767-1845), and their wife, Theresa Van de Zanden (1781–1813). Their primary art lessons came from Ferdinand de Braekeleer and Mattheus Ignatius van Bree at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.
In 1838, they travelled to Egypt and the Middle East in the company of the noted art patron, Charles Stier d'Aertselaer (1770-1847). While in Ankara, they met and befriended their fellow Belgian painter, Jacob Jacobs, and they continued travelling together; taking the Nile as far as Nubia. Later that year, they were in Egypt at the same time as David Roberts, and worked together, sketching ancient monuments.
They later took a second trip to Egypt with the history painter, Franz Vinck. After returning through Alexandria, they visited Greece, then crossed to Trieste and made their way through Austria and Germany to Saint Petersburg. Near the end of 1839, they returned to Antwerp through Northern Germany. They brought a few antiquities with him, as well as Arabic and Coptic manuscripts.
They married Elise-Hubertine Brialmont (1822-1894) in 1842. They had four children: Léonie-Marie, who became an art collector and patron, Marie-Clementine, Robert, who also became a painter, and Alexis.

A data processing unit (DPU) is a channel controller, a programmable specialized electronic circuit with hardware acceleration of data processing for data-centric computing. The data is transmitted to and from the component as multiplexed packets of information. A DPU generally contains a CPU, NIC and programmable data acceleration engines. This allows DPUs to have the generality and the programmability of central processing units while being specialized to operate efficiently on networking packets, storage requests or analytics requests.
The data acceleration engines differentiate itself from a CPU by a larger degree of parallelism (required to process many requests) and from a GPU by a MIMD architecture rather than an SIMD architecture (required as each request needs to make different decisions and follow a different path through the chip). DPUs can be either ASIC-based, FPGA-based or SoC-based. DPUs have been increasingly used in data centers and supercomputers since their introduction in the 2010s due to the rise in use of data-centric computing, big data, security, and artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning. DPUs are designed to be independent infrastructure endpoints.
DPU vendors & product lines include:
AMD/Pensando: Capri, Elba & DSC
Broadcom: Stingray
Fungible: F & S Series
Intel: Infrastructure Processing Unit (IPU)
Kalray: Kalray K200-LP
Marvell Technology: OCTEON and ARMADA

"Robin 101" is the third episode of the fifth season of the How I Met Your Mother TV series and 91st overall. It originally aired on October 5, 2009.
Plot
Robin and Barney are officially girlfriend and boyfriend, but Barney is having trouble adjusting to couple life. They sneak out of bed after sex as if it was a one-night stand, and when Robin has an awful day, they avoid consoling her, telling them to meet them afterwards for sex. After Robin protests, Ted criticizes Barney for their behavior and tells them that if they do not improve, their relationship will not last.
Barney makes more of an effort to be a better boyfriend to Robin. When they begin acting evasively, Robin fears that they are cheating on them They tell Lily who tells them that they are overreacting. Robin then breaks into Barney's briefcase and finds a notebook full of notes about her, although they initially thought that Barney was cheating on them with a college girl. Barney is actually taking night classes from Ted: "Robin 101: How to date Robin Scherbatsky".
Marshall decides to get rid of a barrel they named Mabel that they used for years as a nightstand. They were saddened when they had to get rid of it due to Lily's "barrel resin allergy". They put it in "The Bermuda Triangle", otherwise known as the front step, and they wait anxiously by the window with their binoculars waiting to see who will take the barrel. So far, there are no takers.
In "Robin 101", Ted teaches Barney which topics will distract Robin from being angry, which include hockey, guns and emperor penguins. They also teach Barney about Robin's expressions and things to never do around them At first, Barney plays the part of the distracted and bored student, but after Ted tests the knowledge they have given him, Barney asks them to stay. Unfortunately, Ted's successful classes with Barney are interrupted when Robin finds out about the lessons and shows up for class. Robin gets angry, accusing Ted of not knowing them at all, and storms out.
Ted stops by MacLaren's to talk to Robin, and they convince Robin to give Barney another chance. Ted mentions how Barney usually tries to get rid of women after one night, but was amazed to find them try hard to keep Robin around. Robin finds Barney, who gives up their "Robin notebook", and apologizes to her, admitting that they were scared that they would break up with him. They forgive them and as they kiss, they remind them that the notebook contains a lot of personal information, but the notebook mysteriously vanishes before they can reclaim it, and Marshall is upset because their barrel has still not been claimed.
Critical response
Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade A−.
Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 8 out of 10.

WNND (formerly WSWZ) and WNNP are two FM radio stations serving the Columbus, Ohio market. Owned by the Columbus Radio Group subsidiary of Saga Communications, WNND broadcasts on 103.5 MHz from Pickerington, Ohio, and WNNP broadcasts on 104.3 MHz from Richwood, Ohio. Its studios are located in Upper Arlington.
Prior to joining in a simulcast, WNND formerly carried a Smooth AC format "Smooth Jazz 103.5" under the WJZA calls with programming derived from Broadcast Architecture's Smooth Jazz Network, while from 2009 to 2010, WNNP had its own identity as WODB, "Big Hits B104.3," with a classic hits format.
At 4:35 p.m. on July 30, 2010, after a brief stunt airing songs with an "end" theme, WJZA and WODB became "Rewind 103.5/104.3: Columbus' Greatest Hits," and adopted a 1980s-based classic hits format. The first song on "Rewind" was "Let's Groove" by Earth, Wind & Fire. On August 6, 2010, WJZA and WODB changed their call letters to WNND and WNNP, respectively.
WNND broadcasts in the HD Radio format.
History
WNND and WNNP are now one of two radio stations in the Columbus market to have a Classic Hits format, joining Newark-based WNKO. They also feature the second 1980s-derived classic hits format in Columbus radio history, as sister station WVMX was all-1980s WXST ("Star 107.9") back in the late 1990s.
WSWZ (FM), later WJZA (103.5 FM)
On 103.5 MHz, WSWZ (FM) signed on the air at 6 AM on October 7, 1989 with 6 kilowatts from a non-directional antenna on Tower Hill north of Lancaster that also reached into nearby Columbus, more than 30 miles distant. "Z-103" programmed an oldie format to Lancaster and Columbus that ultimately proved so popular that two more powerful FM stations in Ohio's capital city also switched to an oldies format. Along with the oldies format, WSWZ-FM also programmed local newscasts twice an hour in the mornings, and twice an hour in the afternoons. In its later years, the station received most of its oldies from a satellite playlist service, but kept 8 hours of local programming along with news inserts during morning and afternoon drive times.
New owners changed the call letters of WSWZ to WJZA on February 13, 1998, and switched the format to smooth jazz, taking the format previously aired on 107.5 in Columbus. That station dropped the WJZA calls and smooth jazz format on December 26, 1997 in exchange for WCKX's calls and format, which were dropped from 106.3 FM (now known as WBMO).
In time, the usage of the "smooth jazz" name was taken very liberally as WJZA shifted to a hybrid of Adult Contemporary, Urban AC, and instrumental covers, while the majority of WJZA's programming was soon derived from Broadcast Architecture's "Your Smooth Jazz" service, which chiefly operated under this hybrid style. The jazz and smooth jazz formats proved sustainable, but not as popular as the original oldies format on WSWZ.
WNNP (104.3 FM)
WNNP began broadcasting in 1995 as WZJZ with a jazz format. In 1999, WZJZ switched to a simulcast of WJZA's smooth jazz programming under the WJZK call letters. Their classic hits format, known as "Big Hits B104.3", launched on February 2, 2009 at 12:00PM, taken from the former "Big Hits B107.9" WODB at 107.9, which a few days earlier, switched to a Hot AC format as WVMX, "Mix 107.9." Morning host Dave Kay was the only local personality on the station, with the rest of the programming having been satellite-fed from Dial Global (but under a different channel than the one WTDA carried).
Due to WNNP's transmitter originating 40 miles northwest from Columbus in Richwood, the 104.3 signal suffers coverage problems in the Columbus metro, mainly in the eastern and southern portions. While still WODB, the station filed an application to change its city of license and transmitter location from Richwood to West Jefferson, Ohio, along with increasing power from 3.4 KW to 6 KW, so as to offer better coverage in the Columbus area. The move ultimately was rejected by the FCC.

Phoenix New City or Phoenix New Town () is a special district of Tangshan, China that developed as its central business district.
Economy
Taking advantage of its good ecological environment, Phoenix New City, which is under construction, aims at the domestic first-class CBD development standards. Sixty-eight key projects are comprehensively promoted with a total investment of 63.5 billion yuan.
Different from the traditional expansion type of many cities, Phoenix New City aims at the highest town planning standards in developed countries from the very beginning with commercial, administrative, culture, and green land axes co-existing. "Eco-oriented", "new urbanism", "smart growth" and other advanced international concepts were introduced into the construction to build the domestic first class central business district with eco-tourism and leisure, business services, financial center, the headquarters base, high technology, creative cultural industries, etc.
In accordance with the strategy of inviting business (focusing on inviting global business and strategic investors to improve core competitiveness) which was brought up in early 2010, the Administrative Committee of Tangshan Phoenix New City targeted at Fortune 500 companies home and abroad to carry out a variety of effective activities to invite business, which achieved remarkable results. In 2010, Tangshan received 200 batches of Chinese and foreign visiting groups. Among these groups, 11 are from global Fortune 500 enterprises, 16 are from China fortune 500 enterprises, and 15 are from China's top 500 private enterprises and top 100 specialized enterprises.
Among these projects, the residential and commercial projects co-developed by Hong Kong Kerry Group and China Resources Land Group, as well as the residential and commercial projects co-developed by China Water Power Group and China Petroleum Jidong Oil Company started construction. The South Korean Lotte urban complex project and Pangda Automobile Trade Group Jidong Material Building project reached an agreement with the administrative committee and will start construction in 2011. Yicheng Group urban complex project and Beijing Wanke real estate project will be started soon.

The Anacostia Riverwalk Trail is a multi-use trail system in Washington, DC, which, when complete, will be ~25 miles long, spanning both sides of the Anacostia River, the Washington Channel waterfront, and projecting into neighborhoods away from the Anacostia. It has more recently been branded as part of a larger Anacostia Riverwalk Trail Network which includes an additional 8 segments and 15 miles of trail. On the north end it connects to the Anacostia Tributary Trail System; on the south end it will connect to the Oxon Hill Farm Trail and on the west it connects to the Rock Creek Park Trail and the 14th Street Bridge. Of the 19 planned segments, 14 are complete for a combined total of 16 miles.
History
The Anacostia Riverwalk Trail was first proposed as a 20-mile system of trails in the 2003 Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI) Framework Plan, though similar proposals for such trails had been considered for decades. For example the National Capital Planning Commission's 1997 Extending the Legacy plan proposed an 11 mile "Washington Water Walk" from Georgetown to the National Arboretum and the 1966 federal "Trails for America" report identified a 25 mile trail along the Anacostia as a good candidate for a Washington, DC area trail system. The AWI plan called for building trails on the east side of the Anacostia from the Maryland boundary to the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, on the west side from the Benning Road Bridge to Fort McNair and along the Southwest Waterfront from Buzzard Point to the Tidal Basin. The AWI plan called it the Anacostia Riverwalk and Trail.
Over the next three years, the District government proceeded to study and design the trail system. During that time it was renamed, with the "and" dropped. They identified 19 different trail segments 16 miles in total length, or 25 miles with expanded elements. The system proposed after design was expanded to include segments south to Blue Plains, north to the Capitol and the Tidal Basin, and with a bridge across the Anacostia at the National Arboretum. The design took advantage of several existing pieces of multi-use facilities including the 0.6 mile River Terrace section (repaved and modified in 2003 when the new Ethel Kennedy Bridge was constructed) and a 0.3-mile trail connection to Heritage Island, both built for the bicentennial; the 0.5 mile Navy Yard Promenade built after 1991; a 0.2-mile trail through Southwest Waterfront Park, built in 1968; a 0.2 mile connection over 295 to the Anacostia Recreation Center, originally opened in 1964 and rebuilt in 2009-2010; and 2.7 miles of bicycle/pedestrian facilities on the Sousa (built in 1941, and modified for better bicycle and pedestrian access in 1995), Francis Case (built in 1971, with a causeway built by 1993 and modified in 2018) and Ethel Kennedy (built in 2004) Bridges. However, the Navy Yard Promenade didn't open to the public until April 1, 2011, after the Navy built a fence between it and the facility. Altogether 4.5 miles of trail and facilities existed prior to production of the AWI plan.
In 2003, the District Department of Transportation defined and signed an interim trail that utilized on-street routes, a few existing sections of trail and some demonstration trails located next to the Earth Conservation Corps's Mathew Henson Center at Half Street, SW and their Pumphouse facility along First Street, SE; and another along Water Street where the Anacostia Community Boathouse used to be. At that time they also repaved a temporary trail from Anacostia Drive to the Douglass Bridge's sidewalks and on to Bolling Air Force Base.
Since the initial groundbreaking in 2007, another 13 miles of trail has been completed and over two miles is under construction as of 2020.
In 2014, the section that passes beneath the 11th Street Bridge on the north side of the river was closed to allow Washington Gas to clean up contaminants related to the former Washington Gas East Station manufactured gas plant property which was just north of the site. Once it was cleaned up the area was seeded with native species and the closure remained in place to allow the vegetation to become established. It was to take only two years, but took six instead and the area wasn't reopened until February 2021.
Description
Because the Riverwalk was built bit by bit, designed and constructed at different times by different organizations, the trail is a varying combination of trails and trail segments. At times it is a paved multi-use trail, an on-road route, a sidewalk, a protected bike lane or a riverfront promenade. Its surface is mostly asphalt, but at times concrete, brick or boardwalk is used.
On the north end, the trail starts at the southern terminus of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System in Prince George's County just north of the New York Avenue/US-50 Bridge and follows the river south through Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens to the intersection of 40th St. NE and Anacostia Avenue, NE. It then travels over Watts Branch and through the Mayfair neighborhood on road to the intersection of Anacostia Drive, NE and Foote St. NE. There it enters the south portion of Kenilworth Park on an old park service access road where it connects to a multi-use trail between the river and the old PEPCO power plant. It follows this trail to Benning Road where the trail splits to both sides of the river.
On the east side, the trail continues along the river through River Terrace Park, under East Capitol Street, over the railroad tracks and into the main part of Anacostia National Park. In ANP it travels all the way to Poplar Point between the river and Anacostia Drive, SE. At Popular Point it begins to run along the east side of South Capitol Street, connecting to both sides of the Douglass Bridge, before ending at Defense Boulevard and the gate to Joint Base Anacostia Bolling.
On the west side, the trail travels along the river to Douglass Bridge and then across Southwest DC to the Washington Channel, where it turns north. South of Benning Road, it travels along the river on the east side of the RFK parking lots and Congressional Cemetery. It crosses over the railroad tracks, with a separate connection to Barney Circle, and then uses a sidewalk, sections of trail and Water Street, SE to traverse Boathouse Row. After crossing under the 11th Street Bridge, it connects, in order, to the Navy Yard Promenade, Yards Park and Diamond Teague Park. Someday it will connect from there to the Douglass Bridge and Buzzard Point before turning north, but for now, it detours on road on Potomac Avenue, First Street, SW and P Street, SW to Southwest Waterfront Park. From there it turns north along the Washington Channel using the trail in Southwest Waterfront Park, sidewalks and sidepaths along Maine Avenue and the trail in front of the Wharf to its terminus at Ohio Drive and the trails around the Tidal Basin.
In the future, the trail will connect via two routes to the Capitol, via the South Capital Street Trail to Oxon Cove Park and via a new trail segment in Kenilworth Gardens and a bridge over the Anacostia to the National Arboretum. In 2018, it was branded as part of a larger Anacostia River Trail Network that included the Marvin Gaye Trail, the Suitland Parkway Trail and its extension, the proposed Shepherd's Branch Trail, the proposed Lincoln Connector Trail, the 11th Street Bridge Park, the Oxon Run Trail, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Trail.

The 1968 Burma cyclone was regarded as the worst to strike the country during the 20th century before it was surpassed by another unnamed cyclone in 2004 and further, Cyclone Nargis in 2008, respectively. The first tropical cyclone of the 1968 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it started as a depression on May 7 on the northern Andaman Sea. With low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the storm intensified in the waters near Burma before heading northwestwards. It then started to rapidly intensify, with an eye becoming apparent on satellite imagery on May 9. Also that day, it reached its peak intensity, with 3-minute maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) by the Indian Meteorological Department, which is equivalent to a super cyclonic storm; however, the agency treated the system as a severe cyclonic storm. Little to no changes happened on the cyclone as it turned northeastwards, making landfall near Akyab (now Sittwe) between 18:00 and 21:00 UTC on that day. Land interaction rapidly weakened the storm, dissipating on May 10 as an area of low-pressure in south Chin State.
The predecessor to the cyclone caused light to moderate downpour to the Andaman Islands; however, no deaths were reported. Winds reported from the cyclone inland Burma reached an estimate of 60–100 mph, altogether with heavy rainfall and large storm surges. The former flooded the crops, submerging them in floodwaters in the process while the latter washed out villages near the path of the storm. Schools and hospitals throughout Akyab were destroyed by high winds and large waves, while the port suffered major damages. The town was almost destroyed due to the storm. In addition, some ships in the said harbor, including the Greek freighter Geros Michalos were reportedly sunk in the Bay of Bengal. Houses were destroyed during the storm and many livestock died, mainly due to drowning. The death toll from the cyclone was finalized in May 1968 at 1,037 individuals, while 2,000 more were reportedly missing. The property damages were estimated at Ks.15 million ($3.248 million USD).
After the cyclone, the Government of Burma started to release aid to the victims, altogether with food supplies and cotton blankets. The Red Cross Society of the country donated cases of medicines to the country, while the United States Government released over 25,000 blankets to be transferred to the area. In addition, many countries and organizations including the UNICEF contributed over $121,291 (1968 USD) to Myanmar, following the disaster.
Meteorological history
On May 5, a weak cyclonic circulation, which likely emerged from the Andaman Sea started to move westwards across the southern portion of Burma. The convection of thunderstorms started to consolidate at that time, as pressure countings along the southern coasts of Arakan and Tenasserim regions started to fall, all in the country. In addition, on that day, a trough of low pressure formed along the circulation in the northern Andaman Sea, which would later spawn a well-marked disturbance, early the next day. At 18:00 UTC that day, the disturbance intensified to a depression and further to a deep depression on the next day as it located in a favorable environment for intensification, as evidenced by the rapid strengthening state of the system. The IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 18:00 UTC that day before further intensifying to a severe cyclonic storm on the next day as it moved northwestwards. The storm had an eye feature and a well-defined central dense overcast as being evidenced by satellite imagery. The cyclone then started to move west-northwestwards before turning north as the motion of the system slowed down. On May 9, a ESSA-6 satellite image of the cyclone showed that the system became more compact in size, and its eye became more apparent. Shortly after, the IMD assessed the system to be at a peak intensity of 220 km/h (140 mph) in 3-minute means, well equivalent to a super cyclonic storm on the intensity scale by the agency; however, it was treated as a severe cyclonic storm in the department's record and report on the storm. Using the Davidon–Fletcher–Powell formula on the minimum barometric pressure on the system, it was analyzed to be at , the lowest recorded in association with the system. Little no changes happened in the intensity of the system as it started to recurve northeastwards, approaching western Burma. Between 21:00 and 00:00 UTC on that day and the following, the cyclone crossed the northern coast of Arakan near Akyab, with the latter suffering a direct hit from the storm. Interaction with the landmass of the country rapidly weakened the storm, becoming a well-marked area of low pressure on May 10 on southern Chin State.
Impact
The predecessor of the system influenced the monsoonal winds over the Andaman Sea and southern portions of the Bay of Bengal, causing heavy rainfall to the Andaman Islands, particularly the Napier Bay Islands, starting on May 5 until May 8. A rainfall amount of 7 cm and 6 cm was recorded in Long Island on May 5 and 7, while Port Blair on May 5, 6 and 7 reported a rain accumulation of 4, 8, and 7 cm, respectively. In the Middle Andaman Island of Maya Bandar, a rain amount of 7 cm was also recorded, while Hut Bay reported the same on May 7. No damages and deaths were reported.
Burma
The damage from the cyclone was heaviest in Burma, where the storm caused winds over in Akyab. Though no rain accumulation reports were received from the country, massive storm surges buffeted houses and ships near the coast and on the path of the cyclone, submerging them. Nine townships in the country reported significant damages while the death toll from the cyclone mainly came from Akyab and Kyaukphyu because of the proximity to the cyclone's track. The former was 90% damaged due to the storm, with an estimated 50,000 individuals being rendered homeless out of the population of over 75,000.
The storm destroyed over 57,660 houses in the country alone, rendering 297,768 individuals homeless. Government buildings throughout Arakan suffered damages, and hospitals were left completely wrecked due to the strong winds. The port was also devastated by numerous storm surges, causing many ships to sink. The Greek freighter SS Gero Michalos sank altogether with three Burmese passenger ships on May 10 due to the gusty wind sand rough seas, with the former causing $2 million in losses. Rice mills and miscellaneous factories in Akyab were reported to be damaged, while schools were either wrecked by storm surge or devastated. Coconut trees were also downed due to strong winds. Over 17,527 livestock were killed, while 145,144 acres of paddy fields were submerged in floodwaters, all due to the storm. The large death toll from the storm is possibly due to the little information of the people inland from the cyclone. Despite this, over 12,409 people were evacuated to twelve camps that were donated by the United States of America after a cyclone that also devastated the area, nearly a year later.
Some newspapers described the wide swath of the cyclone as the worst to affect Burma until it was surpassed by another unnamed cyclone in 2004 and further, Cyclone Nargis in 2008. Damages totaled Ks.15 million ($3.169 million USD). The official death tally from the storm was at 1,037 with an estimated 2,000 more missing. The majority of fatalities were from Pauktaw and Myebon Townships with 553 and 415 deaths, respectively.
Aftermath
Within Burma
After the cyclone's havoc on the country, immediate relief operations were started for the evacuees in different shelters across Burma. A high-level relief committee was built by Tin U as commander, the main leader, and secretary, which includes Lwin Maung as the relief minister and one of the secretaries and Nyunt Swe as joint-secretary to discuss the aftermath of the cyclone and preparations of relief aid to the country's victims. In Rangoon, another relief council was formed by U to assess the damages on the area, while a coordinating body was developed by Kyaw Soe on an unknown date for the same reasons.
The Burmese Red Cross made an appeal to the International Committee of the Red Cross for aid due to the storm's wide swath of damages on the country. The latter requested the help of other societies in different countries to help the country.
The government of the country immediately released Ks.2.250 million for disaster response. On May 14, the relief committee including the President and Secretary of the country's Red Cross flew from then-country's capital to Akyab, doing an on-the-spot assessment of the damages caused by the cyclone. Together on the flight was a thousand pieces of cotton blankets, 2,500 yards of longcloth, 100 cases of condensed milk, 200 dozen baby food, and five cases of different medicines from the Burmese Red Cross and many tents from the relief committee for the evacuees. The Blind Monk of a blind school in Burma donated Ks.500/- ($105.65) from their own money, while the students of the said school contributed Ks.100/- ($21.13) to the Red Cross. In addition, many employees in factories and offices including railway stations and other places also pledged money for the victims of the storm by doing overtime in their jobs.
Three months after the cyclone, a continued flow of relief aid was sent by air and sea transportations to different shelters through the affected areas by the storm for distribution. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reacted to the country's reaction from the aftermath of the storm as "swift and effective".
Other countries' reaction to the disaster
On May 13, the Disaster Relief Officer of the United States received a request for more supply of blankets from Burma about the cyclone's large destruction on the area, with the committee passing the plea to the main headquarters at Washington D.C., which was further approved. As the Burmese Red Cross made an appeal for aid following the cyclone, the American Red Cross quickly acknowledged this by donating Sulfa drugs, worth $2 million. The blankets, on the other hand, were transferred to Burma from the U.S by a chartered cargo ship including $137,488 worth of disaster relief. Out of the aid, $9,000 was used for purchasing Indian cotton materials for more blankets. 25,000 more bedclothes were donated by the country's government from Boston, Massachusetts to the affected country on May 18, being given full coverage worldwide.
The Government of India donated over 6,400 longyis and 18,000 metres of long cloth from Calcutta which was received by Burma on June 1 and 3. The government also permitted the United States administration to purchase the latter donation from American-owned rupees.
Days and months after the cyclone's havoc, many agencies and humanitarian organizations, including the UNICEF donated supplies and food to Burma. The contributions totaled $121,291, which are used for the victims of the storm.

Bône (, ‘Annāba) was a French département in Algeria which existed between 1955 and 1974.
Considered as a French province, Algeria was departmentalised on 9 December 1848. Three civil zones (départements) replaced the three beyliks into which the Ottoman former rulers had divided the territory. The easternmost of the three original Algerian departments was called Constantine. For over a century the town of Annaba, known at that time as Bône (and in classical times as Hippo), was a sub-prefecture in the département of Constantine: this changed in 1955.
On 7 August 1955 the eastern extremity of the former département of Constantine was split off and became the separate département of Bône. This administrative reorganisation was a response to the rapid population increase experienced across the territory, especially during the preceding decade.
The new coastal département of Bône covered an area of ; a population of 730,594 was recorded. The department comprised five sub-prefectures: these were La Calle, Clairfontaine, Guelma, Souk Ahras and Tébessa. A final but temporary change took place between 17 March 1958 and 7 November 1959, during which time the Tébessa sub-prefectures was transferred to the département of Batna.
In 1962 Bône département was renamed Annaba département.
The département of Annaba remained in existence until after the independence of Algeria and subsequently became Annaba Province.

Michael Andre Anderson (born December 12, 1959) is an American basketball coach, currently the head coach of the St. John's Red Storm. They came to St. John's after previously serving as head coach at UAB, Missouri and Arkansas. They also served as an assistant/associate head coach under Nolan Richardson at Arkansas for 17 years. Over their 20 seasons as a head coach, Anderson has compiled a 414–235 record, 11 20-win campaigns, 9 NCAA Tournament appearances, two Sweet 16 berths and a run to the 2009 Elite Eight. Anderson is one of just 4 current Division I head coaches with 15+ years of experience and no losing seasons, along with Mark Few, Tom Izzo, and Jim Boeheim*.
Playing career
Anderson was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, where they attended Jackson-Olin High School in the Ensley-Pratt City neighborhood, leading the Mustangs to the semifinals of the Alabama state basketball tournament and averaging 19 points per game in their junior and senior years and winning all-state honors. Anderson moved on to Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham, where they were spotted by an opposing coach named Nolan Richardson. When Richardson was offered the coaching job at the University of Tulsa, they quickly offered Anderson a scholarship. In Anderson's two years with the Golden Hurricane they averaged 12 points a game, and the team won an NIT title and gained an NCAA tournament berth.
Coaching career
Assistant positions
After graduating in 1982, Anderson went into substitute teaching while looking for a coaching job. Richardson brought them on to the University of Tulsa's staff as a volunteer assistant. When Richardson moved on to the University of Arkansas, they brought Anderson along as an assistant for a 17-year stint, the last five as assistant head coach. During that time, the Razorbacks won three Southwest Conference championships, two Southeastern Conference titles, three appearances in the Final Four, a national championship in 1994 and a second-place finish in 1995. When Richardson was fired, Anderson took over for the remainder of the 2001–02 season as interim head coach.
UAB
In 2002, Anderson returned to their hometown of Birmingham to take over the program at UAB, which was coming off a 13–17 season and had only one NCAA appearance since 1995. Anderson quickly turned the program around, leading the team to 22 wins and a National Invitation Tournament Quarterfinals appearance. Anderson then led the Blazers to three straight appearances in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. In 2004, the Blazers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by virtue of a 76–75 upset victory over the University of Kentucky, the tournament's overall #1 seed. UAB ended the season ranked 23rd in the USA Today coaches' poll. Anderson was named Conference USA Coach of the Year, and is the only coach in UAB history to take the Blazers to the post season every year of their tenure.
Missouri
First two seasons (2006–2008)
Anderson was then hired in 2006 to take over the mess at the University of Missouri, rehabilitating a program that was under investigation under Quin Snyder. Anderson's first team, a collection of transfers and raw talent, went 18–12 but missed out on post-season play after a loss to Baylor in the Big 12 Tournament. Their 2007–08 campaign saw the inclusion of their nephew DeMarre Carroll, a transfer from Vanderbilt, but also was hit by scandal, as a group of players (the "Athena Five", so named for where the incident took place) were arrested for a fight in a Columbia nightclub. That incident marked the second disciplinary issue of the season for Anderson's team. Before the season, starting forward Kalen Grimes had been dismissed from the team after being arrested for hitting a man with the butt of a shotgun. The Tigers finished 16–16, losing in the Big 12 Tourney to Nebraska and missing out on post-season play.
Third season (2008–09)
Anderson's third season at Mizzou in 2008–09 brought with it many questions: How well would they be able to blend their seven new players (five first-year students and two transfers) with the remaining Tigers from the previous season including the only two remaining players from the Quin Snyder era? After failing to reach the post season their first two seasons would Mike Anderson be able to lead their Tigers to an NIT or NCAA post season tournament? Missouri was picked to finish 7th in the Big 12 by the coaches. The Tigers season got off to a great start with a 9–1 record including wins over USC and Cal and a close loss to a top 25 team (Xavier) in Puerto Rico. The Tigers finished their non-conference schedule with a record of 13–2. The team lost the conference opener but responded by winning eleven of their next twelve Big 12 games including a last-second win at Texas, which earned them a national ranking, and then a memorable win over their arch rival Kansas at home, where the Tigers climbed back from a 14-point halftime deficit to win the game after Zaire Taylor's game winning shot with 1.3 seconds remaining. Mike Anderson's 2008–09 Tiger team finished their last home game of the season by beating #5 Oklahoma on senior night. The Tigers went undefeated at home, winning 18 games. The Tigers then won the Big 12 Conference tournament by defeating Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and Baylor (Mar. 14) on successive nights. Victories over Cornell, Marquette and Memphis pushed the Tigers into the Elite 8, where top-seeded UConn ended Missouri's run with an 82–75 win.
Anderson was also one of ten finalists for the 2008–09 Henry Iba Award. The other 9 finalists were John Calipari, Memphis; Bill Self (eventual winner), Kansas; Jamie Dixon, Pittsburgh; Mike Montgomery, California; Stew Morrill, Utah State; Matt Painter, Purdue; Oliver Purnell, Clemson, and Brad Stevens, Butler.
On March 31, 2009, Anderson signed a 7-year extension at Missouri, passing up an offer from the University of Georgia. The extension increased Anderson's base salary to $1.6 million and up to $2.2 million with incentives. The offer Anderson reportedly turned down from Georgia was worth more than $2 million a year. Anderson also turned down a $3 million a year offer to coach the University of Oregon during the summer of 2010.
Final two seasons (2009–2011)
Anderson's teams went 23–11 and finished fifth in the conference in both of their final two seasons with Missouri. The Tigers made the NCAA tournament both years but never finished above third place in conference during their tenure. This three-year span was the first time the team had made three or more consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament since 2003. That same three-year span is the first time the Tigers had won more than 20 games three years in a row since 1980–1983.
Leaving Missouri
During the final month of Anderson's tenure at the University of Missouri, their name became linked with the Arkansas opening because of John Pelphrey's increasingly unstable job status. On March 4, 2011, Anderson dismissed the rumors, telling Columbia Tribune sportswriter Steve Walentik they planned to stay at MU for "a long time, retire here."
On March 14, Arkansas fired Pelphrey. Nine days later, Anderson accepted the head coaching position at Arkansas. The departure stunned Missouri fans, especially in light of Anderson's comments to the Tribune earlier in the month. According to MU guard Marcus Denmon, Anderson told them days before leaving that they would stay at MU and "didn't plan on changing." Anderson did not hold a press conference after accepting the Arkansas job, but Denmon, forward Laurence Bowers and guard Kim English—three players recruited to Missouri by Anderson—expressed both disappointment and understanding of Anderson's decision.
Later in the week, when Anderson held their introductory press conference at Arkansas, a reporter from KOMU traveled to Fayetteville to ask Anderson why they did not address fans or media in Columbia. Anderson denied that claim, citing a press release on Arkansas's official athletic website as the official "good-bye." Fans at the press conference booed the reporter, but Anderson told the crowd the questions were "legit," and that "Columbia was great to Mike Anderson."
Missouri eventually hired Frank Haith to succeed Anderson. In their first press conference, Haith said Anderson told them the new Missouri players would love him.
Arkansas
On March 23, 2011, Anderson signed a seven-year contract with the University of Arkansas worth $2.2 million a year. On April 6, 2011, the University of Arkansas announced Anderson's entire coaching staff, which included Melvin Watkins. T.J. Cleveland, and Matt Zimmerman, would follow them from Missouri.
First three seasons
Anderson meandered through their first two seasons back at the place they began their coaching career, finishing with winning records (18–14 and 19–13) but was unable to secure a spot in any postseason play, as they finished ninth and seventh in the Southeastern Conference standings.
In 2013–14, the Razorbacks returned to the postseason for the first time since 2008, earning a spot in the NIT. Improving its SEC Tournament seeding by two spots for the second straight year under Anderson, Arkansas finished fifth in the league standings at 10–8 while reaching the 20-win plateau (22–12) for the first time since the asupervisorstioned 2007–08 campaign. Highlighting the 22-win season was the program's first-ever season sweep of SEC rival Kentucky and a 5–1 mark against teams that advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament and NIT. The Arkansas faithful saw signs of the Nolan Richardson-era style of play that Anderson utilizes, as the Razorbacks led the SEC in scoring (80.1), assists (15.3), steals (8.4), and turnover margin (+5.5), figures that all ranked in the top 30 in the nation. Individual development was also critical to Arkansas' improvement in 2013–14, as 6'10" Bobby Portis became the sixth first-year student in program history to earn All-SEC honors as a first-year student, snagging a spot on the All-SEC second team, SEC All-Freshman squad and USBWA All-District VII team.
2014–15 season
On January 6, 2015, it was announced that Anderson had signed a two-year contract extension, keeping them with Arkansas through 2020. Anderson led Arkansas to the NCAA tournament in their fourth season, while making it to the finals of the SEC Tournament in the process. The Razorbacks were given a No. 5 seed, their highest seed in the tournament since 1999, when Anderson was still an assistant under Richardson. The Razorbacks advanced to the round of 32 before losing to North Carolina. Portis was named SEC Player of the Year, and was drafted with the 22nd pick by the Chicago Bulls in the 2015 NBA draft. Swingman Michael Qualls declared for the draft, but sustained an injury and wasn't selected, instead signing a free agent deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Rashad Madden signed a D-League contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.
2015–16 season
On February 23, 2016, Anderson won their 100th game as the Arkansas coach and their 300th overall with an 85–65 victory over LSU. The Razorbacks finished the season 16–16, 9–9 in SEC play to finish in a tie for eighth place. They lost in the second round of the SEC Tournament to Florida.
2016–17 season
Anderson's sixth Razorback unit got off to the best start since they took over as coach. They signed three of the top six junior college players (Jaylen Barford, Daryl Macon, and Arlando Cook) in the off-season to load the Razorback roster up for a tournament run. With preseason SEC Player of the Year Moses Kingsley and sharpshooter Dusty Hannahs returning to lead the squad, the Razorbacks finished the regular season 23–8. Their 10–1 start bested their 9–2 starts in 2013–14 and 2014–15. The team won six SEC road games for only the third time in school history, joining the 1994 national champions and the 2015 team. They tied South Carolina for third in the league with a conference record of 12–6, and advanced to the finals of the SEC Tournament, losing to Kentucky 82–65. The No. 8-seeded Razorbacks advanced to the NCAA tournament and defeated Seton Hall in their first game before falling to top-seeded and eventual national champion North Carolina in the second round, 72–65.
2017–18 season
On January 26, 2018, it was announced that Anderson had signed another two-year contract extension, keeping them under contract until 2022. The Razorbacks finished in a tie for fourth in the SEC, which sent a record eight teams to the NCAA tournament. Butler ended their season in the first round, 79–62.
2018–19 season
Anderson had to start over in their eighth season with the Razorbacks, welcoming nine new players with Daniel Gafford the only returning player of note. The team finished in a tie for ninth in the SEC with Alabama, lost its opening SEC Tournament game to Florida and then went 1–1 in the NIT to close out the year.
Termination
On March 26, 2019, it was announced that Arkansas had dismissed Anderson as head coach, marking the end of 25 years of association with the University of Arkansas as both an assistant and head basketball coach. They were replaced by former Nevada head coach Eric Musselman.
St. John's
The 59-year-old was named the head coach at St. John's University on April 19, 2019, replacing Chris Mullin.
On Feb. 16, 2021, Anderson won their 400th game as their Red Storm defeated Xavier.
Anderson was named Big East Coach of the Year for the 2020–21 season. Anderson was given a 6-year extension as a result of their first two seasons at St. Johns.

The Tsay Keh Dene First Nation is one of the Sekani bands of the Northern Interior of British Columbia. Tsay Keh Dene means "People of the Mountain". While they have an office in the City of Prince George, their territories, settlements, and Indian Reserves are all to the north, in the area of Williston Lake, the creation of which flooded a large part of their territory with devastating effects on the people and their way of life.
Indian Reserves and Settlements
Indian Reserves and Settlements under the jurisdiction of the Tsay Keh Dene First Nation are:
Ingenika Settlement
Mesilinka
Parnsip Indian Reserve No. 5, on the left bank of the Parsnip River at Fort Grahame, 34.20 ha.
Police Meadow Indian Reserve No. 2, 4 miles east of the Finlay River, 15 miles northwest of Fort Grahame, 129.50 ha.
Tutu Creek Indian Reserve No. 4, on left bank of the Parnsip River at Fort Grahame, 37.30 ha.
The Tse Keh Nay, formerly known as the Ingenika, live at the north end of the Williston Reservoir in the community of Tsay Keh Dene. They have lived in the "Rocky Mountain Trench for many generations." In 1824 Samuel Black, an early fur trader visited the region and kept a journal of their visit there with Tse Keh Nay Chief Methodiates and their followers. They described the historic use of the resource rich Amazay/Thutade/ Kemess area. Duncan (Amazay) Lake – known as Amazay Lake in Sekani – is a natural -long long wilderness fish-bearing lake with rainbow trout and whitefish populations, located at the headwaters of the Findlay watershed.57.0693921,-126.8010853,2830
Amazay Lake was the calving ground for caribou in the month of May.

Steiglitz is a rural coastal town and locality in the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In the the locality of Steiglitz had a population of 705 people.
Geography
Steiglitz is bounded to the east by Moreton Bay, to the south by Jacobs Well, to the west and north by Woongoolba.
Cabbage Tree Point is a headland jutting into Moreton Bay ().
The town of Steiglitz is located at Cabbage Tree Point and the town is often referred to as Cabbage Tree Point. The name refers to the cabbage tree palms that grew in the area.
History
The district is named after Stegelitz, Germany, the home town of the pioneer family Kleinschmidt.
In the late 1800s, the farming district located between the Pimpama River and the Logan River called Pimpama Island and encompasses the modern localities of Jacobs Well, Norwell, Steiglitz and Woongoolba. It was referred to as an island because there were a number of lagoons and swamps that isolated the area during the wet season; however, this disadvantage made it good land for growing sugar cane.
German immigrant families settled in the area in the 1870s. Lutheran services were held in private homes until the first church was erected in 1882, being replaced by the present church in 1908. The church was renovated in 1930.
The Rocky Point Sugar Mill was established by Carl Heinrich Heck in 1878 on Mill Road (and crosses the boundary between Woongoolba and Steiglitz). Despite being one of the oldest sugar mills in Australia, it is still privately owned by the Heck Group, a family company of five generations. There were once other sugar mills in the area, but they have now closed and Rocky Point has expanded to replace their lost capacity.
On 16 August 1924, the Rocky Point Sugar Mill tramway was officially opened by John Appel, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Albert. It went from the mill to Norwell to assist with transporting the harvested sugarcane to the mill, a task made difficult by the low-lying swampy land in the area. The tramway was mostly built along the roadside (the roads having been built on the higher ground whenever possible) but it was still necessary to build a few hundred yards of causeway to cross the swamp (now drained) along New Norwell Road (approx ). The tramway was a gauge and the steam locomotive that operated on it was from John Fowler & Co. in England. The locomotive was delivered to the wharf at Steiglitz and then carried on a large horse-drawn wagon to get to the mill. There were 100 cane wagons to carry the cane; these came from the closed sugar mill at Nerang. Although there were hopes from local people that the tramway would be extended to connect to the South Coast railway line at Ormeau and to the Steiglitz wharf onto Moreton Bay, as a form of public transport, neither of these extensions were built and passengers were not carried. The tramway was only extended to better access the sugarcane-growing areas in Norwell. Frequent flooding of the tramway was the cause of many derailments and there was difficulty maintaining the line during World War II, increasing the frequency of derailments. With the increasing availability of motorised transport after World War II, the tramway was closed in 1951. However, the rails and wagons were still used to move sugarcane around the mill, although the locomotive had been sold. The locomotive was used as a static display in a number of locations including Gilltraps Auto Museum at Kirra and the Dreamworld theme park before returning to the mill as part of a vision to create a historical precinct, which never eventuated, so it was donated in 2013 to the Beenleigh Historical Village.
In 2001–2, a co-generation plant was added at Rocky Point Sugar Mill.
In the , the locality of Steiglitz had a population of 441 people.
In the the locality of Steiglitz had a population of 705 people.
Economy
Rocky Point Sugar Mill is a sugar mill at 102-120 Mill Road (), extending across the road into neighbouring Woongoolba. The mill's co-generation plant produces almost 200GWh of electricity per annum from renewable sources, which can be used in the mill and/or exported, making Rocky Point one of the most energy-efficient sugar mills in Australia.
Education
There are no schools in Steiglitz. The nearest primary school is Woongoolba State School in neighbouring Woongoolba to the west. The nearest government secondary school is Ormeau Woods State High School in Ormeau to the south-west.

Tulle Inger Hazelrigg is an American biologist who is Professor of Cell Biology at Columbia University. Them research considers the propagation and differentiation of germ cells. Hazelrigg was the first to attach green fluorescent protein to other proteins, which changed the way biological research could be conducted.
Early life and education
Hazelrigg was born in Evansville and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana.  They are the daughter of Hugh C. and Jane Yde Andersen Hazelrigg. Them father was the head science writer for the Indiana University news bureau. They became interested in science as a child and bred fruit flies in the basement of their house. They were encouraged by their father to complete their science fair projects in the laboratory of Hermann Joseph Muller, Nobel laureate and then geneticist at Indiana University Bloomington. They enrolled at an honorary science academy, but was kicked out because of their involvement in demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. They were an undergraduate student at Oberlin College, where they majored in philosophy. Hazelrigg was unsure what to do after college and worked as a substitute teacher. They moved to Europe where they took courses in art. They eventually returned to the United States and earned their doctorate at Indiana University Bloomington, where they worked under the supervision of Thomas Kaufman. They elucidated the fine structure of the Antennapedia complex. They were a postdoctoral researcher at the Carnegie Institution for Science and University of California, Berkeley.
Research and career
In 1996 Hazelrigg moved to the University of Utah where they were appointed to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Hazelrigg was the first to attach green fluorescent protein to another protein, allowing them to track a protein's movement through living cells using the green fluorescent tag. They showed that the resulting green fluorescent protein fusion protein behaved the same way the untagged protein. Green fluorescent protein fusion proteins allow for the study and localization of proteins in living cells. They joined the faculty at Columbia University in 1992.
Hazelrigg studies the propagation and differentiation of germ cells using the model organism Drosophila. Germ cells undergo a complex differentiation process and become male and female gametes. Hazelrigg has investigated how genes are regulated within the stem cells of germs and how this regulation is impacted by differentiation. They discovered the histone-lysine methyltransferase dSETDB1, which is located in the pericentric heterochromatin and catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 at its K9 residue (H3K9). In the absence of this gene, germline-stem cells are not maintained in adult Drosophila in both the ovaries and the testes.  They are investigating the gene targets of dSETDB1 and the mechanisms by which dSETDB1 identifies the targets in the genome.
In September 2019, Hazelrigg and their husband, Chalfie, were awarded honorary degrees from Connecticut College.
Selected publications
Personal life
In 1989 Hazelrigg married Martin Chalfie. Chalfie was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein.

Michael Angelo Rooker (1746 or 1743 – 3 March 1801) was an English oil and watercolour painter of architecture and landscapes, illustrator and engraver. They were also the principal scene painter at the Haymarket Theatre.
Life and work
Michael was the son of artist Edward Rooker and Elizabeth Coatham and was taught engraving by their father and drawing by Paul Sandby at the St. Martin's Lane school in London and at the Royal Academy Schools. It was Sandby who called them Michael "Angelo" Rooker in jest, but the name stuck.
In 1765 they exhibited some 'stained' drawings at the exhibition in Spring Gardens, London and in 1768 a print by them of the 'Villa Adriana' (after Richard Wilson), was published. In 1770 they were elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. In 1772 they exhibited a painting of Temple Bar, and they contributed some illustrations to an edition of Sterne, published that year. Most of the landscapes in Kearsley's Copperplate Magazine (1776–1777) were engraved by him, as well as a few plates in its successor, 'The Virtuosi's Museum', and they both drew and engraved the headings of the Oxford Almanack for several years, for each of which they received 50 pounds.
For a long time they were chief scene-painter at the Haymarket Theatre in London, and appeared in the playbills as Signer Rookerini; but a few years before their death they were discharged, in consequence, it is said, of their refusal to aid in paying the debts of Colman, the manager.
In 1788 they began to make autumnal tours in the country, to which we owe most of those drawings which entitle them to an honourable place among the founders of the watercolour school. They are chiefly of architectural remains in Norfolk, Suffolk, Somerset, Warwickshire, and other counties, which they drew well, and treated with taste and refinement. Their figures and animals were artistically introduced.
Rooker became depressed after their discharge from the Haymarket Theatre, and died suddenly in their chair in Dean Street, Soho, on 3 March 1801. Their drawings were sold at Squib's auction room in Savile Row in the following May, and realised £1,240.
Rooker was unmarried and lived their whole life in London. They exhibited one drawing at the Society of Artists, and ninety-eight at the Royal Academy. They were admired by J. M. W. Turner who learnt an aspect of painting technique called "colour scaling" by copying Rooker's "Gatehouse at Battle Abbey", and purchased over a dozen of Rooker's paintings after their death.

Daniel Loxton (born 1975) is a Canadian writer, illustrator, and skeptic. They wrote or co-wrote several books including Tales of Prehistoric Life, a children's science trilogy, and Abominable Science!, a scientific look at cryptozoology. As editor of Junior Skeptic, Loxton writes and illustrates most issues of Junior Skeptic, a children's science section in the Skeptics Society's Skeptic magazine.
Loxton has written articles for critical thinking publications including eSkeptic, Skeptic, Skeptical Briefs, and the Skeptical Inquirer as well as contributed cover art to Skeptic, Yes, and Free Inquiry. They also regularly contributes to Skepticblog, a collaboration blog promoting science, critical thinking, and skepticism.
Early life
Loxton credits Barry Beyerstein for their interest in skepticism. In several interviews Loxton talks about attending a science fiction conference in British Columbia in 1991 and hearing Beyerstein speak on behalf of the BC Skeptics. "He calmly and kindly fielded questions from the audience—and I was shocked by almost everything they said. This wasn't the usual fluff: this guy really knew what they were talking about, in a way that I had never encountered before. Even their 'I don't know's were substantial in a way that I wasn't used to hearing."
Loxton worked as a professional shepherd in British Columbia on the Canadian side of the Alaska Panhandle.
Career
Loxton has published articles on skeptical activism. In 2007, they wrote "Where Do We Go From Here?" about the direction of the new generation of skepticism, and which helped to inspire the SkeptiCamp community organized conferences on scientific skepticism. Then in 2009, they wrote "What Do I Do Next?" providing ideas for individual involvement in the skepticism movement, which was featured on an episode of the Skepticality podcast. In 2014, they wrote "Why Is There a Skeptical Movement?" which explores "the roots, founding principles, and purpose of scientific skepticism. Arguing that it is essential for skeptics to "appreciate that we're caretakers for the work of those who have come before," Loxton carries forward the discussion about the scope and limits of scientific skepticism that has been raised again in recent days".
Loxton is the author of Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came To Be, which was nominated for the Canadian Children's Book Centre's Norma Fleck Award for Children's Non-Fiction and won the Lane Anderson Award (a $10,000 prize). When pitching Evolution to U.S. publishers, Loxton was told "‘Well of course I love it, but we just think it's a little too hot,'... Which is a strange thing to say about fundamental biology." Not so in Canada. About writing a children's book on the topic of evolution Loxton states "People forget to see kids as thinking beings, as people who have existential questions that they want answered. They just need the best information available," they said. "Keep it simple, but make it true."
In 2011, they wrote Ankylosaur Attack (Tales of Prehistoric Life), which was nominated for a Forest of Reading Silver Birch Express award from the Ontario Library Association. They also appeared in an interview on the JREF podcast, For Good Reason in the episode dated February 6, 2010 and on Christopher Brown's Meet the Skeptics! podcast.
In 2013, they co-authored Abominable Science!.
In 2015, Loxton was elected a fellow of the Committee of Skeptical Inquiry.

Volo's Guide to All Things Magical is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1996.
Contents
Volo is a famous AD&D adventurer who, in an effort to help adventurers in Faerûn, has written a number of guides to regions within the Realms. The book, which stresses that its contents may not actually be true, contains 65 new spells, details of the people who know these spells, new magical items, magical locations throughout the area, a section on the crafting of magical items and some details of an entirely new form of magic called Spellfire.
Publication history
Volo's Guide to All Things Magical was designed by Ed Greenwood with Eric L. Boyd, and published by TSR in 1996.
Reception
Paul Pettengale reviewed Volo's Guide to All Things Magical for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. They refer to Volo (whom Pettengale consistently calls "Rolo" instead) as "a famous AD&D adventurer" who is "one of those characters that everyone's heard about, and one that just about every Dungeon Master must have been tempted to introduce to their campaign at some point or another. Anyhow, Rolo's now branched out trying their hand at compiling a guide to, well, All Things Magical." Pettengale comments on how the book's contents may not actually be true: "that's up to the ref - you can't have the players thinking they know everything about magic in the Realms". They also comment on the new form of magic in the book: "What's that called? Why, Spellfire of course, which just happens to be the name of a certain collectible card game by TSR. Spellfire is a complicated business, and I wouldn't actually encourage any DM to give it to a player to use; it's way too powerful for the majority of campaigns, and the very possession of it suggests close affiliation with Mystra, which most wizards would never aspire to." Pettengale concluded their review by saying: "There's a hell of a lot of information packed into these 128 pages. It would take weeks to assimilate it all, and months on end of gaming to incorporate it all into your campaign world, The fact that the ref can ignore it at will is important – you really don't want the players thinking they know too much, and, if I were to use it I think I'd actually ban my players from reading it Used as a ref's magical guide in its own right, Rolo's Guide to All Things Magical is an interesting and worthy addition to the lore of the Realms, with plenty going for it."

Titus Flavius Boethus (died 168) was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.  They are known as being an acquaintance of the physician Galen. Boethus was suffect consul in one of the nundinia falling in the later half of 161 with [? Julius] Geminus Capellianus as their colleague.
Boethus had their family origins in Ptolemais in Syria. Their name suggests they are descended from a man whom either the emperor Vespasian or a relative of theirs gave the Roman citizenship to, but there is no record of any Flavian being governor of Syria. Otherwise there is no known relationship, familial or otherwise, between Boethus and the emperor.
Life
At some point after Galen arrived in Rome in 162, they became the doctor for Boethus' wife and son, and thus became acquainted with the consul. Boethus encouraged Galen to offer public lectures on anatomy, which Galen offered over a three-year period. G.W. Bowersock notes that these lectures were "very much to the taste of the people of that time", and includes in Galen's audience such prominent Senators as Marcus Vettulenus Civica Barbarus consul in 157, Lucius Sergius Paullus consul II in 168, and Gnaeus Claudius Severus consul II in 173.
Boethus was appointed governor of the imperial province of Syria Palaestina for the usual term of three years starting around 166. Before they departed, they obtained medical advice to follow while in that eastern province. Despite those steps, Boethus died while governor of Syria Palaestina in 168.

Its most famous inhabitant was William Domville Handcock, the eldest son of William Elias Handcock and a descendant of William Handcock (Westmeath politician)|William Handcock, who came to Ireland with Oliver Cromwell's army during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and settled at Twyford in County Westmeath. They were born on 2 September 1830, and having been educated at Nutgrove School, Rathfarnham, and at Trinity College, Dublin, took their degree in 1852. As a magistrate for the County Dublin, Mr. Handcock constantly presided on the Tallaght Petty Sessions bench, of which they were a much-valued member. They were also a Guardian of the South Dublin Union, and a frequent attendant at the meetings of that board. For many years they were an active supporter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They died on 5 June 1887.

The Walking Dead: Torn Apart is a six-part web series based on the television series The Walking Dead. It aired in its entirety on October 3, 2011, on AMC's official website.
The web series tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as "Bicycle Girl", the walker whom Rick Grimes killed in the first episode. Rick risks a walker encounter to go back and find Hannah before they set out for Atlanta. After telling them they are "sorry this happened to you," Rick shoots them in what is clearly a humanitarian gesture, which reveals much about Rick's own character and sets a tone for the rest of season one.
These webisodes were followed by a second set of webisodes, titled Cold Storage, which were released on October 1, 2012.
Plot
Hannah, a mother of two kids, awakens from a car crash to find their two children missing. They run to their ex's house, and finds them there. Andrew, their ex, had previously shot and hid their walker wife, who comes back and almost kills the two kids before Hannah kills them In a flashback, it is revealed that after going to their neighbor's house to scavenge supplies, Andrew was asked to shoot their living neighbor, Mike Palmer, who had been bitten. Mike also asked that they shoot their two children upstairs who have already turned, which they neglect to do. Later in a desperate attempt to flee with their family, Andrew tries to get the keys to Mike's truck, but is killed in the process by Mike's undead children they had failed to shoot. A helicopter hovering over the neighborhood announces to any survivors to make their way to the concession stand at the park, where they are evacuating refugees. Hannah and their children leave on foot in an attempt to get there, but Hannah is bitten along the way. After they are bitten, Hannah hands a pistol to their daughter and tells them and their brother to run to safety at the concession stand, and then they are devoured and torn in half by a horde of walkers. The last shot is of them waking up as a walker and then starting to pull themselves along the ground.

The RTÉ Archives and Libraries are a collection of photographs, sounds recordings, video footage and written records (of articles such as scripts) in various formats across a wide range of topics pertaining to Irish life and society.
The collection is derived from the material used by Raidió Teilifís Éireann in their activities as national broadcaster for Ireland.
As RTÉ is part funded by a licence fee from Irish householders with televisions, it has a responsibility to maintain and update this collection and make it available to the general public.
In common with most broadcasters, much of RTÉ's early material was never recorded, with tapes wiped for re-use or simply dumped. The remaining footage largely consists of random extracts, rather than complete series. However, they provide insightful examples of historical programming.
As from Christmas 2021 much more footage of clips, news, sports and programmes will be added to mark 60 years of television.
Logo
The RTÉ Archives logo incorporates RTÉ current corporate logo with a take on the 1967 corporate logo for the word archive. There are two versions of the logo, generally the first letter of the word Archive is used (as see in description box) but also where the full word is used.

The Rangpur Riders joined the league as a member in 2013, prior to the second edition of the tournament. Although the ownership of the team changed multiple times, the team structure stayed at its original form since the foundation of the team.
In the 5th edition of BPL, They defeated Dhaka Dynamites in the finals to win their first title.
On 16 November 2019, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced Incepta Pharmaceuticals as the sponsor of the team and it was renamed to Rangpur Rangers. The team was excluded from 2021–22 Bangladesh Premier League.
History
The Rangpur Riders was established in 2012, afterward first season of the Bangladesh Premier League. The team was bought by Mustafa Rafiqul Islam, owner of iSports Limited. The franchise right were bought for US$1.1 million at a closed-door auction. Haque Brothers Industries Limited also participated in the bid, but failed to outbid iSports Limited, a sister-concern of Flora Telecom. The Riders joined the tournament in 2013 as the seventh team, representing the newly declared Rangpur Division. The team ownership was transferred to Sohana Sports which is now managed by Bashundhara Group, a pioneering conglomerate of Bangladesh. The team's logo is copied without permission from that of the Midnight Riders, a supporters group for the American MLS soccer side New England Revolution.
Season overview
Debut season
Rangpur Riders were the newest addition to franchise during the second edition of the league. The team began its league run with Nasir Hossain as their icon player, and Abdur Razzak (cricketer) as the captain. Pakistani legendary spinner Saqlain Mushtaq was appointed as the coach. The Riders picked up their first victory against Chittagong Kings, winning by 6 wickets. The team ended the season with five wins, and seven loss, resulting in a point-table tie with Duronto Rajshahi, later dropping off from the playoffs due to lower Net Run Rate than Rajshahi. Nasir Hossain was the highest paid cricketer of the team with a salary of US$208,000.
Season Two
Riders of Hope got its hope for this season when they purchase Shakib Al Hasan as their Icon player for this season in the newly introduced Player Draft policy instead of Bidding like previous 2 seasons.
This season Rangpur Riders hired Shane Jurgensen as their head coach to make a tough team as per their promise in the Player Draft. This season they did pick some well known local players, like- Shakib Al Hasan, Arafat Sunny, Soumya Sarkar, Al-Amin, Saqlain Sajib and few more, along with some classy international T20 specialist Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Sachithra Senanayake, Mohammad Nabi with some experienced face, like Misbah-ul-Haq.
This well balanced team ended the season by capturing 3rd position in the League but could not qualify for the final thanks to loss against Barisal Bulls in the 2nd qualifier after a win against Dhaka Dynamites in the eliminator.
Season Three
Prior to the fourth season, the ownership of the Riders were transferred to Sohana Sports. The team rearranged its playing squad, with Shahid Afridi, Soumya Sarkar, Mohammad Shehzad and many other acclaimed cricketers. Shakib Al Hasan, the icon player from the previous edition was transferred to Dhaka Dynamites. The club also included rising star Babar Azam, hard-hitting all-rounder Dasun Shanaka in their squad and signing Sohag Gazi and Rubel Hossain proved beneficial for the bowling attack. Having Ziaur Rahman in the playing eleven who was also picked in the draft seemed useful as they provided some big hits when batting. Retaining Mohammad Mithun was a good call as they were the second highest run scorer for the team that season and Arafat Sunny took magical figures of 3/0 against Khulna Titans which proves they were also worth retaining.
The Riders started the season strong with a dominating victory against Chittagong Vikings, winning the match by 9 wickets with Mohammad Shahzad scoring 80 runs. The team continued its domination during its second game, getting Khulna Titans all out for 44, the lowest ever total in Bangladesh Premier League. They lost their way later on and finished fifth in the team rankings, thus, not qualifying for the playoffs.
Season Four
Previous icon player Soumya Sarkar left the team, resulting in the team announcing Mashrafe Mortaza as the new icon and captain. They signed Jamaican t20 specialist, Chris Gayle, one of the cleanest hitter of the cricket ball, former New Zealand captain and opener Brendon McCullum and Lankan genuine swinger, Lasith Malinga They also signed two English seams bowling all-rounder David Willey and Ravi Bopara. Their other squad members include West Indian leggie Samuel Badree and more. They Retained Rubel Hossain and Sohag Gazi. Both of them bowled well last season. The third retained player is Mohammad Mithun who was their second highest run scorer last season. They picked English batter Sam Hain, Afghan batting all-rounder Samiullah Shenwari, experienced orthodox spinners Abdur Razzak (cricketer) and more from the draft.
They picked 8 locals and 3 foreigners from the draft which is 1 more than the minimum requirement for each category. Their first pick was Shahriar Nafees, a prominent Bangladeshi batsman. The surprise picks were inexperienced and little-known Afghan slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler Zahir Khan.
Rangpur began their campaign with a win against Rajshahi Kings. They suffered a few defeats on the way but managed to qualify for the playoffs, finished 4th in the league stage, just enough for the qualification. In the eliminator against Khulna Titans, Chris Gayle won them the match with an unbeaten 126. In the 2nd qualifier against Comilla Victorians, Johnson Charles won them the match with their maiden century in t20 cricket. In the final, Chris Gayle once again smacked a hundred, this time a record 146*. The bowlers also did very well which won them their first championship. Their skipper Mashrafe Mortaza has now won 4 BPLs out of 5 for 3 different teams.
Season Five
Riders have retained Mashrafe Mortaza, Mohammad Mithun, Nazmul Islam, Ravi Bopara and Chris Gayle. They have also signed English opener Alex Hales and South African batsmen AB de Villiers. AB will play 9 matches and more if the team advances to the playoffs.
In the draft, they signed the likes of Shafiul Islam, Abul Hasan, Sohag Gazi and Nahidul Islam. They signed Rilee Rossouw, Benny Howell and Oshane Thomas from the international category.
Season Six
The captain Mashrafe Mortaza was released and Shakib Al Hasan, the captain of Dhaka Dynamites, left the team and joined Riders for the season.
Season seven (2019-20)
During the player's direct signing period, a Conflict of Interests aroused between BCB and all other franchise. Subsequently, in September 2019, BCB made some changes in rules and regulations for this season and eliminating all franchises, BCB took over the charge of the current BPL and decided to run this current tournament by the board itself and named the tournament as Bangabandhu BPL T20 2019 in order to pay homage to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on their birth centenary. Apparently the team was owned by BCB itself but later Incepta Pharmaceuticals became the team sponsor of Rangpur. They renamed it to ‘Rangpur Rangers'.

David Taylor Kellock (1913–1988) was a leading Australian stained glass artist from the late 1940s until the 1970s.
Life and career
Born in Dunfermline, Scotland, on 19 January 1913, Kellock studied in Edinburgh and worked at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, before coming to Australia in the 1930s. In the United Kingdom, they specialised in stained glass, textiles, fabric printing, dye mixing and pottery work, including glass mixing.
Kellock was appointed Head of the Art Department at the Hobart Technical College and examiner in history of architecture for the RAIA in Tasmania from 1939 to 1941. They were in charge of the art school at Geelong Grammar School and moved to Ballarat in 1946, where they began their stained glass business and was also art teacher at the Ballarat School of Mines.
Kellock was a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London and an associate of the Stained Glass Association of America.
Artistic philosophy
In 1946, Kellock wrote "Appreciation is not a mere matter of caprice; we must not be satisfied by 'This pleases me, That does not' ... We may learn to feel more widely and to ... find pleasure in qualities which at first were not apparent. Even as artists we should understand and practise appreciation, for a sympathy with others is of value in completing and enriching our own work. We are not only artists, we are also human beings ... Unless art is of some use to humanity and makes life better and richer, humanity will pass it by ... Under all forms of art, there lies a common principle. The human mind is capable of ... a scientific or intellectual form ... an emotional or imaginative form ... It is this touch of emotion and imagination which is the essence of art."
Commissions
Kellock carried out a wide range of commissions for Australia's leading church architect, Louis Williams, in their churches, chapels and schools, with fifty-five windows for St Mark's Chapel, Flinders Naval Depot (Westernport) in Victoria; seventeen windows for St John's in Camberwell, Victoria; St Giles' in Murrumbeena, Victoria; Geelong Grammar school chapel in Geelong, Victoria; All Saints' Newtown, Geelong; St Andrew's, Brighton; St Mark's in Red Cliffs, Victoria; St George's in Parkes, New South Wales; All Saints' in Canowindra, New South Wales, and St Stephen's, Adamstown, New South Wales; St Edmund's, Wembley, Western Australia; St David's Cathedral in Hobart, Tasmania; St John's, Devonport, Tasmania, Holy Trinity, Ulverstone, Tasmania..
The stained glass Kellock made for St Mark's Chapel, honouring Royal Australian Navy crews and ships lost in action, was among their most outstanding achievements.
Kellock also worked for other architects and their memorial windows are in the Littlejohn Memorial Chapel in Scotch College, Melbourne, Melbourne Grammar School Chapel, St John's, Beaufort, Victoria; St Augustine's, in the City of Moreland; St Paul's Ballarat; St John's, Balian, Christ Church Cathedral, Grafton, New South Wales, Methodist church, Albury, New South Wales and windows in Brisbane and Tasmania.
David Taylor Kellock died on 6 June 1988 in Berwick, Melbourne, Victoria.

Thomas Henty (born Thomas John Cooper 19January 195613August 1988) was an English actor, and the son of the magician and prop comedian Tommy Cooper. They attended Sutton Court Primary School in Chiswick, and Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith from September 1965. They went on to appear alongside their father in an episode of the Thames Television variety series London Night Out in 1979, as well as in four episodes of the series Cooper's Half Hour in 1980, also for the Thames. They also acted as occasional stage manager to their father, and was backstage when Cooper had a fatal heart attack in front of a live television audience at Them Majesty's Theatre on 15April 1984.
In addition to their work with their father, Henty was an actor in their own right. Their desire to make their own mark in the field was behind their decision to adopt their mother's maiden name. In an archive interview with the television personality Frank Bough, included in the ITV documentary The Unforgettable Tommy Cooper (2001), Henty said that they did not want people in the acting profession to know that they were Cooper's son. Henty made appearances in episodes of the television series Robin of Sherwood (1984) and Just Good Friends (1986), as well as the film Bellman and True (1987), which would be their final film role.
In 1988, Henty's marriage collapsed after seven years. They died on 13 August 1988, aged 32, of haemophilia, following complications caused by liver failure. Doctors had given them transfusions totalling 70 pints, but the blood failed to clot and after three days their mother took the decision to have their life support machine switched off, four years after their father's death. They left behind a son, who was aged six at the time.

Luton Corporation Tramways served the town of Luton in Bedfordshire from 21 February 1908 until 16 April 1932.
History
In 1904, Luton Corporation applied for a Tramways Provisional Order, and this was confirmed and granted in 1905. The corporation issued out the work to competitive tender, and the contract was secured by White & Co on 19 March 1907.
The tramway was constructed in 4½ months, work beginning on 7 October 1907. The total cost, including the 12 tramcars, was £63,000 ().
The official inauguration took place on 23 February 1908. In 1909 the lease transferred to Balfour, Beatty and Co, and Luton Corporation took over the running of the system some years later.
In 1925, the tramways made a profit of £2,000 ().
Infrastructure
The complete system opened in 1908, and had five routes originating at the Town Hall:
Manchester Street, Mill Street, Midland Road, High Town Road, Hitchin Road to a terminus at the junction with Ramridge Road at . (Round Green)
Manchester Street, New Bedford Road to a terminus by Wardown Park at
Upper George Street, Dunstable Road to a terminus at the junction with Kingsway at
George Street, Chapel Street, Windsor Street, Hibbert Street, Ashton Road, London Road to a terminus at the junction with Tennyson Road at . (Stockwood)
George Street, Park Street to the depot situated opposite Bailey Street at . (Park Town)
Tramcars
The fleet, in a livery of grass green with ivory window frames and rocker panels, consisted of:
12 open top double deck tramcars, from the United Electric Car Company, each with two 30 h.p. motors. In 1929 five were converted to top covered.
1 single deck tramcar.
In 1923, a single deck car was purchased from Glasgow Corporation Tramways as an economy measure.
Closure
Towards the end of 1930, the Eastern National Omnibus Company made an offer to purchase the Luton tramways for £64,000 (). The offer was accepted by the Council on 20 January 1931. On 12 May 1932, the council re-affirmed its decision to sell out to the Eastern National Omnibus Company. However, it was forced to rescind its decision, and eventually decided to operate its own buses in place of the trams.
The tramway system closed on 16 April 1932 and was replaced by the motorbuses of Luton Corporation.
Preserved tramcar
Luton's only single deck tram is being restored, for static display, at Stockwood Discovery Centre.
Uncovered tramlines
On Monday 3 February 2014 a section of road was dug up by contractors during the process of building a new road (to run alongside the current railway lines) at the junction of Old Bedford Road and Midland Road, Luton. Following removal of tarmac and cobblestones a section of single tram line was clearly visible still buried in the road.

Born in 1958, Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing has been chairperson and CEO of Sofema since 2007.
Training
Engineering graduate of the École Navale
MBA from CPA Toulouse
Attended (in a civil capacity) the 58th session (2005) of IHEDN (Institut des Hautes Etudes de Défense Nationale)
Career
After an initial career as a naval officer and helicopter pilot, Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing entered Turbomeca (Snecma group) based in Pau in 1994 as Sales Manager and, later, marketing director.
In addition to new equipment, the engine retrofit activity (successive changes of a standard model by return to factory) would later inform their thinking on the future of extending the life of equipment and the new direction of Sofema.
From 2000 to 2004 in the UK, Giscard d'Estaing managed three separate companies - Turbomeca UK, and the joint ventures Rolls Royce-Turbomeca and Rolls Royce-Snecma. With these jobs, they were confronted with Franco-British cooperation, strategic negotiations with prestigious boards, maintaining close contact with customers and users.
In 2004, Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing joined Snecma headquarters in France as deputy director of International Affairs for European countries and, when the group merged with Sagem, they became Deputy Vice President of International Development of the new entity Safran.
In 2007 Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing succeeded General Bernard Norlain as president of Sofema - then specialized in supplying export support to large French aeronautic and defense groups.
They implemented a profound transformation of the company, which is today focused on the renovation and sale of military and civil equipment to countries with lower purchasing power and a reasoned development policy.
This successful reorientation is based on Guillaume Giscard d'Estaing's belief that Sofema's new activity must strengthen French economic presence in these countries through balanced and sustainable partnerships.

Nightbook is an album created by Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi and released in 2009. The album saw Einaudi take a new direction with their music as they incorporated synthesized sounds alongside their solo piano playing. A new approach could be seen with tracks such as "Nightbook", and "Lady Labyrinth" where the element of percussion was utilized along the piano, acting as a driving force throughout the song.
In Italy the album went Gold with more than 35,000 copies sold. Einaudi describes this album as "A night-time landscape. A garden faintly visible under the dull glow of the night sky. A few stars dotting the darkness above, shadows of the trees all around. Light shining from a window behind me. What I can see is familiar, but it seems alien at the same time. It's like a dream - anything may happen."
The title track "Nightbook" was used in the TV advertisement for the Channel 4 drama "Any Human Heart".
The track "Lady Labyrinth" is often used as background music in Top Gear specials.

Good Food was a cookery channel broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Ireland, latterly as part of the Discovery, Inc. network of channels. The channel originally launched on 5 November 2001 and relaunched in its final format on 22 June 2009. Good Food was available on satellite through Sky, on cable through Virgin Media, and through IPTV with TalkTalk TV, BT TV. From 2015 to 2018, Good Food was temporarily rebranded as Christmas Food during the festive season.
Good Food ceased operations on 12 September 2019, with all its programmes moving to Food Network.
History
UKTV announced the launch of UK Food on 11 July 2001, as the first offshoot channel for UK Style, being dedicated to cookery programmes that had previously been broadcast on the increasingly crowded UK Style. The channel eventually launched 5 November 2001, and broadcast within 7am-7pm every day, timesharing with UK Drama. The channel soon expanded its hours to 5am-9pm, before gaining a full 24-hour slot. On 8 March 2004, the channel rebranded as UKTV Food.
The channel used a large amount of programming from the BBC's programme archive, and was similar to a former international channel run by BBC Worldwide called BBC Food, as both use similar programming and both have a similar format.
As part of the rebranding of all UKTV's channels to a unique name and identity, UKTV Food rebranded as Good Food on 22 June 2009, the last of UKTV's brands to do so. The name was based on that of the BBC Good Food cookery magazine, published by Immediate Media Company. The channel and the magazine continued to be operated separately.
Acquisistion by Discovery and closure
On 1 April 2019, it was announced that UKTV co-owner Discovery Inc. would acquire the BBC's stake in Good Food. They took it over along with sister channels Home and Really in June.
On 5 September 2019, Discovery announced that Good Food would merge with Food Network and close on 12 September 2019, with its programmes moving to the sister channel. Good Food was removed from Virgin Media on 11 September, while the channel itself was shut down on 12 September 2019, after which the channel space created in 2001 by UK Food ceased to exist. The last programme shown was an episode of Choccywoccydoodah.
Subsidiary channels
Good Food +1
Alongside the main channel, a time shift channel was also operated: Good Food +1. Corresponding to the name on the main channel, it shows all programming from the channel one hour later, with no special idents or continuity used.
The channel launched on Sky Digital as UK Food +1 on 12 November 2003, airing between 6am-7pm daily, before expanding fully like its main channel. It was later named UKTV Food +1 before going with its final name.
Good Food HD
On 13 July 2009, Virgin Media revealed that they were "currently in active talks" with UKTV about launching a high-definition version of Good Food on their cable television platform. Good Food HD launched on 31 August 2010 on Sky, broadcasting a HD simulcast of the channel's schedule. As part of Virgin Media's deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV's HD channels were added to Virgin's cable television service by 2012. Good Food HD was added to Virgin Media on 7 October 2011.
On-air identity
When UK Food channel launched in 2001, the channel adopted a branding package based around circular shaped foods with a spiral pattern located in the centre when looked at from above. The channel's logo at the time featured the name, stylised as UK Food, and a two lined spiral extending outwards from the right of the name. The majority of UKTV channels had some pattern located there to distinguish the channel, and this spiral also featured in the idents themselves as well as channel promotions.
Following the rebranding as UKTV Food, the channel's identity was altered. The swirling motif was retained within the idents themselves: indeed many of the previous idents survived rebrand reuse. The primary difference was the addition of the two lined UKTV logo, aligned to the left of the screen. The channels colour was orange, and was used in different shades as the background colour to all promotion end boards and static slides both on the channel and for promotion across the network.
Following the rebranding to Good Food, the idents changed to sequences involving the coming together of ingredients to events such as a picnic barbecue, a dinner party and a family Sunday roast. The idents finished with an endboard featuring the circular Good Food logo in the centre of a screen with food imagery in the background, such as fish outlines, knife and fork or wine glasses.

USNS Kingsport (T-AG-164) was built as SS Kingsport Victory, a United States Maritime Commission VC2-S-AP3 (Victory) type cargo ship. During the closing days of World War II the ship was operated by the American Hawaiian Steamship Company under an agreement with the War Shipping Administration. After a period of layup the ship was operated as USAT Kingsport Victory by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948. When Army transports were transferred to the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service the ship continued as USNS Kingsport Victory (T-AK-239), a cargo transport . On 14 November 1961, after conversion into the first satellite communication ship, the ship was renamed Kingsport, reclassified as a general auxiliary, and operated as USNS Kingsport (T-AG-164).
The ship was sent to Lagos, Nigeria as the control station for Syncom 2 becoming the site of the first two way call by satellite by heads of state. The call was between Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard the Kingsport and President John F. Kennedy on 23 August 1963. In 1967 the ship underwent conversion and became a bathymetric and acoustic survey ship for the installation and maintenance of the then classified Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) under the unclassified name of Project Caesar,
Construction
Kingsport Victory, a United States Maritime Commission VC2-S-AP3 (Victory) type cargo ship, was laid down 4 April 1944 with launch on 29 May and completion on 12 July 1944 with delivery to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on the same day at Los Angeles. They were built under the Emergency Shipbuilding program under cognizance of the U.S. Maritime Commission. Basic dimensions, not counting modifications for satellite communications, were length (LBP), beam and .
World War II and Army service
Kingsport Victory was immediately placed in operation by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, under a War Shipping Administration general agency agreement, supplying troops in the Pacific. They made trips between California and Pearl Harbor. On 17 October 1944 they steamed from California, arriving at Milne Bay in New Guinea on 2 November. They carried cargo to US troops and ships at Eniwetok, Iwo Jima, Guam, Ulithi atoll and Okinawa. Kingsport Victory was active delivering support for the Battle of Iwo Jima from 19 February to 26 March 1945. In battle they had to use their deck guns to defend against air attacks. Kingsport Victory received one Battle star for their service. After the war, in December 1945 they steamed from Okinawa to Hong Kong, then Calcutta; through the Suez Canal they arrived at New York City on 27 February 1946. During 1946 they moved cargo from the US east and west coasts.
After the war, on 29 September 1947, they were taken out of service and placed in the reserve fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia. On 8 April 1948 the ship was taken out of reserve and bareboat chartered to the War Department for operation as the USAT 'Kingsport Victory a US Army Transport. During this time the ship was involved in a legal case, Johansen, v. United States, involving rights of an Army civil service employee crew member in personal injury cases. On 1 March 1950 they were removed from US Army Transport and transferred the US Navy.
Navy MSTS serviceKingsport Victory was among large Army ships transferred to the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) with Kingsport Victory being transferred effective 1 March 1950. The ship carried military cargo for the next eleven years as USNS Kingsport Victory (T-AK-239). Kingsport Victory is seen in an Air Force documentary film on the construction of the Dew Line loading supplies at Norfolk, Virginia and unloading at Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS Kingsport was further modified and, in August 1963 while in Lagos harbor, transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when John F. Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard Kingsport spoke in a two-way call. A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington. The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with Kingsport which was off Morocco. Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Kingsport then supported Project Gemini into March 1966. After conversion from satellite configuration, particularly removal of the large and very visible dome, Kingsport was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs.
Satellite communications ship Kingsport
On 24 September 1961, they were delivered to the Portland, Oregon facilities of Willamette Iron & Steel Company where they underwent conversion to become the first satellite communications ship. On 14 November 1961 they were renamed Kingsport and reclassified AG-164.
Designed for use by the United States Army Satellite Communications Agency in the defense satellite communications programs, Project ADVENT, USNS Kingsport underwent extensive alteration during conversion. A special high frequency radio station was installed for ship-to-shore communications. They received advanced tracking and telemetry equipment and anti-roll stabilization tanks. In addition, a 30-foot, gyro-stabilized, computer-oriented, triaxial, parabolic antenna was installed on their afterdeck. Housed in a 53-foot, plastic, air-pressurized radome, this antenna permitted precision tracking of a high altitude satellite at any angle above the horizon.Kingsport sailed to Lagos, Nigeria after Syncom 2 had been successfully launched on 26 July 1963 to serve as the terminal control station during testing and evaluation of the satellite. On 23 August 1963, President John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C., telephoned Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard the Kingsport docked in Lagos Harbor via Syncom 2, the first geosynchronous communication satellite. It was the first live two-way call between heads of state by satellite. Syncom 2 and Relay 1 linked Nigeria, Brazil and the United States with Kingsport transmitting through Syncom 2 to New Jersey and New Jersey via Relay 1 to Rio de Janeiro. During this period Gulf of Guinea oceanographic data, composed of depths temperature and salinity from a station, were transmitted from the to the National Oceanographic Data Center via Kingsport and Syncom 2.Kingsport departed Lagos 23 September and during transit off Morocco on 2 October demonstrated the first satellite communications between an aircraft in flight when a Navy aircraft off the Virginia coast made voice contact with the ship via satellite. The ship reached Rota, Spain on 3 October, staying until 6 October, then sailed supporting communication tests in the Mediterranean from 7 to 25 October. Tests of voice and teletype links between the United States and ships of the 6th Fleet successful with the ship visiting Leghorn, Italy and Beirut, Lebanon during the voyage. After arriving in Rota 26 October and completing additional experiments they sailed for Norfolk 9 November and arrived 21 November.Kingsport departed for the Pacific 17 February 1964 via Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal stopping at San Diego 13 March and reaching Pearl Harbor on 25 March 1964. For the next ten months the ship operated between Pearl Harbor and Guam supporting further communication experiments including those related to the evaluation of SYNCOM 3 after its launching 19 August 1964. Further experiments extended throughout the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean until July 1965.
They then provided support for NASA's Gemini manned space shots serving as on station communications ship between Okinawa and the Philippines for Gemini 5 from 21 to 29 August. They supported three more Gemini flights between 4 December and 16 March 1966 before returning to the West Coast in April. They remained at San Francisco from 18 April to 27 October in a ready reserve status. During November they steamed to the East Coast, and in early 1967 was at New York undergoing repairs and alterations.
Survey ship
After completion of their communications support role the USNS Kingsport became a bathymetric and acoustic survey ship supporting Project Caesar, the installation and maintenance of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), and undersea surveillance development. The ship was part of the "Caeasr fleet" under the technical control of the project's Program Manager, then Naval Electronics Systems Command (NAVELEX PME-124). Among the now published reports, declassified in 2006, of the ship's work is a description of the Indian Ocean exercise code named BEARING STAKE that took place from January to April 1977.
Disposal
Kingsport was placed out of service on 31 Jan 1984, transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup on 29 August 1984 then transferred back to the Military Sealift Command for scientific research on 1 March 1990. The ship was withdrawn from the reserve fleet on 21 January 1992 for scrapping in India.
Honors
Crew of Naval Armed Guard on the SS Kingsport Victory earned "Battle Stars" in World War II for war action during the assault occupation of Assault occupation of Iwo Jima from 13 March 1945 to 16 March 1945.

The Xincheng Incident () is an event that took place in 1896 in the city of Xincheng, Karenkō Prefecture, Taiwan, Empire of Japan. The chief of the Truku tribe, Holok Naowi, led 20 aboriginal warriors against the Japanese forces, killing 13 Japanese soldiers.
Background and causes
Since the Japanese empire took over Taiwan in 1895, there had been a growing tension between the local aboriginal tribes trying to protect their villages and hunting grounds and the Japanese forces which aimed to take over control of aboriginals lands in order to exploit natural resources.
The Xincheng event was mostly caused by sexual abuses of aboriginal women by Japanese soldiers.
Consequences
After the incident the Japanese forces launched a series of retaliatory attacks on the Truku, taking advantage of their terrain knowledge manage to resist hiding in the mountain villages.
The Japanese were forced to withdraw and offered amnesty to the aboriginal who surrendered.
After different conflicts the Truku War ended in 1914 with the victory of the Japanese over the Truku people.

Adventist Health Community Care-Hanford (formerly Central Valley General Hospital) is a clinic in Hanford, California. It offers extensive Community Care clinic services serving communities in Kings, Tulare and southern Fresno counties. Adventist Health Community Care-Hanford is a part of a division of Adventist Health known as the "Adventist Health/Central Valley Network," Adventist Health Hanford, Adventist Health Selma, Adventist Health Reedley, and over 42 Adventist Health/Community Care clinics throughout a region in the Central Valley.
History
In 1998, Adventist Health's growth in the San Joaquin Valley surged with the purchase of Central Valley General Hospital, formerly called Sacred Heart Hospital, in Hanford. A year later, Adventist Health purchased Selma Community Hospital, about 15 miles north of Hanford. Central Valley General Hospital and Selma Community Hospital also began opening rural health clinics to improve rural patients' access to health care in the region.
In 2005, the hospital licenses of Hanford Community and Selma Community were combined, and Central Valley General Hospital took over the Selma Community clinics to consolidate operations among the three hospitals in an effort to improve access, quality and strength.
The local network now offers forty-two Adventist Health/Community Care clinic sites in Kings County, Fresno County, Tulare County, Kern County & Madera as well as physical therapy centers, a Sleep Apnea Center and many other services in the region.
On March 7, 2016, the labor and deliver services moved to the new Family Birth Center at Adventist Medical Center – Hanford on Mall Drive. The birth center is a $44 million state-of-the-art facility that focuses on patient experience. It features 11 private labor and delivery rooms, two surgery suites, a six-bed neonatal intensive care unit operated by Valley Children's Healthcare, 16 postpartum rooms, a café, gift shop and more.
With this move, Central Valley General hospital is no longer an inpatient hospital, and was renamed Adventist Health Community Care - Hanford. The six clinic services remain at the campus, including Community Care – Hanford primary care, Behavioral Health, Dental, Family Medicine Residency, Healthy Beginnings and Specialty.
Affiliation
Adventist Health Community Care-Hanford is part of Adventist Health, a faith-based, nonprofit integrated health delivery system serving communities in California, Hawaii and Oregon. Founded on Seventh-day Adventist heritage and values, Adventist Health provides compassionate community care.

Saint Sabbas Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 44 Costache Negri Street in Iași, Romania. It is dedicated to Saint Sabbas the Sanctified.
Origins and rebuilding
The first church on the site was built soon after 1583, when Greek monks from Mar Saba asked Prince Peter the Lame for a plot of land where they could raise a church. Once their request was granted, the monks built a church dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God, along with cells, thus forming a monastery. Placed under the protection of Mar Saba, it acquired the Jerusalem monastery's name. It is believed that Peter contributed to building the church, given their appearance in a votive portrait and in prayers of commemoration. The clearest reference to the church comes in a letter written by Michael the Brave in June 1600. Due to the monastery's wealth, the administration of Moldavian properties belonging to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was located there until the 1863 secularization of monastic estates in Romania.
Problems with the land on which it was built caused the first church to deteriorate rapidly, a process accelerated by the Tatar invasion of 1624. Another theory holds that the church burned in early April 1616, along with all but 600 of the city's 20,000 houses, in a fire caused by Ștefan IX Tomșa. Whatever the case, an entirely new church was built in 1625. Its ktitor was postelnic Enache Caragea, of Greek origin and related to the regnant prince, Radu Mihnea. They donated nearly twenty villages or parts of villages to the monastery, making it among Moldavia's wealthiest. Caragea died in 1632 and was given a lavish headstone inside the church, which does not survive. The bell tower was added at a later, undetermined date. There are three dedication plaques, one in Old Church Slavonic and two in Greek. The first surviving description is from Paul of Aleppo later in the 17th century.
17th and 18th centuries
In 1676-1678, Prince Antonie Ruset, a distant relative of Caragea's, rebuilt the surrounding wall, of which the eastern part still survives. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1976-1979 found that the original church was quite similar to the second one, that the newer one was built further to the north and that both were used as burial grounds including over 300 graves. Research also determined that the area was used for ceramic production from the 15th century until shortly after 1500, when a powerful fire destroyed the workshop. Caragea died without descendants, and by the mid-17th century, the monastery was in the hands of the noble Palade family, with several of its members being buried on the site through the 19th century. Three of their graves are in the vestibule; a fourth has an illegible inscription, but may belong to the architect Ianachi. It was the Palades who removed Caragea's grave, just as they had removed the graves of the 1583 founders. When the Peloponnesian archimandrite Grigore repaired the church in 1820, they left a plaque portraying themselves as the sole ktitor. Such historical amnesia had the approval of the church, which benefited from substantial contributions in exchange for allowing donors to claim the status of founders.
Due to its importance, the monastery hosted various foreign visitors. These included Jerusalem Patriarchs Theophanes III (1617 and 1618), Nectarius (1664) and Dositheos II (1670 and 1673), as well as Antioch Patriarch Macarios III Zaim (1653). In 1619, Neofit of Rhodes translated the Life of Saint Sabbas into vernacular Greek; their book was donated to the monastery. In 1714, during the reign of Nicholas Mavrocordatos and upon the advice of Chrysanthus of Jerusalem, the Princely Academy of Iași opened on the site. A Slavonic and Romanian printing press as well as a library were also opened; in 1744, Sylvester of Antioch arranged for printing in Greek and Arabic as well. After secularization, the library, which included over 800 volumes, was given to the recently established university library. Tradition holds that galleries existed beneath the church and were used in cases of need to hide locals' property and the monastery's valuables, and could even be used to hold liturgies. Large feasts were held for Saint Sabbas' day (December 5), both in people's houses and outside. Moreover, the Greek monks distributed gifts of objects and money every month to the poor and the sick.
Later history and collections
After 1863, the monastery scaled back its cultural activities, although a school opened in the archimandrite's residence the following year. By 1877, this had become a girls' school, housed in a new building. The monastery was converted into a parish church after clergy reform in 1893. The parish closed in 1951 but reopened in 1958.
The church features a two-room museum that includes 80 books from the 18th and 19th centuries and valuable religious objects such as a Polish-inscribed bell from 1570, an aër from 1842 with Greek writing, an 18th-century wool curtain sewn in Byzantine style, 19th-century vestments, icons and liturgical items. There is a large Slavonic Gospel book printed at Moscow in 1637 and coated in silver and gold at Iași in 1642. Coins, ceramics and jewelry unearthed in the 1970s are also kept there. A large icon of Saint John Chrysostom in the nave is from 1711. The Renaissance interior painting done in fresco-secco in 1832, largely destroyed over time, was reworked in neo-Byzantine style from 2010 to 2013. The 19th-century iconostasis, featuring rich Baroque carvings, was restored in the same period. After Dancu Monastery was demolished in 1903, the relics of Saint Tryphon and Saint Marina were transferred to the church.
The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, as are the nearby ruins and the protective wall.

Lifewide learning (LWL) is a teaching strategy and an approach to learning and personal development that involves real contexts and authentic settings. The goal is to address different kinds of learning not covered in a traditional classroom. By including LWL with a traditional classroom, students are better equipped to attain whole person development and to develop lifelong learning skills. It is the focus of education in Hong Kong, and was developed for higher education at the University of Surrey England. Lifewide education is the means by which an institution encourages, supports and recognizes learners' lifewide learning. It is an approach to visualising learning and personal development as a whole of life enterprise.
Lifewide learning adds important detail to the broad pattern of human development we call lifelong learning – all the learning and development one gains as one progresses along the pathway of one's life. Lifewide learning recognizes that most people, no matter what their age or circumstances, simultaneously inhabit a number of different spaces – like work or education, being a member of a family, being involved in clubs or societies, traveling, taking holidays, and looking after their own well-being mentally, physically, and spiritually. So the timeframes of lifelong learning and the spaces of life-wide learning will characteristically intermingle, and who we are and who we are becoming are the consequences of this intermingling.
Most people have the freedom to choose which spaces they want to occupy and how they want to occupy them. In these spaces, they make decisions about what to be involved in, meet and interact with different people, have different sorts of relationships, adopt different roles and identities, and think, behave and communicate in different ways. In these different spaces, they encounter different sorts of challenges and problems, seize, create or miss opportunities, and aspire to live and achieve their ambitions. The promise of lifewide education is that people can more fully appreciate and value their lives for the potential they hold for enabling them to become the people they want and need to become (in other words, their everyday pathway to actualising themselves).
'Lifewide Education' a not for profit, community-based organisation was founded in 2011 to encourage and support the growth and exchange of knowledge and practices in educational settings relating to lifewide learning. Its programme of scholarly work explores the many dimensions of lifewide learning.

Pingdom AB is a Swedish website monitoring software as a service company launched in Stockholm and later acquired by the Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds. The company releases annual reports on global internet use, which are frequently cited in academic publications and by media organizations as a source of Internet-related statistics.
History
Pingdom was launched in 2005 in Västerås, Sweden, but only became popular in 2007. The website monitoring company was founded by the Swedish entrepreneur Sam Nurmi, who had previously founded Loopia Web Hosting and who would go on to found Dooer. As of 2012, the company reported sales of 22.5 million Swedish kronor. By 2014, the company, then owned by the private equity firm Nurmi Drive controlled by its CEO, reported 500,000 customers in 211 countries and employed 30 people. In June 2014, the software company was acquired by the Austin, Texas-based software developer SolarWinds for $103 million.
In May 2017, SolarWinds acquired the San Francisco-based company Scout Server Monitoring and merged the software with Pingdom.
Product and reports
Pingdom has servers located in several countries used to measure the latency of the websites it monitors. It can report whether a website is down due to network splits or failure in DNS servers. Pingdom functions by regularly accessing websites to check whether the site is accessible to users. The software will continuously monitor the website at higher rates until it determines that it is again operational. Pingdom also generates a report detailing how long the site was down. The user receives an email notifying them of any downtime as soon as it occurs and again when it ends. The monitoring tool can also determine how long it takes a website to load fully, how many files it constitutes, and the number of scripts and images required to load.
Pingdom publishes reports on global Internet use and country-specific data on visitors to popular websites like Facebook. The report also includes data on the location of the hosts for many of the most visited websites in the world as determined by Alexa Internet. In 2012, Pingdom was able to determine that about 43.1% of the top 1 million websites were hosted in the United States, compared to the 31.3% hosted in all of Europe. The company also publishes Royal Pingdom, a blog on a variety of Internet-related topics. Royal Pingdom is frequently cited in academic publications and by media organizations as a source of statistics on a variety of websites.
Reception
In its September 2017 review of the service, PC Magazine praised the software as "fast and comprehensive", pointing out that "the only downside is that all this goodness is wrapped in a difficult interface that requires a steep learning curve to leverage."

OPS 5113, also known as Navstar 3, GPS I-3 and GPS SVN-3, was an American navigation satellite launched in 1978 as part of the Global Positioning System development programme. It was the third of eleven Block I GPS satellites to be launched.
Background
Global Positioning System (GPS) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide all-weather round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground, sea, and air forces. Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including recreational used (e.g., boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet tracking, and surveying. GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55°. These vehicles are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane.
Spacecraft
The first eleven spacecraft (GPS Block 1) were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the GPS system. They were 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing using reaction wheels. Dual solar arrays supplied over 400 watts. They had S-band communications for control and telemetry and Ultra high frequency (UHF) cross-link between spacecraft. They were manufactured by Rockwell Space Systems, were 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed, and had a design life expectancy of 5 years. Unlike the later operational satellites, GPS Block 1 spacecraft were inclined at 63°.
Launch
OPS 5113 was launched at 00:28 UTC on 7 October 1978, atop an Atlas F launch vehicle with an SGS-1 upper stage. The Atlas used had the serial number 47F, and was originally built as an Atlas F. The launch took place from Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and placed OPS 5113 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-27 apogee motor.
Mission
By 13 November 1978, OPS 5113 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 722.60 minutes, and 62.80° of inclination to the equator. The satellite had a design life of 5 years and a mass of . It broadcast the PRN 06 signal in the GPS demonstration constellation, and was retired from service on 18 May 1992.

Covenant Aviation Security, LLC (CAS) is a Chicago company that provides security services to the aviation industry. Michael Bolles has been its President since July 2012.
Activities
Covenant Aviation Security provides airport security services under the Transportation Security Administration's Screening Partnership Program (SPP). In 2002, CAS was awarded multiple contracts for providing commercial screening services to the TSA under the privatization pilot program initiated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. CAS mobilized and hired 1,200 screening personnel at San Francisco International Airport and the Tupelo Regional Airport within six weeks of contract award. In 2005, CAS was awarded the screening contract at Sioux Falls Regional Airport (which was the first airport to de-federalize its workforce under the SPP).
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated CAS airport passenger and baggage screening services as anti-terrorist technology under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002. Also that year, CAS was awarded the screening contract at Sioux Falls International Airport (FSD). CAS provides security services at John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Orlando International Airport, and San Francisco International Airport.
Security services
Security services include but are not limited to the following: passenger and baggage screening, direct access control, personnel screening, cargo screening, CCTV monitoring, report management, security assessments, operate screening equipment (X-ray, Explosive Trace Detection, Walk-Through Metal Detector and Hand-held Metal Detector), and monitoring perimeter intrusion detection systems.
Clients include the federal government (TSA), port and airport authorities and select airlines.
Locations
Covenant is one of the largest providers of security screening under contract with the TSA under the Screening Partnership Program.

Controversy
Undercover tests of screeners
A November 2006 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that TSA officials had collaborated with CAS at San Francisco International Airport to tip off CAS screeners to undercover tests. The tests were as to whether the screeners were properly inspecting passengers and their carry-on luggage at security checkpoints. From August 2003 until May 2004, precise physical descriptions of the undercover personnel who were on their way to test checkpoints were communicated to the screeners. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the report stated that TSA officials and Covenant managers at the airport "notified screening personnel in advance when a tester was approaching a checkpoint and provided their descriptions", and "Officials in the airport's screening control center tracked the undercover testers with surveillance cameras and on foot, the report said, and 'broadcast descriptions and locations of testers to the checkpoints to assist supervisors in identifying testers and to facilitate passing the covert penetration tests.'" An article in the newspaper about a wrongful firing lawsuit related to the events further reported that according to allegations in the lawsuit "Posing as passengers, the decoys try to take dummy bombs, unloaded guns and other contraband through the airport's security checkpoints. But the lawsuit said Covenant tracked the decoys via closed-circuit television cameras and tipped off workers at security gates to expect a test." The handing out of descriptions was then stopped, but until January 2005 screeners were still alerted whenever undercover operations were being undertaken. Despite the report, CAS was rehired with a $314 million, four-year contract at the airport, and while employees of the firm and TSA were disciplined, none lost their jobs. The very same occurrence of Security being warned of test was reported at the Orlando International Airport, as being a regular warning with different descriptions of these undercover agents each time. Mississippi Representative Bennie Thompson said the report was troubling, observing: "How is the public expected to have any confidence in the screening systems when managers game the system?"
Campaign contributions
In November 2010, Fox News reported that Representative John Mica (R-Fla), who was pushing for airports to use private contractors in lieu of the TSA, had since 2006 received $1,700 from Gerald Berry in campaign contributions. Mica's spokesperson said the contributions had not improperly influenced Mica.

Gabr () (also geuber, geubre, gabrak, gawr, gaur, gyaur, gabre) is a New Persian term originally used to denote a Zoroastrian.
Historically, gabr was a technical term synonymous with mōg, "magus", denoting a follower of Zoroastrianism, and it is with this meaning that the term is attested in very early New Persian texts such as the Shahnameh. In time, gabr came to have a pejorative implication and was superseded in literature by the respectable Zardoshti, "Zoroastrian".
By the 13th century the word had come to be applied to a follower of any religion other than Islam, and it has "also been used by the Muslim Kurds, Turks, and some other ethnic groups in modified forms to denote various religious communities other than Zoroastrians, sometimes even in the sense of unbeliever." As a consequence of the curtailment of social rights, non-Muslims were compelled to live in restricted areas, which the Muslim populace referred to as Gabristans.
In the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish version gâvur, borrowed into English via French as "giaour", was used to refer to Christians. This is sometimes still used today in former Ottoman territories and carries a strong pejorative meaning.
The etymology of the term is uncertain. "In all likelihood," gabr derives from the Aramaic gabrā, spelt GBRʼ, which – in written Middle Iranian languages – serves as an ideogram that would be read as an Iranian language word meaning "man." (for the use of ideograms in Middle Iranian languages, see Pahlavi scripts). During the Sasanian Empire (226-651), the ideogram signified a free (i.e. non-slave) peasant of Mesopotamia. Following the collapse of the empire and the subsequent rise of Islam, it "seems likely that gabr used already in Sassanian times in reference to a section of Zoroastrian community in Mesopotamia, had been employed by the converted Persians in the Islamic period to indicate their Zoroastrian compatriots, a practice that later spread throughout the country."
It has also been suggested that gabr might be a mispronunciation of Arabic kafir "unbeliever," but this theory has been rejected on linguistic grounds both phonetic and semantic: "there is no unusual sound in kafir that would require phonetic modification", and kafir as a generic word probably would not refer to a specific revealed religion such as Zoroastrianism.

Design and development
The Dart Kitten was designed by A.R. Weyl in 1936 and built by Dart Aircraft Ltd at Dunstable, Bedfordshire. It is an ultra-light single-seat low-wing aircraft with a fixed tailskid undercarriage. The four examples built were powered by a variety of engines of between 27 h.p. and 40 h.p.
Operational history
The Dart Kitten I G-AERP first flew in January 1937 and was sold to a private owner at Tollerton airport near Nottingham. It was stored during the Second World War. It was re-engined with a 40 h.p. J.A.P. J-99 postwar and flew with a private owner at Broxbourne airfield Hertfordshire before crashing there in November 1952.
The Dart Kitten II G-AEXT received its authorisation to fly on 30 April 1937 and had a series of owners before being badly damaged in a crash at Willingale, Essex in November 1964. It was subsequently rebuilt and in 2009 was airworthy with a private owner near Aylesbury Buckinghamshire. As of 2012 it is based with the Real Aeroplane Company at Breighton near Selby in North Yorkshire.
The Dart Kitten III G-AMJP was built by Dart Aircraft in January 1952 and was flown by owners in Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Lincolnshire before being lost in a crash near Kings Lynn in June 1966.
A fourth Kitten was home-built at Port Moresby New Guinea in 1960 and registered in Australia as VH-WGL.

Jang Young-chul is a South Korean television screenwriter.  They are best known for writing the hit dramas Giant and History of a Salaryman.
Career
Jang Young-chul graduated from Chungbuk National University with a degree in Korean Language and Literature.
In 1994, they won at the KBS Drama Script Contest for Father's House (아버지의 집), followed by another win in 1995 at newspaper Seoul Shinmun's New Year Literary Contest for their script A Room With a View (전망좋은 방). After winning at a 1996 contest, Jang's script Golden Garden (황금빛 정원) was produced as a Best Theater episode on MBC.
Jang was hired by SBS to write their first miniseries in 2002, Affection starring Kim Ji-ho and Yoo Jun-sang. They and Affection co-writer Jung Kyung-soon married in 2005.
They began to gain attention in the TV industry when they wrote the historical epic Dae Jo Yeong (2006-2007), which starred Choi Soo-jong as the titular founder of the state of Balhae. Jang received recognition as Best Writer at the KBS Drama Awards and the Korea PD Awards.
After Dae Jo Yeong, they and wife Jung Kyung-soon became writing partners again, and they would become best known for their collaborations with director Yoo In-shik—the hit dramas Giant and History of a Salaryman. Giant (2010), starring Lee Beom-soo, Park Jin-hee, Joo Sang-wook, Hwang Jung-eum, Park Sang-min and Jeong Bo-seok, is a period drama about three siblings' quest for revenge during the economic boom of 1970-80s Korea, as their fates play out against a larger tide of power, money, politics, and the growth of a city. History of a Salaryman (2011-2012), starring Lee Beom-soo, Jung Ryeo-won, Jung Gyu-woon, Hong Soo-hyun, Lee Deok-hwa and Kim Seo-hyung, is a quirky comedy and murder mystery about an ordinary salaryman who finds themselves involved with corporate spies and rival pharmaceutical companies, and also a parody of modern office politics using the historical events during China's Chu–Han Contention as satire.
Jang, Jung, and Yoo also worked together on the less successful Incarnation of Money (2013), which starred Kang Ji-hwan, Hwang Jung-eum, Park Sang-min, Choi Yeo-jin, Oh Yoon-ah and Kim Soo-mi, and focused on the greed and corruption in Korean society involving prosecutors, lobbyists and loan sharks.
The period drama Empress Ki, which aired from 2013 to 2014, starred Ha Ji-won in the title role as a Goryeo woman who becomes an empress of the Yuan dynasty, depicting their loves and political ambitions as they are torn between the two countries. It did well in the ratings, despite controversy regarding its historical accuracy and fictionalized elements. Ha won the Grand Prize ("Daesang") at the MBC Drama Awards, with Jang and Jung also securing Writer/s of the Year.

The Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (), also known as the Köprübaşı (Bridgehead) Mosque, is the ruin of a 16th-century Ottoman mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey.
The ruin is situated in Büyükçekmece which is now a district of Istanbul, but would have been in the countryside at the time the mosque was built. It was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan (c. 1488/1490-1588) and built for the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (in office 1565–1579) in 1567. It is one of the three mosques with the same name built by Mimar Sinan in Istanbul.
Only the minaret, one gateway and a low wall remain of the mosque. The minaret is unusual in that it is 'monolithic', carved from a single piece of stone. The design is unique in Turkey, there being one similar minaret in Egypt.
The mosque was constructed beside the east end of the Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent Bridge.

Xenocyprinae, is a contentious subfamily of the family Cyprinidae, the carp and minnow family, originally from eastern Asia.
Genera
The 5th edition of Fishes of the World assigns the follow general to this subfamily:
Aristichthys Oshima, 1919
Hypophthalmichthys Bleeker, 1860
Xenocypris Günther, 1868
The taxonomy of the Cyprinids is somewhat contentious and other authorities differ with the above, for example the following genera are assigned to the subfamily Xenocyprinae on Fishbase or the 2018 phylogenetic study:
Distoechodon Peters, 1881
Hypophthalmichthys Bleeker, 1860
Metzia Jordan & Thompson, 1914
Plagiognathops Berg, 1907
Pseudobrama Bleeker, 1870
Xenocypris Günther, 1868
Taxonomy
Cyprinidae is a large, widespread and diverse family of, mainly, freshwater ray-finned fish and the taxonomy of the family has not yet been fully resolved and the subfamilies do not appear to have a single accepted taxonomy. Some authorities place the genera above in the larger subfamilies Oxygasterinae or Xenocypridinae. However, genetic and morphological studies have supported the view that the five general currently assigned to the subfamily Xenocyprinae form a monophyletic grouping.

The clear craze was a marketing fad from the late 1980s to early 2000s, often equating transparency with purity. Inspired by Ivory's "99 and 44/100 percent pure" campaign for bath soap, and by low-calorie or "light" beverages, sodas were redesigned in the 1980s and 1990s as being free of artificial dyes, such as the caffeine-free and preservative-free Crystal Pepsi. Personal hygiene products were then relaunched as clear dye-free gels, and many electronics had transparent cases.
History
Since the introduction of Plexiglas in the late 1930s, devices have been made with clear shells to expose the electromechanical components inside. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a 139 Pontiac Deluxe Six engine with a clear Plexiglas body was on display. Peaking in the 1960s and 1970s, transparent-shelled devices fell out of fashion until the clear craze in the late 1980s. Following the breakup of the Bell System in the mid 1980s, a surge of manufacturers began creating phones, many of them transparent and having flashing neon lights when the phone rings.
A trend of "light" beer with fewer calories started in the 1960s. Then, color was identified in the marketing industry as a "tool for visual persuasion" toward a product's purity and health consciousness. Ivory soap was adapted from its classic milky solution and its slogan of "99 and 44/100 percent pure". This led up the clear craze starting in the 1980s. To showcase the reduction of calories or artificial flavors, many companies released clear versions of their products. The clear cola market was entered by Crystal Pepsi on April 13, 1992 featuring no preservatives or caffeine, although the existing Pepsi also did not have preservatives, and a caffeine-free version was already available. Coca-Cola soon responded with Tab Clear. In August 1992, Coors announced Zima, a clear, carbonated malt beer and in 1993, Miller released Miller Clear to mixed reviews.
Gillette released versions of its existing deodorants and shaving creams in a clear gel form, which have continued indefinitely.
Through the 1990s, the clear trend included transparent watches, staplers, calculators, handheld gaming devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy, and computers such as Apple's iMac G3.

The University of New Mexico Art Museum (sometimes referred to as the University Art Museum or UNM Art Museum) is an art museum at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The museum's permanent collection includes nearly 30,000 objects, making it the largest collection of fine art in New Mexico.
History
In the early years following the opening of the museum in 1963, significant exhibitions were held of the work of Georgia O'Keeffe, Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt, Cady Wells, Andrew Dasburg, John Marin, and other Modernists.
Van Deren Coke was the founding director of the Art Museum. Robert O. Parks was another early Art Museum director.
Georgia O'Keeffe had included the University of New Mexico and another New Mexico museum in their will of 1979, but in a codicil signed in 1984 soon before their death deleted it. An agreement between the State of New Mexico and Juan Hamilton, O'Keeffe's companion and executor of the will, was made in 1986, when the state agreed to drop any challenge to the will in exchange for several O'Keeffe paintings.
Collections
The Art Museum's permanent collection includes the following collections:
Photographs and prints. This collection includes over 10,000 photographs (ranging from daguerreotypes to digital photographs) and over 17,000 prints (with a focus on lithographs). The earliest prints date to the Nuremberg Chronicle, which appeared in 1493. Many of the museum's photographs, prints, and early cased objects are housed in the museum's Beaumont Newhall Study Room.
Beaumont Newhall Collection. The museum holds a collection of works by photographer Beaumont Newhall, who became a professor of art history at UNM in 1971. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation provided grant funding for the acquisition of several works in the collection.
Theodore J. Labhard Collection. The museum holds 481 daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, ivorytypes, and tintypes purchased from the estate of California art collector Theodore J. Labhard. The great majority of the museum's cased images are part of the collection, which originally was part of the university's Department of Art and Art History.
Jerome Bowers Peterson Memorial Collection. The museum holds 82 photographs by Carl Van Vechten, whose work depicted many notable figures of the Harlem Renaissance from the 1930s through the 1950s. The collection came to the University of New Mexico in 1955–1956 after Edward Leuder, an English professor at UNM, published a biography of Van Vechten.
The Tamarind Archives are the archives of the Tamarind Institute (formerly the Tamarind Lithographic Workshop, Inc.), a lithography institute founded in Los Angeles in 1960 and part of the University of New Mexico since 1970. The Tamarind Institute is a division of the College of Fine Arts, while its Archives are part of the university's Center for Southwest Research at Zimmerman Library. The UNM Art Museum archives two impressions of every Tamarind edition, including both work from the early Los Angeles period and from the later Albuquerque period.
Clinton Adams Archive Collection and Clinton and Mary Adams Collections. The museum holds many works contributed by Clinton Adams, who served as dean at UNM. Adams donated impressions of all of their non-Tamarind print works in 1996, adding to their Tamarind lithograph works, which had already been added to the art museum's collection. Clinton Adams and their wife Mary Adams also donated the works of others, mainly in the area of 19th and 20th-century prints. These works were designated as the Clinton and Mary Adams Collections in 1997.
Raymond Jonson Collection. UNM art professor Raymond Jonson gave a museum a sizable collection in their bequest, including more than 1,300 of their own paintings along with several hundred other pieces by other artists, including other members of the Transcendental Painting Group of the 1930s and 1940s.
Old Master Painting, Sculpture, and Drawing. The museum originally chose to focus on 19th- and 20th-century works, especially photographs and lithographies, instead of Old Master works, many of which were prohibitively expensive or already in the collections of other institutions. However, several older works entered the collection even in the museum's early period, including a notable contribution by Jacob Polak of several pieces of Dutch and Flemish Old Master works. In the mid-1980s, the museum began efforts to acquire more Old Master works, and eventually acquired a number of older European works. The Albert A. Anella Collection in Memory of Mia Anella, donated in 1987, includes six significant Italian paintings ranging from the 16th to 18th centuries.
Nineteenth-Century Art. The museum holds a collection of 19th-century painting and sculpture from Europe and the United States.
Old Spain, New Spain, New Mexico. This museum collection includes works connected to Spain, Latin America, and New Mexico. The museum does not hold collections of art by indigenous peoples of the Americas; these are held by the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, another University of New Mexico museum. The two museums have held joint exhibitions in the past.
Taller De Grafica Popular Collection. This collection includes some 300 prints and posters of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, the Mexico City art cooperative. The items in the collection are split between the Art Museum and the Center for Southwest Research at the UNM General Library.
Mary Lester Field and Neill B. Field Collection. This collection of 94 pieces of Spanish colonial silver and 22 mainly 19th-century santos (New Mexican religious sculptures) was donated by bequest in 1939 by Albuquerque mayor Neill B. Field and their wife Mary Lester Field.
Early Modern Art. The museum's collection of art of the early modern era include examples of New Mexican Modernism as well as works by Europeans artists such as Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Francis Picabia, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Photographs and prints are displayed alongside paintings and sculpture.
Art Since 1950. The museum's collection of contemporary art focuses on American art, with particular emphasis upon works from California's Bay Area and Los Angeles.

Apes of Wrath is a 1959 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on April 18, 1959, and stars Bugs Bunny. This cartoon recycles the plot from the 1948 cartoon Gorilla My Dreams. The title is a parody of John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath.
This cartoon was featured in Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales, but with a few slight changes, since the plot features Bugs and Daffy trying to sell books.
Plot
The cartoon opens with the drunk stork talking to themselves in the woods about how everyone is always glad to see the stork and offering them drinks to celebrate the new baby, of which they can't refuse (not for obvious lack of trying.) Unbeknownst, the gorilla baby they are supposed to deliver walks out of their bag. The stork is shocked to find that they have no baby to deliver. They have to find that baby to deliver or they will be kicked out of the Stork Club. Coincidentally, what scene should appear next... none other than Bugs Bunny, who is singing "I dream of Jeannie, she's a light brown hare..." while roasting a carrot not too far from him. The stork knocks poor Bugs out with a stick and, dressing them up in baby clothes, takes them to the gorilla house as the new baby.
At the home, the gorilla couple are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their baby when the stork arrives. Elvis (the male) eagerly runs out and hands out bananas in lieu of cigars. The bag is closed and they are both excited, until they open the bag, which reveals Bugs. Disgusted by their looks, Elvis goes to get a club to hit Bugs with and supposedly put them out of their misery, but the mother (who is dubbed "Mama" throughout the episode) shrieks and stops him. Mama scolds them that "no matter what they look like, he's still your son!" Bug awakens, assuming by their headache and state of dress that they must have been to a costume party and gotten drunk with a hangover. However, upon hearing Mama call them their baby, Bugs figures out what's happening and, not about to assume position of a baby gorilla, tries to get away, only for the gorilla mother to respond by spanking them for trying to run. Elvis roars at Bugs when mother gorilla prompts them to kiss your "son," so they hit them over the head with a rolling pin to get them to stop scaring the "baby". Witnessing this, Bugs thinks this could be fun and decides to pretend to be a monkey.
From that point on, Bugs decides to make Elvis's life miserable for their own enjoyment as there is nothing Elvis can do about it. As Elvis rocks Bugs' cradle rather unpleasantly, they try to sneak away from Bugs before the sneaky rabbit whines with a horrid tantrum for a drink of water, to which Elvis responds by dumping a bucket of water over him. The scene fades with Elvis still holding the bucket before it fades out just before the mother gorilla hits them with their rolling pin in response for their actions. The scene changes again and they're outdoors, where Mama tells Elvis to plays horsey with Bugs. Elvis plays for a few seconds then throws and sends Bugs flying up into the air, who then lands on Elvis and they begin chasing Bugs. To Bugs' best of luck, Mama is close by and soon takes control of the situation by confronting and clobbering Elvis with the ever-present rolling pin, Bugs doing the same while saying "bad ol' daddy" (almost like Tweety's famous line, "Bad ol' putty tat").
Later, Mama leaves Bugs in the care of Elvis once more, this time with Bugs continuing to hit Elvis constantly over the head with a baseball bat and babbling nonsensically. Mama walks away while saying, "That's nice, Elvis. Keep baby happy." Once she's gone, Elvis then takes the bat and breaks it in two, but Bugs cries out for Mama and Elvis decides to replace the bat for Bugs rather than letting Mama know what just happened. While this is occurring, the stork is back and already talking to Mama about their mistake, giving them their real baby. Elvis hears Mama yelling about the stork brings their real baby, then gets a wicked grin upon finding out. Bugs finally realizes the danger that they are in (while uttering the piteous line "Mother!") and tries to escape as Elvis gives chase. Bugs first tried to hide in the tree, but hiding in a tree proves fruitless when Elvis rips the tree up by its roots and is in hot pursuit once more. Then Bugs crosses a rope bridge and tries to keep Elvis at bay by threatening to cut it if they cross it; Elvis instead pulls the entire opposing cliffside to them in one effortless yank of the rope. Elvis tries to hit Bugs when they shrug it off, but they get away, leaving Elvis to smash the cliff to rubble as Bugs runs around to the bottom of the cliff, thinking he's lost the mad gorilla. When Elvis sees Bugs at the bottom of the cliff from the top, they throw a huge boulder toward Bugs. Unfortunately this proven to be backfired as Bugs has no idea that there's a boulder coming towards him, but runs away when they see Mama coming to ask "Elvis, guess what the baby said?" As such, they accidentally step right into the spot where the boulder lands on their head hard then breaks into a rubble, much to Elvis' horror.
Elvis tries to explain to Mama about Bugs, but their words are too gibberish to be explainable and ends up sobbing in disgrace. Bug witnesses it and says: "I'd like to see them eeh-ooh-aah-ooh and their way outta this one," as Mama, finally had enough of Elvis' insane actions, begins to give them a sound thrashing with their rolling pin (off-screen). Suddenly, the stork mistakenly delivers a baby to Bugs. The baby turns out to be Daffy (with a goose egg atop their head suggesting parallels between Bugs' initial predicament). Daffy ends the cartoon by kissing and hugging Bugs and saying: "Mother! My dearest little mommy! Oh. I just love you, Mommy!" all to Bugs' noticeable annoyance and disgust.
Home media
"Apes of Wrath" is available, uncensored and uncut, on the Looney Tunes Super Stars' Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire and Looney Tunes: Unleashed DVDs. However, in both cases it was cropped to widescreen. It was also included in the Stars of Space Jam: Bugs Bunny DVD, but this time in the ratio in which it was originally animated (fullscreen aspect ratio).

Joseph Danner Taylor (November 7, 1830 – September 19, 1899) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Ohio, serving four full terms and part of a fifth in the late 19th century.
Biography
Joseph D. Taylor was born in Goshen Township, in Belmont County, Ohio. Taylor attended public schools in Belmont County and later attended Madison College at Antrim, obtaining a teaching degree.
Taylor taught in Fairview High School from 1854 to 1856, and became principal in 1857. They sought a new revenue for their talents and was accepted at Cincinnati Law School, now known as the University of Cincinnati College of Law, where they obtained their LL.B. in 1860. They were admitted to the bar in 1859.
Taylor was impressed by their time in Guernsey County that they bought property in Cambridge and lived in a simple wood-frame home on Wheeling Avenue. They would later construct their elegant Queen Anne Style home in 1878 on Upland Drive and constructed the Berwick Hotel on the site of the house on Wheeling Avenue. In 1860 they opened their law practice and in 1861 started the Guernsey Times Newspaper. They would remain owner until 1871. Taylor rose in prominence as they made a name for themselves in the courts as well as their newspaper articles. Leading up to the Civil War, Taylor ran articles denouncing slavery and called for negotiation to eliminate the practice.
Military service
Joining the Union Army during the Civil War they entered as a captain in the 88th Ohio Infantry. Taylor became a judge advocate from 1863 until 1865, when hostilities between the states ended. Taylor also served as a prosecuting attorney for Guernsey County from 1863 to 1866.
Political service
Taylor soon turned to the public welfare by entering politics. They served as delegate to the National Union Convention in 1866, joined the Cambridge School Board from 1870 to 1877, and even served as a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1876 and 1880.
Taylor was elected as a Republican to the Forty-seventh Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Jonathan T. Updegraff. During their reelection they were voted into the Forty-eighth Congress and served until 1885, when they lost another reelection bid. This setback did not stop them as they campaigned and won their bid to the Fiftieth, Fifty-first, and Fifty-second Congresses and served from March 4, 1887, until March 3, 1893.
Taylor retired from politics but remained an influential force in the development and growth of Guernsey County and Cambridge in particular. They died in Cambridge, Ohio, September 19, 1899, and was interred in the South Cemetery.

USS Walter C. Wann (DE-412) was a built by Brown Shipbuilding at their yard in Houston, Texas. The ship was launched on 19 January 1944. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Anna Wann, the mother of Pharmacist's Mate Wann, the ship's namesake. They were commissioned on 2 May 1944. The destroyer escort received four battle stars for World War II service. Walter C. Wann was decommissioned on 31 May 1946 and placed in reserve at San Diego, California after two years and one month active service. The vessel was struck from the Navy Register on 30 June 1968 for disposal. In June 1969 Walter C. Wann was sold to the National Metal and Steel Company, Terminal Island, California for scrap and broken up.
Namesake
Walter Carl Wann, Jr. was born on 13 May 1921 in Goldendale, Washington. They graduated from Bandon High School and later enlisted in the United States Navy on 14 December 1939. While stationed in San Diego on 7 December 1941, they were assigned to a vessel to return the wounded to the West Coast. They were then stationed with the Marine invasion forces destined for Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands.
Petty Officer Wann was honored for their actions on 7 August 1942 while assigned as a corpsman with the Marines in action during an engagement with Japanese forces on a causeway between Gavutu and Tanambogo Islands, Solomon Islands. Although the causeway was under direct fire from Japanese machine guns, Wann, with utter disregard for their own personal safety, volunteered to cross the area in order to render aid and return casualties to the aid station. Ignoring the enemy fire, they sprinted back and forth, carrying and rendering aid to wounded Marines. They remained attached to Marine units in the Guadalcanal campaign until they were killed in action on 4 November 1942. As a result of their exceptional courage they were posthumously awarded the Silver Star.
History
World War II
Following their Caribbean shakedown from 25 May to 23 June, Walter C. Wann underwent availability at Boston from 24 June to 5 July and got underway on 6 July in company with the destroyer escort , bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Arriving at Norfolk on 7 July, Walter C. Wann and Abercrombie got underway the next day for the Dutch West Indies. They escorted four gasoline tankers to St. Nicholas Bay, Aruba, where they loaded petroleum cargoes from 13 to 15 July. The task unit proceeded thence to Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone, and arrived on 17 July, whereupon the unit was dissolved, and the escorts were assigned to duty with the Panama Sea Frontier.
Walter C. Wann soon joined Abercrombie and in antisubmarine patrols on the Aruba-Canal Zone tanker route as TU 05.3.2 as a result of increased U-boat activity in the vicinity. The destroyer escort departed for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on 21 July, in company with McCoy Reynolds. On the afternoon of 22 July, the two ships received orders to assist a downed Martin PBM Mariner approximately away. Walter C. Wann and their sister ship picked up all 40 survivors; and McCoy Reynolds prepared to tow the plane to port, but the arrival of SC-1281 on the scene obviated them undertaking that task. Walter C. Wann then proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica, to disembark the survivors. They proceeded back to sea escorting two merchantmen to the Canal Zone, and arrived at Cristóbal with their charges on the evening of 25 July. They transited the Panama Canal the next day and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 27 July.
Walter C. Wann, in company with and McCoy Reynolds, departed Balboa on 29 July; proceeded to the California coast, and arrived at San Diego on 6 August. From 7 August to 4 September, the ship underwent major engineering repairs and received a new high-pressure turbine, conducting sea trials for the new turbine. They then got underway for Hawaii on 5 September, proceeding independently, and arrived at Pearl Harbor six days later.
Walter C. Wann sortied in the screen of Task Group 77.4— the escort carrier group commanded by Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague—and nicknamed "Taffy Two"— on 12 October, to support American landings at Leyte in the Philippine Islands. While en route to the launching areas off Leyte Gulf, a tropical disturbance of near-typhoon intensity struck the task group on 17 October.
Local combat air patrols (CAP) protected the carriers as they launched their air strikes against Japanese positions on Leyte; and, as a result, Walter C. Wann and their fellow escorts did not initially see any enemy air activity. Operating off Samar during the daytime, the group retired each evening to the eastward.
Arriving back off Samar on 25 October to commence the day's air strikes, TG 77.4 received reconnaissance reports indicating the closing presence of a large Japanese surface force; and, by 0700, the northern carrier group, TU 77.4.3, was under attack. Walter C. Wann, with the southern carrier group, screened their charges as they launched all available aircraft while retiring to the southeast. By 0900, the enemy forces— reported as consisting of three battleships, eight cruisers, and numerous destroyers—closed the southern group. On the horizon to the northward could be seen pillars of smoke from the death struggle of the northern group—four groups of shell splashes suddenly erupted astern of Walter C. Wann as the enemy dropped in their heavy shells and groped for the range. While the destroyers of the southern group prepared to make smoke and dash in, in a suicidal torpedo attack, Walter C. Wann and their sister ships formed a circular screen around the highly vulnerable escort carriers. Air strikes and torpedo attacks had by 1100 diverted the Japanese from the carriers, and the range opened to , thus ending the immediate threat to the southern group.
After retiring to the Admiralty Islands, Walter C. Wann anchored at Seeadler Harbor on 3 November. Walter C. Wann again came close to being damaged at Manus on 10 November when the auxiliary vessel blew up in a cataclysmic blast which atomized the ammunition ship and damaged many other ships in the immediate area. Walter C. Wann, off the doomed ship's port quarter, found themselves showered by debris from the exploding ammunition ship but fortunately sustained only minimal damage, and none of their crew were hurt.
Back on escort duty on 27 November, the destroyer escort screened Transport Division 10 on its voyage to Cape Gloucester, New Britain, arriving at Borgen Bay on 28 November. They conducted antisubmarine screening off the entrance to the bay until proceeding independently to Manus on 30 November—anchoring at Seeadler Harbor in December. While at Manus, the ship received additional radio equipment, thus outfitting themselves for their new duty of landing craft control ship during the Lingayen Gulf landings on the Philippine island of Luzon. A round-trip voyage to and from New Britain preceded them linking up with TG 79.6; and, on 15 December, Capt. E. A. Seay (Commander, TG 79.6, and Commander, LST Flotilla 14) embarked with their staff; Walter C. Wann then departed for training exercises and acted as flag and control ship. Capt. Seay then disembarked on 22 December and transferred to LST-610.
On 27 December 1944, Walter C. Wann got underway as part of TU 79.11.3, screening TG 79.5 and 79.6. On 2 January, they fell in astern of TG 78.5 and proceeded through Surigao Strait and into the Mindanao Sea on 5 January and into the Sulu Sea the next day. On 7 January, while the American force was in the Mindoro Strait, two Nakajima Ki-43 "Oscars" attacked the disposition astern of Walter C. Wann at 1822. One dropped a bomb and was shot down by an LST, and the second attacked Walter C. Wann, only to be driven off by antiaircraft fire.
The destroyer escort reached Lingayen Gulf on 9 January and took station ahead of TG 79.6—Tractor Group Baker—as control ship, anchoring off Lingayen beach at 0737. Capt. Seay returned to Walter C. Wann and established their temporary headquarters on board. While they lay anchored off Lingayen, Walter C. Wann provided antiaircraft fire in attempts to repel Japanese kamikaze attacks. However, despite the intense antiaircraft fire, one plane succeeded in crashing into the cruiser some ahead of the destroyer escort. Another kamikaze attempted to attack the battleship —located off the destroyer escort's starboard beam—but was driven off, heavily damaged.
At 1530 on 9 January, Walter C. Wann got underway and moved in a further toward Lingayen and dropped anchor off the town. CTG 79.6 shifted to LST-610 soon thereafter, and the destroyer escort, thus relieved of their control-ship duties, got underway again to proceed through a heavy smoke screen and rendezvous as part of the screen for TU 79.14.1 which was proceeding to Leyte Gulf.
This task unit—consisting of kamikaze-damaged Columbia, , and Australian heavy cruiser , as well as transports, LSDs, LSVs— was attacked by a single plane on 10 January but drove off the attacker with gunfire. Two days later, the destroyer escort and the destroyer escorted the escort carrier to the inner harbor of San Pedro Bay, Leyte, and anchored there at 1957 on 12 January. They spent 14 January on antisubmarine patrol before returning to their anchorage on 15 January for provisioning.
Walter C. Wann conducted local operations and convoy escort missions between Dutch New Guinea and Philippine waters into the late winter of 1944 and 1945. They got underway on 27 March in the screen for Transport Group "Easy," bound for Nansei Shoto in the Ryukyus. Approaching Okinawa Shima with the invasion force on the morning of D day, 1 April, their task unit was deployed to their respective screening stations—Walter C. Wann taking station A-29. At 0603 on 1 April, the destroyer escort took an "Oscar" under fire, but the pilot commenced evasive maneuvers and banked away from the ship. That evening, Transport Division 40, one of Transport Group "Easy," conducted night retirement, with Walter C. Wann among the escorts.
Upon conclusion of the night retirement evolutions, Walter C. Wann screened the transports at various stations and participated in a hunter/killer group operation. For the remainder of their first week off Okinawa and into the second, the ship observed considerable air raids—some taking heavy tolls on American light forces engaged in supporting the invasion of Okinawa.
At 1309 on 12 April, the Japanese launched a determined series of air strikes which lasted until 1720. During this time, at 1418, an Aichi D3A "Val" began a suicide dive on Walter C. Wann from the starboard side. At about away, the dive bomber faltered, pulled up slightly, and crossed the ship in a steep vertical bank before crashing off the port bow. At 1500, a second attack occurred, another "Val" streaking in for Walter C. Wann. The destroyer escort's gunners set it afire; and, as it faltered, the "Val" was shot out of the sky by two American fighters.
Walter C. Wann remained on patrol off Okinawa until 14 April, when they sailed for Guam in company with the battleships and , and the cruiser , as TU 51.29.14, escorting a convoy of transports. Arriving at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 19 April, Walter C. Wann effected battle damage repairs until 6 May, when they sailed for Saipan in the Marianas.
They next escorted TU 94.19.18—attack transports, LSTs, LCIs and LSMs—in company with and three submarine chasers, arriving at Okinawa on 14 May. For the next several days following their arrival, Walter C. Wann was assigned to various patrol stations and, although frequent enemy air attacks sent the ship to an anxious succession of alerts at general quarters, they did not encounter any enemy aircraft herself. The destroyer escort remained on screening duty, supporting the Okinawa strike through June, escorting everything from landing ship docks (LSDs) to light cruisers. On 4 July, Walter C. Wann joined Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 32. TF 32 provided cover for the operations in the Ryukyus and for the minesweeping operations underway in the East China Sea (conducted by TG 39.11).
Walter C. Wann remained engaged in screening operations for the remainder of the war and was at anchor in Buckner Bay when word of the Japanese surrender first came through. The ship conducted training exercises and tactical drills into September, subsequently riding out four typhoons between July and October. During this time, the ship steamed to Waka-yama, Honshu, Japan, standing in readiness to render support for the landings there should it be needed. The 6th Army landed without incident to occupy the key Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe area, and Walter C. Wann later rendered plane-guard duties for off the Hiroshima-Kure occupation zone.
Walter C. Wann continued their support duties for the American occupation of Japan through the late fall of 1945. On 4 November, in company with CortDiv 69, the destroyer escort got underway from Yokosuka, bound, via Pearl Harbor, for San Diego, California.
Assigned to the 19th Fleet (Pacific Reserve Fleet), Walter C. Wann was placed out of commission, in reserve, at San Diego, Calif., on 31 May 1946.
Fate
Them post-1946 records are sketchy. Some documents suggest that in November 1951 the ship may have joined reserve training exercises, although they are officially listed as being "in reserve, out of commission." Movement reports indicate that the ship was at San Diego from 8 November 1951 to 5 June 1956; at Long Beach from 5 to 22 June 1956; and at San Diego from 23 June 1956 to 10 June 1958. Further indications show the ship attached to the San Diego Reserve Group into 1960 and berthed at the Stockton Reserve Facility near Mare Island, Vallejo, California. In any event, Walter C. Wann was struck from the Navy list on 30 June 1968; acquired by the National Metal and Steel Co., of Terminal Island, California, in June 1969; and scrapped soon thereafter.

The 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage began on 8 September 2022 and will end on 3 November 2022. A total of 32 teams compete in the group stage to decide 8 of the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League.
All teams besides AZ, Basel, CFR Cluj, Gent, Partizan, Slavia Prague and Slovan Bratislava, who competed in last season's group stage, made their debut appearances in the group stage. Ballkani, Djurgårdens IF, Dnipro-1, Pyunik, RFS, Silkeborg, Slovácko, Vaduz and Žalgiris made their debut appearances in a UEFA competition group stage. Ballkani, Vaduz and Žalgiris were the first teams from Kosovo, Liechtenstein and Lithuania, respectively, to play in a UEFA competition group stage.
A total of 28 national associations are represented in the group stage.
Draw
The draw for the group stage was held on 26 August 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on their 2022 UEFA club coefficients. Teams from the same association and, for political reasons, teams from Serbia and Kosovo could not be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association, including those playing in the Europa League group stage (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams), based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would have different kick-off times. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed (the second team in a pairing marked by UEL are playing in the Europa League group stage):
A Slavia Prague and Slovácko
B Gent and Anderlecht
C Partizan and Red Star Belgrade (UEL)
D Dnipro-1 and Dynamo Kyiv (UEL)
E İstanbul Başakşehir and Sivasspor
F CFR Cluj and FCSB
G Basel and Zürich (UEL)
H Djurgårdens IF and Malmö FF (UEL)
I Silkeborg and Midtjylland (UEL)
J Molde and Bodø/Glimt (UEL)
K Nice and Nantes (UEL)
L Austria Wien and Sturm Graz (UEL)
Teams
Below were the participating teams (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:
22 winners of the play-off round (5 from Champions Path, 17 from Main Path)
10 losers of the Europa League play-off round
Notes
Format
In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The winners of each group will advance to the round of 16, while the runners-up will advance to the knockout round play-offs. The third-placed and fourth-placed teams will be eliminated from European competitions for the season.
Tiebreakers
Teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria will be applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 16 Equality of points – group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Europa Conference League):
Points in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;
Goal difference in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;
Goals scored in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;
If more than two teams are tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams is still tied, all head-to-head criteria above are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams;
Goal difference in all group matches;
Goals scored in all group matches;
Away goals scored in all group matches;
Wins in all group matches;
Away wins in all group matches;
Disciplinary points (direct red card = 3 points; double yellow card = 3 points; single yellow card = 1 point);
UEFA club coefficient.
Due to the abolition of the away goals rule, head-to-head away goals are no longer applied as a tiebreaker starting from last season. However, total away goals are still applied as a tiebreaker.
Groups
The fixtures were announced on 27 August 2022, the day after the draw. The matches are being played on 8 September, 15 September, 6 October, 13 October, 27 October and 3 November 2022. The scheduled kick-off times are 16:30, 18:45 and 21:00 CET/CEST.

The rose hip or rosehip, also called rose haw and rose hep, is the accessory fruit of the various species of rose plant. It is typically red to orange, but ranges from dark purple to black in some species. Rose hips begin to form after pollination of flowers in spring or early summer, and ripen in late summer through autumn.
Propagation
Roses are propagated from rose hips by removing the achenes that contain the seeds from the hypanthium (the outer coating) and sowing just beneath the surface of the soil. The seeds can take many months to germinate. Most species require chilling (stratification), with some such as Rosa canina only germinating after two winter chill periods.
Use
Rose hips are used in bread and pies, jam,
jelly, marmalade, syrup, soup, tea, wine, and other beverages.
Rose hips can be eaten raw, like berries, if care is taken to avoid the hairs inside the fruit. The hairs are used as itching powder.
A few rose species are sometimes grown for the ornamental value of their hips, such as Rosa moyesii, which has prominent, large, red bottle-shaped fruits. Rosa macrophylla 'Master Hugh' has the largest hips of any readily available rose.
Rose hips are commonly used in herbal tea, often blended with hibiscus. An oil is also extracted from the seeds. Rose hip soup, known as in Swedish, is especially popular in Sweden. Rhodomel, a type of mead, is made with rose hips.
Rose hips can be used to make , the traditional Hungarian fruit brandy popular in Hungary, Romania, and other countries sharing Austro-Hungarian history. Rose hips are also the central ingredient of cockta, the fruity-tasting national soft drink of Slovenia.
Dried rose hips are also sold for crafts and home fragrance purposes. The Inupiat mix rose hips with wild redcurrant and highbush cranberries and boil them into a syrup.
Nutrients and phytochemicals
Wild rose hip fruits are particularly rich in vitamin C, containing 426 mg per 100 g or 0.4% by weight (w/w). However, RP-HPLC assays of fresh rose hips and several commercially available products revealed a wide range of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content, ranging from 0.03 to 1.3%.
Rose hips contain the carotenoids beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene, which are under basic research for a variety of potential biological roles. A meta-analysis of human studies examining the potential for rose hip extracts to reduce arthritis pain concluded there was a small effect requiring further analysis of safety and efficacy in clinical trials. Use of rose hips is not considered an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis.

When Eight Bells Toll is a 1971 action film directed by Étienne Périer and starring Anthony Hopkins, Jack Hawkins, Robert Morley, and Nathalie Delon. Set in Scotland, it is based upon Scottish author Alistair MacLean's 1965 novel of the same name. Producer Elliott Kastner planned to produce a string of realistic gritty espionage thrillers to rival the James Bond series, but the film's poor box office receipts ended their plans.
Plot
British Treasury secret agent Phillip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) is sent to investigate the hijacking of five cargo ships in the Irish Sea, tracking the latest hijacked ship—the Nantesville, carrying £8 million in gold bullion—to the Scottish Highlands and the sleepy port town of "Torbay" on the "Isle of Torbay" (actually filmed in Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull).
Posing as marine biologists, Calvert and their partner Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) find the local inhabitants suspicious and hostile. They suspect that Cypriot tycoon and shipping magnate Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), whose luxury yacht Shangri-La is anchored off the coast, may be behind the pirating of the gold bullion. While searching the surrounding area in a Royal Navy Helicopter, Calvert makes contact with a group of remote shark fishermen who appear more friendly than Torbay's locals. Calvert also meets the occupants of a castle, Lord Kirkside and their teenage daughter, who behave strangely as well as being hostile.
As the helicopter brings Calvert back to Torbay it comes under attack from the shore and the Royal Navy pilot is killed. The helicopter crashes onto the rocky shoreline, explodes and slides into the sea. Calvert escapes from the helicopter after it sinks to the bottom. When they return to their research yacht Firecrest they find Hunslett is missing and is surprised by the presence of their boss Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones, known as "Uncle Arthur" (Robert Morley). Together, they combat boarders and make ready for sea. On raising the anchor they find the dead body of Hunslett tied to it.
They are joined by Skouras's wife, Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), whom they find calling for help in the sea. They claim to have escaped their yacht after they beat them Calvert is both attracted to, and suspicious of them
When a pirate speedboat approaches, Calvert rams it, shoots the occupants and blows up the boat in vengeance for Hunslett's death.
Calvert recruits the shark fishermen to deal with Skouras and their modern day pirates. Guessing that the missing bullion ships are being sunk to allow the gold to be offloaded invisibly, Calvert dives in the bay and finds the Nantesville. They fight and kills one of the divers, whom they have previously encountered and who they suspect killed Hunslett.
They then secretly enters Kirkside's castle and questions the Lord's daughter, discovering that Skouras is an innocent victim whose real wife is being held hostage along with other locals down in the castle's dungeons. They then sneaks into the underground dock of the castle where the gold is being offloaded.
At midnight (eight bells) the shark fishermen ram the gates of the underground dock with their boat. The pirates are expecting them because Charlotte has been transmitting Calvert's plans to them by secret radio.  They are actually the wife of their ringleader, not Skouras. A fire fight ensues in which the pirates are wiped out, after which Calvert lets Charlotte escape with a single bar of gold in their possession.

Production
Development
In July 1966 Kastner and their producing partner Jerry Gershwin had purchased five screenplays from MacLean: Where Eagles Dare, When Eight Bells Toll, and three other unnamed ones.
In November Kastner announced they would make the film as part of a 14-film slate over two years. Among the 14 movies were Maclean's Where Eagles Dare, which was a big hit in 1968, leading to high expectations for When Eight Bells Toll.
Kastner saw When Eight Bells Toll as a combination of The Guns of Navarone, Gunga Din and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. "There was a strong character and a great adventure in there," said Kastner.
MacLean elected to adapt their novel for the cinema himself, and kept the adaptation close to the novel. The story is very close to the source text, and features some of the same witty dialogue. Some of the twists in the ending have been changed, however, and a shootout replaces MacLean's original Agatha Christie-style summation.
Producer Elliott Kastner hoped that the film would be the first of a series of spy adventures films featuring MacLean's Philip Calvert character by capturing James Bond series fans after the anticipated demise of that series (Sean Connery was believed to be planning to quit the Bond role, and some thought that the Bond series would end after their departure).
The director was a Belgian, Etienne Perier who had done low budget films. Kastner later said hiring them was "probably the one mistake" they made on the film.
Financing
Kastner says they raised the budget by ringing "a guy I read about in Fortune magazine and I went and saw them and said 'I need one point eight million dollars to make this second Alistair Maclean project.' And they heard me out and they wrote the damn cheque."
Hopkins was paid £8,000.
Casting
Kastner wanted a Celtic actor to play the hero Calvert, having had a big success with Richard Burton in Where Eagles Dare. "I saw the agent Calvert as a very exciting characterisation," said Kastner. "A lot could be done with him. But I didn't want a Tony Curtis. I didn't want a star. I wanted a classical actor. A real actor."
They considered Michael Jayston and Anthony Hopkins for the role. Hopkins, then best known as a stage actor for their work at the National Theatre, was chosen on the basis of their performance in The Lion in Winter.
Hopkins says they turned down the role at first, worried about being an action star. "It seemed too fast for me," they said. "I could hear myself saying, 'Now wait a minute'. Then when I had finally overcome my fright I said to myself 'I'd be mad to turn this chance down.' I didn't."
Kastner wanted Hopkins to lose weight for the role. Bond film stunt arranger Bob Simmons helped them slim down to become a convincing Royal Naval officer trained as a commando and frogman.
Filming
Filming started in September 1969 and went for sixteen weeks. It was done partly on location in Scotland with studio work at Pinewood.
The main helicopter used in the film is a Westland Widgeon painted in Royal Navy Rescue helicopter colours. The helicopter, registered G-ANLW was also seen in the 1981 war movie Eye of the Needle. The aircraft still exists and is currently being restored to flying condition.
The ship used to represent Calvert and Hunslett's yacht Firecrest was the Tavit, built in 1966 at Berwick Shipyard. The ship still exists to this day, currently registered in Greece.
Skouras' yacht, the Shangri-La was in reality the Maureen Mhor, built in 1961 by Yarrows. The ship still exists, now called the Camara C
The "Northern Diver" the boat used to search for Calvert after the helicopter crash is currently being assessed for restoration by Cam Marine Services on the Isle of Skye.
During filming Hopkins fell in love with one of Kastner's assistants, Jennifer Lynton, and left their wife and child for them
Reception
Box office
When Eight Bells Toll performed poorly in cinemas in the US, although it was more popular in Europe and was the 11th most popular film at the British box office in 1971.
Kastner said the film "tripled its money" but admitted it was a disappointment.
Critical reception
The Guardian described the film as, "All thoroughly silly but routine rather than rotten".
Proposed series
Connery returned to the Bond role and appeared in the successful Diamonds Are Forever, and the Bond series producers decided to continue the series when Connery left. The projected Phillip Calvert series was cancelled.

Lance Henson (born September 20, 1944) is a Cheyenne poet. Henson was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up near Calumet, Oklahoma, where their grandparents raised them in the traditions of the Cheyenne tribe. They have published 28 volumes of poetry, which have been translated into 25 languages. They have been described as the "foremost Cheyenne poet now writing."
Early life
Henson was born in Washington, D.C. on September 20, 1944.  They are of Cheyenne, Oglala, and Cajun ancestry. They grew up near Calumet, Oklahoma, where they were raised by their grandparents, who taught them the traditions and culture of the Cheyenne tribe. After graduating from high school, they served in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Vietnam War. They later became a member of the Cheyenne Dog Soldier Society, an organization of Cheyenne veterans. They attended Oklahoma College of Liberal Arts (now the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma), where they earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. They earned a Ford Foundation Scholarship, which allowed them to undertake graduate studies at the University of Tulsa, where they earned a Master of Arts degree in Creative Writing.
Career
Henson published their first book of poetry, Keeper of Arrows, in 1971, when they were still a student at Oklahoma College of Liberal Arts. They were part of the State Arts Council of Oklahoma's Artist in Residence Program, through which they conducted poetry workshops throughout the state for 10 years. Since then, they have traveled around the world lecturing and doing readings of their poetry. In their travels throughout the United States and Europe, they have been a poet in residence at more than 800 schools.
At the United Nations Indigenous Peoples Conference in Geneva in 1988, Henson represented the Southern Cheyenne. In 1993, they were part of a United States Information Agency tour, in which they lectured in Singapore, Thailand, New Guinea and New Zealand. Also in 1993, they were poet-in-residence at the University of New Mexico. They were a resident at the Millay Colony for the Arts in 1995, and they were awarded a Distinguished Native American Scholars residency at the Smithsonian Institution. In 2004, Henson was inducted into the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma Hall of Fame.
They have published 28 volumes of poetry, which have been translated in 25 languages.
Henson lives in Italy, where their works have been popular. Many of their books are published in Italian/English editions. They return to Oklahoma every June to take part in the Cheyenne Sun Dance.
In 2013, Henson established an official website where selected recent works are available in advance of publication.
Plays
They have written two plays, "Winter Man," which was performed at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, and "Coyote Road," which has been performed at Mad River Theater in West Liberty, Ohio, and in Versailles, France.
Style and influences
Henson's poems draw upon their Cheyenne heritage, incorporating words from the Cheyenne language, Cheyenne philosophy, and Hanson's own social and political commentary. They write in a minimalist style with no capitalization, punctuation, rhyme, or meter. Wilson notes that this style is similar to traditional Cheyenne songs. Imagery of nature and the seasons figures prominently in Henson's works. They also comment on the status of indigenous peoples, their historic oppression, and modern threats to their cultures. Their work is influenced Walt Whitman, N. Scott Momaday, Carl Jung, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mark Twain. Robert Berner also notes references to haiku, Li Po, and Tu Fu in their works.

In enzymology, D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
D-lysine 2,5-diaminohexanoate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-lysine, and one product, 2,5-diaminohexanoate.
This enzyme participates in lysine degradation. It employs one cofactor, cobamide.
Background
D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase belongs to the isomerase family of enzymes, specifically intramolecular transferases, which transfers amino groups. Its systematic name is D-2,6-diaminohexanoate 5,6-aminomutase. Other names in common use include D-α-lysine mutase and adenosylcobalamin-dependent D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase, which can be abbreviated as 5,6-LAM.
5,6-LAM is capable of reversibly catalyzing the migration of an amino group from ε-carbon to δ-carbon in both D-lysine and L-β-lysine, and catalyzing the migration of hydrogen atoms from δ-carbon to ε-carbon at the same time. It demonstrates the greatest catalytic activity in 20mM Tris•HCl at pH 9.0-9.2.
In the early 1950s, 5,6-LAM was discovered in the amino-acid-fermenting bacteria Clostridium sticklandii, in which lysine undergoes degradation under anaerobic conditions to equimolar amounts of acetate and butyrate.
Later, isotopic studies uncovered two possible pathways. In pathway A, both acetate and butyrate are generated from C2-C3 cleavage of D-lysine. Unlike pathway A, pathway B involves C5-C4 degradation, producing the same products.
D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase (5,6-LAM) is responsible for the first conversion in pathway B to convert D-α-lysine into 2,5-diaminohexanoate. Unlike other members of the family of aminomutases (like 2,3-LAM), which are peculiar to a single substrate, 5,6-LAM can reversibly catalyze both the reaction of D-lysine to 2,5-diaminohexanoic acid and the reaction of L-β-lysine to 3,5-diaminohexanoic acid.
Structure
Subunits
5,6-LAM is an α2β2 tetramer. The structure of the alpha subunit is predominantly a PLP-binding TIM barrel domain, with several additional alpha-helices and beta-strands at the N and C termini. These helices and strands form an intertwined accessory clamp structure that wraps around the sides of the TIM barrel and extends up toward the Ado ligand of the Cbl cofactor, which is the beta subunit providing most of the interactions observed between the protein and the Ado ligand of the Cbl, suggesting that its role is mainly in stabilizing AdoCbl in the precatalytic resting state. The β subunit binds AdoCbl while the PLP directly binds to α subunit. PLP also directly binds to Lys144 of the β subunit to form an internal aldimine. PLP and AdoCbl are separated by a distance of 24Å.
Cofactors
5,6-LAM is pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent. PLP binds to its substrate with an external aldimine linkage. PLP is also important for stabilizing the radical intermediate by captodative stabilization and spin delocalization.
Catalysis begins with a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical (Ado-CH2•), and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) is an essential cofactor as a hydrogen carrier.
ATP, a mercaptan, and a divalent metal ion (usually Mg2+) are required to achieve the highest catalytic effect.
Mechanism
Catalytic cycle
The catalytic cycle starts with Ado-CH2• (5'-deoxyadenosyl radical derived from adenosylcobalamine) abstracting a hydrogen atom from PLP-D-lysine adduct (substrate-related precursor SH) to generate a substrate-related radical (S•), with the radical located at carbon 5 of the lysine residue. The latter undergoes an internal cyclization/addition to the imine nitrogen producing an aziridinecarbinyl radical (I•) — a more thermodynamically stable intermediate with the radical being at a benzylic position. Rearrangement of I• produces a product-related radical (P•), which then participates in the final step of hydrogen transfer from AdoH to afford the PLP-product complex (PH).
Structure-based catalysis
Further understanding of the catalytic mechanism can be derived from the X-ray structure.
First, an evident conformational change is observed after the substrate is added to the system. With a substrate-free enzyme, the distance between AdoCbl and PLP is about 24 Å. PLP participates in multiple non-covalent interactions with the enzyme with 5,6-LAM presenting an “open” state.
The first step of the catalytic cycle involves the enzyme accepting the substrate by forming an external aldimine with PLP replacing the PLP-Lys144β internal aldimine. With the cleavage of the internal aldimine, the β unit is able to swing towards to the top of the α unit and block the empty site. Therefore, generation of the Ado-CH2• radical leads to a change in the structure of the active domain, bringing the AdoCbl and PLP-substrate complex closer to each other, thus locking the enzyme in a “closed” state. The closed state exists until the radical transfer occurs when the product is released and AdoCbl is reformed. At the same time, the closed state is transformed to the open state again to wait for the next substrate.
Also worth mentioning is the locking mechanism to prevent the radical reaction without the presence of substrate discovered by Catherine Drennan's group. Lys144 of the β subunit is located at a short G-rich loop highly conserved across all 5,6-LAMs, which blocks the AdoCbl from the reaction site. Based on X-ray structure analysis, when the open structure is applied, the axes of the TIM barrel and Rossmann domains are in different directions. With the addition of the substrate, the subunits rearrange to turn the axes into each other to facilitate the catalysis. For example, in wild type 5,6-LAM, the phenol ring of Tyr263α is oriented in a slipped geometry with pyridine ring of PLP, generating a π-π stacking interaction, which is capable of modulating the electron distribution of the high-energetic radical intermediate.
History
Early insights into the mechanism of the catalytic reaction mainly focused on isotopic methods. Both pathways of lysine degradation and the role of 5,6-LAM were discovered in early work by Stadtman's group during 1950s-1960s. In 1971, having a tritiated α-lysine, 2,5-diaminohexanoate, and coenzyme in hand, Colin Morley and T. Stadtman discovered the role of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as a source for hydrogen migration. Recently, much progress has been made toward detecting the intermediates of the reaction, especially towards I•. Based on quantum-mechanical calculations, it was proposed that with 5-fluorolysine as a substitute for D-lysine the 5-FS• species can be captured and analyzed. A similar approach was applied towards PLP modification, when it was modified to 4'-cyanoPLP or PLP-NO. The radical intermediate I• analogue is hypothesized to be easily detected to support the proposed mechanism. Other simulations can also provide some insights into the catalytic reaction.

The grey-throated babbler (Stachyris nigriceps) is a species of passerine bird in the Old World babbler family Timaliidae.
It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
Taxonomy
The grey-throated babbler was formally described in 1844 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth under the current binomial name Stachyris nigriceps. They specified the locality as Nepal. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek stakhus meaning "ear of wheat" and rhis, rhinos meaning "nostrils". The specific epithet nigriceps is from Latin niger meaning "black" and "-ceps" meaning "-headed".
Twelve subspecies are recognised:
S. n. nigriceps Blyth, 1844 – central, east Himalayas
S. n. coltarti Harington, 1913 – northeast India, north Myanmar and southwest China

Herty Lewites Rodríguez (December 24, 1939 – July 2, 2006) was a Nicaraguan politician. They were Mayor of Managua and a candidate for president in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election when they died suddenly.
Early life and involvement in the Nicaraguan Revolution
Lewites was born on December 24, 1939 in the San Felipe barrio of Jinotepe, the son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland (a candymaker) and a Catholic Nicaraguan. The two had met when their father visited Nicaragua from New York, fell in love with their mother and settled there. In Nicaragua their father owned the only gas station in town, Texaco, and two friends Lewites met at the gas station became pivotal in forming their commitment to fight the Somoza dictatorship: during the April 1954 rebellion, Lewites, then 15, was shocked by the murders of their friends Pablo Leal and Adolfo Báez Bone by the Somoza National Guard. They joined the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship in 1958 and went into exile in Brazil in 1960 with their father following Lewites' participation in the military action taking of the Jinotepe and Diriamba headquarters. Later Lewites went to El Salvador, Mexico and Cuba, and in 1969 they joined the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Rather than fighting, they began directing Solidarity Committees, becoming involved in financial matters and arms smuggling for the revolutionary movement. In 1973 they were imprisoned in the United States for illicit arms trafficking, spending a year and a half in a federal penitentiary at San Pedro, California. Outside of prison, they were highly effective and creative in their efforts, staging photography sessions to mislead the Somocistas about the whereabouts of key Sandinista fighters like Nora Astorga. They also helped form the Group of 12, a group of major Nicaraguan establishment figures who agreed to show public support for the Sandinistas, lending legitimacy to the FSLN.
Their brother, Israel Lewites, was involved in armed struggle and died in the attack on the Masaya barracks in October 1977.
Years in government
During the period of Sandinista rule in the 1980s, Lewites was an ally of the powerful Ortega brothers. As Minister of Tourism, they promoted state development projects, such as the Montelimar beach resort in 1986 and the Olof Palme Convention Center in Managua.
Lewites was twice married, first to Edda María Lacayo, with whom they had a son and later to Carmen García, who was their secretary at the Ministry of Tourism. They left their first wife and had a daughter with García.
After leaving government, they built the "Hertylandia" private amusement park.
Lewites was elected to Congress on the FSLN ticket in 1990, the year Daniel Ortega lost the presidency. They aligned themselves with Sergio Ramírez's Sandinista Renewal Movement (Movimiento Renovador Sandinista or "MRS") against the faction of Secretary General Ortega in 1994. They ran for mayor of Managua, the capital, in 1996 on their own "Sol" ticket, splitting the Sandinista vote to throw the election to the Liberal candidate. With the support of the FSLN "Business Bloc" led by Bayardo Arce, Lewites rejoined the mainline FSLN in 1998 and, with Ortega's blessing, won the Managua mayorship as a Sandinista in 2000.
Lewites opened Nicaragua's only amusement park, Hertylandia (named after himself), between Jinotepe and San Marcos.
Following Ortega's third successive election defeat in 2001, Lewites advocated FSLN cooperation with President Enrique Bolaños in their struggle to hold ex-President Arnoldo Alemán accountable for corruption. Ortega, however, eventually concluded a pact with Alemán. Meanwhile, Lewites removed corrupt members of the Ortega and Arce factions from positions in the Managua municipality. By appealing to both leftists and rightists fed-up with corruption, Lewites was for a while the most popular politician in Nicaragua and attracted the support of many historically prominent Sandinistas. They attempted to challenge Daniel Ortega for the 2006 FSLN presidential nomination, but was expelled from the FSLN (Sandinista Party) in February 2005.
Lewites joined forces with the dissident MRS Party as their Presidential candidate for the 2006 election. They chose Edmundo Jarquín as their running mate for the vice presidency.
Death
On July 2, 2006, it was reported that Lewites died of a massive heart attack at the Hospital Metropolitano "Vivian Pellas" in Managua, aged 66, four months prior to the 2006 national elections. Some of Lewites supporters suspected they were poisoned by Ortega. Their wife did not ask the doctor for autopsy to identify the cause of their death and later remained silent to the press. Lewites was polling in third place before dying, trailing very closely behind Ortega and Eduardo Montealegre. Their death sealed Ortega's victory, as their 1998 pact with Arnoldo Alemán changed the election rules to require a candidate only exceed 35% of the vote to win without a runoff.
Lewites was buried in their native city of Jinotepe three days after they died. Their burial counted with the presence of: the president of the republic, cabinet members, diplomatic representatives, artists, politicians and entrepreneurs. It is calculated that more than 20,000 people were in attendance in the small cemetery of Jinotepe. Their rectangular tomb depicts a Star of David with a Christian cross in the center and an epitaph, inscribed on marble, repeats a sentiment they were known for: "I was born under one dictatorship and I don't want to die under another."

History
The Onoda Light Railway Co. opened the Onoda – Minani-Onoda section in 1915 to service a cement plant.
The Ube Electric Railway Co. opened the Ino – Shin-Okiyama station (since closed) section in 1929, electrified at 600 VDC. The branch to Motoyama opened in 1937, also electrified at 600 VDC.
Both companies were nationalised in 1943, and in 1947 the lines were connected, resulting in the closure of Shin-Okiyama station, the replacement for which was nearby Minami-Onoda station.
In 1950 the Onoda – Minami-Onoda section was electrified and the voltage increased to 1500 VDC on the balance of the line.
CTC signalling was commissioned in 1983, and freight services ceased in 1986.

Music video
Synopsis
The video depicts a female protagonist regularly visits their lover's memorial after they were lost at sea. Every time, they leave a seashell at the site as a totem of remembrance, not knowing that they have woken them up from a limbo in another dimension of reality. They wander aimlessly until the seashells in their pocket, which they have collected in the past, remind them that they have passed on. A strange entity guides them towards the next seashell. They know they are there. They follow it hastily, hoping that they can reach it before they leaf. They find the seashell and tries to send a message back with it. But they have already started walking away. They feel it and turns back to see if it's real but it's already too late. They would visit again and they are hoping to reach back to their next time, in time."

Yakemys is an extinct genus of macrobaenid turtles from the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Tithonian-Valanginian?) lower Phu Kradung Formation of Thailand. It is monotypic, containing a single species, Yakemys multiporcata.
Discovery and etymology
Yakemys hails from fossil turtle site Ban Huai Yang (บ้านห้วยยาง) of Northeast Thailand, which, although expected to be within the later Phra Wihan Formation based on its geographic location, is thought to instead belong to the Phu Kradung Formation based on sedimentology. The recovered holotype of Yakemys multiporcata SM KS39 (housed in the Sirindhorn Museum) consists of a very partial shell, and the paratypes PRC 151, PRC 152, and PRC 153, each one or two shell fragments from different individuals. Its genus name is derived from ยักษ์ (yak), meaning "giant" in Thai, and its species name from Latin "multi" (multiple) and "porca" (ridge).
Description
Yakemys is one of the earliest macrobaenids known, and one of the three largest, with a carapace length of 70 cm (2.3 ft), equaling Anatolemys maximus and Judithemys backmani from the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. It can be distinguished by these autapomorphies: narrow vertebral scutes, large lateral longitudinal keels on the vertebral region, a plastron greatly reduced in size compared to the carapace, among other traits.
Classification
Yakemys was found by phylogenetic analysis in Tong et al. (2021) to belong to Macrobaenidae, and they suggested that Sinemydidae is a subfamily of Macrobaenidae, becoming Sinemydinae. The results of the analysis are shown below:

ROH, (, , Revolutionary Trade Union Movement literally in English) was a communist national trade union centre in Czechoslovakia 1945-1990. In Communist Czechoslovakia (1948-1989) it was a monopolistic trade union, wherein the membership was often mandatory for employees of state industries.
Foundation
ROH was founded in the Czech Lands in 1945, emerging out of the factory councils and workers militias that evolve out of the wake of the Second World War. After World War II, communists became dominant in the trade union movement once the war ended. They were however not the sole political force in the initial phase of ROH, the Trade Union Department of the Communist Party was wary of 'syndicalist' tendencies in the factory councils.
In April 1946 the Slovak trade unions merged into ROH. The Slovak unions merged with their Czech counterparts, adopting the slogan "One factory - one trade union organization". However, during 1947 ROH membership in Slovakia dropped sharply for political and economical reason, ROH lost a third of its members in the area.
Antonín Zápotocký, a communist pre-war labour leader who had been imprisoned for six years during the war, became the chairperson of ROH in June 1947. Evžen Erban, a left-wing Social Democrat, became the general secretary of ROH. In the leading body of ROH, the Central Trade Union Council (ÚRO), there were 94 communists, 18 Social Democrats, 6 National Socialists and 2 from the People's Party.
Prague Spring
During the Prague Spring of 1968, ROH became somewhat more independent. However, developments in the trade union field were somewhat slower than in other organizations. In March 1968 hardline leaders were removed from their positions in ÚRO. In September 1968 ÚRO reaffirmed that the process of internal reforms and adoptions of new statues in the affiliated unions would continue. Between November 1968 and January 1969 some unions (like the metalworkers' Union) threatened to launch strikes if the pro-reform leaders wouldn't be reinstated to their positions in the Communist Party.<ref name="spr">Ekiert, Grzegorz. 'The State against Society: Political Crises and Their Aftermath in East Central Europe. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996. p. 188</ref>
Ahead of the 7th ROH congress, held March 4–5 March 1969, 75% of the delegates were elected from the affiliated unions through secret ballots (for the first time). The congress did steer a moderate course, as the trade union movement was pressured from both pro-reform sectors and Communist Party hardliners. In the ROH leadership elected at the congress, different political strands were represented. Karel Poláček was the ROH chairperson at the time. Gradually, however, ROH returned to following the line of the Communist Party.
Organization
ROH was organized along democratic centralist lines. The national leadership was the Central Trade Union Council (ÚRO). The organ leading ROH between ÚRO meetings was its 14-member presidium. In the districts, there were the District Trade Union Council (KOR). The KORs had around 20 members each, elected at District Trade Union Conferences.
ROH published the newspaper Práce''.
As of August 1958 ROH had over 3 800 000 members.
International cooperation
ROH was a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The WFTU had its headquarters in Prague.
Later period
In 1989, autonomous trade unions and strike committees surged in Czechoslovakia, which called for the dissolution of ROH. A parallel Trade Union Coordination Centre was formed. ROH tried to manage the situation by declaring its independence from the Communist Party. The Slovak branch of ROH decided to subordinate itself to the Coordination Centre. The Czech ROH organization hesitated somewhat, but at a trade union conference held 2–3 March 1990 ROH dissolved itself. In its place a new trade union federation, ČSKOS was founded.

Sydney Govons Kustu (March 18, 1943 – March 18, 2014) was an American biologist and a professor of biochemistry at University of California, Berkeley.  They are known for their pioneering research on the regulation of Nitrogen metabolism in bacteria.
Academic career
At the early age of 15, they entered Radcliffe College, the all-female counterpart to Harvard, receiving their Bachelor of Arts degree in General Studies in 1963, making them among the first females to graduate from Harvard. They then studied as a technician with Saul Roseman at the University of Michigan, and received their doctorate in biochemistry from UC Davis in 1970, studying under Jack Preiss. They performed postdoctoral research at the UC Berkeley in the laboratory of Giovanna Ferro-Luzzi Ames. In 1973, UC Davis hired them as an assistant professor, and they were promoted to full professor in 1984. They were subsequently recruited to UC Berkeley in 1986, from which they retired in March 2010 and received Emeritus status.
Scientific contributions
Among their contributions to microbial genetics and physiology, they worked on bacterial genes and how they are regulated due to the availability of nitrogen-containing compounds from their environment. They had found that strains of Salmonella typhimurium selected for utilization of D-histidine in place of L-histidine were frequently the result of mutations affecting glutamine synthetase (GS), a central enzyme in the pathways of nitrogen utilization.
In a series of paradigm-altering papers, Kustu along with their students proved that regulation GS synthesis and thus bacterial utilization of various nitrogen sources are mediated by a consortium of three regulatory proteins, which they named the Ntr system (for nitrogen regulatory): NtrA, NtrB, and NtrC. These proteins interact to repress or set off the synthesis of enzymes that catalyze the multiple routes of nitrogen utilization appropriate to extant conditions of the environment. Kustu also reported that NtrA was one of the first examples of an alternative sigma factor, and thus it can be claimed that Sydney was responsible for the discovery of RpoN or sigma 54, which it later became more widely known as.
Awards and honors
In 1993, Sydney was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences for their contributions to the field of Genetics.
Other awards include:
elected fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) (1992)
elected fellow of American Academy of Microbiology
Gauss Professorship (Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Göttingen Academy of Sciences)
Miller Professorship (UC Berkeley) (2005-2006)
NIH MERIT award (1986-2007)
NSF Visiting Professorship for Women (1984)
Death
On March 18, 2014, Sydney committed suicide on their 71st birthday, by swallowing the poisonous chemical, sodium azide. They were found by a maid in a room at the Berkeley City Club, along with a note to warn authorities about the dangerous substance having been used in the room, as well as a note with their personal information such as their laptop passcode. A bottle of research-grade sodium azide, likely obtained from their former laboratory, had been left on a table with its lid tightly secured. The unusual nature of their suicide prompted a major emergency response operation to evacuate the landmarked Julia Morgan-designed building. Sodium azide is a commonly-used research chemical, used as a biocide to prevent unwanted bacterial growth in stock chemicals, as well as an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase for studying the influence of oxidative respiration in gram-negative bacteria.

New York State Route 359 (NY 359) is a state highway located entirely within the town of Skaneateles in Onondaga County, New York in the United States. At in length, it is one of the shortest signed state highways in all of New York. The route begins at NY 38A a half-mile (0.8 km) north of the Onondaga-Cayuga County county line and ends at NY 41A in the hamlet of Mandana. It lies between Skaneateles Lake and Owasco Lake. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route. NY 359 was assigned in the early 1940s and was part of the original NY 26 from 1924 to 1930.
Route description
NY 359 begins in the town of Skaneateles at an intersection with Heifer Street, a local road, and NY 38A. The route goes north, intersecting with Weeks Road north of NY 38A. Here, NY 359 begins to curve to the east with Weeks Road carrying on the northward alignment of NY 359. Upon meeting Lacy Road, the route takes over its east–west routing and heads east. NY 359 comes to an end just under a mile later at NY 41A in the lakeside hamlet of Mandana. East of NY 41A, the roadway continues for roughly to a boat launch on the western shore of Skaneateles Lake, from NY 38A.
Signed as a north–south route, it lies that way at the southern end, but about midway along its length the road turns and thence travels east–west. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route. It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an alphabetic suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes.
History
The origins of NY 359 date back to the assignment of the first state routes in New York in 1924. At this time, all modern NY 359 became part of NY 26, a highway that continued north along what is now NY 41A toward the village of Skaneateles and south on modern NY 38A toward the village of Moravia. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 26 was reassigned elsewhere in the state. Its former routing was incorporated into several new routes, including part of NY 38A from Moravia to the modern junction of NY 38A and NY 359 and part of NY 41A from Mandana to Skaneateles. The portion that is now NY 359, however, received no designation and became unnumbered. It was designated as NY 359 in the early 1940s.

Glenn William Howard (born July 17, 1962) is a Canadian curler who is one of the most decorated curlers of all time. They have won four world championships, four Briers and 17 Ontario provincial championships, including a record eight straight, from 2006 to 2013. Through 2017, they have played in 218 games at the Brier, more than any other curler in history. They have also won the 2001 TSN Skins Game.
Career
Juniors
Howard lost two straight Ontario Junior Championship finals in 1980 and 1981, skipping a rink out of Midland, Ontario. In both events there were no playoffs, but a tie for first place after the round robin forced a tiebreaker. In 1980 they lost to John Kawaja and in 1981, they lost to John Base. Howard won the 1984 Ontario University Athletics Association title skipping the University of Waterloo curling team.
1985–2006
Howard had a lot of success in their early career when they played third with their brother, Russ. With Russ, Howard won the 1987 and 1993 Labatt Briers, and brought home gold from the 1987 and 1993 World Championships. However, Russ would move to New Brunswick in the late 1990s, leaving Glenn in Ontario to form their own team. Glenn did return to play for their brother at the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials.
Glenn would be unsuccessful in returning to the Brier, losing back-to-back provincial finals (2004, 2005) until 2006 when they would triumph over former teammate Wayne Middaugh in the Ontario final. This qualified them for the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier. Their team of third Richard Hart, second Brent Laing, and lead Craig Savill dominated the 2006 Brier, finishing the round robin with only one loss. However, the team was not successful in the final, losing to Quebec's Jean-Michel Ménard 8–7.
2007–2014
Howard's team dominated the 2007 season. The team marched right through the provincial championships without losing a single game (none even going a complete ten ends). At the 2007 Tim Hortons Brier, the team lost just one round-robin game to Alberta's Kevin Martin. The team lost another in the Page playoff 1 vs. 2 game to Olympic gold medalist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador. However, in the re-match in the final, Howard beat Gushue 10–6. Howard's team continued its dominance at the 2007 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. The team lost just one game in the round-robin to Team USA (skipped by Todd Birr). However, it avenged this loss by beating the Americans 7–2 in the Page playoff game and then winning the final over the Germans skipped by Andy Kapp 8–3.
In their attempt to repeat at the 2008 Tim Hortons Brier, Howard lost 5–4 in the final to Alberta, skipped by Kevin Martin.
Howard became only the second skip to win a career Grand Slam when they won the Canadian Open in 2009.
Howard again qualified for the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier in Calgary. Many were looking forward to Howard's performance at the Brier. Firstly, their older brother Russ was skipping the New Brunswick team, and secondly, a re-match with the rival Kevin Martin team. Howard's rink finished the round robin in second place with a 9-2 record. Their last match of the round robin was against Martin, as was the first playoff matchup. Both games Howard lost, but were widely considered two of the most entertaining games in curling history, due to the incredible shot making. Howard would lose their next playoff game as well, to Jeff Stoughton's Manitoba rink, disappointing those who wanted to see a third straight exciting Martin vs Howard show down. Despite all of this, Howard is probably most remembered at the 2009 Brier for one of the greatest shots in curling history. In a round robin match against Saskatchewan, Howard was down by two with their last shot of the game. They only had one shot to win the game. Howard was facing two Saskatchewan stones, which were too far apart and too even to take out both. Howard had three rocks in the 12 foot. With their rock, Howard knocked one of their rocks onto another of their rocks, deflecting into one of the Saskatchewan stones, removing it while sticking, while their shooter rock had ricocheted off the first Ontario rock onto the other Saskatchewan stone, taking it out as well, while sticking too. With those two Ontario rocks, plus the other one that remained stationary, Ontario scored three to win the game. (See video) The shot would even be mentioned by Chris Plys on The Colbert Report during a curling segment.
Howard clinched a spot at the 2009 Olympic Trials when they won the 2008 Tylenol Players' Championship, which was held in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Howard finished the tournament with a perfect record and beat Kevin Martin in the final.
At the 2010 Brier, Howard finished the round robin with an undefeated 11–0 record, but lost in the Final to Alberta's Kevin Koe. They finished the year with a semifinal loss to Niklas Edin at the 2011 Players' Championship. At the end of the season, longtime third Richard Hart announced that they would leave Team Howard and the world of competitive curling. Former teammate Wayne Middaugh replaced Hart.
At the 2012 World Championship, Howard defeated Scotland in the Final to capture their 4th world title.
At the 2013 Brier, Howard would once again represent the province of Ontario. Howard and team would go 10-1 in the Round Robin, giving themselves a spot in the Page 1-2 game. Team Howard would go on to lose to Manitoba's Jeff Stoughton in the page playoff and to eventual Brier champion, Northern Ontario's Brad Jacobs in the semi final.
By being the CTRS leader for the 2011-2012 season, Glenn Howard clinched a spot in 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. Howard would end up missing the playoffs, finishing 2-5 and in a tie for 6th place with Kevin Koe. Glenn Howard would go on to play in the 2014 Ontario Provincials and lose to Greg Balsdon in the final. Before losing to Balsdon, Howard had won eight-straight provincial championships.
2014–present
At the end of the 2013–2014 season, Glenn Howard announced that second Brent Laing would be leaving the team and going to Alberta to join with Kevin Koe's new rink. On April 13, via their Twitter account, Glenn Howard announced their new team would consist of former third Richard Hart, Jon Mead, and maintaining lead Craig Savill. The team would not have much success in their lone season together, failing to even qualify for the provincial championships.
For the 2015–16 curling season, Wayne Middaugh joined the team once again, as did Glenn's son, Scott Howard, with Savill leaving the team. Middaugh left the team mid-season following a skiing incident and was replaced by Adam Spencer. The team won the 2016 Ontario Tankard and represented Ontario at the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier. At the Brier, Howard led Ontario to a 4–7 round robin record.
In 2016, David Mathers joined the team at second, with Middaugh retiring from the game. The rink won the 2017 Ontario Tankard, Howard's record 17th provincial championship. At the 2017 Tim Hortons Brier, Howard led their Ontario foursome to a 4–7 record.
In 2017, Hart retired from professional curling, and was replaced by Adam Spencer. The rink played in the 2017 Olympic Pre-Trials. They went 6–0 in round robin play, but were eliminated in the playoffs, making it as far as the "B" final, ending the team's Olympic qualifying run.
At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Howard coached the Great Britain Women's Curling team (skipped by Eve Muirhead), who reached the semi-finals at the expense of their Canadian counterparts; Howard said, "Too bad Canada were knocked out, but we've got a job to do and I'm really proud of the girls". Howard has been coaching the Muirhead rink ever since.
In 2018, Tim March joined the team at lead, with son Scott replacing Spencer at third.
Personal life
Howard works for Brewers Retail Inc. as a consultant and spokesperson. They currently reside in Tiny, Ontario.  They are married and has two children, who are both curlers themselves, Scott and Carly. Howard made a guest appearance on the CBC comedy Little Mosque on the Prairie on the season 2 episode titled "Jihad on Ice". In the Fall of 2013, they were inducted into the Penetanguishene Sports Hall of Fame.

Shyam Saran Negi, (born 1 July 1917) is a retired schoolteacher in Kalpa, Himachal Pradesh, who cast the first vote in the 1951 general election in India — the nation's first election since the end of the British Rule in 1947. Although most of the polling for that first election took place in February 1952, Himachal Pradesh went to the polls five months early because the weather there tends to be inclement in February and March and heavy snowfall during that period would have made it impossible for citizens to reach the polling stations. Negi cast the first vote on October 25, 1951. They have voted in every general election since 1951, and is believed to be India's oldest voter as well its first. Shyam Saran Negi also made a special appearance in a Hindi film Sanam Re.
Honour
In 2010, the then Chief Election Commissioner of India, Navin Chawla, visited Negi's village to honour them as part of the Election Commission's diamond jubilee celebrations.
In 2014, Google India produced a public service announcement in which Negi told of their participation in independent India's first election, and reminded viewers of the importance of voting.

Clemente de Lantaño Pino (31 July 1774, Chillán Viejo, Ñuble, Chile - 10 May 1846) was a royalist military officer during the Chilean War of Independence. Later, during the Spanish reconquest, they changed sides and fought for independence against the royalist forces.
Before the beginning of the war, Lantaño was simply a well-connected large estate owner of Ñuble Partido. In 1814 Spanish Brigadier Gabino Gaínza put them in command of one of their main guerrilla columns, with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
They participated in the Battle of El Roble, the Battle of Membrillar and the Disaster of Rancagua, among other military actions. But the capture in 1814 of the Carrera brothers, José Miguel and Luis, was what made them famous within the army.
After the Battle of Maipú in 1818, they continued fighting with the royalists on the south shore of the Río Bío-Bío until they accompanied Colonel Juan Francisco Sánchez in the exhausting retreat to Valdivia in 1819. From there they went on to Peru by sea in order to continue serving the royalist cause.
In Peru they were welcomed by Viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela. In 1821, before the arrival of the rebel forces of José de San Martín, the viceroy ordered them to prepare the defense of the Department of Ancash. Against the forces that they organized in Huaraz, the rebels sent troops from Supe under the command of Colonel Enrique Compino. The attackers surprised the city. Lantaño was taken prisoner and sent back to Chile.
Bernardo O'Higgins, who knew them before the revolution (because both were powerful neighbors in the same province), offered to recognize their rank if they joined the patriot army. Lantaño, apparently convinced of the hopelessness of the royalist cause, accepted the offer.
They were commissioned the same year to mediate with the royal governor of Chiloé, Antonio de Quintanilla. Lantaño proposed in the name of the government of Santiago the incorporation of the archipelago of the recently created Chilean Republic, trying to convince Quintanilla of the inevitable defeat of Spanish arms in Chile. The mission, however, was unsuccessful, because Quintanilla did not accept Lantaño's view of the situation.
Returning to the territory held by the rebels, they fought in the Guerra a muerte (War to the Death, or the final phase of the Chilean War of Independence), together with Captain Manuel Bulnes. In 1821 they negotiated the surrender of the royalist camp at Quilapalo. In 1823 they led a punitive expedition against the guerrillas of the Pincheira brothers in the mountains of Ñuble.

Pilot Mill, Bury is a four-storey cotton spinning mill in Bury, Greater Manchester, England. It was built in 1905 for the Pilot Spinning Co. It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1939. The mill closed in 1962 and was later sold to Antler Luggage. The Mill is currently occupied by Baum Trading Ltd and Metzuyan Ltd (an online fashion clothing and accessories company)they have opened a retail outlet with an on site cafe.
Location
Bury is a town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Irwell, east of Bolton, west-southwest of Rochdale, and north-northwest of the city of Manchester. Bury is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, of which Bury is the largest settlement and administrative centre. Bury has a total population of 60,718. Historically a part of Lancashire, Bury emerged during the Industrial Revolution as a mill town centred on textile manufacture.
Pilot mill is on Alfred Street, close to the centre of the town adjacent to the River Roch and the railway and junction 2 of the M66.
History
Probate evidence from the 17th century and the remains of 18th century weavers' cottages in Elton, on the west side of Bury, indicate that domestic textile production was an important factor of the local economy at a time when Bury's textile industry was dominated by woollens and based upon the domestic production of yarn and cloth as well as water-powered fulling mills.
Development was swift in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The establishment of Brooksbottom Mill, in Summerseat north of the town, as a calico printing works in 1773 by the family of Sir Robert Peel marked the beginning of the cotton industry in Bury. By the early 19th century cotton was the predominant textile industry with the River Roch and River Irwell providing power for spinning mills and processing water for the finishing trades. Development was further promoted when the town was linked to the national canal network by the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal, fully opened in 1808. The canal is provided with water from Elton Reservoir, fed by aqueducts from a weir on the River Irwell, north of what is now the Burrs Country Park. The Burrs are also the site of another mill developed by the Peel family, first founded in 1790. The remains are displayed for the public. There were seven cotton mills in Bury by 1818 and the population grew from 9,152 in 1801 to 58,029 in 1901.
Following this, railways opened, linking the town from Bury Bolton Street railway station to Manchester, Radcliffe, Rawtenstall and Accrington and from the old Knowsley Street railway station to the neighbouring mill towns of Bolton, Heywood and Rochdale. As well as the many cotton mills other industries which thrived included paper–making, calico printing and some light engineering. The town expanded to incorporate the former townships of Elton, Walmersley and Heap and rows of terraced housing encircled the town centre by the turn of the 19th century. Districts such as Freetown, Fishpool and Pimhole were transformed from farmers' fields to rows of terraced housing, beside the factories and mills.
Pilot Mill is one of the classic late 19th-century spinning mills that were such a feature of other Lancashire towns.
The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Pilot Mill, Bury was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. After cotton, it lost its chimney and the decorative top to the water tower.
, the mill and engine house remain, the chimney is gone. The building is occupied by a luggage manufacturer.
Architecture
Pilot Mill was a late mill. It had an ornate pyramidal water tower, and its name was displayed on the western side.
Power
Driven by 2000 hp triple-expansion four-cylinder engine by J & E Wood, 1906. 23 ½"HP, 36 ½"IP, two 40"LP X 5 ft stroke. 200psi, 66 ½ rpm. 24 ft flywheel, 46 ropes.
