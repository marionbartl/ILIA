Julius Braunthal (1891–1972) was an Austrian-born Jewish historian, magazine editor, and political activist. Braunthal is best remembered as the Secretary of the Socialist International from 1951 to 1956 and for his massive three volume History of the International, first published in German between 1961 and 1971.
Biography
Early years
Julius Braunthal was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary on 5 May 1891.
During World War I Braunthal was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, winning a decoration for valor and rising to the rank of lieutenant by the end of the war.
Interwar period
After the war Braunthal served as an Assistant Secretary of State for the newly established Republic of Austria from 1918 to 1920.
A committed socialist, following his departure from government service Braunthal edited several socialist publications. He published the first article on Fascism entitled "Der Putsch der Fascisten" in Der Kampf, a theoretical monthly journal of the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ), in November 1922 shortly after March on Rome which was an organized mass demonstration and a coup d'état by Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In 1924 Braunthal was editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, the official organ of the SPÖ. From 1927 to 1934 he served as editor of the popular socialist newspaper, Das Kleine Blatt (The Little Leaf), also published by the SPÖ. He also edited the illustrated magazine Der Kuckuck (The Cuckoo).
Austrofascism began to rise in the middle 1930s and Brauthal was soon embroiled with difficulties with the new right wing regime. In 1934 Braunthal was arrested and jailed, charged with treason. He was ultimately expelled from the country in 1935, narrowly escaping the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany three years later.
In 1938, Braunthal went into exile in Great Britain, where his elder sister Bertha Clark (1887-1967) had been living and working with her Scottish born husband since 1933, and where he would remain for the rest of his life.
Julius Braunthal was named an assistant secretary of the Labour and Socialist International in 1938, remaining in that capacity until the outbreak of World War II.
World War II and after
During World War II, Braunthal was the editor of the journal of the Labour and Socialist International, International Socialist Forum. He would serve in that capacity until 1948. Thereafter Braunthal was named as the Secretary of the International Socialist Conference, a transitional organization which preceded establishment of the new Socialist International. In 1951 Braunthal was named the first Secretary General of this new international institution. He would hold this post until 1956.
Following the end of his time as the head of the Socialist International, Braunthal turned his attention to the writing of history. He authored a three volume History of the International, detailing the institutional development of international socialism from the First International until the present day. The first volume of this work was published in 1961, with the third and final volume seeing print in 1971.
Death and legacy
Julius Braunthal died on 24 April 1972 in Teddington, England. He was 78 years old at the time of his death.
Braunthal's papers reside at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Nack is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Alzey-Worms district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
Geography
Location
The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land, whose seat is in Alzey.
Neighbouring municipalities
Nack's neighbours are Erbes-Büdesheim, Bechenheim, Nieder-Wiesen, Offenheim und Wendelsheim.
History
Religion
By religious affiliation, the greatest part of Nack's population, 44.8%, belongs to the Evangelical denomination, whereas 34.2% of the population is Catholic. Those professing another religious affiliation, or none, amount to 21%.
Population development
At 31 December 2004, there were precisely 631 registered inhabitants whose main residences were in Nack, and another 31 inhabitants with secondary residences in the municipality (according to data from the municipal statistics from the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land), making Nack rather one of the smaller villages in the Verbandsgemeinde, with its population of 24,362. Nevertheless, of the 24 places in the Verbandsgemeinde, 11 have even smaller populations than Nack.
As the following table shows, over the last 30 years, there has been a rise in Nack's population of roughly 17%.
The climb in population figures over the last few years stems from the development of the new building areas, In den Dreißig Morgen (1990) and Am Wingertsberg (1995). A further such area is foreseen: Procedures for transferring the land needed for the building area Am Sportplatz have been completed, and thereby the number of building lots on offer is to be raised by 15.
The age distribution in Nack is much the same as it is throughout Germany. The younger age groups are represented in noticeably lower figures. The biggest group, among both men and women, is the 40-to-49 age group. This also holds true in age group breakdowns for the whole of the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land).
In this municipality, 8 children each year until 2011 will begin school, which, given the figures for Nack, is no small number.
The male share of the population at 51.03% is only marginally higher than the female share at 48.97%.
Politics
Town council
The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.
The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:
Mayors
Erhard Grauer (until 1997)
Paul Maruelli (1997–2004)
Bernhard Hähnel, Bürgerverein (2004–2019)
Frank Jakoby-Marouelli (since 2019)
Coat of arms
The municipality's arms might be described thus: Argent between two bars gules the letter N azure flanked by two cubes of the second, in chief five cubes in fess of the second, in base three cubes of the second.
According to Parker, “cubes” is correct for this charge, “square” in blazons meaning a carpenter's or mason's tool.
Culture and sightseeing
Sport
Nack has at its disposal a motocross track, where once Germany-wide races were held; however, owing to difficulties due to noise in Wendelsheim, the racetrack was largely shut down. Today drivers from the local area only use the track once a month.

The Nexus Trilogy is a postcyberpunk thriller novel trilogy written by American author Ramez Naam and published between 2012-2015. The novel series follows the protagonist Kaden Lane, a scientist who works on an experimental nano-drug, Nexus, which allows the brain to be programmed and networked, connecting human minds together. As he pursues his work, he becomes entangled in government and corporate intrigue. The story takes place in the year 2040.
Nexus tied for Best Novel in the 2014 Prometheus Awards given out by the Libertarian Futurist Society. It was also shortlisted for the 2014 Arthur C. Clarke award. Nexus was published in 2012. Its sequel, Crux, was published in 2013. The third volume of the trilogy, Apex, was published in 2014, and won the 2015 Philip K. Dick Award. The film rights to Nexus were purchased by Paramount in 2013.
Plot summary
Nexus
Samantha Cataranes (Sam), an agent for the Emerging Risks Directorate (ERD) of the United States government, arrives undercover at a party looking for Kaden Lane. Kaden is there testing Nexus 5, an illegal, experimental nano-drug for direct input and output of brain signals. Sam talks with Kaden about his work and he invites her to be a part of a Nexus 5 study. Sam goes to the study and meets Kaden's close friends and colleagues: Rangan Shankari, Ilya Alexander, and Watson Cole (Wats). Sam takes Nexus 5, connecting her mind with the others, and they discover who she is and Kade uses Nexus to knock her out. When Sam awakes she threatens the group with prison, and promises a pardon in exchange for Kade's help. Wats escapes before the ERD extracts the group. The ERD describe a mission to spy on Su-Yong Shu, a brilliant Chinese neuro-scientist who is implicated in murder and brain control coercion. Kade agrees to work with the ERD and hands over Nexus 5. Kade and the group are sent to retrieve the Nexus 5 data, and on the way, they install a backdoor into the Nexus 5 operating system.
Sam is required to have permanent integration with Nexus 5, despite her disagreement with Warren Becker, the Enforcement Division Deputy Director at the ERD. Kade and Sam, now with the pseudonym of Robyn Rodriguez, travel to Bangkok for a conference that Kade is invited to by Shu. Wats follows in hopes of setting Kade free and spreading Nexus 5 to the general public. At registration, Kade hears an inspiring talk from Somdet Phra Ananda, discussing a Nexus-like topic, and meets Narong, a PHD student. Narong invites Kade to a student mixer the following night. After returning to the hotel Kade finds a secret note left by Wats, informing him of the possibility of escape if needed. Kade recognizes that he needs to stay and attempts to notify Wats, who however never receives the message.
At the opening night reception Sam discovers Narong is a known associate of Suk Prat-Nung, a nephew of Thanom Prat-Nung, a Thai Drug Dealer. Sam decides it is important to continue to track Narong in hopes of catching the Thai drug ring leaders. Kade finds Shu and is invited for lunch the following day, later changed to dinner as she meets first with Ananda. Kade also discovers that Professor Ananda is under the influence of Nexus. After returning to the hotel, Sam reviews tapes from the day and discovers the interaction between Ananda and Kade and that Ananda also followed Kade home. Sam also discovers that a note has been passed to Kade, however she does not know that it was from Wats. Kade meets with Shu for dinner where she reaches into his mind to discover what he knows. Kade fights back and employs a mantra to rearrange his memories. Shu reverses the effect and discovers that Kade is working with the ERD. Kade discovers that Shu is the first mind uploaded to a computer system. She is trans-human and attempts to convince Kade to join her in fighting humans. Kade asks for time to think about her proposal. She creates false memories so that Sam and the ERD will not discover their true conversation.
Kade and Sam attend the student mixer to meet with Narong. He invites them to an after party in another area. On the way they go to Sukchai, an underground black market for everything trans-human. Kade realizes that legalizing these products would protect people, while Sam struggles with what is right. At the after party, Kade and Sam are invited to a Synchronicity party with Narong to try Nexus and another drug, Empathek. While leaving the party Sam and Kade are attacked. Sam defeats the attackers and calls for backup. The ERD backup arrives and extracts them. Sam confronts Kade about the interaction with Ananda, which Kade denies and arranges his memories to cover it up. The following day, Kade is approached by Shu at the conference. He recounts the previous nights events and Shu denies it was her people. Shu again tries to convince Kade that he should join the trans-humans. Kade takes a call from Ilya that reminds him that technology in the hands of only the elite is dangerous. Kade talks privately with Ananda. Ananda describes Buddhism as a democracy and how technology and knowledge must be shared.
Meanwhile, Wats discovers that Suk Prat-Nung set up the ambush on Kade and Sam. He also discovers a plot to ambush them again during their Synchronicity party and sends an email to Kade to warn him. Sam sees the email and notifies ERD to be available in case of an ambush. At the Synchronicity party, Sam and Kade take Nexus and Empathek. They both use their mantras to change their memories. Sam, believing she is now Robyn Rodriguez, talks with Mai, a young girl that was born with Nexus abilities. Mai unlocks Sam's true memories and contributes to a great change inside Sam. Sam, overwhelmed by her sudden realization of the power of these drugs and released from her horrible past, talks with Kade. She releases his true memories and recounts her dark past. They both fall asleep. Upon waking they find Thanom Prat-Nung and his guards in the room. Narong, under the influence of Nexus 5 and the ERD, draws a gun on Thanom. Narong is killed by Thanom's guards and the ERD sends three team of men into the building, open firing despite Sam's warnings of civilians. Mai and the other members of the party are killed. Sam kills several ERD agents. Kade fights the ERD soldiers. Wats joins the fight and is killed. The ERD detonate explosions in the skulls of the soldiers. Sam and Kade escape.
Suk Prat-Nung still alive, with a few of his men, continues to fight Sam and Kade. Kade is captured while Sam defeats some of Suk's men. Kade uses Nexus 5 to control the actions of his captor, Suk, to escape. Suk is killed. Feng, Shu's driver and a super soldier clone, rescues Kade and Sam, bringing them to a monastery. Sam and Kade spend some time recovering at the monastery while the ERD searches for them. An ERD recon spider robot discovers Sam and Kade's location, and the ERD sends a team to retrieve them. On her way to the monastery, Shu and Feng discover the ERD helicopters going to the monastery. They get a message to the monastery. Kade decides to mass distribute the Nexus 5 instructions. The ERD capture Kade placing him bound on a helicopter. Sam forces her way onto the helicopter, along with Feng. Shu takes control of the helicopter with her mind and forces it to return to the monastery. Before arriving two Thai fighter jets destroy the helicopters just as Kade, Sam, and Feng leap into a nearby lake.
After returning to the monastery, the ERD recon spider robots shoots a neuro toxin at Kade and Shu. Feng cuts Kades right arm off to prevent the spreading of the toxin. Shu is killed. Nexus 5 is spread around the world, despite the efforts of government forces. Warren Becker, the Enforcement Division Deputy Director at the ERD, commits suicide. Kade uses gecko genes to grow back his arm.
Crux
Six months after the upload of the construction plan of the Nexus, a nano drug, which allows the brain to be programmed and networked, connecting human minds together, the world faces terrorism and massive abuse of the new technology. The Liberation Front, a terror cell secretly created and headed by the US-American government, spread terror in the name of posthumanism, to prevent people from using the new technology and bring up an atmosphere of two 'n' eight to take drastic measures against Nexus.
In the meantime, our protagonist Kade and his new friend, clone warrior Feng, are fleeing from the CIA, which want to see them both killed. On the elopement Kade is trying to stem the misuse of the nano drug to prevent a war between posthumans and humans. He has a code to the Nexus system that he can use to hack it.
The secret services are very interested in the code. Ilya Alexander dies as prisoner because she didn't give the code to her turnkeys. Rangan Shankari can escape.
Su-Yong Shu died in Nexus and now lives on as a computer intelligence and prisoner on a server belonging to the Chinese government. Ling Shu, her daughter, tries to help her mother escape. At the end of the book, the mother uses Ling Shus Nexus system to hack her brain and take over the body of her daughter.
In Thailand, Samantha Cataranes helps in a protectory.
Apex
Previous
A new nano cyber drug called Nexus is released in the year 2040. It connects human minds and allows the brain to be programmed. The protagonist Kaden Lane works on the illegal drug and is suddenly entangled in government intrigue. The nanomedicine is the breakthrough to posthumanism which governments and corporations fear and try to stop. Su-Yong Shu, a brilliant Chinese neuroscientist, with a mind uploaded to the network, tries to start a posthuman revolution. Soon Kaden Lane, who is summoned to spy on her, becomes her ally. The US American government hunts both and at the end Su-Yong Shu's physical body dies while her mind is isolated in a Chinese data center. Kaden Lane flees with his friends and makes the nano drugs available for all of humanity. As a result global unrest spreads with terrorists using the nano drug for assassination and governments trying to assassinate Nexus users. Meanwhile, Su-Yong Shu is nearly killed by the Chinese government by cutting off power to the data center. In the end she is rescued by her daughter.
Apex
The United States and China in particular and the Earth in general are aroused by disturbances. Unrest and riots spread with Nexus-upgraded protesters and police. Su-Yong Shu, the former dead neuroscientist who stole her daughter's body by downloading herself into it, tries to take over all electronic systems and with them the entire world, recreating it to fit her imagination. The posthumans are called Apex, the climax, and reinstatement of humankind.
Film adaptions
The film rights to the novel series were purchased by Paramount in 2013.
Futurism themes
The novel is heavily based in, and extends concepts in the author Ramez Naam's 2007 non-fiction work More Than Human: Embracing the promise of biological enhancement, in which the author argues for a technology like the fictional drug Nexus.
Genetic enhancements
The genetic enhancements to boost strength, speed, and stamina, as described in Nexus, are likely already possible, argued so by Ramez Naam.
Operating system backdoor
The Nexus backdoor that is created by Kade and Rangan in the novel is based on the Karger and Schell Multics backdoor, implemented experimentally by Ken Thompson, co-inventor of the Unix operating system.

A haunted swing, also known as diabolic swing or witches' swing, is an amusement ride giving visitors the illusion they are turning upside down by rotating the outer room independently from the platform they are seated on. While the first installations date back to the late 19th century, modern, larger scale implementations are still being manufactured by several manufacturers, as Madhouse (by Vekoma) or Mystery Swing (by Mack Rides).
Illusion
The illusion is created by separating the movement of the swing occupants sit on, and the room that surrounds them. While the swing barely moves, the room can fully rotate around the occupants. As this room is the only frame of reference visitors have, it appears as if they are turning upside down. This principle is known as vection.
History
A patent for the ride was granted in 1893 to Amariah Lake (1836-1922), an inventor from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was also credited with the invention of several other amusement rides. The patent describes "an apparatus (...) of such nature that the occupants (...) will be subject to the illusion that they are swinging to an extreme height, or even that the swing is turning completely over".
The first haunted swings were opened around 1894 at the Atlantic City Boardwalk and the 1894 Midwinter Fair in San Francisco. In Germany, the Hexenschaukel (Witches' Swing) opened later that year, a ride that is still operating today.
Ride experience
Several accounts of the ride experience at the first installations exist. The rooms were furnished with chairs, tables, curtains, paintings, a stroller, an iron safe and a piano, which were secured to the walls or ceiling. The illusion is further enhanced by an electric light disguised as a petroleum light, which would be unable to function when inverted. Visitors were seated on a swing that was hanging from a metal pipe. Sources disagree about the swing's capacity, ranging from 12 persons to 20 or even 40 or more.
After visitors were seated, an attendant would give the swing a small push and leave the room. The attendant would start manually rotating the room from the outside, giving riders the illusion that the swinging was increasing. Finally, the room would fully rotate several times and come to a halt.
Wood described his experience on the haunted swing at the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco. He reported several riders suffering from dizziness and nausea.
Madhouse
In 1996, the illusion was reinvented in the amusement ride Villa Volta in Efteling theme park in the Netherlands. Built by Vekoma, this ride differed in the much larger capacity (78 persons) and the fact that the swing was also actuated, instead of passively swinging. Several rides of this type have since be built by Vekoma under the name Madhouse. Since 2000, Mack Rides produces a similar ride as Mystery Swing.

WJTO (730 AM) is an adult standards/oldies station licensed to Bath, Maine. WJTO is owned by Blue Jey Broadcasting Co. (Bob Bittner: 100% stockholder) and is a sister station to similarly owned WJIB in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
History
WJTO began broadcasting in September 1957 as WMMS ("Where Most of Maine is Served") under original owner Winslow T. Porter Sr. The callsign was changed in 1964 to WJTO for "Where Jets Take Off" — a reference to nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station.
In the 1960s and ‘70s, WJTO, with studios located in downtown Bath, gave several Portland stations real competition. In 1971, the modern two-story building was constructed at the transmitter site (the current site owned by Bittner), and all was well until the late '70s when FM came into fashion. WJTO had a powerful FM (WJTO-FM), which later became WIGY-FM and WKRH-FM; all three incarnations co-owned with WJTO. With listenership drifting to FM, the original AM station was getting less attention, drifting through several ownership changes until both stations went into bankruptcy around 1990. Off the air for 11 months, the FM was finally sold to a Rhode Island broadcaster (which still owns it, with callsign changed to WBCI).
Bob Bittner
Bob Bittner bought WJTO in March 1997, as the fourth station under his ownership. (In 1996-7, he sold two of his other stations, WNEB in Worcester, Massachusetts, and WKBR in Manchester, New Hampshire.) WJTO was a complete purchase: not just the station license, but also the equipment and real estate of , located on an ocean inlet. Later in 2003 and 2004, Bittner made two adjoining land and house purchases, creating a full residence 600' from the station, all situated on in West Bath, Maine. Bittner uses the premises as a summer residence and keeps an extensive music collection for both stations at WJTO. On display at WJTO is much radio memorabilia, including many classic playlists from WABC (AM) during its "MusicRadio 77" days in the 1970s.
With Bittner's purchase in 1997, WJTO switched from talk to beautiful music with moderate results. Slowly, Bittner morphed it to an adult standards station with a lot of '50s/'60s oldies pop mixed in; in recent years, WJTO has had an audience equivalent to the prosperity days of the 1960s and 1970s.
Typical music heard on WJTO (and separately-programmed WJIB) includes a blend of music from 1937 to 1980 (with a few from before and after) not heard anywhere else on the mid- and southern coast of Maine, from Frank Sinatra to Linda Ronstadt. In addition to the hits, Bittner inserts about 4 LP tracks each hour, from same and similar artists. Amazingly, says Bittner, it all flows quite well.
Similar to Bittner's Boston station WJIB, WJTO does not air any commercials, but is big on local public service announcements, including fund-raising spots aimed at keeping the station on the air. WJTO's first fundraising drive in 2008 raised $29,676.11 from 657 different listeners (including a radio fan from Goshen, New York who actually hunted down Bob and the station after hearing it on vacation) over an eleven-week period that summer. Later fund-drives (contributions from listeners) in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were quite successful, thereby solidifying this method of support. Having allegiance to the listeners, as opposed to commercial interests, allows WJTO to have what they call a "pro-people attitude" with public service announcements and editorial opinions rarely heard on other stations
WJTO puts out a 1,000-watt daytime signal and can be heard as far away as Provincetown, Massachusetts and Nova Scotia, with a daytime city-grade signal into Portland. (It also airs at night, but the signal doesn't get far with only six watts.)
Blue Jey Broadcasting has purchased translator W252BT in Freeport to rebroadcast WJTO and it became a licensed facility on May 8, 2013.

Cameraria castaneaeella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from the United States (Connecticut, Kentucky, Ohio, Maine and New York).
The wingspan is 6-7.5 mm.
The larvae feed on Castanea species (including Castanea dentata and Castanea sativa) and Quercus species (including Quercus ilicifolia). They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of an irregular yellowish blotch mine on the upperside of the leaf. The larva hibernates on a slight bed of silk beneath the folded epidermis.

Sky Georgia (Georgian: საერთაშორისო ავიაკომპანია „სქაი ჯორჯია“ - saertašoriso aviaqompania «sqai dzhordzhia») was an airline from Tbilisi, Georgia, operating out of Tbilisi International Airport.
History
The airline was established in 1998 as Air Bisec. In 2004, it was renamed Georgian National Airlines. The current Sky Georgia brand was adopted in 2008, when the company was acquired by US-based Sky Investment Group. In October 2009, the airline ceased all scheduled flights and stated that it would concentrate on cargo rather than on passenger transport. In January 2010, three Ilyushin Il-76 freighter aircraft were leased.
Georgy Kodua was general director and CEO of Sky Georgia.
During 2007, the airline (which was called Georgian National Airlines at that time) had a codeshare agreement with airBaltic on the latter's route from Riga to Tbilisi. In summer 2008, scheduled and charter services were operated from Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi to destinations in Europe and Central Asia. On 9 August 2008, following the outbreak of the 2008 South Ossetia war, Georgian National Airlines was banned from operating into Russia. After the crisis, flights were not resumed.
Destinations
As of January 2011, the official Sky Georgia timetable does not list any scheduled flights.
Former destinations
Sky Georgia used to serve the following scheduled destinations:
Asia
Georgia
Batumi - Batumi International Airport
Tbilisi - Tbilisi International Airport
Europe
Belarus
Minsk - Minsk International Airport
Turkey
Antalya - Antalya Airport
Ukraine
Kyiv - Boryspil International Airport
Fleet

Over the years, the airline operated the following aircraft types:
Tupolev Tu-134B (until 2007)
Bombardier CRJ200 (2007–2008)
Ilyushin Il-76T (from 2010)
McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50

Hadron spectroscopy is the subfield of particle physics that studies the masses and decays of hadrons. Hadron spectroscopy is also an important part of the new nuclear physics. The properties of hadrons are a consequence of a theory called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
QCD predicts that quarks and antiquarks bind into particles called mesons. Another type of hadron is called a baryon, that is made of three quarks. There is good experimental evidence for both mesons and baryons. Potentially QCD also has bound states of just gluons called glueballs. One of the goals of the field of hadronic spectroscopy is to find experimental evidence for exotic mesons, tetraquarks, molecules of hadrons, and glueballs.
An important part of the field of hadronic spectroscopy are the attempts to solve QCD. The properties of hadrons require the solution of QCD in the strong coupling regime, where perturbative techniques based on Feynman diagrams do not work. There are several approaches to trying to solve QCD to compute the masses of hadrons:

The Order of Christian VII, also called "Tessera Concordiæ", was a Danish order of knighthood that flourished for some time during the 18th century. The Danes call it "Christian VIIs Orden" or "Ordenen Tessera Concordiæ".
After the banishment of the adulterous Queen Caroline Mathilde on 17 January 1772 the Royal Danish Court needed a new decoration to replace the Order of Mathilde. King Christian VII of Denmark founded this order on 21 October 1774 as a new decoration that was solely meant for the Danish Royal Family. It was awarded to gentlemen and ladies. The men wore the insignia detached from a ribbon on the left side of the breast. The ladies wore the same insignia on a bow of the same ribbon on their left shoulder.
Painter Jens Juel made a portrait of Danish princess Louise Augusta in 1784, in which she wore the order of her presumed father Christian VII on a blue ribbon with three silver stripes, almost identical to the earlier Danish Ordre de l'Union Parfaite.
After the death of Queen-Dowager Juliana Maria in 1796 the order fell into disuse.

Lift-off oversteer (also known as snap-oversteer, trailing-throttle oversteer, throttle off oversteer, or lift-throttle oversteer) is a form of oversteer in automobiles that occurs while cornering when closing the throttle causes a deceleration, causing the vertical load on the tires to shift from the rear to the front, in a process called load transfer. This decrease in vertical load on the rear tires causes a decrease in the lateral force they generate, so that their lateral acceleration (into the corner) is also decreased. This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn, hence oversteering. In other words, easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction, with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first.
Dynamics
The graphs to the right show the simulated effect of lifting off the throttle in the middle of a left turn. The transients in the first couple of seconds are due to the test, in which a step steer input (wheel angle) is applied at 0 s and held constant throughout. The steady state cornering is at constant speed, with a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g approximately until the throttle is released at 6 s.
The yaw rate plot shows the oversteer due to the rear wheels losing traction - after an uncomfortable jerk at 20 deg/s, the vehicle spins sharply in the direction of the turn. The lateral acceleration also spikes to 0.6 g and levels at about 0.55 g, meaning that the radius decreased (i.e., the turn tightened). The side forces on the outside wheels increase and the inside rear (LR) wheel even lifts off the ground, a common occurrence.
Snap oversteer is induced when the throttle is lifted while midway through a corner (lift-off oversteer), often by inexperienced drivers trying to reduce speed after braking too little.
Moment of inertia
Snap oversteer is most common with mid-mounted engine, rear-wheel drive (MR) vehicles. Mid-mounted engine vehicles have a much lower rotational inertia than vehicles with a front-mounted or rear-mounted engine. The lower rotational inertia of mid-mounted engine vehicles causes the vehicle to spin much faster than a front or rear mounted engine vehicle. If unexpected, it can catch the driver off guard when cornering, ultimately leading to loss of control of the vehicle.
Recovery
As in all situations where the vehicle experiences loss of rear tire traction on the road surface, the proper maneuver to recover is to turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the spin (Countersteering). e.g. If the front of the vehicle is spinning to the left, countersteering to the right will help recover control. More specifically aiming the wheels in the desired direction of travel. In the case of a very violent spin the safest thing to do is turn the wheel so the tires are pointing straight forward with respect to the vehicle. This is often easier to accomplish for inexperienced/panicked drivers.
In popular culture
Lift-off oversteer is often exploited in motorsportparticularly on loose surfaces (e.g. in rallying)as a method of cornering faster as, when controlled, it has the effect of turning the nose into the apex and the car slightly sideways which allows early application of power on exiting the corner. Formula One driver Jim Clark's late-braking technique exploited the lift-off oversteer characteristics of mid-engined race cars to attain higher cornering speeds. It became standard competition driving technique as an enhancement of the four wheel drift technique that preceded it.
On April 10, 2010, Consumer Reports magazine rated the 2010 Lexus GX 460 SUV a "Don't Buy: Safety Risk," as their panel of test engineers determined the vehicle was subject to excessive lift-off oversteer during a standardized evaluation for emergency handling. The test simulates scenarios such as transiting a highway exit ramp while traveling with excessive speed.

HMS Sardonyx was an destroyer that served with the Royal Navy in the Second World War. The S class were a development of the created during the First World War as a cheaper alternative to the . Launched in 1919 soon after the armistice, the ship was commissioned into the Reserve Fleet. Later that year, the destroyer was sent to Latvia, arriving just after the cessation of that country's war of independence. The ship took part in radar trials in 1939, and was upgraded shortly after the start of the Second World War with greater anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities. The destroyer then served as an escort, usually for convoys of merchant ships. The ship was part of the 5th Escort Group which destroyed the German submarines and , although Sardonyx did not claim any hits. The destroyer was also involved in escorting the landing parties for the Normandy landings in 1944. Soon afterwards, the ship was allocated to training. Sardonyx was retired and sold to be broken up in 1945.
Design and development
Sardonyx was one of thirty-three Admiralty destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty during the First World War in June 1917 as part of the Twelfth War Construction Programme. The design was a development of the introduced at the same time as, and as a cheaper and faster alternative to, the . Differences with the R class were minor, such as having the searchlight moved aft and mounting an additional pair of torpedo tubes.
Sardonyx had a overall length of and a length of between perpendiculars. Beam was and mean draught . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three Yarrow boilers fed steam to two sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines rated at and driving two shafts, giving a design speed of at normal loading and at deep load. Two funnels were fitted. A full load of of fuel oil was carried, which gave a design range of at .
Armament consisted of three single QF Mk IV guns on the ship's centreline. One was mounted raised on the forecastle, one on a platform between the funnels and one aft. The ship also mounted a single 2-pounder "pom-pom" anti-aircraft gun for air defence. Four torpedo tubes were carried in two twin rotating mounts aft. Four depth charge chutes were also fitted aft. Typically ten depth charges were carried. The ship was designed to mount two additional torpedo tubes either side of the superstructure but this required the forecastle plating to be cut away, making the vessel very wet, so they were removed. The weight saved enabled the heavier Mark V 21-inch torpedo to be carried. Fire control included a training-only director, single Dumaresq and a Vickers range clock. The ship had a complement of 90 officers and ratings.
Construction and career
Laid down on 25 March 1918 shortly before the end of the First World War by Alexander Stephen and Sons at their dockyard in Linthouse, Glasgow, Sardonyx was launched on 27 May the following year and completed on 12 July. The vessel was the first that served in the Royal Navy to bear the name of the semi-precious stone. Sardonyx was commissioned into the Reserve Fleet.
Interwar service
Although the war on the western front had finished with the signing of the Armistice, the escalating civil war in Russia continued and there was unrest in the Baltic Sea. This reached a peak when the people of Latvia declared independence which, after a war of independence, they achieved on 14 November. Sardonyx was one of the Royal Navy vessels sent to monitor the situation during the following month. The ship returned to the United Kingdom and was reduced to Reserve on 3 March 1920.
In November 1925, Sardonyx took part in search operations to find the missing submarine . M1 had been sunk with all hands in a collision on 12 November, but the submarine's wreck was not found until 1967. On 6 August 1931, Sardonyx was recommissioned at Portsmouth. On 27 January 1932, Sardonyx and sister ship took part in the search for the missing submarine . M2 had sunk the day before. On 17 September 1935, as severe gales struck British waters, the steamer Brompton Manor sent out a distress signal while off the Owers lightvessel, near Selsey Bill. Sardonyx was ordered from Portsmouth to search for the steamer, which was successfully found later that day. Brompton Manors captain had been washed overboard by heavy seas, and the ships cargo shifted, giving a 30 degree list. Sardonyx stood by Brompton Manor until a tug could tow the steamer into Southampton. Sardonyx ran aground off Southsea on 31 January 1938, but was soon refloated, and sustained no damage.
In 1939, trials were undertaken to detect the destroyer with radar. These were sufficiently successful for Sardonyx to be equipped with a L band radar named the Combined Wireless Rangefinder and Lookout Set in June 1939. The trials were a success, with ships identified at and low-flying aircraft at .
Second World War
At the start of the Second World War, Sardonyx was part of the Local Defence Flotilla at Portsmouth. The destroyer was taken out of service and updated for the escort role. The midship and aft gun were removed and a high-angle QF 12-pounder anti-aircraft gun was fitted on a bandstand abaft the middle funnel. Two quadruple Vickers .50 machine guns were also mounted for close-in defence. The torpedo tubes were removed, the space allowing for additional depth charges, and two depth charge throwers were fitted alongside new racks aft. Initially 30 charges were now carried, although this increased as the war progressed. The destroyer reentered service but tragedy soon struck. On 31 May 1940, the destroyer struck and sank the trawler St Apollo off the Hebrides. Soon afterwards, in June, the Type 286M radar was fitted in Londonderry. The antenna proved too heavy for the mast and was lost in a gale, as was the replacement within two months.
For the majority of the war, Sardonyx acted as a convoy escort. When Convoy HX 79 was attacked by the German submarine , which subsequently called a wolfpack of four other boats on 19 October 1940, Sardonyx was one of those sent to protect the convoy. Despite ten Royal Navy warships rushing to the scene, 12 ships in the convoy were sunk. This was the first success for the Wolfpacks. On 27 October, the destroyer was sent to escort the stricken liner , which had been attacked by Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor maritime patrol aircraft. Despite taking evasive manoeuvres, the liner was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine . During the next five months, the destroyer was busy helping 16 convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, OB 236, HX 82, OB 239, HX 86, OB 245, HX 99, OB 256, SL/MKS 58, OB 262, HX 106, OB 269, SC 19, OB 278, SL/MKS 62, OB 283 and SC 69, rarely staying more than one or two days covering the western approaches.
The long term solution was to form Escort Groups with multiple warships. Sardonyx joined the 5th Escort Group which was formed in March 1941. On 15 March, the Group, led by Commander Donald Macintyre, joined Convoy HX 112 as an escort. The convoy had been travelling from Halifax, Nova Scotia, since 1 March. As evening fell, the convoy was attacked by a wolfpack including the submarines , and . Despite losing six merchant ships, the Group successfully destroyed U-99 and U-100 although Sardonyx did not claim any hits. Subsequent operations were more successful. On 16 August, Sardonyx was part of the 8th Escort Group that formed the eastern ocean escort for convoy HX 143. On 4 October, the Group again safely accompanied ON(S) 23 safely across to rendezvous with escorts from the Royal Canadian Navy. On 1 November the Group escorted the 42 ships of ON 30 until being handed to destroyers from the US Navy. The role was reciprocated on 15 November when the Group received HX 160 from a US Navy escort. No merchant ship was lost in any of these operations. In all, the destroyer escorted 21 convoys during 1941.
The following year saw a similar pattern. Between 14 and 16 February, Sardonyx formed part of the 2nd Escort Group that accompanied Convoy ON 66 on the first stage of its journey. Once again, no ships were lost. The destroyer subsequently escorted five UR convoys travelling between Loch Ewe and Reykjavik, six RU convoys travelling back, WS 19W, WS 21S, WS 24, and MKS 3Y sailing from the south, and TA 21, AT 22, TA 22 and HX 206 crossing between Britain and North America.
During this time, the destroyer was upgraded again. The 12-pounder was removed and a Type 271 radar fitted instead while four single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon replaced the Vickers machine guns. Sardonyx reentered service, but the availability of dedicated escorts meant that the ship saw less use. Amongst the crew at the time was the future Admiral of the Fleet Henry Leach, who served as a midshipman before being promoted to sub-lieutenant on 1 October 1942. Another crew member was an American volunteer, Derek Lee, who served as a deck officer with the collateral job of security officer. His role included censoring photographs, for example of the survivors of the merchant ship SS Yorktown that had been sunk by on 26 September 1942, taken as they climbed aboard the destroyer.
The start of 1943 saw a decrease in traffic. Between 21 and 23 January, Sardonyx, along with sister ship took the merchant ship Leinster to Iceland, returning two days later. The same pattern repeated three more times over the next seven months. The last convoy of more than one merchant ship that Sardonyx supported was WS 30, which saw the destroyer for only the first two days of its journey to Freetown. On 8 June 1944, the destroyer escorted the troops that took part in the Normandy landings. Soon after, in October, the ship was withdrawn from operational service and allocated to training at Preston. On 23 June 1945, the ship was retired and handed over to be broken up by Thos. W. Ward at Inverkeithing.

Plexaurella nutans, the giant slit-pore sea rod, is a tall species of soft coral in the family Plexauridae. It is a relatively uncommon species and is found in shallow seas in the Caribbean region.
Description
Plexaurella nutans can grow to a height of over a metre (yard). It has thick cylindrical branches that occasionally fork and which are often slightly clubbed at the tips. These have a diameter of . The polyps are rather large and protrude from round, oval or slit-shaped grooves in the cup-shaped calyces in the coral skeleton. Each of these calyces is on a slight mound giving the coral a dimpled surface. When the polyps are extended, as they usually are, they give the coral a fuzzy appearance. The colour of this coral is usually pale brown, grey or sometimes lavender.
Distribution and habitat
Plexaurella nutans is an uncommon species and occurs at depths down to in the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and Florida. It is usually found on isolated patch reefs or on forereef slopes.
Biology
The polyps of Plexaurella nutans extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton and other small invertebrates floating past. The food gathered is shared with neighbouring polyps via the gastrovascular cavity inside the coral's skeleton. After particles of liver marked with a radioactive tracer were fed experimentally to a single polyp, radioactivity was detected in tissues up to away.
Plexaurella nutans is a zooxanthellate species of coral with large numbers of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium living in its tissues. These are photosynthetic algae that provide nourishment to their host while benefiting from the coral's waste products. It was found experimentally that different species of Symbiodinium were found at different depths in Plexaurella nutans and other corals. If the corals' tissues were cultured in the laboratory, other species again became apparent, the growth of which was favoured by the laboratory environment. These must have been undetected in the tissues previously.

In geometry, a tetrakis hexahedron (also known as a tetrahexahedron, hextetrahedron, tetrakis cube, and kiscube) is a Catalan solid. Its dual is the truncated octahedron, an Archimedean solid.
It also can be called a disdyakis hexahedron or hexakis tetrahedron as the dual of an omnitruncated tetrahedron.
Cartesian coordinates
Cartesian coordinates for the 14 vertices of a tetrakis hexahedron centered at the origin, are the points (±3/2, 0, 0), (0, ±3/2, 0), (0, 0, ±3/2) and (±1, ±1, ±1).
The length of the shorter edges of this tetrakis hexahedron equals 3/2 and that of the longer edges equals 2. The faces are acute isosceles triangles. The larger angle of these equals and the two smaller ones equal .
Orthogonal projections
The tetrakis hexahedron, dual of the truncated octahedron has 3 symmetry positions, two located on vertices and one mid-edge.
Uses
Naturally occurring (crystal) formations of tetrahexahedra are observed in copper and fluorite systems.
Polyhedral dice shaped like the tetrakis hexahedron are occasionally used by gamers.
A 24-cell viewed under a vertex-first perspective projection has a surface topology of a tetrakis hexahedron and the geometric proportions of the rhombic dodecahedron, with the rhombic faces divided into two triangles.
The tetrakis hexahedron appears as one of the simplest examples in building theory. Consider the Riemannian symmetric space associated to the group SL4(R). Its Tits boundary has the structure of a spherical building whose apartments are 2-dimensional spheres. The partition of this sphere into spherical simplices (chambers) can be obtained by taking the radial projection of a tetrakis hexahedron.
Symmetry
With Td, [3,3] (*332) tetrahedral symmetry, the triangular faces represent the 24 fundamental domains of tetrahedral symmetry. This polyhedron can be constructed from 6 great circles on a sphere. It can also be seen by a cube with its square faces triangulated by their vertices and face centers and a tetrahedron with its faces divided by vertices, mid-edges, and a central point.
The edges of the spherical tetrakis hexahedron belong to six great circles, which correspond to mirror planes in tetrahedral symmetry. They can be grouped into three pairs of orthogonal circles (which typically intersect on one coordinate axis each). In the images below these square hosohedra are colored red, green and blue.
Dimensions
If we denote the edge length of the base cube by a, the height of each pyramid summit above the cube is . The inclination of each triangular face of the pyramid versus the cube face is arctan(), approximately 26.565° . One edge of the isosceles triangles has length a, the other two have length , which follows by applying the Pythagorean theorem to height and base length. This yields an altitude of in the triangle (). Its area is , and the internal angles are arccos() (approximately 48.1897°) and the complementary 180° − 2 arccos() (approximately 83.6206°).
The volume of the pyramid is ; so the total volume of the six pyramids and the cube in the hexahedron is .
Kleetope
It can be seen as a cube with square pyramids covering each square face; that is, it is the Kleetope of the cube.
Cubic pyramid
It is very similar to the 3D net for a 4D cubic pyramid, as the net for a square based is a square with triangles attached to each edge, the net for a cubic pyramid is a cube with square pyramids attached to each face.
Related polyhedra and tilings
It is a polyhedron in a sequence defined by the face configuration V4.6.2n. This group is special for having all even number of edges per vertex and form bisecting planes through the polyhedra and infinite lines in the plane, and continuing into the hyperbolic plane for any n ≥ 7.
With an even number of faces at every vertex, these polyhedra and tilings can be shown by alternating two colors so all adjacent faces have different colors.
Each face on these domains also corresponds to the fundamental domain of a symmetry group with order 2,3,n mirrors at each triangle face vertex.

CryptoKitties is a blockchain game on Ethereum developed by Canadian studio Dapper Labs that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell virtual cats. It is one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain technology for recreation and leisure. The game's popularity in December 2017 congested the Ethereum network, causing it to reach an all-time high in the number of transactions and slowing it down significantly.
Gameplay
Players purchase, breed and trade virtual cats that have different visual features of varying levels of rarity. Players must purchase Ether cryptocurrency to join the game, and spend it to perform each breeding and trade action within the game.
The virtual cats are breedable and carry a unique number and 256 bit distinct genome with DNA and different attributes (cattributes) that can be passed to offspring. Several traits can be passed down from the parents to the offspring. There are a total of 12 'cattributes' for any cat, including pattern, mouth shape, fur, eye shape, base color, accent color, highlight color, eye color, and optional wild, environment, 'purrstige' and 'secret'. Other features like cool downtimes are not passed down but are instead a function of the 'generation' of the offspring, which is one more than the 'generation' of the highest 'generation' attribute.
A CryptoKitty does not have a permanently assigned gender. While they can only engage in one breeding session at one time, each cat is able to act as either matron or sire. There is a 'cooldown' time that indicates how soon the cat can breed again, which goes up with the number of breeds, capped at one week.
The virtual cats are static images that can only be purchased, bred and sold. The game has no goal.
Background
CryptoKitties operates on Ethereum's underlying blockchain network. Each CryptoKitty is a non-fungible token (NFT). Each is unique and owned by the user, validated through the blockchain, and its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties cannot be replicated and cannot be transferred without the user's permission even by the game developers. Users can interact with their CryptoKitties, having the ability to buy, sell, and sire (breed) them. However, the CryptoKitty art is not on the blockchain and is instead owned by Axiom Zen. The company released some of the art under a new 'Nifty' license that lets players use the image of their CryptoKitty in a limited way.
A test version of CryptoKitties was unveiled at ETH Waterloo on October 19, 2017, an Ethereum hackathon. As of December 2, 2017, Genesis, the first high selling cat was sold for ETH246.9255 (~US$117,712) on that day.
On March 20, 2018, it was announced that CryptoKitties would be spun off into its own company, Dapper Labs, and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors. The investment round was led by New York based Union Square Ventures and San Francisco based Andreessen Horowitz.
On May 12, 2018, a CryptoKitty was sold for $140,000. In May 2018, CryptoKitties launched their first celebrity-branded CryptoKitty with Stephen Curry, an American professional basketball player. As part of the partnership, Curry was given three CryptoKitties with special imagery, the first of which he put up for auction. The company later suspended the auction, claiming that Stephen Curry was not as involved as they initially thought. The company was later sued for trade secret theft over the Stephen Curry collectibles. The court ruled in the company's favour, stating that "[t]he evidence demonstrates that Defendant, not Plaintiff, developed the idea to license digital collectibles using the likeness of celebrities first…".
In October 2018, CryptoKitties reached the milestone of 1 million cats being bred with a volume of 3.2 million transactions on its smart contracts. In November 2018, Dapper Labs, which was spun out of Axiom Zen as the developer of CryptoKitties, raised an additional $15 million in a venture round led by Venrock. The company doubled its valuation in this round.
In 2018, CryptoKitties was used by the German museum ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe to showcase blockchain technology.
Technology
A CryptoKitty's ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Each CryptoKitty is represented as a non-fungible token using the ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum. Generation 0 CryptoKitties were sold to players in an auction at the rate of one every 15 minutes (672 per week) for one year. New CryptoKitties are created by breeding existing CryptoKitties.
Based on the limited number of cats going into circulation and their limited genomes, there is a limit of around 4 billion total cats that can be bred. Each cat has a distinct visual appearance ("phenotype") determined by its immutable genes ("genotype") stored in the smart contract. Because cats are tokens on a blockchain, they can be bought, sold, or transferred digitally, with strong guarantees of ownership.
Axiom Zen developed the game. Until November 2018, Axiom Zen intended to continually release a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes, with the rest of supply determined by breeding of CryptoKitties. CryptoKitty owners may put them up for sale via an auction for a price set in Ether (ETH). They could also put them up for sire, where another player can pay to breed with a specific CryptoKitty.
Reception
Shortly after launch, there were concerns that CryptoKitties was crowding out other businesses that use the Ethereum platform. The game caused an increase in pending transactions on Ethereum, and at one point accounted for about 25% of network traffic on Ethereum. Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to CryptoKitties, which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second. A variety of similar websites such as Etheremon, Ethertulips, and CryptoBots, were also created. Marketplace sites such as OpenSea and RareBits were created as a response. In March 2021 CryptoKitties announced plans to switch to the Flow blockchain in the "near future".

Ike Yard is an experimental band founded in 1980 in New York and consisting of members Stuart Argabright (vocals), Kenny Compton (bass), Fred Szymanski (synthesizers/ programming) and Michael Diekmann (guitar). Formed in the later days of New York's no wave scene, they recorded for labels like Disques du Crépuscule and Factory in the early 1980s, and were the first American band to be signed to the latter UK label. Initially drawing on early krautrock and dub-influenced post-punk, their work increasingly incorporated drum machines and analog electronics. After releasing their 1982 debut album, Ike Yard dissolved at the beginning of 1983. Argabright later recorded as Dominatrix.
After Acute Records released the well-received career anthology Ike Yard: 1980–82 Collected, the band reformed as a three-piece unit with original members Stuart Argabright, Kenneth Compton and Michael Diekmann in 2007, only a year after Acute records released a well-received career anthology titled Ike Yard: 1980–82 Collected. After a hiatus of roughly 28 years, Danish/Swedish imprint Phisteria released Öst, a limited edition 10-inch, which was followed by their latest full-length, Nord, Phisteria licensing the album to Desire Records for worldwide distribution.

Organized in 1786 as The Stoughton Musical Society, it is America's oldest performing musical organization. For over two centuries it has had many distinguished accomplishments. In 1908, when incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the name was changed to Old Stoughton Musical Society and it has retained that designation.
Early years
From the inspiration of a singing school given in Stoughton in 1774 by Boston composer, William Billings, a group of male singers in town decided to form a singing society. There were 25 names and all of them listed in the membership journal with the date of organization being November 7, 1786. Their first President was Elijah Dunbar, 1740–1814, from Canton. He was also their conductor and a singer. The first music collection the musical society purchased was The Worcester Collection of Sacred Harmony compiled by Isaiah Thomas in 1786, which contained the first American printing of the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah.
Singing contest
According to the musical society's 1929 history book, the Stoughton singers met a chorus from the nearby First Parish Church in Dorchester about the year 1790. This is believed to be the first singing contest held in America. The Dorchester chorus consisting of men and women were accompanied by a bass viol, the Stoughton Musical Society had twenty selected male voices and sang without accompaniment. The Stoughton singers first performed Jacob French's anthem, The Heavenly Vision, which they performed from memory. Next, the Dorchester chorus performed an unidentified piece. Then the Stoughton singers performed Handel's majestic Hallelujah Chorus from his oratorio, Messiah, from memory and without any instrumental accompaniment. Following that performance, the Dorchester chorus acknowledged defeat and the Stoughton singers won the contest.
.
Centennial celebration
On June 9, 1886, the Stoughton Musical Society celebrated its centennial with a full day of activities including a special dinner and an evening concert attended by both Governor George D. Robinson and Lieutenant Governor Oliver Ames. Gov. Robinson spoke glowingly about this centennial concert, ending with these remarks: "Let me commend, so far as my opinion can possibly extend, the fine production of this evening. It has afforded me real delight." The featured work for the concert was Haydn's oratorio, The Creation, for soloists, chorus and orchestra.
World's fair concerts
One of their greatest achievements took place at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The Stoughton Musical Society's 100 musicians performed two concerts in the Music Hall. Both the singers and orchestra wore Colonial costumes. At the first concert on August 14, there were 2,000 people in attendance, more than had attended the symphony concerts conducted by Theodore Thomas. The music performed by the musical society consisted of 24 pieces by such 18th century New England composers as: William Billings, Oliver Holden, Jacob French, and Daniel Read. Some of these composers were later recorded by the Stoughton Musical Society on their LP album in 1975 titled "An Appeal to Heaven."
Bicentennial celebration
The Old Stoughton Musical Society celebrated with a concert again featuring Haydn's Creation. The concert was held on November 7, 1986, exactly two hundred years after its founding date. Letters of congratulation were received from President Ronald Reagan, a Proclamation naming the concert date as "Old Stoughton Musical Society Day" in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, signed by Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and an entry in the Congressional Record by Congressperson Joe Moakley of Massachusetts. A commemorative program was published which included "Notes from the Past", pictures of the chorus, and a hymn written by Bicentennial Chairman Roger L. Hall.<ref>Old Stoughton Musical Society 200th Anniversary Concert, Haydn's THE CREATION, Friday, November 7, 1986</ref>

In enzymology, a hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the epoxyalcohol metabolites arachidonic acid, hepoxilin A3 and hepoxilin B3 to their tri-hydroxyl products, trioxolin A3 and trioxilin B3, respectively. These reactions in general inactivate the two biologically active hepoxilins.
Enzyme activity
Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase converts the epoxide residue in hepoxilins A3 and B3 to Vicinal (chemistry) diols as exemplified in the following enzyme reaction for the metabolism of hepoxilin A3 to trioxilin A3:
8-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid + H2O 8,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid
The substrates of this enzyme are 8-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid, i.e. hepoxilin A3 and H2O, whereas its product is 8,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid, i.e. the triol, trioxilin A3.
Epoxide hydrolases
Epoxide hydrolases represent a group of enzymes that convert various types of epoxides to vicinal diols. Several members of this group have this metabolic activity on fatty acid epoxides including microsomal epoxide hydrolase (i.e. epoxide hydrolase 1 or EH1), soluble epoxide hydrolase (i.e. epoxide hydrolase 2 or EH2), epoxide hydrolase 3 (EH3), epoxide hydrolase 4 (EH4), and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (see epoxide hydrolase). The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11R,12S)-11,12-epoxy-8-hydroxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoat e hydrolase. Other names in common use include hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase, hepoxylin hydrolase, and hepoxilin A3 hydrolase. Since the hepoxilins are metabolites of arachidonic acid, hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase participates in arachidonic acid metabolism.
Identity of hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase
Studies have shown that soluble epoxide hydrolase (i.e. epoxide hydrolase 2 or EH2) readily metabolizes a) hepoxilin A3 (8-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxilin A3 (8,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) and b) hepoxilin B3 (10-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxlin B3 (10,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (i.e. epoxide hydrolase 2 or EH2) sEH also appears to be the hepoxilin hydrolase that is responsible for inactivating the epoxyalcohol metabolites of arachidonic acid, hepoxilin A3 and hepoxiin B3. Soluble epoxide hydrolase is widely expressed in a diversity of human and other mammal tissues and therefore appears to be the hepoxilin hydrolase responsible for inactivating hepoxilin A3 and B3 (see soluble epoxide hydrolase#Function and epoxide hydrolase#Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase). The ability of EH1, EH3, EH4, and leukotriene A4 hydrolase to metabolize hepoxilins to trioxilins has not yet been reported.
Function
Hepoxilins possess several activities (see hepoxilin#Physiological effects) whereas their trioxilin products are generally considered to be inactive. Accordingly, the soluble epoxide hydrolase metabolic pathway is considered to function in vivo to inactivate or limit the activity of the hepoxilins. The other fatty acid epoxide hydrolases cited in the Epoxide hydrolases section (above) have not been reported for hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase activity, could possibly exhibit this, and therefore contribute to inactivating the hepoxilins.

The National Weather Service Burlington, Vermont is a local office of the National Weather Service located at Burlington International Airport (BTV) in South Burlington, VT that is responsible for monitoring weather conditions in extreme northern New York State and the northern two-thirds of Vermont.
History
A chemistry and natural history professor, Mr. Zadock Thompson, began weather observation in the Burlington in 1829 on the campus of the University of Vermont. Records of from the first year have been lost and only a summary exist for those of 1830 and 1831. Detailed observations, but not continuous, are only available since beginning in January 1832. Mr. Thompson became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution's volunteer observer program in August 1853 and was replaced after is death in 1856 by another professor until 1864. On May 24, 1871, the U.S. Army Signal Service established a weather bureau in Downtown Burlington. In 1890, the U. S. Weather Bureau was established. The Burlington Office was officially established on March 29, 1906, at 601 Main Street in a building of its own.
Burlington Municipal Airport opened a weather station on February 4, 1934, but all reports were sent from the City Office. On March 1, 1939, the first telegraph reports directly from the airport location began. On June 4, 1943, the U.S. Weather Bureau consolidated the two observing sites at the airport location, closing the City Office. The Weather Bureau moved to the new building on February 15, 1950, some 0.3 miles north from the previous location. The office and instruments remained in this location until July 19, 1973, when it moved to its present location in the Burlington International Airport.

"Wild Honey" is a song by the rock band U2. It is the seventh track on their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind. The song was played eleven times during the Elevation Tour.
Writing and recording
"Wild Honey" runs for 3:47 and is played in common time at a tempo of 125 beats per minute.
According to guitarist The Edge, "Wild Honey" broke up the album before the next track "Peace on Earth", and its placement in the running order was a misjudgement. The guitarist compared the song with The Beatles' "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da".
There was a lot of debate about whether or not "Wild Honey" should be included on All That You Can't Leave Behind, because the fun and the frivolity of the song was not something U2 are noted for. But producer Brian Eno loved it and thought it was like a Van Morrison song, and lead singer Bono wanted it on the album, saying, "it was playful and broke the mood. Call it a sorbet between courses." Brian Hiatt of MTV considered Bono's vocals on the track to be "hoarse, gritty and soulful".
"It's one of the oddest moments on the record...It was never monkeyed with," said producer Daniel Lanois.
"Wild Honey" was not the kind of song that drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. enjoyed. Despite being a playful side to U2 people rarely get to see, Mullen said, "it wasn't one of my favourites."
The song is featured in the 2001 film Vanilla Sky.

Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is one of the famous tourist sites in India. The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai.
Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva. The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.
Etymology
The earliest mention of the city is found in the 1st century work called Periplus of the Erythraean Sea by an unknown Greek navigator. Ptolemy, the Greek geographer refers this place as Malange. Mahabalipuram is also known by other names such as Mamallapattana and Mamallapuram. The term Mamallapuram means the city of Mamalla, the other name of the famous Pallava Emperor Narasimhavarman I (630-670 CE) who built the famous temples in the city. Thirumangai Alvar, the famous Vaishnavite saint mentions this place as Thirukadalmallai, referring to the Sthalasayana Perumal Temple. Another name by which Mahabalipuram has been known to mariners, at least since Marco Polo's time is "Seven Pagodas" alluding to the Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram that stood on the shore, of which one, the Shore Temple, survives.
History
Neolithic burial urn, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the 1st century BCE have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppadai relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at Kanchipuram of the Tondai Nadu port Nirppeyyaru which scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of Theodosius I in the 4th century CE have been found at Mahabalipuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two Pallava coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mahabalipuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mahabalipuram from Kanchipuram; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch trade and diplomatic missions to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. An 8th-century Tamil text written by Thirumangai Alvar described this place as Sea Mountain 'where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps'.
The temples of Mahabalipuram, portraying events described in the Mahabharata, were built largely during the reigns of King Narasimhavarman and his successor Rajasimhavarman and show the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mahabalipuram was founded by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century CE. The mandapa or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple chariots are hewn from the granite rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mahabalipuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many reliefs, including one long and high, carved out of granite. In 1957 the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture was established to promote and revive the art of making sculptures and temples.
Transport
MTC and TNSTC (Villupuram division) operate bus services between Mamallapuram/Mahabalipuram and Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Thiruttani etc. MTC's bus services available from various parts of the Chennai include Deluxe and Air-conditioned buses. Mahabalipuram is located at the distance of 56 km from Chennai.

Landmarks
The town has a collection of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu religious monuments that has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, about south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.
The site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples, including Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance – one of the largest open-air rock relief in the world. The site includes several categories of monuments: ratha temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas with halls and stone roofs with narratives from the Mahabharata, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs of Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; stone cut temples particularly those dedicated to Shiva that also reverentially display Vishnu and others, built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations with inscriptions some dated to 6th century and earlier. The cave temples and monolithic temples were built during the Pallava Period. The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.
Some important structures include:
Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance – a giant open-air rock relief.
Pancha Rathas (Five Chariots) – five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas (Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishtra, Nakula and Sahadeva) and Draupadi. Each of these is carved from one single separate large piece of stone.
Cave Temples – over ten rock-cut temples dating back to the 7th century. These include the Varaha, Adi Varaha, Krishna, Mahishasuramardini (Durga), Ramanuja, Dharmaraja, Koneri, Kotikal, Panchapandava and others.
The Shore Temple – a structural temple along the Bay of Bengal with the entrance from the western side away from the sea. Recent excavations have revealed new structures here.
Other structural temples including the Olakkanesvara temple and the lighthouse, along with rock-cut features such as the Draupadi's tank and Krishna's butterball.
Thirukadalmallai, the temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

Prestwich Cricket, Tennis & Bowling Club, commonly known as PCTBC or Prestwich Cricket Club, is an English multi-sports club from the town of Prestwich, in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, England.
With over 500 members, the club has four official sporting sections fielding amateur teams in cricket, tennis, crown green bowling and association football. Boasting a large social membership section, the club also has teams playing a variety of other sports including cribbage, darts, dominoes, five-a-side football and netball.
The club was the first multi-sports club in the UK to achieve Clubmark or equivalent accreditation's in all its official sporting sections. Then in 2010, the club underwent a major redevelopment which included the addition of a new changing facility, the refurbishment of the existing clubhouse and new floodlit tennis courts. As a result, PCTBC was then chosen as the showcase club for the inaugural NatWest ECB CricketForce Fundraiser weekend.
History
Locations
Founded in 1840, the club ranks amongst the oldest in the Manchester area and had its first ground at Thatch Leach Lane in Whitefield. In 1850 the club moved the short distance to Diggle Hills until 1862 when Manchester Corporation acquired the cricket pitch so that a new reservoir could be built. Next in the order was Stack Meadow (where Highfield Road is now located) which was to remain the club's home until notice was served to leave the ground in 1903. A year later, Prestwich Cricket and Tennis Club as it was then called, moved to its current location at Heys Road.
Sections
The club started as solely a cricket club up until tennis was introduced in 1891 (competitive fixtures commencing in 1893). Crown green bowls was included in 1914 with the most recent addition of an official sporting section being that of football in 2009.
Prestwich Cricket Club
Responsible for over 170 years of cricket in the town, Prestwich has played in numerous leagues and competitions right up to the formation of the Lancashire County League after the demise of the Lancashire and Cheshire League in 1994. The last decade has brought the club's most successful period in their entire history with three First Division Championship titles, three Walkden cups, three Division Two Championships, six Hulme Trophy cups and four T. Saville Whittle successes. This haul included an unprecedented Lancashire County League 'quadruple' in 2007 where the first and second teams both won their league and cup competitions. The current first team, captained by Steven Lorenzini, are reigning First Division champions.
The club also has a third team competing in the North Manchester Cricket League as well as a thriving junior section playing competitive cricket at a number of age groups.
Prestwich Tennis Club
With six floodlit all-weather tennis courts, Prestwich Tennis club attracts players of all ages all year round for competitive and social tennis. Summer and winter leagues and competitions cater for both doubles and singles players while the club's resident LTA coach hosts numerous events and training camps for both junior members and children from around the local area.
The tennis section was also the first traditional tennis club to achieve their Clubmark accreditation.
Prestwich Bowling Club
A popular destination around the local leagues, Prestwich Bowling Club members compete in numerous senior and veteran competitions throughout the summer months. Also well received are the various annual social events and tournaments held at the club. The Bowling section achieved its Clubmark accreditation in 2010 from Greater Sport.
Prestwich Football Club
While a number of teams have played under the club's banner over the years, the current football section was started in 2005 by Alan Michaelovitz and Peter Lorenzini under the name Prestwich CC Football Club playing in the Bury & District Sunday League. In 2009, the club dropped the 'CC' from its name and expanded to include open age Saturday teams in the Lancashire Amateur League and as well as junior teams competing in numerous local leagues. The club gained Charter Standard status through the Lancashire FA in January 2010. As of the 2011/12 season, the First Team play in the Premier Division, the Reserve Team in Division Four and the A Team in Division Five. The Sunday Team is in their respective Premier Division also.

Benjamin Elliott Turner (born 28 May 1999) is a British cyclist, who currently ride for UCI WorldTeam .
Career
In 2021, Turner competed in cyclo-cross and road racing for UCI team .
2022 Ineos Grenadiers
On 2 November 2021, it was announced Turner had signed for UCI WorldTeam on a two year contract. His first race with the team was the Vuelta a Andalucía his role was being a Domestique for Carlos Rodríguez who ended up finishing fourth overall. In stage 3, Turner finished fourth after leading out teammate Magnus Sheffield to victory.
His next set of races were the Cobbled classics where one again he was in a domestique role. In the Grand Prix de Denain Turner was part of a five-man breakaway with teammates Jhonatan Narváez and Sheffield who attacked with 30km to go but sadly were caught by the peloton with 2km to go, with Turner finishing in 41st position. Gent–Wevelgem was the next race where Turner showed his good form. He managed 28th which was the best placed from his team after spending the day working for Dylan van Baarle who finished in 41st, 17 seconds behind Turner. Turner made the decisive 11-man group with leader Tom Pidcock also there. His work as a domestique chasing down attacks helped Pidcock finish in 3rd position and Turner was able to hold on to finish in 8th, his first top 10 One-day result. Another strong performance by Turner, at the Brabantse Pijl, after working once again as a domestique this time for Sheffield he crossed the line in 4th out sprinting teammate Pidcock and his other 5 breakaway companions.
35km into Paris–Roubaix the bunch was met with cross-winds so Turner went to the front with his Ineos squad and begin to increase the pace, this caused a split with many favourites missing out. By 67km to go the race was mostly together again except for a few riders out in front. came to the front to drive the pace in doing so caused a split which Turner and teammate van Baarle were a part of. Turner unfortunately crashed on a cobble sector and lost contact with the front bunch. He did manage to keep riding finishing in 11th 4' 30" down on winner Dylan van Baarle.

In knot theory, a torus knot is a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R3. Similarly, a torus link is a link which lies on the surface of a torus in the same way. Each torus knot is specified by a pair of coprime integers p and q. A torus link arises if p and q are not coprime (in which case the number of components is gcd(p, q)). A torus knot is trivial (equivalent to to unknot) if and only if either p or q is equal to 1 or −1. The simplest nontrivial example is the (2,3)-torus knot, also known as the trefoil knot.
Geometrical representation
A torus knot can be rendered geometrically in multiple ways which are topologically equivalent (see Properties below) but geometrically distinct. The convention used in this article and its figures is the following.
The (p,q)-torus knot winds q times around a circle in the interior of the torus, and p times around its axis of rotational symmetry.. If p and q are not relatively prime, then we have a torus link with more than one component.
The direction in which the strands of the knot wrap around the torus is also subject to differing conventions. The most common is to have the strands form a right-handed screw for p q > 0.
The (p,q)-torus knot can be given by the parametrization
where and . This lies on the surface of the torus given by (in cylindrical coordinates).
Other parameterizations are also possible, because knots are defined up to continuous deformation. The illustrations for the (2,3)- and (3,8)-torus knots can be obtained by taking , and in the case of the (2,3)-torus knot by furthermore subtracting respectively and from the above parameterizations of x and y. The latter generalizes smoothly to any coprime p,q satisfying .
Properties
A torus knot is trivial iff either p or q is equal to 1 or −1.
Each nontrivial torus knot is prime and chiral.
The (p,q) torus knot is equivalent to the (q,p) torus knot. This can be proved by moving the strands on the surface of the torus. The (p,−q) torus knot is the obverse (mirror image) of the (p,q) torus knot. The (−p,−q) torus knot is equivalent to the (p,q) torus knot except for the reversed orientation.
Any (p,q)-torus knot can be made from a closed braid with p strands. The appropriate braid word is
(This formula assumes the common convention that braid generators are right twists, which is not followed by the Wikipedia page on braids.)
The crossing number of a (p,q) torus knot with p,q > 0 is given by
c = min((p−1)q, (q−1)p).
The genus of a torus knot with p,q > 0 is
The Alexander polynomial of a torus knot is
where
The Jones polynomial of a (right-handed) torus knot is given by
The complement of a torus knot in the 3-sphere is a Seifert-fibered manifold, fibred over the disc with two singular fibres.
Let Y be the p-fold dunce cap with a disk removed from the interior, Z be the q-fold dunce cap with a disk removed its interior, and X be the quotient space obtained by identifying Y and Z along their boundary circle. The knot complement of the (p, q) -torus knot deformation retracts to the SpaceX. Therefore, the knot group of a torus knot has the presentation
Torus knots are the only knots whose knot groups have nontrivial center (which is infinite cyclic, generated by the element in the presentation above).
The stretch factor of the (p,q) torus knot, as a curve in Euclidean space, is Ω(min(p,q)), so torus knots have unbounded stretch factors. Undergraduate researcher John Pardon won the 2012 Morgan Prize for his research proving this result, which solved a problem originally posed by Mikhail Gromov.
Connection to complex hypersurfaces
The (p,q)−torus knots arise when considering the link of an isolated complex hypersurface singularity. One intersects the complex hypersurface with a hypersphere, centred at the isolated singular point, and with sufficiently small radius so that it does not enclose, nor encounter, any other singular points. The intersection gives a submanifold of the hypersphere.
Let p and q be coprime integers, greater than or equal to two. Consider the holomorphic function given by Let be the set of such that Given a real number we define the real three-sphere as given by The function has an isolated critical point at since if and only if Thus, we consider the structure of close to In order to do this, we consider the intersection This intersection is the so-called link of the singularity The link of , where p and q are coprime, and both greater than or equal to two, is exactly the (p,q)−torus knot.

g-torus knot
A g-torus knot is a closed curve drawn on a g-torus. More technically, it is the homeomorphic image of a circle in S³ which can be realized as a subset of a genus g handlebody in S³ (whose complement is also a genus g handlebody). If a link is a subset of a genus two handlebody, it is a double torus link.
For genus two, the simplest example of a double torus knot that is not a torus knot is the figure-eight knot.

The Schauinsland (literally "look-into-the-country"; near Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany) is a mountain in the Black Forest with an elevation of 1,284 m (4,213 ft) above sea level. It is a popular destination for day trips. Due to the high amount of silver mining, it was previously known as "Erzkasten" (literally "ore box"); the name "Schouwesland" first appeared in 1347. The mountain is located roughly ten kilometres (6 miles) south-east of Freiburg's city centre.
Geography
The summit of the Schauinsland is located in the district of Freiburg. The mountain is surrounded by towns such as Oberried, Munstertal, Bollschweil, and Horben (clockwise). The closest village to the summit is Hofsgrund. In Autumn especially, during a temperature inversion, there is a clear view of the Vosges mountains from the top of the Schauinsland. Under appropriate weather conditions there is a view of a large portion of the Swiss Alps.
Since 2003, the Holzschlägermatte on the Schauinsland has been home to a number of very controversial wind turbines. Due to conservation issues (the summit of the Schauinsland is part of a nature reserve), they were constructed at an elevation of roughly 1,000 metres (3000') above sea level instead of on the summit. Therefore, the view to and from the summit is only slightly restricted. During the lawsuit against the operating company, the Freiburg-based artist Richard Schindler wrote an expert report which is considered the first of its kind.
History
Mining
For over 700 years, silver, lead and zinc were mined from the Schauinsland. In the Middle Ages, mining was very productive, so much so that in the 14th century a number of contractors of the Dieselmuot mine could afford to donate glass windows to the Freiburg Minster. The miners lived right next to the mines on the Schauinsland in two settlements, which were abandoned during the 16th century. The silver obtained was traded and used for minting coins. The mining tunnels are spread over 22 levels and amount to a total of about 100 kilometers (60 miles). At the beginning of the 20th century, about 250 miners were employed in the Schauinsland mines. Production ceased in 1954 due to the mine not yielding enough economy.
Kapplerstollen
There is a tunnel, the so-called Kapplerstollen, which connects the villages Kappel and Hofsgrund. It is also referred to as "midwife's tunnel" due to the fact that around the end of the 19th century midwives, as well as the children of Kappel, used it as a shortcut to Hofsgrund.
The tunnel still exists, however, its entries are no longer accessible.
Since 1975, the Barbarastollen, a reconstructed part of the mine, has been used by the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Emergency Aid as a storage facility for Germany's archived materials. The tunnel is Europe's largest long-term archive.
Mining museum
The research team Steiber, founded in 1976, cleared and surveyed several old parts of the mine. A part of an old ore mine has been transformed into a museum that has been open to the public since 1997. On tours, visitors are shown a wide range of medieval tunnels and shafts from the final stages of when the mine was in operation.
Schauinsland Race
Between 1923 and 1984, a legendary hillclimb race called the "ADAC Schauinsland-Rennen" took place on the Schauinslandstraße. The 12 km (7 mile) long route winds its way up public roads from Horben over the Holzschlägermatte to the cable car station at the top of the mountain. Since 2000, this traditional motorsport event has taken place on a shortened route up to the Holzschägermatte, but only as a parade for classic cars. Since 1984, the Schauinslandstraße has been shut for motorcyclists between 1 April and 1 November, as well as at weekends and on public holidays.
Schauinslandkönig (Schauinsland King)
Since 2007, there has been a hillclimb event on the L-124- "race course" from Horben to the chairlift station. It attracts over 1,000 participants a year, including racing cyclists, but also bikes with the capacity to tow children, tandem bikes, unicyclists, handicapped riders, inline skaters and roller skiers. They climb the so-called Schauinslandkönig (Schauinsland King) which is a distance of 11.5 km (7¼ miles) with a 770 metre (2500') climb.
Berghaus (Mountain House)
In 1936, a hotel with 26 rooms and 74 beds was built on the mountain. This was used by the French Commandant from the end of the war to 1952. In 1958, it was used as a children's recreation centre and later as a hall of residence building for the town of Pforzheim. In 1989, it was used by the town of Freiburg as a home for refugees up until 1992 when it was used as a student hall of residence. A doctor from the Groddeck Hospital then tried to convert the building into a 48-bed rehabilitation centre, but this failed due to changes in health legislation and lack of credit. This led to its bankruptcy in late 2000. The building was empty from 2001 and the new doors and windows were vandalised. In 2011, the Berghaus was acquired by three couples from Freiburg, who wanted to convert the building into a conference centre and holiday home in the spring of 2015. They were supported in this endeavour by members of the Service Civil International. However, the project did not find enough support and the house is now due to be sold again.

In 1869, the stage manager of the municipal theater in Freiburg built and ran a cottage to the south-west of the peak. After various changes, the guest house "Zur Friedrichsruhe" emerged, also known as "Berghotel Schauinsland" (mountain hotel Schauinsland). After a fire in 1926, the house was reconstructed to its current form. From 1936 to 1982, Heinrich Sauerer ran the mountain hotel together with his family. Afterwards, the workers' welfare union ran the guesthouse as a conference and meeting place for groups for thirteen years. As of 2006, the house, including 50 beds, can be fully rented. It is also the location of a detective novel.
Protected areas
As of 12 December 2002, the Schauinsland's summit and the surrounding areas are protected by the regional council as a nature reserve (NSG number 3.264) within the natural environment of the High Black Forest. It encompasses an area of almost 1,054 ha (2605 acres), whereby 329.7 ha (815 acres) are part of Freiburg im Breisgau and 724.2 ha (1790 acres) are part of the rural district Breisgau-High Black Forest. It is classified in the fourth IUCN category. The CDDA code is 319058. The nature reserve is supplemented by a conservation area of the same name, which has also been documented in the bylaw of December 2002. It incorporates the "Freiburger Bergwald" at the north-west slope of the Schauinsland, the "Kappler Tal" with a small and a big valley at the district of Kappel, the countryside south-west of "Brugge" and west of the L126 between "Kirchzarten-Bruckmühle" and the "Hohen Brücke" by St. Wilhelm, the countryside south-west of the "Trubelmattkopf" to the "Widener Eck" and east of the "Stampfbachtal" from "Oberneuhof" to "Spielweg" at the district of "Obermünstertal", as well as the meadows at the "Kohlerhöfen" in the district of "Ehrenstetten" within the nature reserve. Altogether, the landscape conservation area spans 5,484 ha (13552 acres), of which 1,741 ha (4302 acres) can be attributed to the urban district of Freiburg (under the number 3.11.008) and 3,743 ha (9250 acres) can be attributed to the rural district Breisgau-High Black Forest (under the number 3.15.032).
Points of interest
Fallerhäusle
The Fallerhäusle is a miner's house which is located about a kilometer (3000') below the visitors' entrance to the mine. It is a smaller version of the Schauinslandhaus. In the middle of the 18th century, there was great disagreement between the Hofsgrunder farmers and the mine owners concerning this miner's house. The mine owners had hired mountain experts/miners from Tyrol without taking care of housing possibilities for the men. Because of this, the Tyroleans were allowed to build their own small houses on the dumps and pits.
Wind beeches
Due to its exposed location on the "Rheinebene" which the Schauinsland rises from, there is a lot of strong wind, mainly from the west. Over the course of many decades, this has led to unusual forms of the red beech trees growing there.
Schniederlihof
Above "Hofsgrund" you can visit the Schniederlihof, a Black Forest farm house which was built in 1593. Schnieder is the Allemanic form of the name Schneider. Since the man was not a giant, Schneider became Schniederli (diminutive form). Until 1966, the farm was still managed and since 1972 it has been a local museum and can be visited from May to October. The farm is located at 1050 meters (3445') above sea level and can be reached on foot from the Hofsgrund church in 30 minutes.
Schauinslandbahn
From Freiburg (valley station Horben), the Schauinsland can be reached by Germany's longest cable car. The so-called Schauinslandbahn ascends a height of 746 metres (2448') and has a length of 3600 metres (2¼ miles). The 37 cabins can transport up to 700 people per hour, which is about 240,000 passengers per year. The Schauinslandbahn came into operation in 1930 as the world's first cable railway according to the circulation principle.
The lower station of the Schauinslandbahn can be reached by bus route 21 from the terminus of Freiburg city tram route 2 at Günterstal. All three lines are operated by VAG Freiburg, the city transport operator for Freiburg.
During the winter time, every couple of years, the Schauinsland cable car can be used as a ski lift when ideal snow conditions permit. About 300 metres (yards) from the carpark "Rotlache" and under the mountain station, the "cold water run" begins. Known as the "wild run", it is highly treacherous, being over 8 km (5 miles) away from the valley station, thus making it the longest ski-run in the Black Forest.
Schauinsland Tower
Built in 1981, and named after the former Mayor of Freiburg Eugen Keidel, the lookout built on the summit of the Schauinsland is the start of many hiking routes within the local mountainous region. From the viewing platform, roughly 20 metres (65') high, Mont Blanc can also be seen, which is not possible at the base of the tower due to the ski resort "Haldenköpfle" just in front.
The "Engländerdenkmal" (Englishmen Memorial)
On 17 April 1936, a group of English students from the Strand School, along with their teacher Kenneth Keast, hiked up Schauinsland, attempting to reach Todtnauberg, a challenging hike even in favourable conditions. Severe weather had been predicted, and the group was inadequately equipped and clothed. It was already snowing when they left Freiburg, and despite several local people advising Keast not to walk on Schauinsland in such weather, they went on. Just short of the summit, they were engulfed in a blizzard, and severely lost. Hours later, part of the group finally made it to Hofsgrund, from where a search party immediately set off to rescue the scattered group from storm and darkness. Four of the group of 27 were already frozen to death or had died from exhaustion, and another one was very critical and died on the following day. This tragic event is locally known as the "Engländerunglück", literally "Englishmen's calamity".
In 1938, in memory of this event, architect Hermann Alker from Karlsruhe erected a memorial for the deceased English students. This memorial, however, became a significant site for the Hitler Youth who used the monument for the purpose of propaganda.
After the Second World War, "Hitler Youth" in the inscription was replaced by "Youth of Germany", and the swastika and imperial eagle on the top bar were removed.
Eaton cross
Jack Eaton, father of one of the deceased students, had a stone cross erected at the spot where his son, Jack Alexander Eaton, had been found lifeless. This cross is locally known as "Kleines Engländerdenkmal", literally "Little Memorial to the English". It bears a German inscription on the mountain side, and an equivalent English inscription on the valley side. Eaton intended to add the line, "Their teacher failed them in the hour of trial", but this was disallowed, as the official version of the event exonerated the teacher.
Observatories
On the Schauinsland, there is a solar telescope, which is operated by the Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics, which nowadays is only used for teaching and PR. Current research is mostly done at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. The observatory can be visited without pre-booking on five open days between May and September, each of which is scheduled at the beginning of the year. On those days guided tours take place between 11 A.M and 3 P.M.
The observatory was founded in 1943 by the German Luftwaffe of the Third Reich to make the most accurate prediction of the ideal frequency for military radio communication by observing the solar activities. It was managed by Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer from 1943 until 1975.
There is also an air measuring station on Schauinsland which belongs to the German environmental federal agency and the federal agency for radiation protection. The concentration of air pollutants is measured as part of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP), the climate-relevant gasses and radionuclides are recorded as part of the GAW. Both this building and the solar telescope were built in 1943 and were used to observe the quality of the ionosphere for the purpose of military radio communication.
A measuring station for the permanent monitoring of the artificial and natural radioactivity in the atmosphere has existed on the Schauinsland since 1957. It was integrated into the newly founded federal agency for radiation protection in 1989. Among other devices to measure traces of radioactivity in the air, the "Ortsdosisleistungs-Messnetz" and the supervision of the adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) takes place there.
Recreational activities
The Schauinsland is a very popular leisure area for Freiburg and the region as it is suitable for a number of outdoor adventurous activities including hiking, skiing and mountain biking. In the winter, sledging is possible on the Holzschlägermatte or on the higher areas of the mountain where a sledge-lift operates. Cyclists can visit the Schauinsland for both challenging and leisurely trails and use the Schauinslandbahn to help them ascend the mountain. From May to November, it is possible to go down the mountain using a hired scooter, which takes about an hour. The area right below the top station is a popular starting position for paragliders.

The Year of the Hare () is a 1977 Finnish drama film directed by Risto Jarva, starring Antti Litja as a man who leaves his office job in Helsinki to live in the wilderness with a hare. The film is based on the 1975 book The Year of the Hare by Arto Paasilinna. The Year of the Hare was the last film of Risto Jarva; he died in a car accident on his way back from a private showing of the film, and the subsequent party.
Plot
A man, Vatanen, wakes in a high-rise apartment block. After a minimal comment to his bedraggled wife, he heads off to his work as a deodorant advertising agent.
After being reprimanded by his boss that his standards are slipping, he's sent with a colleague, Miettinen, on a business trip. En route, Miettinen outlines his future plans within the rat race, while Vatanen points out that the product they sell is damaging to the ozone layer. During a business meeting, he dreams of nature and an attractive woman.
En route to Heinola, their car hits a hare. Vatanen gets out to investigate, and heads into the woods, where he remains with the injured hare. Miettinen gets impatient and drives on. He later returns, but cannot find Vatanen.
Vatanen takes the hare to a veterinarian, and receives treatment for its leg, plus dietary advice.
Vatanen sells his boat via telephone, and arranges for the money to be sent to Heinola. After narrowly evading his wife and colleagues, he manages to collect the money.
Vatanen gets a permit and better dietary advice for his hare in Southern Savonia. He buys a lottery ticket in Kuopio and wins some stereo equipment.
Vatanen heads into the forests, chatting to the hare. After attempting to sell the stereo, he's arrested by the police. Upon release, he stays in a fisherman's hut, where he meets a man (Hannikainen) who's obsessed with the notion that the President of Finland, Kekkonen, has been substituted by a younger double.
During a forest fire, he saves a drunken moonshiner, Salosensaari, whose factory has burned down. He finds refuge in a cabin, but is chased off by its owners, who threaten to shoot him, wanting to eat his hare.
He finds another cabin, but again his peace is disturbed by a group of tourists, keen to meet a real hermit. He tires of them and again heads off. The next recluse he meets attempts to make an animal sacrifice of the hare, tying it to a rock.
After sneaking home and briefly encountering his wife, he reaches the conclusion that he will never be truly free until his records are erased from government computers, which he endeavours to do.
He wakes in Turku with amnesia, and with a lady, Leila, he'd apparently met during a lengthy drinking spree in Helsinki. He discovers that, despite being married, he's somehow become engaged to her (she's a lawyer).
After police questioning, he's put on trial, and then in prison for his recent misdemeanours.
His new future wife wants him to grow up and conform to her work expectations.
The hare escapes from its cage, as does Vatanen from his prison cell, leaving the engagement ring behind.

The treaty of Marienburg, concluded on 29 June 1656, was a Brandenburg-Prussian – Swedish alliance during the Second Northern War.
In January 1656, Charles X Gustav of Sweden had made Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, his vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. By the time of the treaty of Marienburg, Swedish prospect in the war had diminished, and Charles X Gustav was willing to offer Frederick William I a reward for fighting on his side. While the latter was to remain a Swedish vassal for Prussia, he was promised hereditary sovereignty in four voivodeships of Greater Poland in return for participating in the Charles X Gustav's Polish campaigns. This alliance proved victorious in the subsequent Battle of Warsaw, but as further campaigns stalled, Frederick William I was to gain full sovereignty in Prussia by the Treaty of Labiau in November 1656.

Ji Zhe (; 14 October 1986 – 5 December 2019) was a Chinese professional basketball player for the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Playing the position of power forward for the Ducks, he won three CBA championships and served as the team's captain. He died from lung cancer at the age of 33.
Career
Ji Zhe was born 14 October 1986 in Shenyang, Liaoning, China. In 2005, he led the Northeastern University men's basketball team to win the 2nd Chinese University Basketball Super League championship. He was also a member of the Liaoning provincial team which finished 4th at the 2005 National Games of China.
In 2007, Liaoning loaned Ji to the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He permanently joined the Ducks in 2012. As a member of the Ducks, he won three CBA championships in 2012, 2014, and 2015. He played the position of power forward and served as the captain of the Ducks. He was listed at tall and weighed .
Ji played his final game on 22 March 2018, the Ducks' last game of the 2017–2018 CBA season. During his CBA career he played 434 games, averaging 23.9 minutes, 7.3 points, and 4.7 rebounds per game. He was considered a good rim protector.
Death
In August 2018, Ji was diagnosed with lung cancer, but did not publicly disclose the news and quietly sought treatment in the United States. Despite more than a year of treatment, his health deteriorated and he died on 5 December 2019 at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, aged 33. He had a son.
On 8 December 2019, the Ducks' played their first home game after Ji's death as a tribute to him, and all Ducks players wore his No. 51 jersey before the game. The team placed a T-shirt with the number 51 on each of the 18,000 seats inside the Wukesong Arena and retired the number. Many players and fans were in tears. The Ducks defeated the visiting Shenzhen Aviators by the score of 102 to 100, with Jeremy Lin scoring three free throws in the final seconds of the game. Lin called the comeback victory a "miracle".
In popular culture
In the 2016 film My Other Home, a biopic of Ji's former Ducks teammate Stephon Marbury, the Taiwanese-Canadian actor Godfrey Gao portrayed the player based on Ji. By coincidence, Gao died suddenly at the age of 35, eight days before Ji's death.

The Waipa Foundation is a non-profit organization which sponsors a program called Aina Ulu (in the Hawaiian language), funded by Kamehameha Schools.
Its programs grew out of community efforts to manage the ahupuaa of Waipa in the late 1980s. The Waipa Foundation was established as a 501(c)3 non-profit in 1993.
The program
The foundation makes its home in the ahupuaa of Waipa, a valley on the north shore of the island of Kauai in Hawaii, . The Waipa stream flows through the valley and empties into Hanalei Bay. An ahupuaa is an ancient Hawaiian land division from mountains to the sea, often corresponding to a watershed district. It was used in traditional Hawaiian times as a way to distribute the resources of the land to the people. The mission of the foundation is "the physical and cultural restoration of the ahupuaa of Waipa".
Ecological restoration
The restoration project at Waipa focuses on human interactions with plants and land. There are three types of sites. The first is native reforestation. Some of the plants being out planted are Acacia koa (Koa), Dodonaea viscosa (A'ali'i), Munroidendron racemosum, Pritchardia spp.(Loulu), and Microlepia strigosa (Palapalai). Some sites feature Polynesian introduction plants, such as Piper methysticum (Kawa) and Cordyline fruticosa (Ti). These plants all have value in Hawaiian ethnobiology. The last designation of restoration sites is agroforestry. Waipa is planting fruit and timber trees to satisfy this category. All of the agroforestry plantings are plants with commercial value. They can be harvested and sold as well as provide food and medicine. By planting the trees, Waipa community is rehabilitating the land as well as providing for the community.

The Curtatone class were a group of destroyers built for the Royal Italian Navy.
They were the first destroyers to be built in Italy after the end of World War I, and were the first ships of this type to use twin rather than single mountings.
The ships were originally ordered at the same time as the Palestro-class destroyers, but were postponed due to steel shortages. The opportunity was taken to modify the design to incorporate experience and lengthen the ships by .
The ships were later modernized for escort duties with the twin guns being replaced by singles and the triple torpedo tubes replaced by twin torpedo tubes. Extra light anti-aircraft guns were also fitted and the /40 caliber guns removed.
Ships
All four ships were built by Orlando yard in Livorno.

Zero-overhead looping is a feature of some processor instruction sets whose hardware can repeat the body of a loop automatically, rather than requiring software instructions which take up cycles (and therefore time) to do so. Zero-overhead loops are common in digital signal processors and some CISC instruction sets.
Background
In many instruction sets, a loop must be implemented by using instructions to increment or decrement a counter, check whether the end of the loop has been reached, and if not jump to the beginning of the loop so it can be repeated. Although this typically only represents around 3–16 bytes of space for each loop, even that small amount could be significant depending on the size of the CPU caches. More significant is that those instructions each take time to execute, time which is not spent doing useful work.
The overhead of such a loop is apparent compared to a completely unrolled loop, in which the body of the loop is duplicated exactly as many times as it will execute. In that case, no space or execution time is wasted on instructions to repeat the body of the loop. However, the duplication caused by loop unrolling can significantly increase code size, and the larger size can even impact execution time due to cache misses. (For this reason, it's common to only partially unroll loops, such as transforming it into a loop which performs the work of four iterations in one step before repeating. This balances the advantages of unrolling with the overhead of repeating the loop.) Moreover, completely unrolling a loop is only possible for a limited number of loops: those whose number of iterations is known at compile time.
For example, the following C code could be compiled and optimized into the following x86 assembly code:
Implementation
Processors with zero-overhead looping have machine instructions and registers to automatically repeat one or more instructions. Depending on the instructions available, these may only be suitable for count-controlled loops ("for loops") in which the number of iterations can be calculated in advance, or only for condition-controlled loops ("while loops") such as operations on null-terminated strings.
Examples
PIC
In the PIC instruction set, the and instructions implement zero-overhead loops. only repeats a single instruction, while repeats a specified number of following instructions.
Blackfin
Blackfin offers two zero-overhead loops. The loops can be nested; if both hardware loops are configured with the same "loop end" address, loop 1 will behave as the inner loop and repeat, and loop 0 will behave as the outer loop and repeat only if loop 1 would not repeat.
Loops are controlled using the and registers ( either 0 to 1) to set the top and bottom of the loop — that is, the first and last instructions to be executed, which can be the same for a loop with only one instruction — and for the loop count. The loop repeats if it is nonzero at the end of the loop, in which case is decremented.
The loop registers can be set manually, but this would typically consume 6 bytes to load the registers, and 8–16 bytes to set up the values to be loaded. More common is to use the loop setup instruction (represented in assembly as either with pseudo-instruction and , or in a single line as ), which optionally initializes and sets and to the desired values. This only requires 4–6 bytes, but can only set and within a limited range relative to where the loop setup instruction is located.
P0 = array + 396;
R0 = 100;
LC0 = R0;
LOOP my_loop LC0; // sets LT0 and LB0
LOOP_BEGIN my_loop; // pseudo-instruction; generates a label used to compute LT0
// LC0 cannot be written directly to memory,
// so we must use a temporary register.
R0 += -1; // equally fast and small would be R0 = LC0
[P0--] = R0;
LOOP_END my_loop; // pseudo-instruction; generates a label used to compute LB0
x86
The x86 assembly language prefixes implement zero-overhead loops for a few instructions (namely ). Depending on the prefix and the instruction, the instruction will be repeated a number of times with holding the repeat count, or until a match (or non-match) is found with or with . This can be used to implement some types of searches and operations on null-terminated strings.

Korean idol groups began to appear in the early 20th century. Its earliest examples came in the form of vocal groups that both sang and danced. The most notable early example is the Jeogori Sisters, who debuted in 1939.
1930–70: Early vocal groups
In the 1930s and the 1950s, the earliest mainstream Korean idols consisted of vocal groups that sang and performed at the same time. One of the first girl groups was the Jeogori Sisters, who debuted around 1939, while one of the first boy groups to debut was the Arirang Boys. The first idols to go abroad were The Kim Sisters, a three-member girl group that performed in the U.S. and South Korea from the 1950s to the 1970s. With the success of The Kim Sisters, a number of "sisters-type" girl bands started to rise in popularity, including the Silver Bell Sisters (1954), Hyun Sisters (mid-1950s), Jung Sisters (mid-1950s), Lee Sisters (1962), Lily Sisters (1969), Bunny Girls (1971), and National Treasure Sisters (1981). However, these groups differed from the concept of idol groups associated with the Korean Wave and K-pop.
1980–90: Dance singers
In the mid-to-late 1980s, independent music that was founded in the newly introduced genres of disco, soul, and funk began to rise in popularity. The debuts of Fire Truck and Setorae in the 1980s is now considered to be the beginning of the current trend in boy and girl groups respectively. Korean dance singers and groups held performances based on Western dance music which combined exciting music and fancy dances, with the most prominent representatives of the movement being the Fire Trucks, Setorae, Kim Wan-sun, and Nami.
In the early 1990s, songs started to combine repeated rhythms of electronic dance music such as house, techno, and trance with a melody that gives a trot-like feeling. In addition, simple rap due to the influence of American hip hop was especially popular among teenagers. This musical composition is called "new generation dance music" and has been adopted by current idol music. These younger generations were exposed to new musical influences as they began to find and listen to foreign music that had not yet been introduced to Korea.
1990: First-generation idols
Founded in 1989, SM Entertainment selected Hyun Jin-young, who was well known as a "dancer," to debut as its first singer. However, in 1993, the company suffered financial difficulties when Hyun was discovered to be taking methamphetamine. As such it attempted to establish a new training system for singers in which teenagers were selected through auditions to practice singing and dancing before eventually debuting as singers. The company then recouped the capital they invested during their debuts through record sales and performance activities. H.O.T. was the first group under this system to be presented by SM Entertainment.
The first-generation idol groups are usually groups of approximately five people, each of whom divided their roles into lead vocal, sub-vocal, dancer, and rapper. While singing on stage, their synchronous choreography, known as "group dance," was more sophisticated compared to previous dance music, but at the same time included "point choreography" that teenagers could easily imitate. Musical performances were done only for two or three songs in the album—the title song and follow-up song—and these songs were produced with music videos that showed each member's characteristics. After several months of performing, the singers took a break and resumed their career with their next album. This system became the basis for the second and third-generation idols.
The first-generation idol groups were mostly formed by SM Entertainment, which had a focus on mysterious images, and DSP Media, which had a focus on realistic images. The two were known to have a rivalry with each other. Boy groups such as SM's H.O.T. and DSP's Sechs Kies arose, both of which made their debuts with songs about social criticism and became popular for their rhythmical dance music. SHINHWA maintained the group's identity with its masculine visual appeal and strong audience reception, while g.o.d built a friendly image by appearing on entertainment shows and producing songs that many generations could relate to. Meanwhile, girl groups such as SM's S.E.S. and DSP's Fin.K.L. maintained a cute and pure girl image for the band. Later, S.E.S displayed an unrealistic and mysterious image, and Fin.K.L displayed a friendly image for the band members. Baby V.O.X and DIVA had become popular for their strong female image as well.
First-generation idols lost popularity in the 2000s. They often lip-synced as they performed with a focus on choreography, and most of the audience recognised that the songs heavily relied on digital techniques to correct the vocals of the idol singers. As a result, many people began to question the authenticity and competency of the singers. In addition, a series of controversies had erupted in contracts with idol members and adjustment of profits, and the idol-training system relied on terrestrial broadcasting while the music market was being converted into digital centres. Eventually, idol groups were disbanded, such as Sechs Kies in 2000, H.O.T. in 2001, S.E.S. in 2002, and Fin.K.L declaring a halt to team activities in 2002.
2000: Second-generation idols
With the decline of the first-generation idols in the early 2000s, solo singers from big agencies, such as BoA, Rain and Seven, became popular alongside solo singers who were formerly part of a group, such as Kangta, Moon Hee-joon, Bada, Ock Joo-hyun, and Lee Hyori. TVXQ made its debut as an a cappella group in 2004, and was followed by SS501 and Super Junior in 2005 and Big Bang in 2006, but were not as trendy as first-generation idols. The rise of second-generation idols can be attributed to the 2007 release of Wonder Girls' "Tell Me", which became so popular that it was named a "syndrome." TVXQ, SS501, Super Junior and Big Bang, all of which debuted earlier, subsequently joined the popularity triggered by Wonder Girls.
The second-generation idol groups usually consisted of six or more members, formed a "group in a group" called a unit, and ran group and unit activities at the same time. The agencies tried to manage their idol groups more thoroughly than the first generation to prevent problems. They regularly evaluated trainees' singing and dancing abilities and ended contracts with trainees if their abilities did not improve or were significantly inferior. They also put an emphasis on personality and dismissed trainees whose behaviour was controversial.
The music released during this period consisted mainly of hook songs in which a short chorus was repeatedly presented, and most songs were deliberately composed similar to Western pop music to target foreign market listeners. Since the digitisation of the music market required frequent releases of albums and continuous exposure to the public to maximise profits as an agency, singles and extended plays with fewer tracks than regular albums became common. Unlike first-generation idols, second-generation idols appeared on entertainment shows and established "friendly images outside the stage" that were different from their "image on stage". Second-generation idols also extended their demographic to middle-aged people, and as a result introduced the term "Samchon Fan", which referred to male fans in their 30s and 40s. Female fans of girl groups, called "Yeodeok", were also established.
The rivalry present in the first-generation idols was not as frequent among second-generation idols as concepts and music genres diversified. Wonder Girls and Girls' Generation, who debuted in 2007, gained popularity together and were perceived to be rivals, but as more idol groups made their debuts there were fewer instances of them being dubbed rivals. Wonder Girls, Kara, and Girls' Generation pursued an appealing image and were heavily influenced by the groups in the previous generation, with Kara resembling Fin.K.L. while Girls' Generation resembled S.E.S. Brown Eyed Girls became popular with both men and women for their own musical characteristics, while 4minute, 2NE1, f(x), and Miss A took on the independent female image of Baby V.O.X and DIVA. SISTAR, Girl's Day and AOA pursued a sex theme, while Apink pursued a theme of innocence. TVXQ and Big Bang were considered different from traditional idols as they created music that showed originality and maturity, and TVXQ in particular drew attention by releasing different albums from country to country. SS501 and Super Junior became popular because they introduced the concept of idol groups appearing on entertainment shows. SHINee built a pretty-boy image, and 2PM built a masculine image called "Jim Seung-dol". FT Island and CNBLUE were band-type idol groups.
2011: Third-generation idols
Idols that debuted in the 2010s are known as third-generation idols. EXO is considered to be the starting point for the third generation, particularly for boy groups. On the other hand, many girl groups disbanded after the Korea Fair Trade Commission stipulated in 2009 that exclusive contracts between agencies and celebrities could only last a maximum duration of seven years; as such, girl groups are classified as third-generation if they debuted after 2014. Some second-generation girl groups were categorized as "Generation 2.5" if they debuted in the transitional period between Generations 2 and 3, which includes groups that debuted from 2011 to 2012.
The idol groups' marketing strategy had become more diverse due to social media, which has led to the emergence of unprocessed, self-produced content on sites such as YouTube, AfreecaTV, and V App rather than through TV programs. Idol members also began to post on social networking services to get closer to their fans. In terms of planning, the "localisation" strategy expanded not only through releasing albums in different countries or performing in different languages but by including foreign, non-Korean members directly into groups. Idol groups such as I.O.I and Wanna One were selected and debuted on popular singing competition programs akin to American Idol. Since the mid-2010s, there have been more cases of second and third generation idols using group activity breaks to release records as solo singers and deviate from their groups' characteristics.
The concepts of third-generation idol groups have also evolved to be more nuanced as the number of girl groups targeting female audiences increased. In addition to their singing ability, MAMAMOO, for example, attempted to utilise male attire in the title track of Pink Funky, which in turn gained them the "girl crush" image and was well received by their target audience. Lovelyz chose their concept to be "girls seen from a girl's gaze." GFriend took on a concept reminiscent of "healthy youth" and bore the innocent image of S.E.S., Fin.K.L, and Girls' Generation.

Vasilisa Sergeevna Pashchenko (; 1923
– 19 April 1945) was a radio operator in the Soviet Air Force during World War II who was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation in 2021.
Biography
Born to a Russian peasant family in Millerovo in 1923, she went on to enlist in the Red Army in 1942 to aid the war effort during the ongoing fight against the German occupation of the Soviet Union. Originally assigned to the 432nd Airfield Service Battalion, after graduating training for radio-operator/gunners in 1944 she was reassigned to the 452nd Bomber Aviation Regiment of the 218th Bomber Aviation Division. There, she entered combat, and in March 1945 she was awarded the Order of the Red Star for participating in 25 sorties, of which 16 were over Budapest.
On 19 April 1945 the A-20 bomber she was flying as radio operator was hit by a barrage of anti-aircraft fire while approaching the Czech city of Brno. The pilot in command ordered the crew to bail out, but only the navigator was able to bail out over land controlled by Soviet forces. Pashchenko remained in the plane while the pilot attempted an emergency landing, but he was killed in the crash. Having miraculously survived the crash and with nobody else to fight off the axis troops approaching the crash site, she remained in the machine-gun turret and opened fire on the approaching soldiers, and then shot herself after running out of ammunition. Initially she was buried in Vedrovice, close to the place of her last stand, but in 1946 her remains were transferred to a military cemetery in Orzhekhov, where over a thousand Soviet soldiers who died in the liberation of Czechoslovakia were buried. On 16 August 2021 she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation.

In enzymology, a microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction between an epoxide and water to form a diol.
This enzyme plays a role in the uptake of bile salts within the large intestine. It functions as a Na+ dependent transporter. This enzyme participates in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450. mEH has been identified as playing a large role in the detoxification and bioactivation of a wide variety of substrates, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known for their carcinogenic properties.
The human homolog of microsomal epoxide hydrolase is EPHX1 and is located on chromosome 1.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-stilbene-oxide hydrolase. Other names in common use include epoxide hydratase (ambiguous), microsomal epoxide hydratase (ambiguous), epoxide hydrase, microsomal epoxide hydrase, arene-oxide hydratase (ambiguous), benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide hydratase, benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-epoxide hydratase, aryl epoxide hydrase (ambiguous), cis-epoxide hydrolase, and mEH.
Structure
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase is a single polypeptide chain composed of 455 amino acids with a molecular weight of 52.96 kilodaltons. It is known that the N-terminal region of the enzyme is responsible for anchoring the protein to the cell membrane, while the C-terminal region of the enzyme contains catalytic residues. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase belongs to the superfamily α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes. The center of all α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes is an alpha/beta-sheet consisted of 8 beta strands connected by 6 alpha helices. The three dimensional structure of mEH has been elucidated from Aspergillus niger. Although no 3D modeling has been solved for the mammalian mEH enzyme (EPHX1), the overall homology between fungal and mammalian mEH is relatively high. This high homology has allowed for the elucidation overall general structure and subsequent catalytic mechanism of EPHX1 in humans by comparisons to existing structures of fungal mEH.
Mechanism
α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes use a catalytic triad in their active site. The catalytic triad present in microsomal epoxide hydrolase is composed of glutamine, histidine and aspartic acid. The substrate is positioned in an orientation poised for nucleophilic attack through hydrogen bonding stabilization from two nearby tyrosine residues The proposed mechanism for the mEH-catalyzed reaction first involves a nucleophilic attack on the oxirane ring of the substrate from the aspartic acid residue near the active site, which forms an ester intermediate. The second step in this mechanism is hydrolysis of the ester that occurs by an activated water molecule. The activation of water is facilitated by proton abstraction via the catalytic triad between a water molecule, glutamine, and histidine. After hydrolysis, the substrate is then released from its bond to the aspartic acid residue, liberating the diol product from the enzyme active site.
The active site of this enzyme lies within a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme, which in turn leads to the enzyme's preferential reactivity with molecules with hydrophobic side-chains. The mEH enzyme typically binds to small organic epoxides, such as styrene epoxide and cis-stillbene-oxide. mEH does not catalyze the hydrolysis of bulkier molecules, as their large side-chains may sterically disrupt the charge relay system responsible for water activation.
Function
In humans, mEH has been found in the ovary, lung, kidney, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and liver. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase serves as a protective enzyme against potentially harmful small molecules derived from the external environment. This hydrolysis of genotoxic epoxides causes subsequent effects in several signal transduction pathways, rendering this enzyme important to metabolism.
Disease relevance
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase plays a large role in its effects on human health. Studies have shown that mutations EPHX1 in humans may be the cause of hypercholanemia, preeclampsia, and may contribute to fetal hydantoin syndrome. Research also suggests that maternal polymorphisms in EPHX1 in pregnant women were related to facial malformations of children born from women taking phenytoin during their first trimester of pregnancy. While mEH participates in the protection of human health via detoxification of various environmental substances, it also has been found to facilitate the activation of carcinogens.
mEH detoxifies reactive epoxides that are commonly caused from cigarette smoke, and as such it is hypothesized that mutations in EPHX1 in humans may have an effect on an individual's susceptibility to COPD, emphysema and lung cancer. Some sources have demonstrated that individuals affected by COPD have a higher rate of containing an under-active variant of the EPHX1 gene, yet also demonstrated that the overactive variant of the gene was also found in higher frequencies in individuals affected by disease as well. Other research has provided evidence supporting the idea that EPHX1 variants do not contribute to susceptibility of disease, but do contribute to disease severity. The role that mEH plays in lung cancer and COPD is still not fully elucidated, as the data on the topic in the literature is not completely unanimous.
There is some evidence that mEH variants may contribute to the occurrence of childhood asthma in combination with variants on the GSTP1 gene.
Compared to soluble epoxide hydrolase, the contribution of mEH to metabolism of beneficial epoxy fatty acids such as Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid is considered minor since they are relatively poor mEH substrates in vitro. Yet, in vivo, it was found that mEH can play a considerable role in regulation of EET levels and hence inhibition of mEH or dual inhibition of mEH and sEH might have therapeutic potential. Amide, amine and urea based mEH inhibitors have been explored. Based on the most potent inhibitors characterized, an amide with a bulky alpha-substituent and a phenyl ring with lipophilic groups at meta-positions appear to be key pharmacophore units.
The overall effect that mEH has on human health is still debated, with some sources finding evidence that the overactive EPHX1 gene is the culprit for some diseases, while other evidence supports that the under active variant is the cause of others.

Loyalties is a 1933 British drama film directed by Basil Dean and starring Basil Rathbone, Heather Thatcher and Miles Mander. It is based on the 1922 John Galsworthy play Loyalties.
The film addresses the theme of anti-Semitism. The film was part of an increased trend depicting mistreatment of Jews in British films during the 1930s, tied to the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany, but is unusual in its depiction of prejudice in Britain as most other films were set in a non-British, historical context.
Plot
While a houseguest at an upper-class gathering, the wealthy Jew Ferdinand de Levis is robbed of £1,000 with evidence pointing towards the guilt of another guest, Captain Dancy. Instead of supporting De Levis, the host attempts to hush the matter up and then sides with Dancy and subtly tries to destroy de Levis's reputation. When Dancy is later exposed and commits suicide, de Levis is blamed for his demise.

Production
Film rights were purchased by Herbert Wilcox for £9,000. He developed a screenplay for an extra £2,000. Galsworthy had contractual rights of approval over the project. Wilcox sold the project to William Fox for £20,000.
The film was the first to be made by Associated Talking Pictures (which later became Ealing Studios), after the breakdown of their arrangement with RKO Pictures. Carol Reed and Thorold Dickinson both worked on the film's production as assistant directors. Edward Carrick designed the film's sets.

Rentemestervej is an approximately 1.4 km long street in the North-West district of Copenhagen, Denmark. It runs from Lygten at Nørrebro station in the southeast to Utterslev Torv in the northwest.
History
The street was originally called H. C. Nielsen's Vej but was renamed Rentemestervej in 1930. The area between Rentemestervej and Bispebjerg Bakke to the north was from around 1910 built over with industrial installations. The factories along the street included Glud & Marstrand, Techno and Schou' Soap Factory.
Notable buildings
The Nielsen & Jespersen's former factory at No. 14 is from 1034 and designed in the Functionalist style. The factory was active until 1993 and the building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1994.

Dendrobium johannis, commonly known as the chocolate tea tree orchid, is a species of epiphytic or lithophytic orchid native to Australia and New Guinea. It has spindle-shaped pseudobulbs, between five and ten dark green leaves with purplish markings and flowering stems with up to fifteen chocolate brown flowers with a yellow labellum.
Description
Dendrobium johannis is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with brownish or purplish pseudobulbs that are long, wide and tapered at both ends. There are between five and ten dark green to purplish leaves long and wide near the upper end of the canes. Between six and fifteen flowers long, wide are borne on a flowering stem long. The flowers are chocolate brown with a bright yellow labellum, long lasting and have an unpleasant scent. The sepals and petals are thick, shiny and twisted, the sepals long and wide and the petals a similar length but narrower. The labellum is long, wide with three lobes. The side lobes are upright and the middle lobe is curved with three ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from March to July.
Taxonomy and naming
Dendrobium johannis was first formally described in 1865 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who published the description in The Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette from a specimen collected by John Gould Veitch. James Bateman noted the following: "Prof. Reichenbach being anxious to connect in some way the name of Mr John G. Veitch with that of a plant which forms one of his more remarkable discoveries, and being unable to call it Dendrobium Veitchianum because that name had long since been given by Dr. Lindley to another species of the genus discovered by Lobb, hit upon the ingenious device of making his Christian name the passport to immortality in the present instance. Certainly no one ever laboured harder in the cause of science or deserved the compliment better than the adventurous young traveller, who has already added so many new things to our collections, and who, we sincerely hope, may be spared to enrich them still more.
This orchid is sometimes included in the genus Cepobaculum, but the splitting of Dendrobium into numerous genera has not typically been accepted.
Distribution and habitat

Lady Katherine Barnardiston (died 1633) was a patron of puritanism.
Life
She was born in the centre of Lomdon in the parish of St Michael-le-Querne. She first married Bartholomew Soame and they lived in the parish of St Mary Colechurch. Soame died in 1596. She then married Thomas the eldest child of Sir Thomas Barnardiston of Witham, Essex in 1599. She was his second wife and he had children from his first marriage including Nathaniel Barnardiston. In 1603 she became Lady Barnardiston when her husband was knighted and she kept this name and her place of residence when her husband died in 1610.
Two years after becoming a widow she married William Towse who was a lawyer.
When she died in 1633 she left a detailed will. Her husband had died the year before. One of the substantial donations was to St Catharine's College, Cambridge. She left the college £400 to fund three scholars who could not otherwise afford to study.
Her tomb is in the Church of St Peter and St Paul, in Kedington, which is surprising as she had requested to be buried in her home parish and is not clear if this happened.

The MacRobertson Girls' High School buildings are a series of heritage-listed buildings constructed on the site of the Mac.Robertson Girls' High School, located on the Kings Way, in , South Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The girls' school and the campus is named in honour of Sir Michael Macpherson Robertson after MacRobertson donated £100,000 to the State of Victoria, £40,000 of which was spent to construct the school. Norman Seabrook of Seabrook and Fildes architecture practice, designed the building after winning the state-wide design competition with his functional and modern design entry in the Inter-war Functionalist & Moderne style. Constructed in 1934 during centenary celebrations of Victoria, MacRobertson was vital to the progress of modernist architecture in Australia and essential in the strong re-emergence of the state after the economic downturn of the depression.
The building was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 23 May 1998 due to the buildings' architectural, historic and social significance to the State of Victoria.
Description
The school was zoned in a functional manner with four wings for different disciplines including classrooms, science rooms, art rooms, and cookery rooms. This allowed for smooth movement between disciplines and also created distinct external courtyard areas around the building.
The facade of the building comprises "interlocking cubic forms of differing heights" which is offset by the vertical clock tower with white rendered vertical strips. The material Seabrook used were functional while at the same time embracing the typical palette of De Stijl movement by using striking colours of cream brick, red steel framed hopper windows and dark blue glazed brick piers between windows. Internally softer shades of red, blue, yellow, green and black were used. With the use of practical floor finish material such as linoleum for classrooms, terracotta tiles for corridors and granolithic materials for the stairs and services rooms.
Key influences
It is believed that the main influence of Seabrook's design for MacRobertson Girls' High School was William Dudok Hilversum's town hall (1923–31).< Both these buildings have similar brickwork, rectilinear interlocking facades, functional planning, open air classrooms, flat roof, industrial aesthetic and a modern interior fitout.
The brickwork used in both consists of two stretchers followed by a header in a Flemish bond with an extra wide and deeply raked horizontal joint which emphasises horizontality, while the cream brickwork emphasised shadows. Seabrook selected local Glen Iris Cream bricks at a time when they were only being used sparingly in buildings such as in polychromatic brickwork. Using the cream brick for the entirety of the building was seen as a modernist approach and set a trend for many future buildings in Victoria.
Design approach
Seabrook had a strong functional design approach to the design of MacRobertson Girls' High School. He believed that a "building must look like what it is, be it a town hall or a destructor plan…" . This frame of mind helped in creating the unique and functional design of the building which has had a great impact on Australian architecture. It was the first modernist school constructed in Victoria, at a time when other contemporary schools tended to adopt a variety of Gothic collegiate to Georgian revival style in the design. Robin Boyd described the building as an "evolution of modern architecture" in Australia.
The differing masses of MacRobertson impart proportion and scale to the building, while the De Stijl colour of the articulated red steel hopper windows contrast to the blue glazed brick piers and cream brickwork, helping to break up the facade. Steel windows were not common in schools at this time and are seen as a modernist and functional approach.
Seabrook also considered the site in his design, using native plants to embrace the dry, flat scrubland of South Melbourne. The flagpole and clock tower are also significant in his design and can be seen in many of Seabrook's later work.

She was the second woman to compete in the modern era of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 1982 and was the youngest woman to qualify for an event. McCall is married to fellow race car driver Wally Dallenbach Jr. and has three children.
Career
McCall was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. She went to McArthur High School. McCall began racing at the age of eight and was influenced by her father Bob, who owned a machine and sheet metal shop. Her grandfather Roy participated in midget events and retired when Bob was in early childhood. McCall's main area of racing was driving in quarter midgets until she was 14, winning several championships. with more than 250 victories on short tracks. She entered the Limited Late Model championship in 1979 and took ten feature race victories, including six trophy dash wins and two heat race victories. McCall won the series' rookie of the year accolade. That same year, she was the first female driver to take part in the Texas Race of Champions held at Texas World Speedway. In 1981, McCall drove in the Southeastern-based All Pro Late Model Series behind the wheel of a Chevrolet Camaro, and clinched several top-five finishes, along with 10 victories from 16 feature events.
McCall began competing in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (today the Sprint Cup Series) in 1982, driving the No. 5 Jim Stacy Racing Buick. Jim Stacy, a former stock car driver, offered her a test in his car after he saw her compete at New Smyrna Speedway and McCall later signed a five-year contract at Daytona International Speedway in February that year. It was planned that she would enter five races in 1982, and Stacy along with co-owner Robert Harrington and McCall's father elected not to enter her in the Firecracker 400 as they felt she needed more experience. In the first race McCall entered (at Charlotte Motor Speedway), she failed to qualify after the qualifier was rained out. Three races later, McCall made the field by starting 29th for the Gabriel 400 at Michigan International Speedway, making her the youngest woman to qualify for a NASCAR Cup Series race at the age of 18. In the race, she retired due to an engine failure. McCall started her second race five events later but crashed out, and failed to qualify for the second race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Afterward, she was affected with financial difficulties and dropped out of the series.
She switched to racing on short and dirt tracks in Late Model Stock Cars before she went into road course racing. McCall drove in the IMSA GT Championship in 1984, and her finish in the series with a second-place. She was voted the IMSA GT Championship rookie of the year. In 1985, she competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona. That same year, she married fellow race car driver Wally Dallenbach Jr. having known him for one year. With him, she has three children (Jake, Wyatt, and Kate). She took part in the One Lap of America Rally in 1986 and 1987, and later worked as a pace car driver in the Indy Car World Series between 1995 and 1998. She currently works as a driving instructor for automobile manufacturers in driving events, and co-authored a book Portrait of NASCAR. McCall also competes in trap shooting events and acts as a Precision/Stunt Driver in films and commercials.

Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira (May 3, 1910 – February 28, 1989) was a Brazilian lexicographer, philologist, translator, and writer, best known for editing the Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa, a major dictionary of the Portuguese language.
His family name was originally spelled Hollanda, but was changed to Holanda, presumably to follow the Portuguese spelling reform of 1943.
Biography
Aurélio was born in Passo de Camaragibe, Alagoas state, Brazil. In 1923 he moved to the state capital Maceió, where, at only 14 years of age, he gave private lessons of Portuguese language. One year later he became a first-grade teacher at the local high school Ginásio Primeiro de Março.
In 1936 obtained a law degree at the Recife Law School in Pernambuco, and in that same year he started teaching French and Portuguese grammar, as well as Brazilian and Portuguese literature, at the Alagoas State High School in Maceió. In 1937–1938 he also served as director of the Maceió City Public Library.
In 1938 he moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro, where he taught Brazilian and Portuguese Literature at elite secondary schools including the public Pedro II High School and the private Anglo-American High School.
It was in Rio that he has started his career as a writer, by publishing articles, tales and chronicles in the local press. Between 1939 and 1943, he was acting secretary of the magazine Revista do Brasil.
Aurélio started his career as a lexicographer in 1941, as a collaborator of the Pequeno Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa. In 1942 he published a book of short stories, Dois Mundos ("Two Worlds"), which earned him a prize by the prestigious Brazilian Literary Academy. In 1943 he collaborated with the Dicionário Enciclopédico sponsored by the Brazilian Book Institute. In 1945 he took part in the First Brazilian Writers Conference in São Paulo. Between 1944 and 1949 he was a member of the Brazilian Writers Association (Rio de Janeiro branch).
In 1945 he married Marina Baird, with whom he had two children – Aurélio and Maria Luísa – and five grandchildren.
Between 1947 and 1960, Aurélio authored various texts for the Conto da Semana ("Weekly Tale") section of the newspaper Diário de Notícias. Starting in 1950 he also authored the column Enriqueça o Seu Vocabulário ("Enrich Your Vocabulary") for the Brazilian edition of Reader's Digest; these columns were later published as a book.
Between 1954 and 1955 he lectured Brazilian studies at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, on a grant by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
He was elected a member of the Brazilian Literary Academy on May 4, 1961, and inaugurated on December 18, 1961, taking over seat number 30, formerly of Antônio Austregésilo.
Inspired by his love of the Portuguese language, he decided to produce his own dictionary. After several years of work, in 1975 he published the Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa which was for many decades the reference lexicon in Brazil – to the point that Aurélio and Aurelião ("big Aurélio") became popular synonyms of dictionary. (It is said that his collaborators once proposed to add that entry to the dictionary, but Aurélio vetoed it.) This book went through dozens of reprints and revisions, and spawned several derivative editions.
Aurélio was also member of the Brazilian Academy of Philology, of the Pen Clube do Brasil (the Brazilian section of the International Writers Association), the Brazilian Folklore Commission, the Alagoas Literary Academy, the Alagoas Historical and Geographical Institute, and the Hispanic Society of America.

Rising Tide North America is a grassroots network of groups and individuals in North America organizing action against the root causes of climate change and work towards and promote local, community-based solutions to the climate crisis. Rising Tide is an international network dedicated to building a climate justice and anti-extraction movement.
Rising Tide North America's strategy is based on a no-compromise approach of stopping the extraction of more fossil fuels and preventing the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure.
History
Rising Tide was formed by groups and individuals who came together to organize protests and events at the United Nations Climate Conference of Parties (COP6) in The Hague, Netherlands, in November 2000.
In 2000, Rising Tide UK was formed. In mid-2004, a Rising Tide group formed in Newcastle, Australia, the world's largest coal export port. A smaller group has also started in Sydney.
Rising Tide North America was formed mainly by Earth First!, Mountain Justice and other experienced activists in a desire to be less insular and focus more on coalition building and linking climate change issues to other causes.
Rising Tide describes itself as "a grassroots network of groups and individuals who take direct action to confront the roots causes of climate change and promote local, community-based solutions to the climate crisis. Employing popular education and direct action to address the root causes of climate change with a focus on climate justice, Rising Tide now spans three continents."
Organization
Rising Tide North America is a network with over 50 chapters, allies and local contacts throughout Canada, Mexico and the United States.
Rising Tide North America has active local groups in Idaho, Utah, the Pacific Northwest Cascadia, Chicago, Texas, the San Francisco Bay Area and Alaska. Rising Tide operates through decentralized network organizing consisting of autonomous local groups and that mostly use consensus decision-making.
Activities
On December 17, 2013, 16 protesters with Portland Rising Tide were arrested after locking themselves to disabled vehicles in front of a tar sands megaload shipment near John Day, Oregon, delaying the shipment's passage. Police responded by using 'pain compliance' to remove the protest. On December 1, 2013, two men locked themselves to the tar sands megaload truck and had to be removed by police, which took so long the shipment canceled its nightly move.
Rising Tide NYC organized three days of action on climate change in New York City on April 20–22, 2015. They rallied at the office of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to call for him to reject a proposed deepwater port which would be used to import natural gas.

Lee Vining (formerly, Leevining, Poverty Flat, and Lakeview) is a census-designated place in Mono County, California, United States. It is located south-southeast of Bridgeport, at an elevation of 6781 feet (2067 m). Lee Vining is located on the southwest shore of Mono Lake. The population was 222 as of the 2010 census, down from 250 reported as of 2000 by Mono County. At the previous census (1990) the town population was 398, and at the census before that (1980) it was 315.
Economy
The economy of Lee Vining relies largely on tourism, since it is the closest town to the east entrance of Yosemite National Park, and is near other tourist destinations such as Mono Lake, the ghost town of Bodie, popular trout fishing destinations, and June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain ski areas and the June Lake recreational area. Although off-season tourism has increased in recent years, most tourists visit in the summer months because State Route 120 through Yosemite is often closed otherwise because of heavy snowfall in the winter. Lee Vining has a year-round Information Center for visitors.
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 5.2 square miles (13.5 km2), 99.95% of it land, and 0.05% of it water.
Climate
Lee Vining, on the boundary between the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin ecoregions, has a transitional climate warmer and drier than the mountains to the west but cooler and much snowier than the vast desert to the east. Despite only getting 14 inches of water-equivalent precipitation annually, the town averages nearly six feet of snow, sometimes falling as late as April or even May. Precipitation is highest in the winter months of December through March, but some can be expected to fall every month of the year and the town does not typically experience the four to six month dry spells of more coastal parts of California.
History
The town was named after Leroy Vining, who founded the town in 1852 as a mining camp. In 1926, the town was laid out by Chris Mattly and named "Lakeview", but when a post office was sought in 1928, it was learned that another town, Lakeview, California already had the name. The name of Lee Vining was chosen in 1953. The place was also called Poverty Flat for its unfavorable conditions for agriculture.
Sights
The town is the site of the Upside-Down House, a distinctive local landmark built by silent film actress Nellie Bly O'Bryan. Also located in the town is the Whoa Nellie Deli, which was once described by the San Francisco Chronicle as "a misplaced Fellini set carved into the edge of the Mono Basin, dust devils skipping around in the distance like extras on the floor of Owens Valley."
The town is home to the Mono Cone burger and ice-cream store, open in the spring and summer. Gus Hess Park commemorates an early miner in Lee Vining.
Lee Vining is situated near the foot of Lee Vining Canyon. State Route 120 runs from town, through the canyon, up to Tioga Pass. Lee Vining Canyon is one of only two ice climbing venues in California. U.S. Route 395 also runs through the town, connecting to Los Angeles to the South, and Reno, Nevada to the North.

NOYB – European Center for Digital Rights (styled as noyb, from "none of your business") is a non-profit organization based in Vienna, Austria established in 2017 with a pan-European focus. Co-founded by Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems, NOYB aims to launch strategic court cases and media initiatives in support of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, and information privacy in general. The organisation was established after a funding period during which it has raised annual donations of €250,000 by supporting members. Currently, noyb is financed by more than 4,400 supporting members.
While many privacy organisations focus attention on governments, noyb puts its focus on privacy issues and privacy violations in the private sector. Under Article 80, the GDPR foresees that non-profit organizations can take action or represent users. noyb is also recognized as a "qualified entity" to bring consumer class actions in Belgium.
Notable actions
EU–US data transfers/'Schrems I' (2016)
The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) filed a lawsuit against Schrems and Facebook in 2016, based on a complaint from 2013, which had led to the so-called "Safe Harbor Decision". Back then, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had invalidated the Safe Harbor data transfer system with its decision. When the case was referred back to the DPC the Irish regulator found that Facebook had in fact relied on Standard Contact Clauses, not on the invalidated Safe Harbor. The DPC then found that there were "well-founded" concerns by Mr Schrems under these instruments too, but instead of taking action against Facebook, initiated proceedings against Facebook and Mr Schrems before the Irish High Court. The case was ultimately referred to the CJEU in C-311/18 (called 'Schrems II': see Max Schrems#Schrems II). noyb supported this private case of Mr Schrems.
"Forced consent" complaints (2018)
Within hours after General Data Protection Regulation rules went into effect on 25 May 2018, noyb filed complaints against Facebook and subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Google LLC (targeting Android), for allegedly violating Article 7(4) by attempting to completely block use of their services if users decline to accept all data processing consents, in a bundled grant which also includes consents deemed unnecessary to use the service. Based on the complaint, the French data protection authority CNIL has issued a €50 Mio fine against Google LLC. The other cases are still pending.
Apple Tracking Case (2020)
In mid November 2020, noyb.eu announced that complaints were filed to both the German and Spanish Data Protection Authorities, claiming "IDFA (Apple's Identifier for Advertisers) allows Apple and all apps on the phone to track a user and combine information about online and mobile behaviour". In a slight change from their previous legal strategy in other similar cases, noyb notes that, because the complaint is based on Article5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive and not GDPR, the Spanish and German authorities can directly fine Apple, without appealing to EU Data Protection Authorities under GDPR.
Open letter on GDPR cooperation mechanism (2020)
noyb also focuses on putting pressure on regulators to enforce privacy laws on the books. In an open letter, the NGO has accused the Irish Data Protection Commission of acting too slow and having 10 meetings with Facebook before the coming into application of the GDPR.
Schrems II - Court of Justice Judgment on Privacy Shield (2020)
On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated Privacy Shield and decided that Facebook and other companies that fall under US surveillance laws cannot rely on “Standard Contractual Clauses” (SCCs) since US surveillance laws were found to be conflicting EU fundamental rights. This judgement was based on a long lasting case of Max Schrems and noyb. US companies' foreign customers' data are not protected from the U.S. intelligence services. The CJEU found that this violates the “essence” of certain EU fundamental rights.
The Court has also clarified that EU data protection authorities (DPAs) have a duty to take action. The Court highlighted that a DPA is “required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence”.
Despite the invalidations made by the judgment, absolutely "necessary" data flows can continue to flow under Article 49 of the GDPR. Any situation where users want their data to flow abroad is still legal, as this can be based on the informed consent of the user, which can be withdrawn at any time. Equally the law allows data flows for what is "necessary" to fulfil a contract.
Mass Complaints on EU-US Data Transfers (2020)
After the Schrems II judgment, B filed 101 complaints against EU/EEA companies against controllers using Google Analytics or Facebook Connect and thereby transferring data to the US despite the Court finding (link to Privacy Shield) that US surveillance laws violate the essence of EU fundamental rights. The organization thereby wanted to point out the lack of enforcement of Schrems II. These model complaints led to the creation of a special taskforce by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) which is tasked to coordinate the complaints and to prepare recommendations for controllers and processors. On January 12, 2022, the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) reached a partial decision in favour of noyb, stating that the continuous use of Google Analytics violates the GDPR. This decision affects most websites in the European Union since Google Analytics is the most common traffic analysis tool.
Google Advertising ID tracking (2021)
On April 7, 2021, noyb filed a complaint in France charging that Android users were being tracked by Google without giving consent.
"Google's software creates the AAID without the user's knowledge or consent. The identification number functions like a license plate that uniquely identifies the phone of a user and can be shared among companies. After its creation, Google and third parties (e.g. applications providers and advertisers) can access the AAID to track users' behaviour, elaborate consumption preferences and provide personalised advertising. Such tracking is strictly regulated by the EU “Cookie Law” (Article 5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive) and requires the users' informed and unambiguous consent."
Facebook and DPC complaint (2021)
NOYB has filed a complaint against the irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in for corruption and possible bribery in 2021 under austrian law for an affair concerning Facebook.
Administrative fine for Grindr over illegal sharing of user data (2021)
Together with the Norwegian Consumer Council, noyb filed three strategic complaints against the dating app Grindr and several adtech companies over illegal sharing of users' data in January 2020. The data shared was GPS location, IP address, Advertising ID, age, gender and the fact that the user in question was on Grindr. Users could be identified through the data shared, and the recipients could potentially further share the data. These complaints are based on the report “Out of Control” by the Norwegian Consumer Council.
One year after the complaint was filed, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority upheld the complaint against Grindr, confirming that Grindr did not receive valid consent from users in an advance notification. The Authority imposed a fine of 100 Mio NOK (€9.63 Mio) on Grindr which was then reduced to 65 Mio NOK (€6.5 Mio) in the final decision since Grindr's actual revenue was lower than previously assumed and the company undertook measures to remedy deficiencies in their previous consent management platform.
Action against the use of "Dark Patterns" in cookie banners (2021)
On August 10, 2021, noyb filed 422 complaints against companies using deceptive cookie banners on their website. This wave of complaints was the outcome of a “Legal Tech” initiative by the organization in the course of which thousands of websites in Europe had been automatically checked for violations with a tool that was developed specifically for this purpose. In response to those complaints an EDPB taskforce was set up to exchange views on legal analysis and possible infringements and to streamline communication In its effort to overcome the necessity of cookie banners, noyb has also co-developed Advanced Data Protection Control together with the Sustainable Computing Lab of the Vienna University of Economics. The ADPC browser signal poses a feasible alternative to cookie banners through its automated mechanism for the communication of users' privacy decisions and data controllers' responses.
Austrian Court: Google Analytics illegal in Europe (2022)
In early 2022, an Austrian court ruled that the use of Google Analytics on European websites was illegal. The case in question was filed in August 2020, from a Google user accessing an Austrian website for health related issues. The website used Google Analytics, and data about the user was transmitted to Google. The Google user complained to the Austrian data protection authority alongside noyb. The issue at hand has a direct reference to Article 44 under GDPR, since the user cannot be afforded the correct level of protections established, thus making it a clear violation of GDPR. France's data watchdog CNIL concurred with the Austrian ruling in mid February 2022. Schrems duly commented:
Furthermore, in mid 2022, the Austrian DPA also ruled that Google's anonymization was insufficient in protecting user privacy, and that Article 44 of GDPR does not allow for a risk-based approach that Google had argued for.

The Toros de Nuevo Laredo (Bulls of Nuevo Laredo in English) are a professional basketball team based in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico playing in the Northern Division of the Mexican Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP).
History
The Correcaminos UAT Matamoros (Matamoros Roadrunners) were transferred to Nuevo Laredo in 2007 and were renamed Venados de Nuevo Laredo. In the 2009-10 season the team was renamed Toros de Nuevo Laredo. During the 2010–2011 season the Toros de Nuevo Laredo won their first League Championship beating the Pioneros de Quintana Roo.
During the 2012 - 2013 season the team was renamed the Toros de Los Dos Laredos after an agreement with the city of Laredo, Texas to play home games in the Laredo Energy Arena. The Toros de Los Dos Laredos played their home games in the newly designed sports complex, the Ciudad Deportiva's Gimnasio Multidisciplinario Nuevo Laredo in Mexico and the Laredo Energy Arena in the United States. The Toros de Los Dos Laredos won its second championship in 2013 beating Halcones UV Xalapa. It was announced that for the 2013-2014 the team would be renamed back to Toros de Nuevo Laredo. The reason given was that the team is funded by the state and its budget was cut in half because it played half its games out of state.

Wanguo Quantu or the Complete Map of the Myriad Countries is a map developed in the 1620s by the Jesuit Giulio Aleni in Ming China following the earlier work of Matteo Ricci, who was the first Jesuit to speak Chinese and to publish maps of the world in Chinese from 1574 to 1603. Aleni modified Ricci's maps to accommodate Chinese demands for a Sinocentric projection, placing the "Middle Kingdom" at the center of the visual field.

The Hugo Award for Best Novelette is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The novelette award is available for works of fiction of between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out in the short story, novella and novel categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".
The Hugo Award for Best Novelette was first awarded in 1955, and was subsequently awarded in 1956, 1958, and 1959, lapsing in 1960. The category was reinstated for 1967 through 1969, before lapsing again in 1970; after returning in 1973, it has remained to date. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novelettes for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the award presentation constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The novelettes on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.
During the 65 nomination years, 202 authors have had works nominated; 50 of these have won, including coauthors and Retro Hugos. 1 translator has been noted along with the author whose work she translated. Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, and Harlan Ellison both have received the most Hugos for Best Novelette at three, with Ellison having been nominated a total of six times, while seven other authors have won twice. Mike Resnick has had the most nominations at eight, and Ursula K. Le Guin and Greg Egan have been nominated seven times each. Fifteen other authors have been nominated at least four times, while Egan has the most nominations without winning.
Winners and nominees
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novelette was first published. Each year links to the corresponding "year in literature". Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the novelette was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the publisher's name is included after the book title.
* Winners and joint winners
Retro Hugos
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of "Retro Hugos", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years before the current year, if no awards were originally given that year. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

The Maghreb lark (Galerida macrorhyncha) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found in the Maghreb desert of north-eastern Africa.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Maghreb lark was previously considered to be a subspecies of the crested lark. It was proved to have diverged genetically from the latter species 1.9 million years ago was accepted as a separate species in 2009. Alban Guillaumet and colleagues noted the distinctiveness of populations from the Maghreb - birds in the dryer parts of Morocco and Tunisia had longer bills while those in more coastal northern parts had shorter bills typical of the European subspecies. The authors sampled the mitochondrial DNA and found they were distinct genetically. The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words makros "long" and rhynchos "bill".
Subspecies
Two subspecies are recognized:
Hauts Plateaux Maghreb lark (G. m. randonii) - Loche, 1860: Originally described as a separate species. Found in eastern Morocco and north-western Algeria
North-west Saharan Maghreb lark (G. m. macrorhyncha) or Long-billed Maghreb lark - Tristram, 1859: Found in southern Morocco and western Algeria to west-central Mauritania
Two syntypes of Galerida macrorhyncha Tristram (Ibis, 1859, p.57), an adult male and adult female, are held in the vertebrate zoology collection of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers NML-VZ T17849 & ML-VZ T17850. The specimens were collected in Laghouat, Sahara, Algeria on 11-12 November 1856 by H. B. Tristram. The specimen came to the Liverpool national collection through the purchase of Canon Henry Baker Tristram's collection by the museum in 1896.

Mahyuddin Natimbul Same'a (14 September 1947 – 8 April 2021) was an Indonesian politician and academic who served as the vice governor of South Sumatra from 2003 to 2008 and as governor of South Sumatra in 2008. Following his five-month tenure as governor, Mahyuddin later served as a member of the People's Representative Council from 2009 to 2014.
Early life
Mahyuddin was born on 14 September 1947 as the fourth son of the seven children of Natimbul and Same'a in the village of Tanjungkurung, located in the Lahat Regency. He began his studies at a local People's School at the age of seven and he later graduated from his elementary school in 1960. During his high school years, he worked in a local market. In 1963, he graduated from his junior high school and in 1967 he graduated from the Xaverius High School. He graduated from the Sriwijaya University in 1975 with a medical degree.
Academic career
Mahyuddin started his career as a staff member at the biology faculty in Sriwijaya University. After attending specialized education on obstetrics and gynaecology at Airlangga University in 1984, Mahyuddin became a lecturer at Sriwijaya University. Later on, he was also appointed a director for family planning in the Palembang Central Hospital.
After five years teaching in the university, Mahyuddin was appointed the secretary for the medical faculty in the university. He was later promoted to assistant dean in 1996 and as assistant rector in 1999. He ended his career in the university after being elected as vice governor in 2003.
Political career
Vice Governor
Mahyuddin entered politics shortly before the 2003 South Sumatra election, in which he ran with Syahrial Oesman. They placed first, winning 38 votes, one vote more than then-incumbent governor, Rosihan Arsyad, who also ran in the election. A political scandal occurred after the election, when fifteen MPs from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) endorsed Syahrial instead of party-approved Rosihan. Megawati Soekarnoputri, the president of Indonesia at that time who was the chairwoman of the PDI-P delayed the confirmation of the results due to this scandal. Mahyuddin and Syahrial were eventually inaugurated on 7 November 2003.
Governor
Then-governor of South Sumatra, Syahrial Oesman, resigned from the post on 19 June 2008 to run in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Mahyuddin assumed office after he resigned and was later inaugurated on 11 July 2008. His term ended on 7 November 2008. During his governorship, Mahyuddin enacted a decree which legally banned the existence of Ahmadiyya in South Sumatra.
Member of the People's Representative Council
Mahyuddin was elected into the People's Representative Council after gaining 75,695 votes from the South Sumatra I electoral district. He was assigned to the Commission X of the People's Representative Council, which handles education, youth affairs, sports, tourism, art and culture. Mahyuddin became the chairman of the commission on 21 October 2009. Mahyuddin handed over his office as chairman to Agus Hermanto after a three-year tenure.
He later ran again as a member of the People's Representative Council from the same party and constituency in 2014. He did not obtain enough votes for a parliamentary seat.
Death
Mahyuddin died on 8 April 2021, reportedly around 23:45 in Palembang. He died due to COVID-19. A proper gubernatorial funeral for him could not be held due to his cause of death.

Abraham Léo Errera (4 September 1858 in Laeken – 6 August 1905 in Brussels) was a Belgian botanist, known for his research in the field of plant physiology. He worked at the Free University of Brussels in 1883 as an associate and in 1890 a full professor of botany. In addition, he was actively involved in Jewish affairs.
After receiving his liberal arts degree at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (1874), his focus turned to natural sciences, and in 1879 obtained his doctorate in botanical science. He then travelled to Germany, where he furthered his education at the Universities of Strasbourg, Bonn, and Würzburg. In Strasbourg, he conducted research in the laboratories of Anton de Bary and Felix Hoppe-Seyler. At Würzburg, he studied plant physiology under Julius von Sachs.
Following his return to Brussels, he founded the Laboratoire d'Anatomie et de Physiologie Végétales. This laboratory eventually featured facilities for microscopy and chemistry, a greenhouse, a photography studio, a sterilization chamber, a thermostatic chamber and a darkroom for spectroscopy and polarimetry.
He is credited with discovering the presence of glycogen in plants and fungi (amylopectin) through the use of sophisticated histochemical techniques. He later employed these techniques to detect alkaloids in plants.
In 1886, he published an important observation linking cell division in plants to the behavior of soap bubbles, which came to be known as Errera's Rule: “the cell plate, at the time of its formation, adopts the geometry that a soap film would take under the same conditions."
In 1887 he became a corresponding member of the Academie Royale des Sciences de Belgique, and in 1898 was elected a full member. He died in 1905 at the age of 46 from a cerebral embolism.
Selected works
In 1893 he published "Les Juifs russes : extermination ou émancipation?" (with a prefatory letter by Theodor Mommsen), a book that was later translated and published in English as "The Russian Jews; extermination or emancipation?" Among his principal scientific works are the following:

Cystathionine beta-lyase (), also commonly referred to as CBL or β-cystathionase, is an enzyme that primarily catalyzes the following α,β-elimination reaction
Thus, the substrate of this enzyme is L-cystathionine, whereas its 3 products are homocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia.
Found in plants, bacteria, and yeast, cystathionine beta-lyase is an essential part of the methionine biosynthesis pathway as homocysteine can be directly converted into methionine by methionine synthase. The enzyme belongs to the γ-family of PLP-dependent enzymes due to its use of a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor to cleave cystathionine. The enzyme also belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cystathionine L-homocysteine-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways: methionine metabolism, cysteine metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and sulfur metabolism.
Structure
Cystathionine beta-lyase is a tetramer composed of identical subunits, and is constructed as a dimer of dimers, each associated with one molecule of PLP bound to the catalytic site by a lysine residue. The dimer is formed by two monomers associated through several electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, whereas the tetramer is stabilized through interactions between the N-terminal domains and key α-helices.
Most of the enzyme's catalytic site residues are conserved amongst the enzymes involved in the transsulfuration pathway. Other members include cystathionine gamma-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase, and methionine gamma lyase. Additionally, these structures exhibit a type I fold and belong to the aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) family, characterized by homodimers with dihedral symmetry and active sites composed of residues belonging to adjacent subunits.
Monomer
The cystathionine beta-lyase monomer consists of three functionally and structurally distinct domains:
N-terminal domain
Composed of three α-helices and one beta-strand that contribute to the formation of the quaternary structure. This domain contains residues that interact with the active site of the neighboring subunit to facilitate substrate and cofactor binding.
PLP-binding domain
Contains most of the catalytically relevant residues on the enzyme. It is composed of α-helices and β-sheets with a distinct parallel seven-stranded β-sheet. These sheets form a curved structure around the PLP-binding helix. PLP is covalently attached to a lysine residue at the C-terminus of the sheet.
C-terminal domain
Smallest domain on the enzyme, which is attached to the PLP-binding domain by a long, kinked α-helix. The domain is structured into four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with neighboring helices.
Catalytic site
Aside from being bound to a lysine residue, PLP is fixed within the substrate binding site of the enzyme through various interactions with catalytic residues. Amine- and hydroxyl-containing residues are located in hydrogen bonding distance to the four phosphate oxygens. This phosphate group is considered to be the main contributor to securing PLP in the active site. Additionally, residues neighboring the pyridine nitrogen in PLP help stabilize its positive charge, thereby increasing its electrophilic character.
The aromatic ring in PLP is fixed in place by an almost coplanar tyrosine residue. It is believed that this configuration increases the electron sink character of the cofactor. These stacking interactions between PLP and aromatic side chains can be found in most PLP-dependent enzymes as it plays an important role in catalyzing the reaction by facilitating transaldimination.
Mechanism
As shown in the mechanism below, cystathionine beta-lyase facilitates the S-C bond cleavage in cystathionine with the use of a PLP cofactor bounded to a catalytic lysine residue. Initially, a deprotonated amino group is needed to perform the transaldimination reaction. Given that the pH optimum for the enzyme is between 8.0 and 9.0, a tyrosine residue in the catalytic pocket exists as a phenolate, which abstracts a proton from the α-amino group of the substrate. In the next step, the deprotonated amine undergoes a nucleophilic attack and displaces the lysine to form a Schiff base, forming an internal aldimine.
The released lysine can now abstract the proton from the Cα and form a quinoid intermediate, which is facilitated by the delocalization of the negative charge over PLP's conjugated p-system. Subsequently, the protonation of Sγ induces Cβ-Sγ bond cleavage, thereby releasing homocysteine
The external aldimine is displaced by the nucleophilic attack of the lysine, regenerating the catalytically active internal aldimine and releasing dehydroalanine. Lastly, the enamine tautomerizes into an imine that undergoes hydrolytic deamination to form pyruvate and ammonia.
Inhibition
Plant and bacterial cystathionine beta-lyases are inhibited by the antimicrobial amino acid, L-aminoethoxybinylglycine (AVG), and the antibacterial amino acid, rhizobitoxine.
Plants
Cystathionine beta-lyase in plants exhibits a two-step mechanism inactivation process with AVG, in which a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex is formed before the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme:
Excess addition of cystathionine prevented the inactivation of the enzyme, suggesting that AVG acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to cystathionine. Additionally, the enzyme has been shown to be sensitive to thiol-blocking inhibitors, such as N-ethylmaleimide and idoacetamide.
Bacteria
Unlike in plants, Cystathionine beta-lyase in bacteria exhibits a one-step inhibition mechanism:
Through kinetic methods and X-ray crystallography, a time-dependent, slow-binding inhibition was observed. It is believed that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a similar way as the substrate; however, after the abstraction of the α-proton, the reaction proceeds to create an inactive ketimine PLP derivative.
Evolution
Arabidopsis cystathionine beta-lyase possesses 22% homology with its Escherichia coli counterpart and even higher homology (between 28% to 36%) with cystathionine γ-synthase from plant and bacterial sources and cystathionine γ-lyase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All of these enzymes are involved in the Cys/Met biosynthetic pathway and belong to the same class of PLP-dependent enzymes, suggesting that these enzymes were derived from a common ancestor.
Industrial relevance
Cystathionine beta-lyase catalyzes the production of homocysteine, a direct precursor to methionine. Methionine is an essential amino acid for bacteria that is required for protein synthesis and the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine; thus, the amino acid is directly linked to DNA replication. Because of its necessity in DNA replication, inhibition of cystathionine beta-lyase is an attractive antibiotic target. Furthermore, the enzyme is absent in humans, decreasing the chance of harmful and unwanted side effects.
Studies have linked the anti-fungal activity of several anti-fungal agents to the inhibition of cystathionine beta-lyase; however, other studies have not observed enzyme inhibition by these. Further research is needed to characterize the full extent cystathionine beta-lyase inhibition has on microbial and fungal growth.

Ennomos alniaria, the canary-shouldered thorn, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It can be found in Europe in a wide variety of biotopes where there are deciduous trees, perhaps mostly in deciduous forests and gardens.
Description
The wingspan is 34–42 mm. The length of the forewings is 16–20 mm. Resembles Ennomos quercinaria, but has a canary-yellow thorax. The forewings are scalloped and there are also two cross lines. The wings are ochre yellow with greyish flecks. The bands, a small discal spot on the forewing and a larger discal spot on the hindwing are grey. The larva is brownish-grey, long and thin, with four raised cross-bands on the dorsal side. It closely resembles a dead twig.
Other Ennomos species are similar.
Distribution
Caucasus and Russia to western Europe. The northern limit is Fennoscandia and the southern limit is the northern Mediterranean.
Biology
The moths fly in one generation from July to October. They are attracted to light.
The larvae feed on a number of deciduous trees including downy birch and silver birch, alder and goat willow.

Don is the soundtrack album to the 2006 Hindi film Don: The Chase Begins Again (a remake of 1978 film of the same name), directed by Farhan Akhtar, and starring Shahrukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Boman Irani. The music was released on 27 September 2006, on T-Series. It was one of the best-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the year, with 1.5million units sold in India.
Overview
The film has seven songs composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. Two of the original songs, "Khaike Paan Banaraswala" and "Yeh Mera Dil" were remade for the movie. The album overall, is very contemporary, stylish and racy. Composers have taken care to maintain the essence of the old Don.
Two of the tracks were redone for the movie, which was originally composed by the duo of Kalyanji Anandji. Shahrukh Khan has rapped in the retro track Khaike Paan Banaraswala, the remix of the old classic, who rendered the song along with Udit Narayan. Yeh Mera Dil, sung by Sunidhi Chauhan, is the second remix of the album, which was originally sung by Asha Bhosle.
The song "Mourya Re" sung by Shankar Mahadevan is a Ganpati song set big in Mumbai. Then there is "Aaj Ki Raat", sung by Alisha Chinai, Mahalakshmi Iyer & Sonu Nigam, which has a trendy 1980s club feel to it. The title song, "Main Hoon Don" which falls in a rave, techno, industrial genre, is rendered by Shaan. The "Don Revisited" track was composed by MIDIval Punditz and the remix of the title track was done by DJ Randolph.
Track listing
Release
The music was released on 27 September 2006, at the Inorbit Mall, Malad, Mumbai. Over 30,000 people attended the function.
RJ Harsh of Radio Mirchi was the host of the event. The programs started off by Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy singing Mourya Re, and gave a brief intro about the album. Isha Koppikar, who plays the role of Anita in the film, performed onstage, and later launched the music with Shahrukh Khan as the lead actress Priyanka Chopra was unable to attend the function. Shahrukh had also performed the rap from Khaike Paan Banaraswala and delivered some dialogues from the film.
Reception
The music received generally favorable reviews from critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama in his four-star review, said, "Shankar Ehsaan Loy do exceedingly well with the soundtrack of 'Don – The Chase Begins Again' and establish their supremacy as the composer trio who can give their own even while rearranging the songs from the past, as seen in 'Khaike Paan' and 'Ye Mera Dil'. While 'Aaj Ki Raat' sits pretty at the top for its innovative appeal, 'Khaike' is a sure shot chartbuster for all generations and 'Main Hoon Don' makes the proceedings exciting, the theme instrumentals too create a great impact and take the proceedings on a fast track." Faridoon Shahryar of IndiaGlitz, said in his review, "Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy cast their spell in the music score of DON. And I am still recovering from the thrilling effect it has left on me." The Rediff review read, "This lavish enterprise has a little bit of everything. An eclectic mix of old, new and everything in between; Don is an unusual presentation of old wine in new bottle."
The music became extremely popular among the public and topped the music charts. The music sold over 1.5million units in India. Main Hoon Don (Normal/Fncinternational Mix) has been in The Top 20 songs list compiled by Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM every week, on the basis of album sales, on-air requests and research since 28 October 2006 i.e. for 47 weeks. It gained the #1 position on 14 October 2006 in its first entry and has been in the top 20 list ever since, except one case when it disappeared in just one of the compilations.
In popular culture

The Anukramaṇī (, ) (also ) are the systematic indices of Vedic hymns recording poetic meter, content, and traditions of authorship.
Anukramanis of the Rigveda
Six Anukramanis of the Rigveda are ascribed to Shaunaka: Anuvakanukramani, Arshanukramani, Chandonukramani, Devatanukramani, Padanukramani and Suktanukramani. Except the Anuvakakramani, other Anukramanis survive only in quotations found in the writings of Shadgurashishya.
The most important Anukramani of the Rigveda is Katyayana's Sarvanukramani (ca. 2nd century BCE), recording the first word, the number of verses, name and family of poets (rshis), names of deities and metres for each of the 1,028 hymns of the Rigveda. The Vedarthadipika, written by Shadgurushishya (12th century) is a significant commentary of this work.
Mayrhofer (2003) discusses the personal names contained in the Rigveda Anukramani, counting 543 items. Academic opinion regarding the age and authenticity of the tradition of these names is not unanimous. Mayrhofer suggests that Hermann Oldenberg (1888) was essentially correct in assuming that
"the editors of the lists of authors [...] [possessed] a correct notion of the families associated with these Mandalas [the Rigvedic "family books" 2–7], possibly rooted in tradition. Beyond this, they do not betray as much as the slightest sign of any genuine tradition on the hymn authors." (p. 229)
Another view is set forth by Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton in the 2014 English translation of the Rigveda:
Even though the anukramaṇīs were composed and redacted long after the R̥gvedic period, they are an invaluable resource, for, by and large, their identifications of the poets of hymns are plausible.
Anukramanis of the other Vedas
The Arsheya Brahmana is the earliest Anukramani of the Samaveda, belonging to its Kauthuma shakha. The Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana is a later Anukramani of the Samaveda belonging to its Jaiminiya shakha.
There are three Anukramanis of the Yajurveda belonging to the Atreyi shakha of the Taittiriyasamhita, Charayaniya shakha (known as Mantrarshadhyaya) and Madhyandina shakha of the Vajasaneyisamhita ascribed to Katyayana.
The Brihatsarvanukramani and the Atharvavediyapancpatalika are the Anukramanis of the Atharvaveda. The Brihatsarvanukramani is a complete index of the Atharvavedasamhita in 10 patalas.

Seagull Trust Cruises (formerly Seagull Trust) is a waterway society and Scottish charity.
The Trust was formed in 1978 and offers free canal cruising for disabled and disadvantaged persons and groups. It is the largest service provider of its kind within the UK, and run entirely by volunteers. The Seagull Trust was awarded The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2007, the highest award which can be given to a voluntary group, considered on a par with the MBE awarded to individuals.
It provides a service from four locations in Scotland. These are Ratho (Edinburgh) on the Union Canal, Falkirk also on the Union Canal, Inverness on the Caledonian Canal, and at Kirkintilloch on the Forth and Clyde Canal.
From these locations, it operates eight canal boats, adapted with a lift for wheelchair access, and fitted with galley and toilet. Seven operate daily excursions, one (the Marion Seagull) is adapted as a residential boat for hire to families with a disabled member. The Wooden Spoon Seagull is fitted out as a floating classroom.
Origins
The Seagull trust was formed on 21 November 1978 by The Reverend P. Hugh Mackay, MBE, PhD. Rev. Mackay was Minister of the Parish of Torphichen (1927-1960) where he ran Sea Scouts on the Union Canal, and then Minister of Prenmay and Leslie in Gordon to 1972. Then he retired to North Berwick. He died in 1994 in North Berwick. It was during his retirement that he was involved in the formation of the Seagull Trust. At Torphichen in 1947, MacKay resurrected the Ancient order of St John. He was a canal enthusiast who had learned about two other canal projects, one in England, run by Claire Hanmer, who converted a narrow boat for the service of disabled people on the Midland canals, and a project in Wales, the Sunshine Boat, run under the auspices of the Prince of Wales Trust.
From the project in Wales, Charles Quant drew attention to the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council (IWAAC) of the realisation that his operation had a previously unforeseen secondary advantage of demonstrating that sections of the canal system regarded as "remainder" canals, were being used to good effect and as such his organisation now could fulfil a dual role of providing a service to disabled people and demonstrate the advantages of canal travel to the wider public.
As British Waterways at the time had no obligation to maintain remainder canals in navigable condition, this renewed use of the 'remainder' canal system became the early part of a movement which supported the continued existence of the canals.
Mr R.J. Hume OBE, was a friend of Rev. Mackay and a member of IWAAC. He brought the facts of these two projects to the attention of Rev. Mackay, and soon between them they formulated an idea of bringing a similar service to the Scottish Canal system.
Major Simon Campbell, manager at the time of the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh had joined the original steering group, and it was he who suggested the name 'Seagull Trust' referring to the apparently effortless flight of these birds, an analogy to the freedom which canal boating can give.
Ratho
Rev Mackay approached The Order of St John for £10,000 necessary to buy a boat and meet its immediate running costs. The boat purchased was Claire Hanmer's original craft, which was renamed The St John Crusader. The naming ceremony took place in 1979 at Wester Hailes and was attended by the Duke of Hamilton.
They had nowhere to dock the boat initially, but this problem was soon solved by the generosity of the landlord of the Bridge Inn at Ratho, Ronnie Rusack who also administered a booking system from his premises for the Trust.
Rev Mackay was anxious that the Trust should have its own accommodation, and acquired a partially built canal side facility at Wester Hailes (which was in fact never developed by the Trust). This was soon to prove beneficial for the canal as its presence prevented the blocking off of the waterway at the building of the new A720 (Edinburgh City By-Pass). An aqueduct (The Scott Russell Aqueduct) crossing was provided instead of keeping the waterway open.
The St John Crusader was joined by the Janet Telford. The Janet Telford was soon found to be too small for use by the Trust and was sold to the Forth and Clyde Canal Society. She was replaced by the Mackay Seagull, which is still in operation today. The St John Crusader is not in use today and has been replaced by the St John Crusader II, which came into service in 1996. The St John Crusader is now named Bluebell and is still occasionally seen at Ratho. A third barge, St John Edinburgh was added to the Ratho fleet in 2011.
Cruises operate from Ratho 7 days a week from Easter to the end of October either going west over the Almond Aqueduct or east to the Scott Russell Aqueduct over the Edinburgh City By-Pass road. Santa Cruises are operated to Wilkies Basin in December. There are morning, afternoon and (during the lighter evenings) evening departures. All are by pre-booking. Typically 6000 individual passengers are carried each year.
Kirkintilloch
Having successfully established cruising at Ratho, the trustees looked to Kirkintilloch as the location for a second branch. Kirkintilloch sits on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and has a very rich association with the canal since its inception. After discussions with British Waterways, a substantial boathouse was built near the town centre, on the site of R. Hay and Sons Boatyard. This building also housed a dry dock, which would provide housing and facilities for repair and maintenance for two boats.
The construction was completed in 1984, just in time for the arrival of the Yarrow Seagull. This boat was built at Yarrow Shipbuilders by the then apprentices. She was taken back to Yarrows yard on the Clyde in Spring 2009 for a complete refit, and, while there, had her bow section lengthened considerably to accommodate passengers sitting outside on deck in the warm summer weather.
The second boat to arrive at Kirkintilloch was the Marjorie Seagull in 2001. This boat was built by a bequest named in honour of Mrs Marjorie Brown from Edinburgh. It was built by Stenson Marine in Derby to a new design which aimed to lift passengers higher from the water level in order to see better over the higher banks on the Forth and Clyde Canal.
Town centre development saw the need for the land which the building sat on. New accommodation was built further along the canal adjacent to the new marina and was officially opened by the Princess Royal on 30 September 2008.
Falkirk
The Falkirk branch was formed in 1982, with the original idea to cruise on the westernmost end of the Union Canal. Money was raised for a new boat, The Govan Seagull, which entered service at the branch in 1985. Cruising originally was on the Forth and Clyde Canal between Camelon and Bonnybridge, while British Waterways prepared the Union Canal for use. The Govan Seagull was transferred up to the Union Canal in 1987, and moored at Greenbank. Vandalism was a problem, and money was raised to build accommodation which was completed in 1992, at Bantaskine. The new accommodation was to provide enclosed mooring for one boat and a fully equipped reception centre for the passengers. A lift was fitted which allowed embarkation within the building. It also housed a meeting room which provided for meetings of the Falkirk members.
The Barr Seagull joined the fleet at Falkirk in 2006. She was bought by the Barr Charitable Trust for operation in Falkirk. The steel work was carried out in Falkirk by A.L. Gordon Ltd.
The Marion Seagull was built by funding from the Salvesen Charitable Trust, named in memory of Mrs Marion H Salvesen. It was designed and built as a residential boat, for use by families with a disabled member. It is fully fitted for wheelchair access.
Inverness
The Highland branch was formed in 1987, operating on the Caledonian Canal. The Highland Seagull was built in 1975, formerly a cruiser on the Caledonian Canal and Loch Ness, the Abbey Princess. It was completely adapted by Caley Marina, Inverness for operation with the Trust. It was renamed in 1989 by the Duke and Duchess of York.
A replacement boat "The Highland Cross Seagull" was built in 2011/2012 with the original "Highland Seagull" being transported south to the Lowland Canals to be lengthened, adapted and used as a floating classroom. The "Highland Seagull" is now named "The Wooden Spoon Seagull"

Pierre Maudet (born 6 March 1978) is a Swiss and French politician. Maudet was a member of FDP.The Liberals. He was the mayor of Geneva from 1 June 2011 to 31 May 2012.
Biography
Pierre Maudet is the son of Henri Maudet (born 1948), a Frenchman who first studied theology in Paris before moving to Geneva, Switzerland and becoming a lawyer, and Susanna Willy (born 1943), a teacher. Maudet was born on 6 March 1978 in Geneva and attended the University of Fribourg.
On 17 June 2012, he was elected to the Council of State of Geneva, the executive council of the Canton of Geneva with 40,966 votes out of 104,375 casts.
In 2017, he was nominated by his party to run for the Federal Council. He lost the election in the second ballot receiving 90 votes against Ignazio Cassis who received 125 votes and therefore achieved the absolute majority. The election took place on 20 September 2017.
In 2018, he writes a regular column in the German-speaking newspaper Blick.
Controversial 2015 expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi
In November 2015, Pierre Maudet and his family, his former chief of staff Patrick Baud-Lavigne and Antoine Daher, a friend active in real estate in Geneva, made a luxury trip to Abu Dhabi. Pierre Maudet initially claimed until May 2018 that the trip, including business class flights, accommodation at the Emirates Palace and access to the Formula One race was a private trip, paid for by his friend and it was by chance that he met Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. Following this meeting, he held talks with senior officials on political issues.
A police report on the trip was submitted to the courts in August 2017, and proceedings were opened against an unknown person, Pierre Maudet and his chief of staff.
In August 2018, the public prosecutor claims Pierre Maudet accepted flights and accommodation for an amount estimated at several tens of thousands of Swiss francs.
While denying a conflict of interest, Pierre Maudet then admitted “having hidden part of the truth”.
In September 2018, the Council of State of Geneva decided to temporarily withdraw the Presidential Department from Pierre Maudet, now entrusted to Antonio Hodgers. Pierre Maudet also lost responsibility for the police to Mauro Poggia and for Geneva Airport to .
On 23 November 2018, an online petition on change.org was launched urging Maudet to resign and Pierre Maudet was criticized by Swiss Liberal Party president Petra Gössi, who stated: "If I were Pierre Maudet, I would have already resigned".
In mid 2019, the Geneva government approved a retirement package for Mr. Maudet, amounting to between 89,000 and 125,000 Swiss francs per year, for life, a decision that has caused further outrage among the population.
In July 2020, Swiss FDP committee voted 22 for-1 opposed-1 abstension for expulsion of M. Pierre Maudet from Swiss FDP party for ethics violations regarding his acceptance and inaccurate reporting regarding Dubai travel and acceptance of related gratuities. On 29 October 2020 he announced his resignation from his government position, adding that he would run again in the subsequent March 2021 election. He was found guilty of accepting illegal advantages on 22 February 2021 and given a suspended 300 day-fine sentence. Maudet then lost his bid for re-election to the Geneva Cantonal government in a run-off to Green candidate Fabienne Fischer. He nevertheless indicated his intention to remain politically active. On 3 May 2021 a local cybersecurity company announced his hiring.

Daniel Norton (12 July 1905 – 10 January 1992) was an Australian politician who was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1953 to 1974, representing the seat of Gascoyne. He served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1974.
Early life
Norton was born in Wadhurst, Sussex, England. His family migrated to Victoria in 1913, where he attended the state school at Tresco before going on to Ballarat Grammar School. After leaving school, Norton was employed by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission, working variously as a wheat lumper, truck driver, and mechanic. He came to Western Australia in 1928, living in Perth for a period before moving out to the Gascoyne, where he initially ran a service station at Wubin. Norton moved to Carnarvon in 1934, where he ran a general store, and from 1938 worked as a salesman for the International Harvester Company. He enlisted in the Australian Army in 1941, and served as a staff sergeant in the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. After the end of the war, Norton returned to Carnarvon, where he purchased a banana plantation. He became a member of the Carnarvon Banana Growers' Association, and also chaired a local cooperative.
Politics
Having joined the Labor Party as a young man, Norton first stood for parliament at the 1951 Gascoyne by-election (necessitated by the resignation of the former Labor premier, Frank Wise). He lost the by-election to an "independent Liberal" candidate, Noel Butcher, but successfully recontested the seat at the 1953 state election. After the 1971 election, which saw the election of a Labor government led by John Tonkin, Norton was appointed chairman of committees. He was elected to the speakership in November 1971, following the unexpected death of the previous speaker, Merv Toms, and served in that position until his retirement at the 1974 election. He was succeeded as the member for Gascoyne by Ian Laurance, and as speaker by Ross Hutchinson.

The Nagpur division is one of six administrative divisions of the state of Maharashtra in India. Nagpur is the easternmost division in the state, with an administrative headquarters in the city of Nagpur. It covers 51,336 km² (19,821 mi²). The Amravati and Nagpur divisions make up the Vidarbha region.
Two airports, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport and Gondia Airport, are located here.
History
Nagpur Division was created in 1861, when the Central Provinces administrative division of British India was created by merging the Nagpur Province and the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. Before 1861, Nagpur Division had been part of Nagpur Province, which had been created after the Nagpur kingdom was annexed by the British in 1853 by means of the Doctrine of lapse. The British Nagpur Division included the current districts as well as Balaghat District, currently part of Madhya Pradesh.

On December 7, 2019, a plebiscite was held to determine if residents of the Philippine province of Compostela Valley approve the renaming of their province to Davao de Oro.
Background
The province of Compostela Valley was carved out from Davao del Norte in 1998. In early 2019, Republic Act No. 11297 was passed into law renaming Compostela Valley to Davao de Oro, subject to the province's residents' approval in a plebiscite. The legislation was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on April 17, 2019 and the signing was made known to the public on May 23, 2019. The Philippine national government's Commission on Elections (Comelec) was tasked to supervise and conduct the required plebiscite.
Republic Act No. 11297 was proposed as House Bill 7363, which was filed before the House of Representatives on May 15, 2018, and Senate Bill 1746, which was filed before the Senate on December 10, 2018. Representatives Pedro Acharon Jr., Ruwel Peter Gonzaga, and Maria Carmen Zamora were the proponents of HB 7363 and Senators Juan Miguel Zubiri and Sonny Angara were the proponents of the Senate counterpart of the House bill. The two proposed bills were consolidated on January 29, 2019. Supporters of the renaming said that renaming Compostella Valley to Davao de Oro would strengthen the association of the province with the rest of the Davao Region; prior to the plebiscite, Davao de Oro as Compostella Valley was the only province in the region without "Davao" in its name.
As per Resolution No. 10614 of Comelec, all voters in the 11 municipalities of Compostela Valley who voted in the 2019 Philippine general election were eligible to participate.
Preparations
Campaign
Since March 2019, the provincial government of Compostela Valley led by governor Jayvee Tyron Uy started the campaign to convince voters to approve the renaming of their province. Jayvee Uy's campaign was helped by Arturo Uy, his father and a former governor of his province. The proposed name of "Davao de Oro" was formally launched on March 8, 2019 during the Bulawan Festival.
Organization
Polling for the plebiscite was scheduled to run from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on December 7, 2019. was allocated for the conduct of the plebiscite. President Rodrigo Duterte also directed the police and the military to ensure the security of the province during the plebiscite. A province-wide gun ban was imposed in Compostela Valley from November 7 to December 7, 2019 and at least one police checkpoint was set up in each of the province's 11 municipalities.
Question
The question used in the ballot was in Filipino and voters were asked to vote either "yes" or "no". The question was:
"Pumapayag ka ba na palitan ang pangalan ng lalawigan ng Compostela Valley at gawing lalawigan ng Davao de Oro alinsunod sa Batas Republika bilang 11297?"
Voters wrote "yes" or "no" or its equivalent in Filipino.
Results
The results of the plebiscite was counted manually and was submitted to the Provincial Plebiscite Board of Canvassers.
The turnout of the plebiscite as per the Comelec was around 45 percent which translates to 178,953 participants out of the 410,262 eligible votes. Majority of the voters favored the renaming with 174,442 voting "yes" and 5,020 voted "no". Canvassing was slowed due to inconsistencies regarding the number of votes in four municipalities. The results of the plebiscite was approved by the Comelec at 10:24 p.m. on December 8, 2019.
By municipality
The measure was accepted in all municipalities by overwhelming margins. The municipality of Compostela had the largest proportion of "no" votes.
By legislative district
Likewise, the measure was accepted in both legislative districts.

Omeleto described it saying "Difficult People" is a unique and soulful film, whose singular nature emerges gently but confidently as the story unfurls and builds to a subtle and moving ending. The short has a matter-of-fact, even offhand cultural specificity that captures an authentic sense of Mumbai, but at its heart, the arc concerns itself with an emotionally relatable, even universal, story about family, love, identity and independence." Nidhi Verma of Platform Magazine described it as " Difficult People deals insight-fully with a father-son relationship after the loss of the mother, the economic constraints of the middle class and the ambition of the artist to break free. The story is deeply rooted in Bombay's cultural ethos, and yet universally highlights the complexity of loss, filial relationships and the difficulties of pursuing one's artistic ambitions."

A critic from The Hindu wrote "Suman looks too heavy to prance around with the heroines. Srihari as the bridegroom, who keeps stripping to show off his biceps frequently, is irritating. The comic track is very poor. Musical score by S A Rajkumar is deafening. On the whole a downbeat movie."

The YouTube visitors were in all praise for Suresh productions for restoring and providing the movie for Free when other producers don't even bother of restoring their movies.

The Ramon Torres National High School (RTNHS) (Filipino: Pambansang Mataas na Paaralang Ramon Torres) is one of the 7 functioning public secondary schools of Bago. Located in Gen. Luna St., Brgy. Balingasag, Bago, it provides free secondary education for the people of the city and neighboring towns with focus on secondary basic education.
History
After almost sixty years of quality service to the public, Ramon Torres National High School has undergone an evolution of names. It was originally named Bago Junior High School then, Bago High School, Bago Community High School, and Bago City High School.
With the implementation of Resolution No. 1310 series of 1977 passed by the Sanguniang Panlungsod of Bago City and approved by the President of the Philippines Ferdinand E. Marcos, the school became Ramon Torres Memorial High School. The name of the school is a living legacy of its chief founder, ex-Senator Ramon Torres whose brilliant mind gave birth to the establishment of the school.
In July 1983, Ramon Torres Memorial High School was again converted by virtue of Batas Pambansa 411 entitled "An Act of Converting the Ramon Torres Memorial High School in the City of Bago, Province of Negros Occidental into a National High School to be known as the Ramon Torres National High School."
There had been changes not only in the name but also in there Secondary Curriculum since the establishment of Ramon Torres National High School. The school started with the General Secondary Curriculum. In 1959, the general secondary (2-2) plan took effect. Department Order No. 20, s. 1973 implemented the Revised Secondary Education Curriculum in 1973 and school year 1976 marked the implementation of the New Curriculum as Department Order No. 40. This program offers one elective in the second year and two in the third year and fourth year or a total of five electives which a student has to take aside from his regular load before he can graduate.
The Secondary Education and Development Program (SEDP) or otherwise known as the National Secondary Education Curriculum was implemented in 1989, thus, school year 1991-1992 marked the end of the 1973 Revised Secondary Curriculum.
From a simple vision, the school started with a population of 244 students, 124 boys and 120 girls in the school year 1947–1948. In its Silver Jubilee, the school had reached 2,285 students.
As the school turned on its 50th year, it had a total population of 8,807 students, including its six extension schools: RT Dulao National High School, Rt Malingin National High School, RT Taloc National High School, RT Sagasa National High School, RT Ma-ao Sugar Central National High School, and RT Louisiana National High School.
To congest the RTNHS Main as well as to minimize expenses among students residing at Barangay Dulao and Barangay Malingin, Resolution No. 1430 dated May 17, 1978 has approved and authorized the establishment of the two extension classes which started on school year 1978–1979.
In 1979, another extension schools were again established at Barangay Sagasa and Barangay Taloc. There were approximately 4,000 high school students at the Main School for school year 1980-1981 and approximately 800 of these students resides at Barangay Ma-ao Central and its neighboring barangays. Due to this, the city school administration and city government officials have decided to open an extension school at Barangay Ma-ao Central by virtue of Resolution No. 1886 series of 1980 and Resolution No. 1971 series of 1981. The RTHNS MSC Extension started its operation school year 1981–1982.
Due to the existing cost of secondary education in private schools located at Barangay Ma-ao, the Sanguniang Panlungsod, recognizing the immediate need, resolve to establish a less expensive public high school located at the Louisiana Elementary School campus effective school year 1984-1985 by virtue of Resolution No. 2562 series of 1984.
Just after the acquisition of the school site, buildings have flourished through the support and joint efforts of Hon. City Mayor Manuel Y. Torres, Hon. Congressman Edward M. Matti, PTA Officials and NGO's.
Improvements in the institutional facilities are visible under the administration of the present Principal, Miss Heidi M. Estandarte. Vehicles, intercoms and classrooms were obtained from donations of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.
After sixty years of Ramon Torres National High School, the brainchild of Sen. Ramon Torres, it is now one of the best and biggest schools in Western Visayas.
To better serve the city and its neighboring communities, the Schools Division Office has authorized the opening of additional public secondary schools including RT Malingin National High School - Atipuluan Extension, RT Bagroy National High School, and the stand-alone Bago City Senior High School.

Brian Yandle is an American ice hockey coach and former defenseman who was a two-time All-American for New Hampshire.
Career
Yandle's college career started in 2002 with New Hampshire when he debuted for the ice hockey team. He began as a depth player and helped the Wildcats reach the 2003 NCAA championship game. As a sophomore, Yandle become the team's leading point producer from the blueline and continued in that capacity for the remainder of his time with UNH. For his third season, Yandle netted career highs for goals and points and was named an All-American.

After the Wildcats were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament, Yandle finished the season with the Lowell Lock Monsters. He became a full-time professional player the following year but wasn't able to find a consistent spot on a roster. He became the Hockey Director at the Alpharetta Family Skate Center in Alpharetta, Georgia (a suburb of Atlanta) in 2008 and worked there for over two years. During that time he twice made further appearances with ECHL teams but it only amounted to 4 games over two seasons.
Fully retired as a player in 2010, Yandle returned home to Massachusetts and worked as a manager for ProEvolution Hockey and a coach for the Boston Jr. Terriers. He worked for both until 2015, which enabled him to be able to coach all three of his sons in junior hockey. In 2020, Yandle and fellow former college hockey player Mike Mottau began hosting a podcast called 'The Rink Shrinks'.

Strength is a Major Arcana tarot card, and is numbered either XI or VIII, depending on the deck. Historically it was called Fortitude, and in the Thoth Tarot deck it is called Lust. This card is used in game playing as well as in divination.
Description
The design of this card is fairly constant across tarot decks. The key characters are that of a woman and a lion, with the woman leaning over the lion. Many cards, including that of the Rider–Waite–Smith deck, have the woman clasping the lion's jaws. Some feature an Infinity symbol hovering over the woman's head. Other decks have the woman sitting upon the lion, or merely with one hand upon it. Some decks feature just one of the characters; flowers are often presented on this card.
According to Eden Gray, the lemniscate above her represents enlightenment and spiritual powers, whereas the lion represents animal passions and earthly cravings.
History
The Strength card was originally named Fortitude, and accompanies two of the other cardinal virtues in the Major Arcana: Temperance and Justice.
The older decks had two competing symbolisms: one featured a woman holding or breaking a stone pillar, and the other featured a person, either male or female, subduing a lion. This Tarocchi del Mantegna card (image, right), made in Ferrara around 1470, illustrates both. The modern woman-and-lion symbolism most likely evolved from a merging of the two earlier ones.
Numbering
Strength is traditionally the eleventh card and Justice the eighth, but the influential Rider–Waite–Smith deck switched the position of these two cards in order to make them a better fit with the astrological correspondences worked out by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, under which the eighth card is associated with Leo and the eleventh with Libra. This switch was originally suggested in the mysterious Cipher Manuscripts which formed the basis for the Golden Dawn's teachings regarding tarot and other subjects. Today many divinatory tarot decks use this numbering, particularly in the English-speaking world.
Interpretation
According to A. E. Waite's 1910 book Pictorial Key to the Tarot, the Strength card carries several divinatory associations:
8. FORTITUDE.—Power, energy, action, courage, magnanimity; also complete success and honours. Reversed: Despotism, abuse of power, weakness, discord, sometimes even disgrace.
Alternative decks
The "Flemish Deck" by Vandendorre (c.1750 – 1760) renumbers La Force ("Strength") as XI and La Justice ("Justice") as VIII.
In the X/1999 tarot version made by CLAMP, The Strength is Yuzuriha Nekoi and her Inugami, Inuki.

After Hours is a 1961 studio album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan.
This was Vaughan's first album with just guitar and double bass accompaniment, it was followed by 1963's Sarah + 2 in a similar vein.
Reception
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded After Hours three stars and said that "the emphasis throughout is exclusively on Sassy's magnificent voice. The program mostly sticks to ballads, with a couple of exceptions...and is a quiet and intimate affair, with Vaughan more subtle than she sometimes was. Despite a lightweight version of "My Favorite Things" that will not remind listeners of John Coltrane, this is an excellent if brief set (34-and-a-half minutes) with some fine jazz singing". Awarding it a maximum four-star rating, The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings says that the album, while relatively obscure, is one of Vaughan's best records.

Mimosa tenuiflora, syn. Mimosa hostilis, also known as jurema preta, calumbi (Brazil), tepezcohuite (México), carbonal, cabrera, jurema, black jurema, and binho de jurema, is a perennial tree or shrub native to the northeastern region of Brazil (Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Pernambuco, Bahia) and found as far north as southern Mexico (Oaxaca and coast of Chiapas), and the following countries: El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela. It is most often found in lower altitudes, but it can be found as high as .
Description
The fern-like branches have leaves that are Mimosa like, finely pinnate, growing to long. Each compound leaf contains 15–33 pairs of bright green leaflets long. The tree itself grows up to tall and it can reach tall in less than 5 years. The white, fragrant flowers occur in loosely cylindrical spikes long. In the Northern Hemisphere it blossoms and produces fruit from November to June or July. In the Southern Hemisphere it blooms primarily from September to January. The fruit is brittle and averages long. Each pod contains 4–6 seeds that are oval, flat, light brown and in diameter. There are about 145 seeds/. In the Southern Hemisphere, the fruit ripens from February to April.
The tree's bark is dark brown to gray. It splits lengthwise and the inside is reddish brown.
The tree's wood is dark reddish brown with a yellow center. It is very dense, durable and strong, having a density of about .
Mimosa tenuiflora does very well after a forest fire, or other major ecological disturbance. It is a prolific pioneer plant. It drops its leaves on the ground, continuously forming a thin layer of mulch and eventually humus. Along with its ability to fix nitrogen, the tree conditions the soil, making it ready for other plant species to come along.
Medicinal uses
A tea made of the leaves and stem has been used to treat tooth pain. For cases of cough and bronchitis, a water extract (decoction) of Mimosa tenuiflora is drunk. A handful of bark in one liter of water is used by itself or in a syrup. The solution is drunk until the symptoms subside.
One preliminary clinical study found Mimosa tenuiflora to be effective in treating venous leg ulcerations.
Aqueous extracts of Mimosa are widely used for wound healing and burns in Middle and South America. Consequently, the products of the plant (generally grouped under the term "Tepezcohuite") have become a popular and easily produced cosmetic ingredient in commercial skincare products, used and marketed by celebrities including Kylie Jenner and Salma Hayek.
Other uses
The tree is an acceptable source of forage or fodder for animals, providing vital protein and other nutrients. It does well in the dry season and in drought, while providing life saving food for local livestock and animals. Cows, goats and sheep eat the pods and leaves. There seems to be evidence that Mimosa tenuiflora forage or fodder cause development defects to pregnant ruminants in Brazil.
The tree is an important source of forage for bees, especially during the dry season and in the beginning of the wet season.
Like most plants in the family Fabaceae, Mimosa tenuiflora fertilizes the soil via nitrogen fixing bacteria. The tree is useful in fighting soil erosion and for reforestation.
Mimosa tenuiflora is a very good source of fuel wood and works very well for making posts, most likely because of its high tannin content (16%), which protects it from rot. Due to its high tannin content, the bark of the tree is widely used as a natural dye and in leather production. It is used to make bridges, buildings, fences, furniture and wheels. It is an excellent source of charcoal and at least one study has been done to see why this is the case.
The healing properties of the tree make it useful in treating domestic animals. A solution of the leaves or bark can also be used for washing animals in the prevention of parasites. Because the tree keeps most of its leaves during the dry season, it is an important source of shade for animals and plants during that time.
Chemistry
The bark is known to be rich in tannins, saponins, alkaloids, lipids, phytosterols, glucosides, xylose, rhamnose, arabinose, lupeol, methoxychalcones, and kukulkanins. Additionally, Mimosa hostilis contains labdane diterpenoids.
Entheogenic uses
[[File:Mimosa tenuiflora — João de Deus Medeiros 003.jpg|thumb|right|Mimosa tenuiflora''' syn. Mimosa hostilis]]Mimosa tenuiflora is an entheogen used by the Jurema Cult (O Culto da Jurema) in northeastern Brazil. Dried Mexican Mimosa tenuiflora root bark has been recently shown to have a dimethyltryptamine (DMT) content of about 1-1.7%. The stem bark has about 0.03% DMT.
The parts of the tree are traditionally used in northeastern Brazil in a psychoactive decoction also called Jurema or Yurema. Analogously, the traditional Western Amazonian sacrament Ayahuasca is brewed from indigenous ayahuasca vines.
However, to date no β-carbolines such as harmala alkaloids have been detected in Mimosa tenuiflora decoctions, yet the Jurema is used in combination with several plants.MOTA, Clarice Novaes da; ALBUQUERQUE, Ulysses P.. "As muitas faces da Jurema: de espécie botânica à divindade afro-indígena." Recife: Bagaço (2002).CAMARGO, Maria Thereza Lemos de Arruda . As plantas medicinais e o sagrado: A etnobotânica em uma revisão historiográfica da medicina popular no Brasil. 1ª ed. São Paulo: Ícone, 2014.
This present challenges to the pharmacological understanding of how DMT from the plant is rendered orally active as an entheogen, because the psychoactivity of ingested DMT requires the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as a β-carboline. If an MAOI is neither present in the plant nor added to the mixture, the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) will metabolize DMT in the human gut, preventing the active molecule from entering the blood and brain.
The plant is also used in clandestine manufacture of crystalline DMT. In this form, it is psychoactive by itself when vaporized and inhaled.
The isolation of the chemical compound yuremamine from Mimosa tenuiflora as reported in 2005 represents a new class of phytoindoles, which may explain an apparent oral activity of DMT in Jurema.
Cultivation
For outside planting, USDA Zone 9 or higher is recommended.
In nature, Mimosa tenuiflora "[...] fruits and seeds are disseminated by the wind in a radius of from the mother plant; rain carries them from slopes to lower plains and human activities contribute to their dissemination."
For cultivation, the seed pods are collected once they start to spontaneously open on the tree. The collected pods are laid out in the sun so that the pods open up and release their seeds. The seeds can then be planted in sandy soil with sun exposure.
Scarification of the seed via mechanical means or by using sulfuric acid greatly increases the germination rate of the seeds over non-treatment. The seeds can be sown directly into holes in the ground or planted in prepared areas.
The seeds can germinate in temperatures ranging from , but the highest germination rate occurs at around (about 96%), even after four years of storage. Germination takes about 2–4 weeks.
It is also possible to propagate Mimosa tenuiflora via cuttings.
Trimming adult Mimosa tenuiflorae'' during the rainy season is not recommended as it can cause them to die.

The Blind Spot is a science fiction novel by American writers Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint. The novel was originally serialized in six parts in the magazine Argosy beginning in May 1921. It was first published in book form in 1951 by Prime Press in an edition of 1,500 copies, though fewer than 800 were actually bound, and the remainder are assumed lost. The sequel, The Spot of Life, was written by Hall alone.
Plot introduction
The novel concerns an interdimensional doorway between worlds.
Reception
In In Search of Wonder, Damon Knight is critical of the novel's coherence, scientific accuracy and style:
Groff Conklin, however, more generously termed The Blind Spot an "honored classic" despite being "overwritten [and] leaning a little heavily on the pseudo-metaphysical." Forrest J Ackerman described it in Astounding as a "luxuriantly glorious Merrittesque [fantasy] of dimensional interstices" and "a highly philosophical work."
Dave Langford reviewed The Blind Spot for White Dwarf #91, and stated that "You can enjoy spotting the howlers; in this dotty pulp melodrama and trying to work out what'll happen next, information quite evidently hidden from the authors ..."
Everett F. Bleiler wrote that The Blind Spot "used to be regarded as one of the classics of early science-fiction, but now it is much less esteemed." He concluded that while its opening section "evoke[s] a considerable sense of wonder," the novel "soon degenerates into a routine adventure story with loose ends."

Background
He was the only son of Orlando Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford and his wife Hon. Margaret Cecilia Bruce, the eldest daughter of Henry Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. In 1957, he succeeded his father as earl. Bridgeman was educated at Harrow School and went then to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1932.

Stephen Nasse (born May 5, 1995) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes part-time in the ARCA Menards Series East, driving the No. 09 Ford for Jett Motorsports. He also competes in various super late model events. He is nicknamed Classy Nasse.
Racing career
A third-generation racer, Nasse started his racing career in the go-kart ranks at age four. He won a national karting championship. He grew up watching racing at his hometown track Sunshine (now Showtime) Speedway. As a 13-year-old, he moved up to Florida's FasTrucks. Nasse had his first late model win as a 14-year-old in the 2009 New Smyrna Speedway's World Series of Asphalt Racing, and moved up to full-time late model racing in 2010. He and his family team eventually made two NASCAR K&N Pro Series East starts in 2012. Nasse won the Red Eye 100 late model race in 2012 and 2013.
Nasse was running in the Pro Cup Series in 2013 when he caught pneumonia, keeping him off of the track for two-plus months. After he recovered, Nasse ran in the Pro Cup Series' successor, the CARS Super Late Model Tour, teaming with DLP Motorsports.
In 2015, Nasse spun leader Anderson Bowen on the first lap of the Rattler 250 at South Alabama Speedway. Nasse took responsibility for the incident but called it an accident, claiming that Bowen took an irregular line into corner entry, braking earlier than Nasse was expecting. During a Pro All Stars Series South contest at South Boston Speedway, Nasse was spun from the lead by Brandon Setzer and retired from the race. 2016 saw Nasse take checkered flags in various events, including the Baby Rattler 125 and races sanctioned by the Bright House Challenge Series and the CARS Tour. Multiple run-ins with Dalton Sargeant led to a brief rivalry between the two. In the 2016 Snowball Derby, Nasse wrecked William Byron under caution in retaliation for an on-track incident; Nasse later called out Byron, Johanna Long and Todd Gilliland for moving up by writing checks and not moving up by talent.
Nasse won the 2017 Southern Super Series championship and also claimed a victory in the CARS Super Late Model Tour season finale. The SSS championship came after Nasse started the season unsure of whether he would run the full season, as he had never done so in the past.
He switched teams from DLP Motorsports to Jett Motorsports in 2018 and followed the championship up with an early 2018 championship in the World Series of Asphalt. In April 2018, Nasse punched rival Donnie Wilson while Wilson was still in his car after an on-track incident at Five Flags Speedway. Nasse later controlled the last third of the race to win the Mobile 300 at Mobile International Speedway. At the Snowball Derby in December, Nasse wrapped his car in a Fortnite-style winter paint scheme. He also spent $5000 to hire what he thought was a Roush Fenway Racing development pit crew for the race but had myriad problems with the crew during the day, losing spots on pit road and eventually returning to the track twice with a loose wheel, ending his day in a crash. Nasse, infuriated by the smirks he saw on the rented pit crew's faces, charged the crew after exiting his car over an estimated $40,000 loss.
Nasse switched to a freelance schedule in 2019 instead of running for any one particular points championship. He won the super late model portion of Short Track Nationals at Bristol Motor Speedway in May, prevailing over Casey Roderick. At Winchester Speedway, Nasse led all but eight laps en route to a Winchester 400 win. After leading laps in the American 400 at Fairgrounds Speedway, brake issues dropped Nasse from contention. He also finished first in the Snowball Derby in December, but was stripped of the win during post-race technical inspection for having titanium piston caps in the braking system, something that was explicitly disallowed in the rulebook. Nasse claimed that his former brake supplier, PFC Brakes, told technical inspectors to check the brakes, and the claim was not immediately refuted by PFC employees, although the company later released a statement denying involvement. Nasse also blasted PFC for playing favorites within their customer base.
To start the 2020 season, Nasse debuted a new Rowdy Manufacturing super late model chassis, switching from a Fury Race Cars-built entry. After winning the pro late model portion of SpeedFest in January, he spun Bubba Pollard with fifteen laps to go in the super late model portion of the event. Pollard later dumped Nasse, leading to an exchange of words between the two culminating in Nasse calling Pollard "the biggest crybaby in this pit area." In February, Nasse was asked by his team owner to run the ARCA Menards Series East race at New Smyrna Speedway in an aim to get into the driver development program arena. In his first race at Five Flags since the Snowball, Nasse scored a win at a Blizzard Series race there. After a potential late model stock car debut at the ValleyStar Credit Union 300 was cancelled, he returned to the Short Track Nationals. Nasse also won two Southern Super Series races, claiming a $5,000 bonus for his win at Crisp Motorsports Park in August.
Other racing
Nasse has said that he originally aspired to be a high-level NASCAR driver, but that the organization lost its luster for boring racing, empty stands and vanilla personalities. As an alternative, Nasse said that he would like to run in a World of Outlaws Late Model with personalities like Scott Bloomquist.
Personal life
When not racing, Nasse works as a foundation builder for residential construction. He is a casual iRacing player. Other hobbies of his include bass fishing in his hometown.

Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious is the third album by British extreme metal band Carcass. It was released on 30 October 1991 through Earache Records. This album is the first to feature guitarist Michael Amott and marked the first time Carcass had recorded as a four-piece. Many of the tracks describe economical ways to dispose of dead bodies. Necroticism continues the move towards a predominant death metal sound which was started in Symphonies of Sickness, featuring songs with longer sections and complex structures, more akin to the then-burgeoning technical death metal subgenre.
Release
Necroticism was originally released on 21 October 1991 through Earache Records. The album was re-released in 2008 as part of an ongoing series of Carcass reissues, to tie in with their reunion. The main album is presented as one side of a dualdisc, while the DVD side features the third part of an extended documentary titled The Pathologist's Report Part III: Mass Infection, and a 23-minute interview with Walker and Amott from 1993, recorded on the Gods of Grind tour. Later editions of the reissue contain the album on a CD and the documentary on a separate DVD. Also included in the reissue is a set of four art cards. The reissue is presented in a 12-panel digipak with full lyrics and artwork.
Musical style
Ken Owen and Jeff Walker said during The Pathologist's Report Part III: Mass Infection that they rejected the descriptions of Carcass's music on this album being grindcore. While Owen acknowledges its death metal characteristics, both he and Walker expressed that they are more inclined towards calling their music on this album "progressive".
Reception
AllMusic gave Necroticism four out of five stars, stating that the worthy addition of Michael Amott made the record an excellent guitarist's album. Kerrang! notably gave the album a perfect score in their 364th magazine issue. Metal Storm gave Necroticism a 9.6/10 calling it a masterpiece and a transitional album that every metalhead should own (melodic or extreme) and suggested that people should buy the album immediately.
Accolades
In 2005, Necroticism was ranked number 294 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. In September 2005, Necroticism was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame, being the eighth album overall to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame.

The Rivière du Petit Pré flows south, on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence river, entirely in the municipality of L'Ange-Gardien, in the (MRC) of La Côte-de-Beaupré Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in province of Quebec, in Canada.
The lower part of this small valley is served by Avenue Royale and the route 138 which runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. The upper part is accessible by the Lucien-Lefrançois road. Forestry, in particular the exploitation of sugar factories, constitutes the main economic activity in this valley; agriculture (lower part) second.
The surface of the Petit Pré river is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March; however, safe traffic on the ice is generally from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.
Geography
The Petit Pré river originates in Lake La Retenue in the hinterland of Côte-de-Beaupré; a dam is built at its mouth. This lake has two outlets: the Petit Pré river and the outlet of the rivière la Retenue which turns out to be a tributary of the Ferrée River.
From Lac la Retenue, the course of the Petit Pré river descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments:
towards the south-east crossing an agricultural zone and a small hamlet, until the confluence of the Queen river (coming from the north);
generally in the forest area south to a bend in the river, then east, crossing a small unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: , up to the dam at its mouth;
first towards the north-east in the forest zone up to the high-voltage lines of Hydro-Québec, where the agricultural zone begins, forming some small coils, then towards the is by forming some streamers, crossing the hamlet Petit Pré, up to route 138;
towards the south-east, passing on the south side of the village Giguère and crossing a bay with a length of , up to its mouth.
The Petit Pré river flows on the northwest bank of the Saint-Laurent river, in the area designated "La Longue Pointe", opposite the Pointe Saint-Pierre of Île d'Orléans. This mouth is located between the hamlet Valin (located on the north side) and the hamlet Petit-Pré (located on the south side). This confluence is located north of the village center of L'Ange-Gardien, of the northwest shore of Île d'Orléans and north of the bridge linking Île d'Orléans to L'Ange-Gardien. The segment of upward from the mouth, constitutes the limit of the municipalities of L'Ange-Gardien and Château-Richer.
Toponymy
This toponym has a descriptive origin, because natural meadows supplying shore hay generally encouraged the formation of the first stands on the Côte-de-Beaupré. At the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the arrival of the railway, the agglomeration formed around the railway station which has disappeared today characterized the establishment of the current hamlet.
This watercourse, identified in 1652 as "Rivière du Petit-Pré", has also been designated otherwise. In the 17th century, this watercourse was designated "Lothainville", sometimes spelled "Lotinville"; this designation evokes that in 1652 this watercourse crossed a stretch of land behind the fiefdom under the name of Lotinville or Lothainville, in memory of Isabelle Lotin, mother of the governor of Lauson. In the 20th century, part of the local population also designated this watercourse: "Rivière du Moulin" and "Rivière à Richard".
The toponym "Rivière du Petit Pré" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Eubenangee is a coastal locality split between the Cairns Region and the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the population of Eubenangee was 242 people.
Geography
The larger northern part of the locality () is in Cairns Region with the smaller southern part () in the Cassowary Coast Region. The western part of the locality is very low-lying undeveloped wetland (approx 10 metres above sea level) and forms part of the Eubenangee Swamp National Park. In contrast the north-eastern part of the locality is mountainous undeveloped land rising to Mount Arthur (470 metres above sea level), part of being in the Ella Bay National Park. The developed land is mostly on the fringes of the Eubenangee Swamp National Park; it is mostly used for crop farming with sugarcane predominating.
Eubenangee is a watershed with the northern part of the locality draining towards the Russell River (which enters the Coral Sea between Deeral and East Russell) and the southern part of the locality draining towards the North Johnstone River (which having merged with the South Johnstone River into the Johnstone River enters the Coral Sea between Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point).
The Bruce Highway and North Coast railway passes through the south-east of the locality with the Waugh railway station serving the area. A cane tramway passes through the locality to take harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills.
History
The locality takes its name from the railway station name assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 15 August 1918. In turn the railway station took its name from the extensive Eubenangee Swamp.
Eubenangee Provisional School opened in September 1921. In 1927 it became Eubenangee State School. It closed on 1971.
In the , the population of Eubenangee was 242 people.
Education
There are no schools in Eubenangee. The nearest primary schools are Mirriwinni State School in neighbouring Mirriwinni to the north-east and Goondi State School in Goondi Bend to the south-west. The nearest secondary schools are Babinda State School (Prep-12) in Babinda to the north-west and Innisfail State College in Innisfail Estate to the south-east.

"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)" is a song by Canadian rock band Arcade Fire, and the first track on their debut album Funeral. It is the first of the four-part "Neighborhood" series found on Funeral. It was the band's first single, released several months before the album as a 7" vinyl record on June 20, 2004, to a pressing of 1500 copies. The B-side to the album is a recording of the song "My Buddy" by swing musician Alvino Rey. Rey is the maternal grandfather of Arcade Fire members Win and William Butler.
Arcade Fire re-issued the single on November 29, 2019 as part of Record Store Day's Black Friday event.
Critical reception
In August 2009, the song was named #10 on Pitchfork's "Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s". In a 2012 Beats Per Minute article on The Essential Arcade Fire, it was named the band's most essential track by writer Lucien Flores. Flores writes, "'Tunnels' has all the elements of a great Arcade Fire song: a head-bobbing rhythm section, lyrics that harken back to an imperfect past, a seamless blend of instruments, and a cathartic coda."

"I Can't Drive 55" is the lead single and first track from Sammy Hagar's eighth studio album VOA in 1984. Perpetuated by a very successful music video, it became a concert staple that continued throughout Hagar's tours as a member of Van Halen. The song is a reference to the since-repealed National Maximum Speed Law that set speed limits at in the United States.
It is the 100th song on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.
Song origin
Hagar wrote the song in response to receiving a speeding ticket in New York State, for driving on a road with a speed limit, which was the highest permissible speed limit in the United States at the time due to the National Maximum Speed Law enacted in 1974. According to Hagar:
Music video
The song's music video was directed by Gil Bettman. The video was shot on location at the Saugus Speedway in Santa Clarita, California.
The song's video includes Hagar and his band being chased and jailed by the California Highway Patrol for traffic violations. The video shows Hagar driving a black Ferrari 512 BBi which is later tuned up by Hagar's mechanic, Claudio Zampolli. Zampolli was driving the Ferrari during the video's opening shot, where the Ferrari fish-tails across the speedway. Hagar claims in the commentary for the video on the DVD, The Long Road to Cabo that he burned out his clutch during the video. Hagar drove a 512, but a 308 was also used. Hagar claims it cost him $5800 to fix.
A trial scene is presided over by a judge played in a cameo appearance by John Kalodner. The judge's props were borrowed from director Robert Zemeckis, director of the 1980 film Used Cars. Sets were built and the video was shot during the summer. There was no air conditioning in the jailhouse set, so the cast and crew were hot.
The yellow jumpsuit, worn by Hagar in the video, can be seen at the New Orleans Hard Rock Cafe. A stuntman was used for Hagar's stunts. An exploding ramp was used to throw Hagar across the courtroom.

"I Can't Drive 55" (Sammy Hagar) – 4:12
"Dick in the Dirt" (Sammy Hagar) – 4:19
Chart performance
Additional placements
The song has been a signature track for Hagar during and after his tenure with Van Halen, and is commonly used on TV programs and commercials related to automotive racing.
Most recently, the song was featured in a NAPA Auto Parts commercial, where NASCAR drivers Michael Waltrip and teammate Dale Jarrett are asking Hagar to keep the noise down during a recording session; in response, Hagar asked Waltrip if he could drive faster. Waltrip's car number at the time of the 2007 commercial was No. 55 and he had failed to qualify for some races.
In 2001, NBC Sports had Hagar record a "corrected" version titled "I Can't Drive 65", reflecting the common speed limit on freeways at that time (six years after the National Maximum Speed Law was repealed), for use during Budweiser Pole Award presentations on Winston Cup Series broadcasts on NBC and TNT. It was used from 2001 to 2003 during the broadcasts.
The accelerated version of the song was also available as a download for NHL Rivals 2004.
The song was the opening theme for ESPN's NASCAR coverage for the 2012 season.
The song is featured as a playable track in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and Guitar Hero Live.
"I Can't Drive 55" was an achievement and Easter egg found in Forza Motorsport 4 for driving a 1984 Ferrari GTO faster than 125 mph, in homage to the 1984 Ferrari 512 BBi used in the music video and the "Write me up for 125" line in the song.
The song is featured in an R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 US commercial.
The song is featured in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, when Marty McFly discovers he has returned to an alternate, hellish version of 1985 Hill Valley, replete with strip joints, pawn shops, and in the center of it all, a huge 27-story casino hotel called "Biff's Pleasure Paradise", featuring villain Biff Tannen's face. At other points of the film and in its predecessor, Marty goes back to the year 1955 by driving in a time machine in the form of a very fast car.
The song is featured in the 1985 film Moving Violations when Scott Greeber and Stephanie McCarty borrow a car and go cruising at high speeds.
The song is on the soundtracks of NBA 2K18 and Twisted Metal.
The song is used in the 2018 film Bumblebee.
The song is played when Niklas Kronwall of the Detroit Red Wings and Noah Hanifin of the Calgary Flames score goals at home.
In 2021, Sammy Hagar performed this song live at the NASCAR All-Star Race at Texas Motor Speedway during the warmup lap before the race began.
Pop culture
The American punk rock band Minutemen named their album Double Nickels on the Dime as a protest against the song.

Scott Coast () is the portion of the coast of Victoria Land between Cape Washington and Minna Bluff. Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1961 after Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Royal Navy, leader of the Discovery expedition (1901–1904) and the British Antarctic Expedition (1910-1913), who lost his life on the return journey from the South Pole. Much of the early exploration of this coastline was accomplished by Scott and his colleagues, and many of the names in the region were bestowed by him.

The forward exchange market is a market for contracts that ensure the future delivery of a foreign currency at a specified exchange rate. The price of a forward contract is known as the forward rate.
Forward contracts can be used to hedge or cover exposure to foreign exchange risk, and this arrangement may then be known as forward cover.
Forward rates
Forward rates are usually negotiated for delivery one month, three months, or one year after the date of the contract's creation. They usually differ from the spot rate and from each other. If one currency is expected to depreciate against a second, it is said the first currency is selling at a discount on the forward market. The term selling at a premium on the forward market is used for cases in which appreciation is expected.
What determines the forward rate?
If there is no government intervention on the value of a currency, the forward market will be governed by supply and demand. It is also governed by interest rates of respective countries quoted in the pair. In such a case it is possible that the forward rate provides information on the future spot rate, but ultimately uncertain. What is certain is that the forward rates reflect the expectations forward market participants have on the changes of the spot rate during the specified interval. If the forward rate and the spot rate are the same, forward market participants do not expect much change in the price of a currency over the given period of time.

R v Grantham [1984] QB 675 is a UK insolvency law case which decides that an intent to defraud, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 213, needs to be established for a conviction for fraudulent trading, and knowing that there was no prospect of being able to pay debt when they fell due, even if there might be a distant prospect in the future, constituted an intent to defraud.
Facts
Mr Grantham was tried for fraudulent trading, contrary to the Companies Act 1948 section 332(3) (now Insolvency Act 1986 section 213). The jury were directed that they could find dishonesty and intent to defraud if they thought Mr Grantham obtained credit when he knew there was no good reason for thinking that his company would be able to repay the debt when it became due.
Mr Grantham was convicted. He appealed that the jury was given the wrong direction.
Judgment
Lord Lane CJ, Boreham J and Stuart-Smith J dismissed Mr Grantham's appeal. They held there was no error in the direction. Applying the House of Lords case Welham v DPP [1961] AC 103, under section 332 (now section 213, Insolvency Act 1986) an intent to defraud was established on proof of intention to dishonestly prejudice creditors in being repaid.
Significance
In a previous case from 1960, Re White & Osmond (Parkstone) Ltd Buckley J held that 'there is nothing to say that directors who genuinely believe that the clouds will roll away and the sunshine of prosperity will shine upon them again and disperse the fog of their depression are not entitled to incur credit to help them get over the bad time.' But this approach, allowing directors to keep incurring losses when they knew a company was unable to meet debts was disapproved by R v Grantham. If a director knew there was no short term prospect of repaying debts, it was irrelevant that he thought there may some hypothetical day be "blue skies" ahead.

Calf Top is a mountain in the western part of the Yorkshire Dales, England. It is located in the county of Cumbria, although Lancashire and North Yorkshire are not far away. The hill is a dominating profile in the view from many of the smaller hills to its west, such as Lambrigg Fell and Hutton Roof Crags.
The height was formerly shown on Ordnance Survey maps as 609 metres. The closeness of this figure to the threshold of used in the United Kingdom to separate mountains and hills led to the summit being surveyed using precision GPS and levelling equipment. The height was found to be 609.58 ± 0.1 m, or fractionally below 2,000 feet. The result was discussed with the authors of the Nuttalls, Hewitts and Deweys who all agreed that the hill should retain its current status as a member of Dewey's list of hills at least 500 metres but less than 609.6 metres high. Current OS maps show the height rounded to 610 metres. The Ordnance Survey recalculated the height of the mountain in 2016 using the OSTN15/OSGM15 transformation to a height of 609.606 metres updating the status from hill to mountain.
Calf Top is separated from its neighbours, Great Coum and Aye Gill Pike by the deep trench of Barbondale, meaning that although it is lower than most of the hills in its region, it has high relative height and is a Marilyn.

An Chongrong () (died January 21, 942), nickname Tiehu (), was a major general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Jin. Late in the reign of Later Jin's founding emperor Shi Jingtang, An, discontented with the friendly relations between Later Jin and the Khitan Liao state, often provoked Liao and eventually decided to rebel against Later Jin. He was quickly defeated, however, and then was killed by his own subordinates.
Background
It is not known when An Chongrong was born. His family was from Shuo Prefecture (朔州, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi). His grandfather An Congyi () served as the prefect of Li Prefecture (利州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), while his father An Quan () served as the prefect of Sheng Prefecture (勝州, in modern Ordos, Inner Mongolia) and the commander of the infantry and cavalry soldiers at Zhenwu Circuit (振武, then probably headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). An Chongrong himself was said to be strong and good at both archery and horsemanship.
During Later Tang
During the Changxing era (930-933) of the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan, An Chongrong served as a military commander at Zhenwu (which was then headquartered in modern Shuozhou). He had once committed an offense and was imprisoned, and then-military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenwu, Gao Xingzhou, wanted to put him to death. An Chongrong's mother went to the Later Tang imperial government, then located at Luoyang, to appeal for his life. Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui protected An Chongrong, and An Chongrong was not put to death. It was not known what the aftermaths of that incident exactly were, but apparently at some point An Chongrong was free and became an officer at Zhenwu again.
In 936, Shi Jingtang (Li Siyuan's son-in-law), the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) rebelled against then-emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son). He sent his officer Zhang Ying () to entice An Chongrong to join his rebellion. Both An Chongrong's older brother and mother tried to stop him from doing so, and tried to kill Zhang. However, An Chongrong persuaded his older brother and mother that if he could use two arrows to hit targets 100 steps away, they would be signs that Shi would become emperor and that he would be a military governor. He then hit the targets, so his older brother and mother allowed him to take his soldiers and join Shi's army. Shi was pleased, and promised him that he would be made a military governor. An subsequently served under Shi's general Liu Zhiyuan in defending Hedong's capital Taiyuan against the siege by the Later Tang general Zhang Jingda, whom Li Congke sent to attack Shi.
During Later Jin
Shi Jingtang sought aid from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, promising to cede 16 prefectures to the north to the Khitan if the Khitan would support him as the emperor of China. Khitan's Emperor Taizong agreed and, in fall 936, arrived at Taiyuan and crushed Zhang Jingda's troops. He then declared Shi emperor of a new state of Later Jin. The joint Khitan/Later Jin forces then advanced toward Luoyang. Believing defeat to be inevitable, Li Congke committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang. Shi entered Luoyang and took over the Later Tang lands.
During the transition from Later Tang to Later Jin, the Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) officer Mi Qiong () used the opportunity to seize control of the circuit (with Chengde's military governor Dong Wenqi ()'s having been captured by the Khitan) while trying to aid Zhang). In spring 937, Shi commissioned An Chongrong as the military governor of Chengde and Mi as the defender of Qi Prefecture (齊州, in modern Jinan, Shandong), sending An to seize control from Mi. He also first sent the officer Wang Jingchong to Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture () to persuade Mi to submit, while sending the Khitan officer Zhao Siwen () with An to intimidate Mi. However, he secretly told An, "If Mi Qiong refuses to receive you, I will give you a different circuit. Do not forcibly seize the circuit, in case it creates other problems." This caused An to lose respect for Shi, believing that if Shi was easily intimidated by Mi — viewed by An to be an aged administrator — then he himself could more easily intimidate the emperor with his military abilities. Mi did not dare to resist An, however, and he allowed An to take control of the circuit and departed himself for Qi. (Mi was subsequently ambushed and killed by Fan Yanguang the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), as Fan had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mi into a joint rebellion against Later Jin and feared that Mi would leak the news, and was also enticed by the wealth — which Mi gained by killing Dong's family and seizing Dong's wealth — that Mi was carrying.)
At Chengde, An was said to be diligent — whereas the other military governors of the time often took bribes and ruled according to the amount of bribes they received, An was attentive to the administration of laws and often used logic in ruling on cases. His subordinates therefore also did not dare to receive bribes. There was one occasion when a couple was claiming that their son was not filially pious. An gave the father a sword and said, "Kill him yourself." The father wept and stated, "I do not have the heart to do so." The mother cursed at the father and took the sword herself, chasing the father away. An, finding this illogical, inquired further, and found out that she was a stepmother, not the son's birth mother. He chased her out and then shot her to death with an arrow. This much impressed the people of the realm, and he initially enjoyed popularity. As a result, however, he became arrogant, and he began to gather troops, believing that he could seek the throne (just as Li Congke and Shi did), stating, "The Son of Heaven's throne is based on those who have strong armies and healthy horses, not based on preordination." However, the people began to see him as overly harsh when, on one occasion, he, out of anger, killed his officer Jia Zhang () on false excuse of Jia's committing treason, and slaughtered Jia's entire household, except for Jia's daughter. Jia's daughter, however, did not want to live alone, and sought to share her father's fate, so he killed her as well.
Part of the territory that Shi ceded to the Khitan (which, by this point, has renamed their state Liao) included territory inhabited by the Tuyuhun tribespeople. The Tuyuhun were mistreated by the Liao. And enticed them to join his army, and so large Tuyuhun contingents fled to his territory in or about 940. Subsequently, Emperor Taizong angrily rebuked Shi, and Shi, under Liao pressure, forcibly expelled the Tuyuhun and sent them back to Liao.
This aggravated An, who had long been (at least publicly) ashamed of how Shi had submitted to Emperor Taizong, not only as subject, but also titularly as son. (However, despite public protestations against Liao, he was also in secret communications with the Liao military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Liu Xi () He himself was arrogant to Liao emissaries whenever they passed through Chengde, and, if they were particularly distasteful to him, would kill them. In 941, he submitted a lengthy, public petition to Shi, in which he urged, in harsh terms, the repudiation of the alliance with Liao. He also wrote letters with similar contents to the important officials at the imperial court and the military governors throughout the Later Jin realm. Shi's advisor Sang Weihan, then the military governor of Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), wrote him and suggested that he (Shi) head to Yedu (鄴都, Tianxiong's capital) and take up court there, so that he could react quickly if An did rebel. Shi did so. Once he reached Yedu, he wrote An, stating:
The letter, however, did not change An's mind, and he became even more arrogant. He also heard that An Congjin the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) was also planning to rebel against Shi, and therefore sent secret messengers establishing an alliance with An Congjin.
At the same time, Shi sent Liu Zhiyuan to Hedong to serve as its military governor, to also monitor the situation with An. Liu enticed the Tuyuhun chieftain Bai Chengfu (), who had previously submitted to An Chongrong, into joining the Hedong army with his tribesmen. That, and the failure of Dada and Qibi () tribesmen to join An Chongrong (as he had claimed that they would), hampered the impact of An's public pronouncements.
Nevertheless, when An Congjin shortly after rebelled against Later Jin, An Chongrong resolved to rebel anyway. Shi sent his brother-in-law Du Chongwei against An Chongrong, with Ma Quanjie () serving as Du's deputy. When the armies encountered each other, An's officer Zhao Yanzhi () surrendered to Du (although he was nevertheless killed after the surrender), causing a general rout of An's army. An fled back to Zhen and took up defense there. In spring 942, a Chengde officer opened a water gate and allowed Du's army into the city, and An was captured and executed. Shi had An's head painted (for preservation) and delivered it to Emperor Taizong.

Maine mac Cearbhall, great grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages, died 531 or 538. The brother of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, future High King of Ireland. Maine's great grandfather was Niall of the Nine Hostages, making Maine an Ui Neill. Maine's descendants according to the Book of Ballymote were called Cenel Maine.
Career
Prof. Byrnes writes "In 538 Diarmait mac Cerbaill's brother Maine (the coincidence of his name is quite fortuitous) was defeated and slain at the battle of Claenloch near Gort in south Galway. According to the Annals of Tigernach, a Clonmacnoise compilation, he was slain by the king of the Ui Fiachrach Aidne, Goibnenn mac Conaill, while attempting to claim the homage of the Ui Maine Connacht. In the later king-lists Maine mac Cerbaill is called king of Uisnech. In the minds of compilers this meant that he was over-king of the Southern Ui Neill, but this is probably an anachronism, especially since Tuathal Maelgarb is supposed to have been high-king of Tara at this date."

Kostas Mountakis (, a.k.a. Μουντόκωστας) (10 February 1926, in Alfa in Mylopotamos, Crete – 31 January 1991) was a Greek musician who popularized the traditional music of the island of Crete, primarily with the lyra, the bowed string instrument of Crete and most popular surviving form of the medieval Byzantine lyra. His parents came from the village Kallikratis in Sfakia, Crete. His older brother Nikistratos was playing the lira and so did Mitsos Kaffatos – one of the best musicians in Rethymno at that time – who was to become Kostas' tutor.
When the German military occupation of Crete started, Kostas Mountakis was 15 years old. In those days, he played his lira and sang at the village coffee shop, and later at wedding receptions.
In 1952, Kostas Mountakis participated for the first time in an album recording when he accompanied Stelios Koutsourelis at the song "Arpaxsa kai Baildisa". In 1954, he recorded his first personal album accompanied by the Koutsourelis brothers with the all-time classics "De thelo stin kardia", "O pramateutis", "O argaleios", "Milonades kai mazoxtres", "Sto stadio pou m'efere", "Rethemniane mou kantife", "Harami sou", Erotokritos", "Kritikos Gamos", "H mahi tis Kritis", "O thanatos tou lirari". These songs are a small sample of his music.
Kostas Mountakis played an important and vital role to the popularization of the lira as well as to the formation of its teaching methods. His overall contribution to the musical tradition of Crete is very important.

Markievicz Park () is the principal GAA stadium in County Sligo, Ireland, home to the Sligo Gaelic football and hurling teams. Built in 1955 in Sligo town (due mostly to Seán Forde who single-handedly gathered the funds necessary to build the stadium), it is named after Constance Markievicz, one of the participants of the 1916 Easter Rising, the first woman elected to Dáil Éireann and the first female elected to the British parliament, although she refused to take up her seat there.
A ten-year project to redevelop Markievicz Park completed work in 2009 and cost €2.4 million. This raised the safe capacity from 10,500 to 18,558 (3,585 seated under a covered stand, 14,936 standing terraced and 37 disabled spectator places).
On 25 July 2003, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Unbreakable Tour, supporting their album Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1.

MindGym is a surreal game about creative thinking. It was produced as a CD-ROM in 1996 by London-based Melrose Film Productions and NoHo Digital and published by Macmillan (UK), Simon & Schuster (US) and Ravensburger (Germany).
Development
A client-driven project, Mindgym was conceived and produced by Adam Gee, while working at video training company Melrose to create an "interactive training product that would teach corporate middle-management about the value of ‘creative thinking'". He approached NoHo with the idea as the company had the capacity to make games Tim Wright of NoHo designed the project with a specific vision to utilise the talents of Rob Bevan as art director, Adam Gee as producer and script editor, Jason Loader as 3d animator and comedian, and Nigel Harris as sound designer. After a script and demo were created, NoHo teamed up with Macmillan, having proven that the concept could be funnier, bigger, and have a broader appeal.
Reception
Critical reception
The project has been categorised as "a personality test", "an interactive experience", "comedy self help disk", and "a game". It has been likened to comedic surreal video games such as You Don't Know Jack and Starship Titanic.
Sacha Cohen of The Washington Post compared the surreal and silly game to the work of Salvador Dalí and Dadaism, while describing the personal trainer as a cross between the Three Stooges and Richard Simmons, ultimately questioning what the makers of the program were thinking when they designed it.
Awards and nominations
MindGym won the very first BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award in the Comedy category. The award was presented in February 1998 by Stephen Fry. The other nominations were Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic and You Don't Know Jack.
MindGym was awarded Millennium Product status by the UK's Design Council.
MindGym was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1999 "Puzzle/Classics Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey.

Two Sevens Clash is the debut album by roots reggae band Culture, recorded with producer Joe Gibbs at his own Joe Gibbs Recording Studio in Kingston in 1976, and released on Gibbs' eponymous label in 1977 (see 1977 in music). The album's title is a reference to the date of 7 July 1977.
Singer Joseph Hill said "Two Sevens Clash," Culture's most influential record, was based on a prediction by Marcus Garvey, who said there would be chaos on 7 July 1977, when the "sevens" met. With its apocalyptic message, the song created a stir in his Caribbean homeland and many Jamaican businesses and schools closed for the day.
The liner notes of the album read: "One day Joseph Hill had a vision, while riding a bus, of 1977 as a year of judgment - when two sevens clash - when past injustices would be avenged. Lyrics and melodies came into his head as he rode and thus was born the song "Two Sevens Clash" which became a massive hit in reggae circles both in Jamaica and abroad. The prophecies noted by the lyrics so profoundly captured the imagination of the people that on July 7, 1977 - the day when sevens fully clashed (seventh day, seventh month, seventy-seventh year) a hush descended on Kingston; many people did not go outdoors, shops closed, an air of foreboding and expectation filled the city."
Music critic Robert Christgau named the album one of the few import-only records from the 1970s he loved yet omitted from Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981).
The album was reissued in 1988 with different cover art, and with the track listing altered with the last five tracks of the ten tracks listed first, and tracks 1-5 becoming tracks 6-10.
To mark its 40th anniversary, the album was reissued again in 2017. This version features an additional disc of remixes and dub versions. New sleeve notes were written by Don Letts.

Marxism and Morality is a 1985 book about Marxist ethics by the political and social theorist Steven Lukes. The book was praised by commentators, who credited Lukes with showing the paradoxes inherent within Marxist approaches to morality. It has been called a classic introduction.
Reception
Marxism and Morality has been described as a classic introduction to its subject by the political theorist Terrell Carver. The book received positive reviews from Michael Perelman in the Southern Economic Journal and Alan Swingewood in the British Journal of Sociology. The book was also reviewed by the philosopher Arthur Danto in The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Donnelly in the American Journal of Sociology, and May Ellen Batiuk in Humanity & Society, and discussed by David Bankhurst in Praxis International.
Perelman described the book as "a work of disarming simplicity that brings together much of the far reaching literature on the subject of Marxism and morality." He credited Lukes with "bringing both scholarship and intelligence to his subject matter", finding Lukes's discussion of the wage/labor relationship especially successful. He disagreed with Lukes that the philosopher Karl Marx underestimated the importance of values such as freedom of the press, writing that "the effective use of such freedom rarely extended beyond the privileged strata of society", and criticized Lukes for neglecting Marx's insight that capitalists and workers both behave through "character masks." He concluded that, "Despite its shortcomings, Lukes offers us a useful, though idiosyncratic vision of Marx's theory of morality."
Swingewood described the book as "a notable contribution to current debates on the problems of socialist ethics and moral theory". He credited Lukes with offering "a concise and cogently argued analysis of the many paradoxes within Marxism on ethics and moral theory." He called Lukes's chapter on the "means-ends debate" "brilliant", writing that Lukes showed how "the possibility of alternative means (and thus the need to argue for them outside the framework of historical necessity) was largely ignored." He concluded that, "Lukes's book is an important contribution to the contemporary debate on the renewal of democratic socialism."
Bankhurst praised Lukes for his "honesty and responsibility" in confronting the issue of whether Marxism suffers from a "deep-rooted theoretical incoherence" that accounts for its "terrible record" in political life, commenting that, "In the realm of morality" Marx's thought "does seem to abound in paradoxes and peculiarities." He credited Lukes with correctly characterizing Marx's basic outlook on morality as an analysis of it "as an expression of class struggle" combined with "the dismissal of the prevailing moral orthodoxy as the embodiment of the interests of the dominant class."

The University of Strasbourg (, Unistra) is a public research university located in Strasbourg, Alsace, France, with over 52,000 students and 3,300 researchers.
The French university traces its history to the earlier German-language Universität Straßburg, which was founded in 1538, and was divided in the 1970s into three separate institutions: Louis Pasteur University, Marc Bloch University, and Robert Schuman University. On 1 January 2009, the fusion of these three universities reconstituted a united University of Strasbourg. With as many as 19 Nobel laureates, and two Fields Medal winners, the university is ranked among the best in the League of European Research Universities.
History
The university emerged from a Lutheran humanist German Gymnasium, founded in 1538 by Johannes Sturm in the Free Imperial City of Strassburg. It was transformed to a university in 1621 () and elevated to the ranks of a royal university in 1631. Among its earliest university students was Johann Scheffler who studied medicine and later converted to Catholicism and became the mystic and poet Angelus Silesius.
The Lutheran German university still persisted even after the annexation of the city by King Louis XIV in 1681 (one famous student was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1770/71), but mainly turned into a French speaking university during the French Revolution.
The university was refounded as the German Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität in 1872, after the Franco-Prussian war and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany provoked a westwards exodus of Francophone teachers. During the German Empire the university was greatly expanded and numerous new buildings were erected because the university was intended to be a showcase of German against French culture in Alsace. In 1918, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, so a reverse exodus of Germanophone teachers took place.
During the Second World War, when France was occupied, personnel and equipment of the University of Strasbourg were transferred to Clermont-Ferrand. In its place, the short-lived German Reichsuniversität Straßburg was created.
In 1971, the university was subdivided into three separate institutions:
Louis Pasteur University (Strasbourg I)
Marc Bloch University (Strasbourg II)
Robert Schuman University (Strasbourg III)
These were, however, reunited in 2009, and were able to be among the first twenty French universities to gain greater autonomy.
Buildings
The university campus covers a vast part near the center of the city, located between the "Cité Administrative", "Esplanade" and "Gallia" bus-tram stations.
Modern architectural buildings include: Escarpe, the Doctoral College of Strasbourg, Supramolecular Science and Engineering Institute (ISIS), Atrium, Pangloss, PEGE (Pôle européen de gestion et d'économie) and others. The student residence building for the Doctoral College of Strasbourg was designed by London-based Nicholas Hare Architects in 2007. The structures are depicted on the main inner wall of the Esplanade university restaurant, accompanied by the names of their architects and years of establishment.
The administrative organisms, attached to the university (Prefecture; CAF, LMDE, MGEL—health insurance; SNCF—national French railway company; CTS—Strasbourg urban transportation company), are located in the "Agora" building.

"I Am a Pilgrim" is a traditional Christian hymn from the United States, first documented in the mid-19th century. It forms part of the repertoire of gospel, folk, and bluegrass artists.
The song combines elements from an "[o]ld hymn entwined with Poor Wayfaring Stranger (Sacred Harp - 1844). It appears in The Southern Zion's Songster (1864) and in Hymns For the Camp (1862)." The song references or alludes to several Bible passages, including "If I could touch the hem of his garment" which references Matthew 9:20 where a woman touches the hem of Jesus' robe and is healed. In July 1924 the song was first recorded by Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, an African American group. Prominent musicians such as The Byrds, Johnny Cash, and Merle Travis have recorded the song.

Oakleigh Football Club, nicknamed the Devils, was an Australian rules football club from Oakleigh which played in the VFA from 1929 until 1994. Oakleigh wore purple guernseys with a gold monogram thus giving them their original nickname the Purple and Golds.
History
The club was formed in 1891 and after having success in the Melbourne Districts Association (premierships in 1907, 1924, & 1928), they were one of two teams admitted into the VFA in 1929, the other being Sandringham.
With former Essendon star player and coach, and future Fitzroy and Carlton coach Frank Maher in charge they won a premiership in just their second season with a 9-point win over Northcote in a very spiteful game, 9.6 (60) to 7.9 (51). The game had erupted into full scale violence during the last term when a Northcote defender elbowed an Oakleigh forward in the face and an all in brawl, involving a number of spectators as well as most players, ensued. Under the rules of the time, Oakleigh would have been able to challenge Northcote the following week if they had lost this game as they had finished as minor premiers after the home and away matches preceding the finals series. The two sides met once more in the Grand Final the following year and Oakleigh again got the better of Northcote, winning by 3 points despite kicking inaccurately, 10.14 (74) to 11.5 (71).
It would be the last time the club saw finals football until 1949 when they made it all the way to the Grand Final before losing when a Williamstown player kicked a goal with only seconds to play to put his team in front. They earned the minor premiership the following season and outplayed Port Melbourne to win their third premiership. In 1952 the teams met again in the Grand Final and Oakleigh won comfortably.
Another drought ensued and Oakleigh didn't make the finals again until 1959. They won their 5th premiership in 1960 despite not being able to play at their home ground which was having resurfacing work.
In 1966 Oakleigh was demoted to the second division by finishing bottom of the first division but won the second division premiership by defeating Geelong West in the Grand Final in 1967 and returned to the top flight for 1968. In the following decade they made consecutive Grand Final appearances in 1972, 1973 and 1974; The 1972 grand final saw them defeat Dandenong in a high scoring match, 25.17 (167) to 18.15 (123). The success from this saw the club secure a lucrative three-year $80k sponsorship deal from Transtours in 1975, making it financially the most well-backed club in the Association; but in spite of this its on-field performances quickly deteriorated and the club finished last in 1976 to be relegated again.
Oakleigh remained in the second division for the rest of that division's existence, losing a number of grand finals along the way, until 1988 when they finally won the premiership. At the end of this season, the two division format was scrapped and all of the existing VFA clubs were merged into one competition for the following season. Oakleigh struggled to make an impact in the recombined competition and never managed to move far off the bottom of the ladder again.
At the end of 1994, when administration of the VFA was turned over to the Victorian State Football League, Oakleigh left the Association as part of the VSFL's efforts to reduce the size of the VFA and align it with the TAC Cup (Under 18s competition); Oakleigh's identity was carried on within the TAC Cup from 1995, when the new Oakleigh Chargers club was established to represent the south-east. The Chargers were one of two additional metropolitan clubs introduced to the TAC Cup in 1995 as part of a plan by the AFL to replace the traditional club zones with independent junior clubs. They are based at Warrawee Park in Oakleigh, representing the southeastern suburban area of Melbourne.

The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby is a children's novel by Charles Kingsley. Written in 1862–63 as a serial for Macmillan's Magazine, it was first published in its entirety in 1863. It was written as part satire in support of Charles Darwin's On The Origin of Species. The book was extremely popular in the United Kingdom and was a mainstay of British children's literature for many decades, but eventually fell out of favour in America in part due to its claimed prejudices against Irish, Jews, Catholics, and Americans.
Story
The protagonist is Tom, a young chimney sweep, who falls into a river after encountering an upper-class girl named Ellie and being chased out of her house. There he appears to drown and is transformed into a "water-baby", as he is told by a caddisfly—an insect that sheds its skin—and begins his moral education. The story is thematically concerned with Christian redemption, though Kingsley also uses the book to argue that England treats its poor badly, and to question child labour, among other themes.
Tom embarks on a series of adventures and lessons, and enjoys the community of other water-babies on Saint Brendan's Island once he proves himself a moral creature. The major spiritual leaders in his new world are the fairies Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby (a reference to the Golden Rule), Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, and Mother Carey. Weekly, Tom is allowed the company of Ellie, who became a water-baby after he did.
Grimes, his old master, drowns as well, and in his final adventure, Tom travels to the end of the world to attempt to help the man where he is being punished for his misdeeds. Tom helps Grimes to find repentance, and Grimes will be given a second chance if he can successfully perform a final penance. By proving his willingness to do things he does not like, if they are the right things to do, Tom earns himself a return to human form, and becomes "a great man of science" who "can plan railways, and steam-engines, and electric telegraphs, and rifled guns, and so forth". He and Ellie are united, although the book states (perhaps jokingly) that they never marry, claiming that in fairy tales, no one beneath the rank of prince and princess ever marries.
The book ends with the caveat that it is only a fairy tale, and the reader is to believe none of it, "even if it is true."
Interpretation
In the style of Victorian-era novels, The Water-Babies is a didactic moral fable. In it, Kingsley expresses many of the common prejudices of that time period, and the book includes dismissive or insulting references to Americans, Jews, Blacks, and Catholics, particularly the Irish.
The book had been intended in part as a satire, a tract against child labour, as well as a serious critique of the closed-minded approaches of many scientists of the day in their response to Charles Darwin's ideas on evolution, which Kingsley had been one of the first to praise. He had been sent an advance review copy of On the Origin of Species, and wrote in his response of 18 November 1859 (four days before the book went on sale) that he had "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species," and had "gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development into all forms needful pro tempore and pro loco, as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made", asking "whether the former be not the loftier thought."
In the book, for example, Kingsley argues that no person is qualified to say that something that they have never seen (like a human soul or a water baby) does not exist.
How do you know that? Have you been there to see? And if you had been there to see, and had seen none, that would not prove that there were none ... And no one has a right to say that no water babies exist till they have seen no water babies existing, which is quite a different thing, mind, from not seeing water babies.
In his Origin of Species, Darwin mentions that, like many others at the time, he thought that changed habits produce an inherited effect, a concept now known as Lamarckism. In The Water Babies, Kingsley tells of a group of humans called the Doasyoulikes who are allowed to do "whatever they like" and who gradually lose the power of speech, degenerate into gorillas and are shot by the African explorer Paul Du Chaillu. He refers to the movement to end slavery in mentioning that one of the gorillas shot by Du Chaillu "remembered that his ancestors had once been men, and tried to say, 'Am I Not A Man And A Brother?', but had forgotten how to use his tongue."
The Water Babies alludes to debates among biologists of its day, satirising what Kingsley had previously dubbed the Great Hippocampus Question as the "Great hippopotamus test." At various times the text refers to "Sir Roderick Murchison, Professor (Richard) Owen, Professor (Thomas Henry) Huxley, (and) Mr. Darwin", and thus they become explicitly part of the story. In the accompanying illustrations by Linley Sambourne, Huxley and Owen are caricatured, studying a captured water baby. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw this engraving and wrote his grandfather a letter asking:
Dear Grandpater – Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day? – Your loving Julian.
Huxley wrote back a letter (later evoked by the New York Suns "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" in 1897):
My dear Julian – I could never make sure about that Water Baby.
I have seen Babies in water and Babies in bottles; the Baby in the water was not in a bottle and the Baby in the bottle was not in water. My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did – There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.
When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.
Adaptations
The book was adapted into an animated film The Water Babies in 1978 starring James Mason, Bernard Cribbins and Billie Whitelaw. Though many of the main elements are there, the film's storyline differs substantially from the book, with a new sub-plot involving Tom saving the Water-Babies from imprisonment by a kingdom of sharks.
It was also adapted into a musical theatre version produced at the Garrick Theatre in London, in 1902. The adaptation was described as a "fairy play", by Rutland Barrington, with music by Frederick Rosse, Albert Fox, and Alfred Cellier. The book was also produced as a play by Jason Carr and Gary Yershon, mounted at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2003, directed by Jeremy Sams, starring Louise Gold, Joe McGann, Katherine O'Shea, and Neil McDermott.
The story was also adapted into a radio series (BBC Audiobooks Ltd, 1998) featuring Timothy West, Julia McKenzie, and Oliver Peace as Tom.
A 2013 update for BBC Radio 4 written by Paul Farley and directed by Emma Harding brought the tale to a newer age, with Tomi having been trafficked from Nigeria as a child labourer.
In 2014 it was adapted into a musical by Fiona Ross and Sue Colverd, with music by David Last. A shortened version premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2014, with the full version being produced at the Playhouse Theatre, Cheltenham in 2015 by performing arts students of the University of Gloucestershire. It was performed, again by students, in the same venue in June 2019.
In 2019 the story was adapted into a folk opera performed at The Sydney Fringe Australia from a musical score and libretto composed by musician and librettist Freddie Hill in 1999.

Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time is an action role-playing video game developed by A+ Games and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, based on the anime franchise Little Witch Academia.
The game was released on the PlayStation 4 in Japan in November 2017, and worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on 15 May 2018.
Gameplay
The side-scrolling action game lets players control the anime's protagonist, witch-in-training Akko, accompanied by her friends Sucy, Lotte, Amanda, Constanze, Jasminka and Diana, as she explores her magical academy. There are two distinct game modes: a 3D adventure-style exploration of the school, and a 2.5D action mode involving the exploration of magical labyrinths with three characters.
A limited edition with additional material, including an audio drama and an artbook, was released in Japan. The game features animated cutscenes by Trigger, the creators of the anime series. Scores from the series' original soundtrack are included in the game as well.
Plot
It's the first day of summer vacation at the Luna Nova Magic Academy, but after getting into trouble once again, Akko is sentenced by Professor Finnelan to clean up the school's library. While working on the library, Akko discovers a hidden door leading to a secret place called the "Holorogium Chamber" where she finds a magic door leading to a mysterious world. In the next day, Akko and her friends Sucy and Lotte find out that the previous day is repeating itself continuously, and certain that it is related to the Holorogium Chamber being unsealed, with assistance from Diana, Amanda, Jasminka and Constanze, they try several ways to seal the chamber and return the flux of time to normal with no success.
Along the way, Akko and her companion stumbled upon Seven Wonders of Luna Nova, seven different anomalies that take place after the unsealing of Horologium Chamber. Initially believing the phenomenon to be the least of their concern, the significance between it and Horologium Chamber becomes increasingly evident the more Akko solved them all, as each solved anomaly granted Akko a new magic key which powers enable the group to travel to different regions by using them on the Sealed Door of Horologium Chamber. After running away of options, Diana concludes that solving the final anomaly is the only way to restore the flow of time for good.
While in the middle of investigating the last anomaly of Seven Wonders, Akko meets and befriends Molly McIntyre who curious with the Seven Wonders. However, it soon comes to light that Molly is a witch whose powers were sealed 200 years ago in the Holorogium Chamber, and with the chamber unsealed, she regained her memories and powers. Assisted by Professor Ursula, Akko and her friends locate and defeat Molly inside the chamber and learn from her that she once was a young witch who had no talent with magic and no friends, and used the powers of the Holorogium Chamber to repeat time over and over again as she practiced her magic to increase her abilities, but despite that, she failed to make new friends and after attempting to repeat the entire year using her powers, she transformed herself into a monster, which was sealed by the teachers at the time, and since then she attended the school year after year for centuries, always forgetting the events of the previous year.
After the Holorogium Chamber is sealed again, Akko finishes her task of cleaning up the library with help from her friends, and finally begins enjoying her summer vacation with the others. In the post-credits, Akko rejoices that Molly, now free from the curse, is also enjoying life with her own friends.
Reception
The PS4 version of the game received a score of 58 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Destructoids reviewer noted that while the "characters, story, script and voice-acting are fantastic", the game was a "disappointment" because of the unexciting and unnecessarily complicated and laborious gameplay. According to Hideaki Mizota, this was attributed to the developers unable to fully integrate all elements that made the game faithful to the series prior to the deadline. IGN Japan rated the game 81 out of 100, commenting that "if you can live with average gameplay there is plenty to enjoy here".

RedToL, or Red Algal Tree of Life, is part of the collaborative National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life activity (AToL), funded through the Division of Environmental Biology, Directorate for Biological Sciences. The overall goal of AToL is to resolve evolutionary relationships for large groups of organisms throughout the history of life, with the research often involving large teams working across institutions and disciplines. Investigators are typically supported for projects in data acquisition, analysis, algorithm development and dissemination in computational phylogenetics and phyloinformatics.
The Phylogenetic and Genomic Approaches to Reconstructing the Red Algal Tree of Life focus on the Rhodophyta (red algae), one of the most ancient eukaryotic phyla with fossil evidence for Bangiales stretching back 1.2 billion years. Red algae are not only key members of marine and freshwater aquatic environments but they are sources for important human foods such as dulse and sushi wrap, and have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial uses (e.g., agarose and carrageenans). Perhaps most important is the role red algae played in symbiogenesis. A red alga was the ancient (>1 billion years ago) donor of the plastid in chlorophyll c-containing algae (heterokonta or stramenopiles) that rose to prominence in marine ecosystems after the end of Permian with groups such as diatoms currently providing ca. 20% of global fixed carbon.
Aims
The aims of RedToL are: 1) reconstruct a robust phylogeny of 471 red algal species using a concatenated dataset of 2 nuclear, 4 plastids, and 2 mitochondrial encoded gene markers; 2) sequence plastid genomes and generate transcriptome databases for 16 key taxa that represent the phylogenetic (e.g., class- and order-level) breadth of the red algae, 3) make freely available red algal multi-gene and genome data via release to GenBank and a project-specific web site. The outreach and student mentoring program is an important component of the RedToL initiative.
The 471 chosen species from 294 genera represent the diversity of ca. 6,000 red algal species (i.e., ca. 35% of all red algal genera will be included, which represent all extant orders). The robust phylogenetic framework resulting from this study is the basis for a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the red algae and provides the basis for interpreting key innovations during red algal evolution. Because the chosen marker genes are shared across different Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) projects, it will provide a common framework for a future comprehensive eukaryotic tree. Complete plastid genome and transcriptome data from 16 major red algal taxa will provide a genome inventory to facilitate understanding of red algal evolution, as well as provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses using a rich set (i.e., hundreds) of vertically inherited genes. The genome data will specifically test the relationships among the major classes and orders of red algae. The RedToL team members come from eight institutions including two foreign collaborators and fifteen advisory board members and represent the most prominent active national and international red algal specialists from different generations who use different methods (from taxonomy to phylogenomics) to enhance understanding of red algal biology.

The Palestinian minhag or Palestinian liturgy, (, translit: Nusach Eretz Yisrael translation: "Rite or Prayer Service of The Land of Israel") as opposed to the Babylonian minhag, refers to the rite and ritual of medieval Palestinian Jewry in relation to the traditional order and form of the prayers.
A complete collection has not been preserved from antiquity, but several passages of it are scattered in both the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud, in the Midrashim, in the Pesiktot, in minor tractate Soferim, and in some responsa of the Palestinian Geonim. Some excerpts have been preserved in the Siddur of Saadia Gaon and the Cairo geniza yielded some important texts, such as the Eighteen Benedictions.
One fragment of a Palestinian siddur discovered in the genizah was written in Hebrew with various introductions and explanations in Judaeo-Arabic. The Geniza fragments mostly date from the 12th century, and reflect the usages of the Palestinian-rite synagogue in Cairo, which was founded by refugees from the Crusades.
Though the Jerusalem Talmud never became authoritative against the Babylonian, some elements of the Palestinian liturgy were destined to be accepted in Italy, Greece, Germany and France, even in Egypt, against the Babylonian, owing to the enthusiasm of the scholars of Rome. The Babylonian rite was accepted mainly in Spain, Portugal and the southern countries.
Liturgies incorporating some elements of the Palestinian minhag fall into three distinct groupings.
The German ritual, itself divided into two rituals, the western or Minhag Ashkenaz and the eastern, or Minhag Polin. Minhag Ashkenaz was introduced in Palestine itself during the 16th century by German and Polish Kabbalists.
The Italian minhag, perhaps the oldest Palestinian-influenced ritual.
Lastly the Romaniot minhag, more accurately, the Rumelic or Greek ritual; this ritual of the Balkan countries has retained the most features of the Palestinian minhag.
It has been argued that Saadya Gaon's siddur reflects at least some features of the Palestinian minhag, and that this was one source of the liturgy of German Jewry. Another historic liturgy containing Palestinian elements is the old Aleppo rite (published Venice, 1527 and 1560).
This traditional view, that the Sephardi rite was derived from that of Babylon while the Ashkenazi rite reflects that of Palestine, goes back to Leopold Zunz, and was largely based on the fact that the Ashkenazi rite contains many piyyutim of Palestinian origin which are absent from the Babylonian and Sephardi rites. However, the correspondence is not complete. First, a few Sephardi usages in fact reflect Palestinian as against Babylonian influence, for example the use of the words morid ha-tal in the Amidah in summer months; and Moses Gaster maintained that the correspondence is the other way round (i.e. Ashkenazi=Babylonian, Sephardi=Palestinian). Secondly, Palestinian influence on any of the current Jewish rites extends only to isolated features, and none of them substantially follows the historic Palestinian rite.
A comparative list of Babylonian and Palestinian customs, known as Hilluf Minhagim, is preserved from the time of the Geonim: most of the Palestinian customs there listed are not now practised in any community. The most important and long-lasting difference was that Torah reading in Palestinian-rite synagogues followed a triennial cycle, while other communities used an annual cycle.
Similarly, Palestinian prayer texts recovered from the Cairo Geniza are not reflected in any current rite.

at Air Force
VMI opened the season with their first ever matchup against Air Force. It was the first time the program played a game in Colorado and the farthest west VMI has ever travelled. The game started off poorly for the visitors, as VMI allowed the Falcons to march down the field for an eight-play, 65-yard drive capped off by a 27-yard touchdown run by Tim McVey. Later in the first quarter, Air Force quarterback Arion Worthman found Geraud Saunders for a 57-yard touchdown strike that put the Falcons ahead 14–0.
Air Force only piled on from there, as Worthman found Saunders in the endzone again to start the second, followed up by two rushing touchdowns in the final six minutes of the quarter, as the Falcons went into the locker room with a 35–0 advantage. More worrisome for the Keydets was that starting quarterback Austin Coulling was carted off the field in the second quarter after receiving a hit from Falcons safety Garrett Kauppila. Coulling did not return to the contest.
Air Force continued to pile on the scoring in the second half, as Malik Miller punched it into the endzone from five yards out. Later, Nolan Eriksen added a three-yard rushing score, and the Falcon defense would preserve the shutout, winning 62–0. VMI struggled offensively all day, gaining only six first downs to Air Force's 32. The Keydets had only 55 rushing yards, compared to the Falcons' 473. VMI used three quarterbacks—Coulling, Duncan Hodges, and Reece Udinski—who combined to complete 10 of 19 passes for only 40 yards with one interception, by Udinski. The loss marked the sixth consecutive season-opening defeat for VMI.
Catawba
VMI was hoping to earn their first win of the season over Division II-Catawba in their first meeting with the Indians since 1990. The game started off well for the Keydets, as running back Daz Palmer bursted up the middle on the team's first drive for a 56-yard score less than three minutes into the contest. From there, the game became a defensive grudgematch; the only other score of the half came on a 39-yard field goal by freshman kicker Grant Clemons at 10:28 of the second quarter, giving VMI a 10–0 advantage.
But the Indians managed to turn the tide early in the third, as the visitors concocted an eight-play, 91-yard touchdown drive that featured pass completions of 36 and 42 yards, punctuated with a one-yard plunge by Eamon Smart. After the rest of the third quarter went by without a score, Catawba took their first lead of the day with a 28-yard run by Kenyatta Greene less than two minutes in to the fourth. However, the Indians missed the extra-point, keeping it a three-point game.
From there, it was a back-and-forth affair. VMI quickly marched down the field but was stopped on third down in Indian territory, setting up another 39-yard field goal by Clemons, who had missed from forty yards earlier in the afternoon. But Catawba had the answer just four plays and 85 seconds later, as quarterback Patrick O'Brien hooked up with Sam Mobley for a 66-yard gain which took Catawba deep into Keydet territory. Then, the two found each other again in the endzone for a 13-yard score.
Down by seven, VMI responded again with a five-play touchdown drive that was capped off with a 26-yard run by Quan Mayers, evening the score at 20–20 with 7:32 to play. Catawba went three-and-out on their next possession, but VMI was unable to take advantage, failing to complete on a 3rd down in their own territory. This set up the would-be game-winning drive for the Indians, as O'Brien found Keyon West in the endzone from 25 yards out to put the visitors ahead 27–20. VMI had one final shot to tie it up, but on 3rd and 7 from VMI's 28-yard line, Coulling's pass was picked off by Jeremy Addison, preserving the Indians' upset win. The victory is believed to be Catawba's first over a Division I program.

Championship
The Sacred Twenty were a group of nurses who were the first female members to ever formally serve in the United States Navy representing the Nurse Corps. Officially formed in 1908, the Sacred Twenty made broad contributions during wartime, not only including training of field nurses and disease treatment, but also providing education programs for nurses abroad and professional publications to the field of nursing.
History
Shortly after the formation of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901, the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) campaigned to create a similar organization for itself. Congress officially permitted the creation of the organization on 13 May 1908, where twenty women were selected as the first members. The women were required to be between the ages of 22 and 44, to be citizens of the United States, and also could not be married. They were initially headed by Esther Voorhees Hasson, a former member of the Army Nurse Corps, who was appointed as superintendent. Hasson and the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery collaboratively selected the other 19 nurses, who were chosen from various nursing schools and had training across a broad range of nursing skills.
The Sacred Twenty were assigned to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington, D.C for initial training and were subsequently assigned to hospitals in Washington, New York City, Norfolk, and Annapolis for supervised duty. Assignments were later expanded to many other cities including Philadelphia and Puget Sound. Overseas, U.S. naval hospitals were built in Guam, Samoa, and the Philippines where some of the Sacred Twenty served.
The navy did not provide room or board for them, and so the nurses rented their own accommodations and provided their own meals. In 1910, Superintendent Hasson noted the dwindling applications from qualified candidates to the Nurse Corps, and subsequently pushed for initiatives such as better pay and reducing the cost of applications by foregoing an in-person interview and replacing it with a written essay requirement. Initially, hospital administration was wary about the idea of introducing female nurses into settings without female patients because they believed they may serve to distract male patients. Consequently, existing male nurses, who had not received sufficient training, performed most of the nursing tasks. Some years after the Sacred Twenty's formation in 1908, however, female nurses began to champion this role in the Hospital Corps, even abroad.
Service
In addition to administering medical care on the battlefield and training of local nurses to do the same, the Sacred Twenty also implemented a number of other programs during their service. For instance, Chief Nurse Elizabeth Leonhardt, who arrived at the Naval Hospital in Guam 1911, not only worked with women and children, but also created a training school for local Chamorro women. Six women attended the first class, which was later expanded due to interest. Later classes included discussion of tuberculosis cases and training and teaching of massage therapy. Some training in midwifery was also implemented by Leonhardt, in part due to her own perceived problems with native approaches to treatment. However, some have noted that these concerns may have been motivated by racial- and gender-based discrimination towards women in the tropics.
Chief Nurse Beatrice Bowman, who arrived in 1916, also taught courses in midwifery and practical nursing, which later allowed trained nurses to provide more complete healthcare to the villages they were assigned to. Later, when Bowman became Superintendent, she implemented mandatory inspections of all naval hospitals in order to create a more consistent standard of nursing and to gain firsthand experience of what challenges different hospitals and nurses faced. Bowman is also noted to have pushed for Navy nurses to continue their education and keep up-to-date with developments in medicine by taking postgraduate courses.
Superintendent Lenah Higbee focused on publicizing and enhancing the reputation of the Nurse Corps. She often published articles in professional journals such as the American Journal of Nursing and encouraged nurses to contribute as well.

Vijayasri was an Indian actress who predominantly worked in Malayalam cinema in the 1970s. She acted in many movies opposite Prem Nazir and have also worked in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films.
Biography
Her first appearance onscreen was in the Tamil film Chitthi (1966). Her first film in Malayalam was Poojapushpam (1969), directed by the patriarch Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair. She ended up being a part of 3 of the 6 movies Thikkurissy directed in his prolific career as a director. She also got to share screen space with the leading lady of the times, Sheela in her debut movie itself.
She gained popularity due to her beauty in the Malayalam film history. She was a contemporary of the popular Malayalam actress Jayabharathi. Her most notable films are Angathattu (1973), Postmane Kananilla (1972), Lanka Dahanam (1971), Maravil Thirivu Sookshikkuka (1972), Pacha Nottukal (1973), Taxi Car (1972), Aromalunni (1972) and Ponnapuram Kotta (1973). In all these films, she starred opposite Prem Nazir and the Prem Nazir-Vijayasree pair created the biggest hits in box office. "Theirs was the most successful pair in Malayalam cinema ever, I cannot think of a single film of theirs flopping." says R. Gopalakrishnan, one of the senior-most still photographers in Malayalam cinema. Many of her movies are directed by Kunchacko. At the end of her career, she parted ways with Kunchacko and joined with P. Subramaniam.
She also acted in a number of Tamil films but in supporting roles. She had played an important role in Babu (1971), a Sivaji Ganesan starrer, as the pair of Sivaji who is killed early in the story. She had also acted opposite Gemini Ganesh in Chitthi, a hit. Other notable ones are Deivamagan (1970), Adhe Kangal (1967) and Kulavilakku (1968).
Many celebrities praised the beauty of Vijayasree. "She is the most beautiful woman I have ever met", said director Bharathan to his associate, Jayaraj, once. "She was verily the Marilyn Monroe of Malayalam. No other actress had as many male admirers as she had. No other actress had as many hits as her in such a short span of time. No actress had made such a sudden impact in Malayalam cinema. People went to the theatre to see her, and that is something that has not happened before (her time)", said Jayaraj. He directed a film Naayika, by which the character in the movie named "Vani" (played by actress Sarayu) portrays slight resemblance to Vijayasree's life. "If Jayan epitomised the essence in manly beauty among male actors, then there has never been an actress in Malayalam whose voluptuous beauty compared to Vijayasree's. Her graceful statuesque beauty was almost a symbol of God's artistry", said actor Kaduvakulam Antony. Many actors and directors said, due to the bad fate, Malayalam film fans could not see the great Jayan-Vijayasree combination on the screen. "She was extremely beautiful of course, but she was a capable performer too.", said actor Raghavan.
She committed suicide at the age of 21 on 17 March 1974.
Vijayasree loved children with all her innocence, she used to distribute sweets or candies whenever she saw children nearby.

The Red Shoes is the seventh studio album by English musician Kate Bush. Released on 1 November 1993, it was accompanied by Bush's short film, The Line, the Cross and the Curve, and was her last album before a 12-year hiatus. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. In the United States, the album reached number 28 on the Billboard 200, her highest-peaking album on the chart at the time.
Overview
The Red Shoes was inspired by the 1948 film of the same name by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, which itself was inspired by the fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. It concerns a dancer, possessed by her art, who cannot take off the eponymous shoes and find peace.
Bush had suggested she would tour in support of The Red Shoes and deliberately aimed for a "live band" feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums (which would be difficult to recreate on stage). However, the tour never materialised.
This was a troubled time for Bush, who had suffered a series of bereavements including the loss of her favoured guitarist, Alan Murphy, as well as her mother, Hannah, who died the year before the album's release. Bush's long-term relationship with bassist Del Palmer had also ended, although the pair continued to work together. "I've been very affected by these last two years", she remarked in late 1991. "They've been incredibly intense years for me. Maybe not on a work level, but a lot has happened to me. I feel I've learnt a lot – and, yes, I think [my next album] is going to be quite different... I hope the people that are waiting for it feel it's worth the wait."
Many of the people she lost are honoured on the ballad "Moments of Pleasure", as well as director Michael Powell, with whom she had discussed working shortly before his death in 1990. Composer and conductor Michael Kamen contributed a score for the song.
Most notably, The Red Shoes featured many more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts. The track "Why Should I Love You?" featured instrumental and vocal contributions from Prince as well as guest vocals from comedian Lenny Henry. "And So Is Love" features guitar work by Eric Clapton, and Gary Brooker (from the band Procol Harum), and Jeff Beck also collaborated. Trio Bulgarka (who had contributed to The Sensual World) appeared on three songs: "You're the One", "The Song of Solomon", and "Why Should I Love You?".
A short film, The Line, the Cross and the Curve, written and directed by Bush, and starring herself and English actress Miranda Richardson, was released the same year. It featured six songs from the album: "Rubberband Girl", "And So Is Love", "The Red Shoes", "Moments of Pleasure", "Eat the Music" and "Lily". The first five were used as promo videos for the singles, though Bush recorded a separate video for the American release of "Rubberband Girl" (though this video is intercut with clips from The Line, the Cross and the Curve). The film was nominated for the Long Form Music Video at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
In 1995, Bush received a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Artist.
The album was recorded digitally, and Bush has since expressed regrets about the results of this, which is why she revisited seven of the songs using analogue tape for her 2011 album Director's Cut, as well as releasing a remastered version of The Red Shoes in 2011, based on the master from an analogue backup tape.
Bush performed "Lily" and "Top of the City" live for the first time in 2014 as part of the Before the Dawn concert residency.

The "bureau system" of the United States Navy was the Department of the Navy's material-support organization from 1842 through 1966. The bureau chiefs were largely autonomous, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Navy and managing their respective organizations without the influence of other bureaus. In 1966, the bureaus were gradually replaced by unified commands (generally known as "systems commands" or SYSCOMs) reporting to the Chief of Naval Operations.
Before the bureaus
For the first several decades of the Navy Department's existence, all procurement and material matters were handled directly by the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. As the navy expanded during the War of 1812, it became clear that this system was not sufficient for the service's needs.
On February 7, 1815, Congress established a three-member Board of Naval Commissioners to handle material-support matters. As part of the navy secretary's office, the board's jurisdiction generally extended only logistical matters such as supply and construction. The Secretary of the Navy remained in control of many operational aspects of the navy.
Establishment of the bureau system, 1842
Ultimately, the Board system was unable to provide the navy with the necessary technical and management control. Among other things, naval technology was becoming increasingly complex during the first half of the 19th century, and required more specialized oversight. In the early 1840s, Congress decided to abolish the Board of Naval Commissioners and replace them with a more specialized bureaucracy based on broad functional areas such as shipbuilding.
The first five bureaus were established by Act of Congress on August 31, 1842. They were the:
Bureau of Naval Yards and Docks
Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repairs;
Bureau of Provisions and Clothing;
Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography; and
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
Reorganization, 1862
The system was reorganized during the early years of the Civil War. By an act of Congress of July 5, 1862 (), the existing bureaus were reorganized and increased to eight. As reorganized, these included the:
Bureau of Yards and Docks;
Bureau of Provisions and Clothing;
Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd);
Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting;
Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&R);
Bureau of Steam Engineering (later the Bureau of Engineering);
Bureau of Navigation (BuNav); and
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
Late 19th century through World War II
The bureau system dominated the navy's procurement for the rest of the 19th century and into the World War II years. There were a few changes, often brought about by changes in technology or changing missions.
The increasing role of naval aviation, for example, led Congress in 1921 to consolide technical authority under a new Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), with responsibility for the procurement of naval aircraft. Previously, this responsibility had been divided among several other navy bureaus.
Other changes were more superficial, as in 1892 when the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing was renamed the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts (BuSandA).
World War II brought about several other changes. The Bureau of Ships (BuShips) was established in 1940, through the merger of the Bureau of Construction and Repair and the Bureau of Engineering. In 1942, the Bureau of Navigation was renamed the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BuPers), to reflect its change in mission.
Post-World War II through the 1960s
By the postwar period, the following bureaus were in existence:
Bureau of Yards and Docks;
Bureau of Supplies and Accounts;
Bureau of Naval Weapons which merged BuAer and BuOrd;
Bureau of Ships;
Bureau of Naval Personnel; and
Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
The bureaus' traditional autonomy became hard to maintain after World War II, with the armed services' greater emphasis on "jointness." The complexity of post-war weapons systems was promoting a "systems engineering" approach—an approach that did not fit well with the bureau systems' semi-independence. Other problems related to jurisdiction; the Bureau of Aeronautics' work on unmanned aircraft, for example, overlapped to some degree with the Bureau of Ordnance's work on guided missiles. This particular controversy was resolved in 1959 with the establishment of the Bureau of Naval Weapons (BuWeps), which merged BuAer and BuOrd.
The bureau system largely came to an end in the mid-1960s, in the midst of the Defense Department's overhaul of its entire planning and budgeting system. The bureaus were replaced with "systems commands," or SYSCOMs, which consolidated their functions into broader "systems." The Bureau of Naval Weapons, for example, was replaced by the Naval Air Systems Command, with responsibility for all aircraft, aerial weapons, and related systems, and by the Naval Ordnance Systems Command. BuShips was replaced with the Naval Ship Systems Command (which was later combined with the Naval Ordnance Systems Command to form the Naval Sea Systems Command), with responsibility for all naval shipbuilding. With modifications, the systems-command model remains in place today.
The two non-materiel bureaus, Bureau of Naval Personnel and Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, are still in existence.
Coordination of bureaus
The first body to be charged with the coordination of the bureaus was the General Board of the United States Navy. The General Board had the advantage of being staffed with experienced former line officers and of being charged with determining long term naval requirements and policy. The disadvantage of the General Board was that it functioned in an advisory capacity only. Ultimately, there were several cases of failures of coordination between bureaus, with three between 1938 and 1943 having major implications:
The Iowa class battleship design, in which C&R designed a lighter more compact hull for speed and BuOrd somehow dropped its paper study for a matching turret and proceeded with design for a larger gun and turret:
Upon delivery of the Sims class destroyer USS Anderson to the Navy in May 1939 it was discovered that the high pressure steam plant designed by BuEng was too heavy for the hull designed by C&R, by 150 tons. The metacentric height was insufficient, which resulted in a higher risk of capsizing. Corrections to this class included removal of top weight from the superstructure (including guns and torpedo tubes) and adding ballasting lower in the hull. This time there were repercussions: the chiefs of the two bureaus were ultimately fired, and Congress merged the two bureaus into BuShips in 1940.
The 1940-1943 design of the Sumner class destroyers was protracted as conflicting requirements were repeatedly considered. The resulting design was more than satisfactory, but there was a widespread impression that the General Board had been indecisive.
In 1945 the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations / OpNav created the Ship Characteristics Board / SCB to supplant and eventually replace the General Board as the body coordinating the bureaus' design activities. The SCB had the advantages of direct OpNav authority and of specialized staff who could spend more time on design work, but it lacked the long range planning role of the General Board. The SCB role as a coordinator faded after the bureaus were reconstituted as System Commands and all were moved under the direct authority of OpNav in 1966. In the 1980s it was revived as the Ship Characteristics Improvement Board (SCIB), but without its former authority.
In 1942 the Office of Procurement and Material was created to coordinate procurement activities among the bureaus. The Office of Procurement and Material would undergo several changes of name until it was merged into the System Commands in 1985. At this time the Office of Naval Acquisition Support was established to create acquisition support for functions that span across Commands, and that require a degree of independence in their operations.

The siege of Urgun was a military engagement that took place during the Soviet–Afghan War. Between August 1983 and January 1984 Mujahideen forces laid siege to the town of Urgun, which was defended by a garrison of troops loyal to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (the DRA). The mujahideen tried to take the town by storm using tanks, but despite making initial progress, they were eventually driven back and the siege was lifted.
Prelude
Starting in July 1983, large numbers of Mujahideen fighters began to concentrate around Urgun. The town represented a political objective, in that the newly formed Mujahideen government-in-exile had set its sights on Urgun as a future provisional capital. The attacking Mujahideen belonged to three parties: Sayyaf's Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan, Khalis' Hezb-e Islami Khalis (HIK), and Gailani's National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA). They were joined by a certain number of freelance Pashtun tribesmen, attracted by the prospect of loot. Sayyaf managed to persuade major commanders, such as Jalaluddin Haqqani, to participate in the offensive. The mujahideen belonged to the Wazir, Jadran and Kharoti tribes.
The DRA garrison consisted of 900 men of the 15th Brigade, under Colonel Sayed Rahman, supplemented by some local militias. 600 men were deployed inside the town, and the remainder in outlying outposts. The Urgun airfield, situated to the west of the town, was defended by a reinforced company. A battalion unit was stationed at a fort known as Nek Mohammed Kala, to the south of the town, and another company occupied a post to the north of Urgun, protecting the main road leading into the town. An old fort, known as the Octagonal Fort, served as the main DRA position, protecting the town itself.
Siege
In August 1983, the mujahideen laid siege to the Nek Mohammed Kala fortress, but they were unable to approach it as it was protected by minefields and heavy machine-guns. However, on September 18, the insurgents were able to ambush a supply column and capture a tank. The prize, crewed by former DRA crewmen was quickly put to use, clearing a path through the minefields and knocking out the machine guns, before breaching the fort walls. A 65-strong mujahideen assault party stormed through the breach, after which the Nek Mohammed Kala garrison quickly surrendered. Of the 243 prisoners, most were released, and those who wished were allowed to join the resistance. A few days later, the mujahideen completed the encirclement of Urgun, by capturing a security outpost on a mountain to the west of the town. The DRA garrison were forced to rely on aerial resupply, as all roads were cut. However, the road between the airfield and the town was under mujahideen machine-gun fire, so supplies could only be carried in armoured vehicles. To bolster their defenses, the DRA flew in an operations group led by General Jamaluddin Omar, who redeployed one battalion to the south of Urgun.
In January 1984, the mujahideen began the second phase of their plan, a direct assault on Urgun itself. The plan called for an attack led by the captured tank from the south, together with a concerted attack from the north, led by another tank, and the broadcasting of tank engine sounds from the southeast, in order to deceive the defenders over the direction of the main assault. After an artillery preparation, the attack from the south began, and met with initial success. The tank crossed the minefields protecting Urgun, destroying machine guns on the way, followed by an assault group that overran the positions of the battalion defending the south of the town. The DRA soldiers who evaded capture retreated into the octagonal fort, where General Jamaluddin Omar was stationed. However, the northern attack never got underway, as the second tank had got stuck in the sand. The mujahideen who had entered Urgun soon began to run short of ammunition, and one of the crew members of their tank was killed. The tank was sent back to the rear to fetch ammunition, but some mujahideen saw this as a signal to retreat, and the DRA garrison managed to counterattack and drive the mujahideen from the town. In the morning, Soviet and Afghan aircraft relentlessly bombed and strafed the exposed mujahideen, destroying their tank and forcing them to retreat into the mountains.
On January 16, an Afghan army column broke through to Urgun, lifting the siege.
Aftermath
The attack against Urgun was part of a general offensive by the Mujahideen in eastern Afghanistan. A concurrent attack against Khost also failed, but the insurgents managed to capture Jaji. The mujahideen parties in Pakistan had received new weapons, and thus the insurgents demonstrated new confidence in carrying out large-scale operations involving different factions. However, they were still plagued by internal divisions. In autumn 1983, two tank crews defected from the Urgun garrison with their T-55s, but quarrels over the ownership of the tanks between NIFA and HIK prevented them from being used in the battle.
According to Olivier Roy, the fighting around Urgun still bore the hallmarks of the traditional tribal warfare of Afghanistan. It took the shape of a rapid flareup of violence, occurring in the period after the harvests and continuing during the winter. It was characterised by a lack of strategy, and the immediate goal was the capture of booty. For the Mujahideen guarding the road to Urgun, there was a strong possibility that would be denied their share of the loot, in favour of those participating in the direct assault of the town. Therefore they rapidly abandoned their positions, which explains why the government forces had little difficulty in breaking the siege.

The Acrobatidae are a small family of gliding marsupials containing two genera, each with a single species, the feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus) from Australia and feather-tailed possum (Distoechurus pennatus) from New Guinea.
This family of the order Diprotodontia, which can be found in the east coast and inland of Australia and in some islands of New Guinea, is characterized by their very small size, which has side effects: because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small, heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals (the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio, the harder it is to get rid of heat). Therefore, when temperature drops or food is scarce, they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity (not to be confused with hibernation, which is not known in marsupials) which can last between one day and two weeks. In this state, the animal's breathing slows down, its temperature drops to almost that of its surroundings, and the animal becomes unresponsive.

Emil Carlebach (10 July 1914, Frankfurt, Hesse-Nassau - 9 April 2001) was a Hessian Landtag member, a writer, and a journalist. He was born and died in Frankfurt am Main.
Life
Emil Carlebach was descended from a family of rabbis who had practiced in Germany for generations. However, at the time he was born, his father was the only non-religious member of the Carlebach family in Frankfurt. While still young, Emil turned away from the conservative secular attitude of his parents and in 1932 he joined the Young Communist League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands) KJVD.
In early 1934, he was sentenced to three years in prison for spreading anti-fascist union publications. When the sentence was completed in 1937, he was sent to Dachau concentration camp and then imprisoned at Buchenwald in 1938. At Buchenwald, he was active in the illegal resistance organization. Following plans he designed, he launched "with the call to mutiny on 4 April 1945." He was to have been shot by the SS on 6 April 1945, for his efforts in the camp revolt, but was hidden by other prisoners and survived till liberation. After the liberation of the concentration camp, the prisoners from Buchenwald chose him as their spokesman; later he became the vice-president of the International Buchenwald Committee.
After 1946, he became first a Frankfurt city council member, then a member of the Hessian parliament, where he worked on the Hesse constitution.
Carlebach was one of seven original licensees of the Frankfurter Rundschau, a licensed daily newspaper based in Frankfurt and the first licensed newspaper in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany. In 1947, without explanation, the U.S. Military Government in Germany revoked Carlebach's publisher's license. He was also a co-founder of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes) or VVN.
In the early 1950s a fierce dispute began between Carlebach and Margarete Buber-Neumann over the torture of German communists by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. Carlebach contested Stalin's responsibility; he maintained this position his entire life. In connection with this dispute and later publications, Carlebach's conduct towards those Buchenwald prisoners who he did not consider loyal communists was also criticized. Because of this, his former fellow prisoner, Benedikt Kautsky, accused him of being partially responsible for the death of least two Polish prisoners.
After the West German Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was banned in 1956, he fled to the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, East Germany). There he was a staff member for the Deutscher Freiheitssender 904 (German Freedom Radio 904). After his return to the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (BRD, West Germany) he was active in the VVN, the German Communist Party (DKP) and the Deutsche Journalistinnen- und Journalisten-Union (dju, Union of German Journalists) until his death.

The British Rail Class 799 are tri-mode multiple units prototype adapted from Class 319 electric multiple units (319001/382). The existing 25 kV AC and 750 V DC equipment has been retained with a hydrogen fuel cell added, currently taking up one of the carriages.
History
The Class 319 units were built by BREL between 1987 and 1990 for Network SouthEast, as dual-voltage units to run on Thameslink services. In late 2014, Govia Thameslink Railway began returning its allocation of Class 319 units to Porterbrook (the owner of the units) as they were gradually replaced by units and then ultimately units on Thameslink services.
In September 2018, Porterbrook announced it would develop a hydrogen fuel cell demonstrator in partnership with the University of Birmingham's Centre for Railway Research & Education. In December 2018, Porterbrook procured an FCveloCity fuel cell unit from Ballard Power Systems.
The first unit was converted from Class 319 EMU 319001 that had last been used by Govia Thameslink Railway. It was unveiled on 20 June 2019. In June 2019, it was announced that approval for mainline testing of the unit (branded as HydroFLEX) had been granted after a period of demonstration at Rail Live 2019.
The first mainline testing occurred in September 2020, reaching 50 mph through Warwickshire. The next phase of the development of this prototype is move the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell from one of the carriages and suspend them beneath the train.
A second unit (converted from 319382) was showcased at the COP26 Summit at Glasgow with one of the DT car's passenger doors removed and permanently sealed, the TSOL has also been reconfigured with a boardroom styled interior specially for the COP26 Summit. The unit is numbered to 799201 but retains the car numbers from 319382.

Two Steps from the Blues is the debut album by Bobby Bland, in 1961. It compiles five songs recorded between 1956 and 1960 and seven songs recorded in two sessions from August 3 to November 12, 1960. The sessions took place at Universal Recording Corporation in Chicago, where Bland and his backing band moved after a series of successful singles and albums. The backing band was composed of Joe Scott and Melvin Jackson (trumpet), Pluma Davis (trombone), Robert Skinner and L. A. Hill (tenor saxophone), Rayfield Devers (baritone saxophone), Teddy Reynolds (piano), Clarence Holloman (guitar on some tracks, notably "I Want No Woman," where Bobby Bland shouts, "Look out, Clarence!" in the middle of the guitar solo), Wayne Bennett (guitar on other tracks), Hamp Simmons (bass), and John "Jabo" Starks (drums). Scott also served as an arranger.
The album was critically and commercially successful. It produced two singles, "I Pity The Fool" and "Don't Cry No More", which charted at number 1 and 2 on the Billboard R&B chart, respectively. Two Steps from the Blues was ranked at number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
Recording
Bobby Bland was an established artist who produced several top-ten singles, such as "Further Up the Road" (1957), "Little Boy Blue" (1958) and "I'll Take Care of You" (1959), and recorded two successful albums, Blues Consolidated and Like Er Red Hot for Duke Records. Moving to Chicago on August 3, 1960 to the Universal Studio, Don Robey suggested with arranger Joe Scott, who wrote most of Bland songs, to produce a third album. It was decided that nine new songs should appear in Two Steps from the Blues. Bland was backed by "a tight, well-rehearsed, bombastic, blues band", as biographer Charles Farley noted, consisting of Joe Scott and Melvin Jackson on trumpet, Pluma Davis on trombone, Robert Skinner and L. A. Hill on tenor saxophone, Rayfield Devers on baritone saxophone, Teddy Reynolds on piano, Wayne Bennett on guitar, Hamp Simmons on bass, and John "Jabo" Starks on drums. Starks explained that one side was done in a few days and the second side was finished after a several-weeks-long break.
Three songs from the first session were later included on Two Steps from the Blues: the slow with funky leanings "Cry, Cry, Cry", which was listed on David Marsh's "1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made" for Scott's arrangement and Bland's singing, later peaked at number 9 on Billboard R&B chart as the A-side of the ballad "I've Been Wrong So Long", staying there for eighteen weeks; "I've Been Wrong So Long", on which biographer Farley especially praised Bennett's guitar skills, calling him the "most articulate blues guitarist ever"; and "Two Steps from the Blues", which was initially written by Texas Johnny Brown and recorded as a demo tape. The title track was later rearranged by Bennett, and Brown received a small salary. The big band-like "Close to You" and "dirgelike blues" "How Does a Cheatin' Woman Feel", which was too similar to "I'll Take Care of You", were excluded from the album, but included as bonus tracks on re-releases.
The second session, taking place on November 12, 1960, produced Joe Primrose's "St. James Infirmary" and the moody "I've Just Got to Forget You". The latter was lifted only as the b-side of "Keep on Loving Me (You'll See the Change)" (1970). The third song on that session is "Don't Cry No More", featuring a faster rhythm, later charted at number 2 on Billboard R&B. "I Pity the Fool" was written by Joe Medwick and became Bland's second number-one hit on the R&B chart. The other five songs in the album were recorded before Two Steps from the Blues: "I Want No Woman", recorded on a January 22, 1957 session with "I Smell Trouble", the first was compared with "It's My Life Baby," but had no blowers; "Little Boy Blue" (1958), "I'm Not Ashamed" (1959), "I'll Take Care of You" (1959) and "Lead Me On" (1960).
Reception
The album was released on January 1, 1961, and became a commercial and critical success. Especially Bland's strong and emotional voice and Scott's thoughtful arrangements were praised by critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic calls the album, "one of the great records in electric blues and soul-blues." Furthermore, "it's one of the key albums in modern blues, marking a turning point when juke joint blues were seamlessly blended with gospel and Southern soul, creating a distinctly Southern sound where all of these styles blended so thoroughly it was impossible to tell where one began and one ended." Geoff Brown commented in Mojo: "no song is wasted and hardly a note sounds false as Bland's blues-wearied voice, driven to anguished screams, grapples with the vicissitudes of life and love, his torment echoed and bolstered by Joe Scott's memorable horn arrangements."
Downbeat Magazine listed the album on "50 Top Blues Albums Of The Past 50 Years" at number 5, the compiler of the list noting that ""Bland's outstanding voice, whether tough or tender, is set to Joe Scott's arrangements on 'I Pity The Fool', 'Cry, Cry, Cry' and other priceless tracks... Among the stellar sidemen are guitarists Clarence Holloman and Wayne Bennett", and Rolling Stone on 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 217. The album was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame at the 1997 W. C. Handy Awards.

The Biosecurity Act 2015 is an Act of the Parliament of Australia which manages biosecurity risks in Australia. It was enacted on 16 June 2015, after the Bill was passed with bipartisan support on 14 May 2015. It covers both agricultural and human medical biosecurity risks, including epidemics and pandemics, and is designed to contain and/or deal with any "diseases and pests that may cause harm to human, animal or plant health or the environment" in Australia.
The application of the Act was particularly tested during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.
History
The Act replaced most of the Quarantine Act 1908, which was wholly repealed on 16 June 2016 by the Biosecurity (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2015. The new Act is a major reform of the Quarantine Act, in particular in its strengthening and modernising the existing framework of regulations governing biosecurity legislation in Australia.
As recommended by the Beale Review (One Biosecurity: A Working Partnership, Roger Beale et al., 2008) and the earlier Nairn Report, the Act adopts a risk-based approach, but includes several measures to manage unacceptable levels of biosecurity risk. New requirements include how the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (at the time of enactment, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources) would manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, people and vessels entering Australia.
The Biosecurity Bill 2014 passed through parliament on 14 May 2015 with bipartisan support. The Act did not radically change operational functions, but were more clearly described, with the aim of being easier to use and reducing the complexity of administering it. The main change relate was the compliance and enforcement of powers.
Amendments and related legislation
The Act has been amended a number of times, with the latest amended, as of 25 March 2020, being the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Act 2020, which also affects other legislation. Also related to the Act are the Biosecurity Charges Imposition (General) Act 2015, Biosecurity Regulation 2016, Biosecurity (Human Health) Regulation 2016, and Biosecurity Charges Imposition (General) Regulation 2016.
Description
The Act is about "managing diseases and pests that may cause harm to human, animal or plant health or the environment" in Australia. There are chapters which cover management of risks in several areas, including:
Risks to human health. Human diseases listed in a legislative instrument are the main focus, but there are also requirements relating to people entering or leaving Australian territory as well as rules relating to managing deceased people.
Goods that are brought into Australian territory from outside Australian territory, by air or by sea. It also provides for prohibition of or conditions relating to certain goods from being brought or imported into Australian territory.
Aircraft and vessels entering Australian territory from outside Australian territory, including controlling landing or mooring places and their movement while they are in Australian territory.
Implementation of the Ballast Water Convention, which regulates the ballast water and sediment of certain vessels, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Other biosecurity risks which may be posed by diseases or pests in or on goods or premises in Australian territory.
Arrangements to enable biosecurity officials to carry out biosecurity activities to manage biosecurity risks associated with goods, premises or other things.
Provision for the Governor-General of Australia to declare biosecurity emergencies and human biosecurity emergencies; provision for special powers for the Agriculture Minister to deal with biosecurity emergencies (including the delegation of certain powers to national response agencies; and provision for special powers to be given to the Health Minister to deal with human biosecurity emergencies, including by effecting the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Provision for powers for biosecurity officers powers to ensure people are complying with this Act, to investigate non‑compliance and to enforce this Act by means such as civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions and other means.
Governance is described, including the functions and powers of the Director of Biosecurity, Director of Human Biosecurity, and various types of biosecurity officers.
Part 3 (Section 344) states that the Director of Human Biosecurity is the person acting in the capacity of Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer (CMO), and this person has certain powers conferred upon them by this Act. Part 4 deals with human biosecurity officers. The CMO may, under Section 563 of the Act, make members of the Australian Defence Force, as well as officers and employees of the federal and state departments of health, human biosecurity officers, if satisfied that they have appropriate clinical expertise.
Biosecurity emergencies
Chapter 8, Part 2 of the Act deals with "emergencies involving threats or harm to human health on a nationally significant scale". This chapter deals with special powers which exist as well as the powers available under Chapter 2. "The Governor‑General may make a human biosecurity emergency declaration if the Health Minister is satisfied that the special powers in this Part are needed to deal with a human biosecurity emergency. The Health Minister may exercise special powers under this Part to deal with a human biosecurity emergency, subject to limits and protections. These powers may be exercised anywhere in Australian territory".
Similar emergency powers are given to the Governor-General and Agriculture Minister for other types of biosecurity emergencies, in Chapter 8, Par 1. In addition, the Agriculture Minister may "declare Commonwealth bodies, or parts of Commonwealth bodies, to be national response agencies for the purposes of dealing with biosecurity emergencies", and some of the Minister's powers may be delegated to staff in the national response agencies.
Scope
An article on the parliamentary website explains the scope the Health Minister's powers under the Act under sections 477 and 478. The minister may:
However, Sub-section 478(5) places limits on interference with state and territory bodies and officials: "A direction must not be given under subsection (1) to an officer or employee of a State, Territory or State or Territory body unless the direction is in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State, Territory or body". (For the COVID-19 pandemic, an intergovernmental agreement was signed.)
Invocations
2020 invocation of state of emergency
On 18 March 2020, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, after the National Security Committee met the previous day. The Act specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. The Act only allows for three months, but the period may be extended for a further three if the Governor-General is satisfied that it is required.
The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, made by the Health Minister on the same day under Section 477 of the Act, banned international cruise ships from entering Australian ports before 15 April 2020.
On 25 March 2020, the Health Minister made a second determination, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020, which "forbids Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australian territory by air or sea as a passenger".
On 25 April 2020, the Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, made under subsection 477(1) of the Act, was signed into law by the Health Minister. The purpose of the new legislation is "to make contact tracing faster and more effective by encouraging public acceptance and uptake of COVIDSafe", COVIDSafe being the new mobile app created for the purpose. The function of the app is to record contact between any two people who both have the app on their phones when they come within of each other. The encrypted data would remain on the phone for 21 days of not encountering a person logged with confirmed COVID-19.
Investigation into breach by Ruby Princess
On 5 April 2020, New South Wales Police launched a criminal investigation into whether the operator of Ruby Princess, Carnival Australia, broke the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cwth) and possibly NSW state laws, by deliberately concealing COVID-19 cases.
2021 India flight ban
Late on 30 April 2021, after some days earlier imposing a ban on all flights from India, which was experiencing a dramatic rise in cases in a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government announced a ban on Australian citizens and permanent residents in India from entering Australia via any route. These measures came into effect on 3 May and would remain in force until 15 May. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that anyone, including Australian citizens and permanent residents, caught returning from India to Australia via any route would be subject to punishment under the Biosecurity Act, with penalties for breaches including up to five years' jail, a fine of , or both. Foreign Minister Marise Payne reported that 57% of positive cases in quarantine had come from India in April, compared with 10% in March. The move was branded as racist by some critics, and a potential breach of international human rights law. On 3 May 2021 the government announced that it would review this decision earlier than originally intended, possibly within the same week. There were about 9,000 Australian citizens in India, of whom 650 were considered vulnerable.
On 7 May 2021 Morrison announced that the flight ban would end on 15 May and that repatriation flights to the Northern Territory would start on this date. A legal challenge to the ban was due to be heard in the Federal Court in Sydney on 12 May 2021, part of the challenge was rejected on 10 May.

Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg was a military barracks, originally belonging to the German Army, and later occupied by the United States Army. It lies in the city of Ludwigsburg, in south-west Germany near Stuttgart.
History
Pre-war
Construction began in late 1935, and by early 1937 members of anti-aircraft unit Flak-Regiment 25 began to occupy the site. First to be completed were the barracks and a parade ground. The official opening ceremony took place on 12 September 1936 in the presence of Oberst Kolb (commander of the regiment), Oberst Heilingbrunner, the Bürgermeister of Ludwigsburg Dr. Karl Frank, and other guests. There was a military flypast, and a show was staged in the gymnasium, which included appearances by Zarah Leander and Ilse Werner.
Post-war
In April 1945, French and American troops occupied Ludwigsburg and the barracks commander surrendered. After initial skirmishes the French withdrew from the city, and control of the town was in the hands of Captain (later Major) John Lindsay as head of the American military government.
From 1945 until 1948, the Flak-Kaserne was used as an internment camp by the U.S. Army and designated I.C. 74. Among the many leading Nazis held there were the former Obergruppenführer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, and Ministers Richard Walther Darré and Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk. Between 1948 and 1950 the barracks served as camp for displaced Germans.
From 1950 the U.S. Army occupied the barracks, and it served as the headquarters of the 4th Transportation Battalion, and later the 42nd Medical Company. The U.S. Army left the site in 1992, and ownership was returned to the German Federal government.
Redevelopment
After 1992 the barracks remained empty, overgrown and vandalized. Parts of the site were used as a parking lot for truck trailers, and as a training ground for the police.
In 2007, after many years of negotiations with the Bundesanstalt für Immobilienaufgaben ("Federal Real Estate Agency") the city of Ludwigburg bought the site for approximately €8.25 million, and created a new housing development, the Hartenecker Höhe. After decontamination, housing for 1,600 people was built, and the first residents arrived in late 2009. All that remains of the former barracks are the gymnasium (now a kindergarten), the officers mess (now an apartment building), the guard house (now a cafe) and the main gate.
On September 13, 2015 the unveiling of the memorial plaque took place on the former exit of the Kaserne. The Mayor of Ludwigsburg and many former US Soldiers were attending the ceremonial.
The memorial plaque has the following engraving: „In honor an grateful remembrance of the soldiers of the United States Army who served at Flakkaserne, Ludwigsburg, from 1950 to 1991.“

Peperomia serpens, the vining peperomia, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Peperomia and family Piperaceae, native to the New World Tropics. The plant is perennial.
The name Peperomia serpens has in the past also been used to describe Peperomia dimota and Peperomia subrotundifolia. In addition the terms Peperomia serpens and Peperomia scandens are sometimes falsely used for Peperomia nitida, perhaps because both are similar vining plants. The Royal Horticultural Society has bestowed the Award of Garden Merit to "Peperomia scandens" as a houseplant, however it is not clear whether this means Peperomia serpens or Peperomia nitida.

The PWS-4 (PWS - Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów - Podlasie Aircraft Factory) was a prototype Polish sports aircraft, developed in 1928 by Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów.
Design and development
The PWS-4 was conceived as a cheap and simple single seater sports aircraft. It was designed by August Bobek-Zdaniewski in the Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów factory in 1928. The prototype was flown in September 1928 at Biała Podlaska, by Franciszek Rutkowski. It did not enter production due to lack of orders, as the Polish sports aviation movement was interested mostly in more universal two-seater machines. The design was later used as the basis for the PWS-50.
Operational history
The prototype PWS-4 took part in the second Polish Light Aircraft Contest between 29 October-1 November 1928, taking sixth place. Later it was used by the LOPP paramilitary organization in Biała Podlaska. Among others, it was used for aerobatics.
Construction
The PWS-4 was a single-seater high-wing braced monoplane of wooden construction. The fuselage was a wooden frame, covered with plywood, apart from the engine section, which was covered with aluminium sheeting. The empennage structure was wood, with fabric covering. The rectangular wooden wings had two spars; were covered with plywood in front and fabric in the rear; and were supported with pairs of twin struts. The undercarriage consisted of a fixed common axle conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. Fuel was carried in a tank in the wings, 45 L capacity.
The 9-cylinder Salmson AD.9 air-cooled radial engine was rated at , driving a two-blade fixed pitch wooden propeller. Cruise fuel consumption was 11-13 L/h.

Moses Sithole (born 17 November 1964) is a South African serial killer and rapist who committed the ABC Murders, so named because they began in Atteridgeville, continued in Boksburg and finished in Cleveland, a suburb of Johannesburg. Sithole murdered at least thirty-seven women and one toddler between 16 July 1994 and 6 November 1995.
Early life
Moses Sithole was born on 17 November 1964 in Vosloorus, a township near Boksburg, Transvaal Province (now Gauteng). When he was five years old, his father died and his mother abandoned the family. Sithole and his siblings spent the next three years in an orphanage, where he later said they were mistreated. By his own account, Sithole was arrested for rape in his teens and spent seven years in prison. He later blamed his imprisonment for turning him into a murderer. He explained his crimes by saying that the women he murdered all reminded him of the women who had falsely accused him of rape years before.
Murders
Sithole appeared to be a mild-mannered individual to those around him. At the time of his crimes, he was managing a shell organization, Youth Against Human Abuse, ostensibly devoted to the eradication of child abuse. After committing murders in Atteridgeville, near Pretoria, Sithole moved his focus to Boksburg and eventually to Cleveland. By 1995, he had claimed over thirty victims, sparking nationwide panic. In some cases, he would later phone the victims' families for no other apparent reason than to taunt them. At one point, President Nelson Mandela visited Boksburg in person to appeal for public assistance in apprehending the killer.
Methods
Sithole targeted black women between the ages of 19 and 45 years old. Most of his victims were being interviewed for positions with Sithole's ersatz charity. Sithole would take them to remote fields, where he would beat, rape, and murder them. They were generally strangled with their own underwear. He once inflicted a head wound on the two-year-old son of one of his victims and left him to die from exposure.
Capture
In August 1995, Sithole was identified as having been seen with one of the victims, but he disappeared shortly after SAPS investigators learned details of his previous rape conviction. In October 1995, Sithole contacted South African journalist Tamsen de Beer and identified himself as the wanted murderer. During a phone conversation with de Beer, he indicated that the killings were carried out in revenge for his unjust imprisonment and claimed 76 victims, twice as many as those reported. Finally, in order to prove his identity, Sithole gave directions to where one of the bodies had been left. Local authorities subsequently cornered Sithole in Johannesburg, shooting the suspect when he attacked a constable with a hatchet. Sithole was driven to the hospital, where he was found to be HIV positive and also tested positive for TB.
Trial and imprisonment
On 5 December 1997, Sithole was sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment for each of the 38 murders, twelve years' imprisonment for each of the 40 rapes, and five years' imprisonment for each of six robberies. Since his sentences run consecutively, his total effective sentence is 2,410 years. Justice David Carstairs ordered that Sithole would be required to serve at least 930 years before being eligible for parole, making him eligible for parole at the age of 963. The judge also told Sithole that if capital punishment was still used, he would have been sentenced to death. Sithole was incarcerated in C-Max, the maximum security section of Pretoria Central Prison. He is currently incarcerated in Mangaung Correctional Centre in Bloemfontein.

Wentworth Cheswell (11 April 1746 – 8 March 1817) was an American assessor, auditor, Justice of the Peace, teacher and Revolutionary War veteran in Newmarket, New Hampshire. Elected as town constable in 1768, he was elected to other positions, serving in local government every year but one until his death.
Some sources consider Cheswell to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States, as well as the first African American judicial officer. Others are less sure, noting he was recorded as "white" in censuses.
Around the time of his marriage, Wentworth purchased a plot of land from his father Hopestill. His grandfather Richard is believed to be the first African American in New Hampshire to own land. A deed shows that Richard purchased from the Hilton grant in 1717. In 1801, Wentworth was among the founders of the first library in the town and provided in his will for public access to his personal library.
Early life and education
Wentworth was the only child born in Newmarket, New Hampshire, to Hopestill Cheswell, a free black man of biracial ancestry, and his wife, Katherine (Keniston) Cheswell, a white woman. The senior Cheswell was a master housewright and carpenter who worked mostly in the thriving city of Portsmouth. Among other projects, Cheswell helped to build the Bell Tavern in 1743 on Congress Street and the John Paul Jones House, originally owned by Captain Gregory Purcell and now a designated National Historic Landmark. The Jones house was an example of classic mid-eighteenth century elite housing. The Jones House for years served (and continues to) as the Portsmouth Historical Society Museum. Cheswell also built the Samuel Langdon House, which was moved to Sturbridge Village; it is a central exhibit demonstrating 18th-century construction technology.
Hopestill Cheswell was born free to a white mother and Richard Cheswell, an indentured black laborer in Exeter, New Hampshire, who was the first Cheswell recorded in New England. (Because his mother was free, the boy was free, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children followed the mother's status, which was incorporated into slave law in the colonies.) After completing his servitude, Richard Cheswell purchased of land from the Hilton Grant. The deed, dated 18 October 1717, is the earliest known deed showing land ownership by a black man in present-day New Hampshire. The land was located in what was to become the town of Newmarket. Hopestill was the only known child of this union.
Hopestill Cheswell earned enough as a housewright to purchase a total of more than of land between 1773 and 1749, which he farmed while working as a housewright. Later, he had part ownership of a sawmill and stream in Durham, New Hampshire, as well as "mill privilege" at another falls, to handle his need for lumber. His prosperity helped provide for his son's education.
He sent his son Wentworth to Governor Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts. There the youth studied with the Harvard graduate William Moody, who taught the classical subjects of Latin and Greek, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as swimming and horsemanship.
As Erik Tuveson noted in his master's thesis on the first three generations of Cheswells, the youth's education was:
an unusual privilege for a country boy of that time. Few people of the colonial era were formally educated, mostly due to cost and lack of inexpensive public schooling. Education of any formal sort in colonial New England carried a significant degree of elite social status.
Early career
After completing his education, Wentworth Cheswell returned to Newmarket to become a schoolmaster. In 1765, he purchased his first parcel of land from his father. By early 1767, he was an established landowner with more than and held a pew in the meetinghouse. By 1770, he owned .
Cheswill was first elected to public office in 1768 as the town constable, and later was elected to local offices every year (except for 1788) until his death in 1817, to positions such as town selectman, auditor, assessor, and others. In 2008, George Mason University in Virginia declared Wentworth Cheswell to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States. He preceded Alexander Twilight of Vermont (1836), Joseph Hayne Rainey of South Carolina (1870), and John Mercer Langston of Virginia (1888) for the title.
Marriage and family
Cheswell married 17-year-old Mary Davis of Durham on 13 September 1767. Eleven months later, the first of their 13 children was born. Their children were: Paul (1768), Thomas (1770), Samuel (1772), Sarah (1774), Mary (1775), Elizabeth (1778), Nancy (1780), Mehitable (1782), William (1785), a daughter (name unknown) (1785), Martha (1788), a daughter (name unknown) (1792), and Abigail (1792).
Son Thomas Cheswell attended Phillips Exeter Academy and later became a deacon. Thomas' wife and children remained in Newmarket, and are buried in Riverside Cemetery.
Revolutionary War
During the American Revolutionary War, the citizens of Newmarket, including Cheswell, were unequivocally for the patriotic cause. In April 1776, along with 162 other Newmarket men, Cheswell signed the Association Test. Patriots collected signatures of people opposed to what they considered the hostile actions by the British fleets and armies. The abundance of the returns gave the signers of the Declaration of Independence assurance that their acts would be sanctioned and upheld by most of the colonists.
He was elected town messenger for the Committee of Safety, which entrusted him to carry news to and from the Provincial Committee at Exeter. On 13 December 1774, Paul Revere was dispatched to Portsmouth to warn the town that the British warships, frigate and the sloop of war Canseau, were on their way to reinforce Fort William and Mary (known as "The Castle") and seize its powder and arms. When Portsmouth asked for help from neighboring communities, Newmarket held a town meeting to decide on their response. Townsmen voted to send 30 armed men to Portsmouth. Cheswell rode to Exeter to receive instructions from the Provincial committee on where the men were to be sent. He was also with the party which built rafts to defend Portsmouth Harbor.
On the morning of 14 December 1774, John Langdon made his way through Portsmouth with a drummer, collecting a crowd to descend on the fort. Several hundred men responded to his call, setting out for The Castle by way of the Piscataqua River. The colonists removed 100 barrels of gun powder, light cannons, and small arms. These captured supplies were later used by New Hampshire's forces against the British military, including at the Siege of Boston.
As a private, Cheswell served under Langdon in a select company called "Langdon's Company of Light Horse Volunteers", which helped to bolster the Continental Army at the Saratoga campaign. Langdon's company of Light Horse Volunteers made the 250-mile march to Saratoga, New York, to join with the Continental Army under General Horatio Gates, defeating British General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga, which was the first major American victory in the Revolution. Cheswell's only military service ended 31 October 1777. As with many other men, he served for a limited time, as his family was dependent on him for support.
Local leader
After his service in the war, Cheswell returned to Newmarket and continued his work in town affairs. He also ran a store next to the school house. Cheswell supported his family as a teacher, and was elected and appointed to serve in local government for all but one year of the remainder of his life, as selectman, auditor, assessor, scrivener, and other roles. In 1778, Cheswell was elected to the convention to draft New Hampshire's first constitution, but he was unable to attend.
He was interested in artifacts from the town and wrote about his studies; he has been called the first archeologist in New Hampshire for his work. The scholars W. Dennis Chesley and Mary B. Mcallister have said, "Cheswell's writings clearly contain the seeds of modern archaeological theory. His eighteenth century fieldwork and reports, limited though they were, justify calling him New Hampshire's first archaeologist." Unfortunately The New Hampshire Archaeological Society has not taken the step to officially bestow the honor to him.
In 1801, Cheswell and other men established the first library in Newmarket, the Newmarket Social Library. Of the estates of men who started the library, Cheswill's was valued the highest at over $13,000. In his will he stated,
I also order and direct that my Library and collection of Manuscripts be kept safe and together…if any should desire the use of any of the books and give caution to return the same again in reasonable time, they may be lent out to them, provided that only one book be out of said Library in the hands of any one at the same time.
Cheswell was a self-appointed town historian. As scrivener, he copied many of the town records from 1727, including two regional Congregational Church meetings. He collected stories and took notes of town events as they occurred. Jeremy Belknap, who wrote a three-volume History of New Hampshire, quoted Cheswill more than once at length in his work, and credited him for his local histories. They corresponded several times.
In 1805, Cheswell was elected as the Justice of the Peace for Rockingham County, making him the first African-American judge in U.S. history. In that position, he executed deeds, wills, and legal documents, and was a justice in the trial of causes. He served as Justice until typhus fever caused his death on 8 March 1817, a month before his 71st birthday.
In his will, Cheswell requested that:
<blockquote>the burying place in the orchard near my dwelling house be fenced with rocks, as I have laid out (if I should not live to finish it) and grave stones be provided for the graves therein....His original will is available to view at NH Records and Archives located at 9 Ratification Way in Concord, NH.
His daughter Martha, as his last surviving heir, provided the following in her will:
<blockquote>the burying yard at my farm as now fenced in, for a burying place for all my connections and their descendants forever…on the express condition that they and their heirs and assigns shall forever maintain and support the fence around said burying yard in as good condition as it now is.... Her original will is available to view at NH Records and Archives located at 9 Ratification Way in Concord, NH.
Legacy
In 1820, shortly after Cheswill died, the New Hampshire Senator David L. Morril used him as a positive example of the contributions of mixed-race persons in a speech to the United States Congress regarding the negative effects of discriminatory racial legislation. Morril opposed a bill to forbid mulatto persons to become citizens of Missouri. In his speech Morril noted,
"In New Hampshire there was a yellow man by the name of Cheswell [sic], who, with his family, were respectable in points of abilities, property and character. He held some of the first offices in the town in which he resided, was appointed Justice of the Peace for that county, and was perfectly competent to perform with ability all the duties of his various offices in the most prompt, accurate, and acceptable manner." Angrily, Morril added, "But this family are forbidden to enter and live in Missouri."
Note: Cheswell was listed as white on the census, but Morril's reference suggests he was considered mulatto by some contemporaries.
Wentworth's grandfather Richard Cheswell, a former slave of African ancestry, is the first known resident by that surname in New England; all descendants share his African ancestry, as well as that of his English wife. PBS Frontline discussed the Cheswell family as among mixed-race American families in Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, associated with its program Secret Daughter (1996), based on June Cross' memoir.
In 2006, Cheswell descendants and other New England residents raised funds to restore or replicate the Cheswell gravestones. In addition, they and members of the New Hampshire Old Graveyard Association worked to clean up the old Cheswell gravesite. Some Cheswell descendants, whose families have identified as white for many generations, discovered their connection to the Cheswells and African-American heritage due to publicity in 2002 and following years of research about Wentworth Cheswell done by Rich Alperin, a local resident. He also brought notice to an unpublished master's thesis by Erik R. Tuveson about the first three generations of Cheswells and other people of color in New Hampshire. It is available at the University of New Hampshire.
In 2007, a New Hampshire historical marker (number 209) highlighting Wentworth's accomplishments was erected at the Cheswell gravesite in Newmarket.

The Kuravar is an ethnic Tamil community native to the Kurinji mountain region of Kerala, India.
Etymology
The "Kuravar" is a Tamil word which means "hill-dweller" or "hunter". It is a polite version of the term Kuruvikkaranka, which they are known by in some locations. The name Kuruvikkaranka refers to how Kuravar men hunt small fowl called kuruvi. They are also called Narikkuravanka, which refers to how Kuruvars are believed to hunt and eat jackals, which are animals more despised than dogs in Tamil Nadu.
History
Kuravars are considered to be an untouchable caste, and occupy the lowest status among Tamil untouchable castes; they are considered untouchable even to the other Tamil untouchables themselves. They keep and consume pigs, which are avoided by many other castes due to how pigs consume large amounts of human feces. Notably, they hunt and consume crows, which are avoided by other castes due to crows being considered "birds of death" who consume carrion.
During British rule in India they were placed under Criminal Tribes Act 1871, hence stigmatized for a long time, after Independence however they were denotified in 1952, though the stigma continues.
They are nomadic people, who have no permanent homes. They move throughout a certain territory with their rag-tents, and are commonly found at train stations, bus stops, markets, festivals, and cross-roads. For a living they sell trinkets, but are also believed to live off petty theft and prostitution.
Kuravar women traditionally wear a skirt and blouse, which is considered immodest in comparison to the sari. In urban locations, Kuravar women scavenge food daily by going through garbage bins and gathering rice from thrown away spittle leaves.
Politics
Kuravars are a Scheduled caste in Tamil Nadu.

Phosphorus pentachloride is the chemical compound with the formula PCl5. It is one of the most important phosphorus chlorides, others being PCl3 and POCl3. PCl5 finds use as a chlorinating reagent. It is a colourless, water-sensitive and moisture-sensitive solid, although commercial samples can be yellowish and contaminated with hydrogen chloride.
Structure
The structures for the phosphorus chlorides are invariably consistent with VSEPR theory. The structure of PCl5 depends on its environment. Gaseous and molten PCl5 is a neutral molecule with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and (D3h) symmetry. The hypervalent nature of this species (as well as of , see below) can be explained with the inclusion of non-bonding molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or resonance (valence bond theory). This trigonal bipyramidal structure persists in nonpolar solvents, such as CS2 and CCl4. In the solid state PCl5 is an ionic compound, formulated .
In solutions of polar solvents, PCl5 undergoes self-ionization. Dilute solutions dissociate according to the following equilibrium:
PCl5 + Cl−
At higher concentrations, a second equilibrium becomes more prevalent:
2 PCl5 +
The cation and the anion are tetrahedral and octahedral, respectively. At one time, PCl5 in solution was thought to form a dimeric structure, P2Cl10, but this suggestion is not supported by Raman spectroscopic measurements.
Related pentachlorides
AsCl5 and SbCl5 also adopt trigonal bipyramidal structures. The relevant bond distances are 211 pm (As−Cleq), 221 pm (As−Clax), 227 pm (Sb−Cleq), and 233.3 pm (Sb−Clax). At low temperatures, SbCl5 converts to the dimer, dioctahedral Sb2Cl10, structurally related to niobium pentachloride.
Preparation
PCl5 is prepared by the chlorination of PCl3. This reaction is used to produce around 10,000 tonnes of PCl5 per year (as of 2000).
PCl3 + Cl2 PCl5 (ΔH = −124 kJ/mol)
PCl5 exists in equilibrium with PCl3 and chlorine, and at 180 °C the degree of dissociation is about 40%. Because of this equilibrium, samples of PCl5 often contain chlorine, which imparts a greenish coloration.
Reactions
Hydrolysis
In its most characteristic reaction, PCl5 reacts upon contact with water to release hydrogen chloride and give phosphorus oxides. The first hydrolysis product is phosphorus oxychloride:
PCl5 + H2O → POCl3 + 2 HCl
In hot water, hydrolysis proceeds completely to orthophosphoric acid:
PCl5 + 4 H2O → H3PO4 + 5 HCl
Lewis acidity
Phosphorus pentachloride is a Lewis acid. This property underpins many of its characteristic reactions, autoionization, chlorinations, hydrolysis. A well studied adduct is PCl5(pyridine).
Chlorination of organic compounds
In synthetic chemistry, two classes of chlorination are usually of interest: oxidative chlorinations and substitutive chlorinations. Oxidative chlorinations entail the transfer of Cl2 from the reagent to the substrate. Substitutive chlorinations entail replacement of O or OH groups with chloride. PCl5 can be used for both processes.
Upon treatment with PCl5, carboxylic acids convert to the corresponding acyl chloride. The following mechanism has been proposed:
It also converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides. Thionyl chloride is more commonly used in the laboratory because the resultant sulfur dioxide is more easily separated from the organic products than is POCl3.
PCl5 reacts with a tertiary amide, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), to give dimethylchloromethyleneammonium chloride, which is called the Vilsmeier reagent, [(CH3)2N=CClH]Cl. More typically, a related salt is generated from the reaction of DMF and POCl3. Such reagents are useful in the preparation of derivatives of benzaldehyde by formylation and for the conversion of C−OH groups into C−Cl groups.
It is especially renowned for the conversion of C=O groups to CCl2 groups. For example, benzophenone and phosphorus pentachloride react to give the diphenyldichloromethane:
(C6H5)2CO + PCl5 → (C6H5)2CCl2 + POCl3
The electrophilic character of PCl5 is highlighted by its reaction with styrene to give, after hydrolysis, phosphonic acid derivatives.
Comparison with related reagents
Both PCl3 and PCl5 convert R3COH groups to the chloride R3CCl. The pentachloride is however a source of chlorine in many reactions. It chlorinates allylic and benzylic CH bonds. PCl5 bears a greater resemblance to SO2Cl2, also a source of Cl2. For oxidative chlorinations on the laboratory scale, sulfuryl chloride is often preferred over PCl5 since the gaseous SO2 by-product is readily separated.
Chlorination of inorganic compounds
As for the reactions with organic compounds, the use of PCl5 has been superseded by SO2Cl2. The reaction of phosphorus pentoxide and PCl5 produces POCl3 :
6 PCl5 + P4O10 → 10 POCl3
PCl5 chlorinates nitrogen dioxide to form unstable nitryl chloride:
PCl5 + 2 NO2 → PCl3 + 2 NO2Cl
2 NO2Cl → 2 NO2 + Cl2
PCl5 is a precursor for lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6. Lithium hexafluorophosphate is a commonly employed salt in electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. is produced by the reaction of with lithium fluoride, with lithium chloride as a side product:
PCl5 + 6 LiF → LiPF6 + 5 LiCl
Safety
PCl5 is a dangerous substance as it reacts violently with water. It is also corrosive when in contact with skin and can be fatal when inhaled.
History
Phosphorus pentachloride was first prepared in 1808 by the English chemist Humphry Davy. Davy's analysis of phosphorus pentachloride was inaccurate; the first accurate analysis was provided in 1816 by the French chemist Pierre Louis Dulong.

United Nations Security Council resolution 690, adopted unanimously on 29 April 1991, after recalling resolutions 621 (1988) and 658 (1990) and noting a report by the Secretary-General on the situation in Western Sahara, the Council approved the report and decided to establish the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) in accordance with the Secretary-General's recommendations. The Mission was to implement the Settlement Plan for a referendum of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara.
The Council called upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Mission, expressing its full support to him and the Organisation of African Unity for their efforts. It also decided that the transitional period will begin no later than sixteen weeks after the General Assembly approves the budget of MINURSO. In May 1991, the General Assembly approved the budget.
A ceasefire came into effect on 6 September 1991, and MINURSO was deployed thereafter.

Badmaash Company () is a 2010 Hindi-language crime comedy film written and directed by actor Parmeet Sethi and produced by Aditya Chopra. The film stars Shahid Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film was released on 7 May 2010 under the banner of Yash Raj Films, and was a commercial success at the box office.
Plot
In 1994 middle-class Bombay, three ordinary youngsters, Karan, Zing and Chandu graduate from college and go for a trip to Bangkok, Thailand, where they meet Bulbul and they start a business together. Karan eventually falls in love with her. Karan tells her that he always wanted to start his own business but his father Sajjan Kapoor wants him to study MBA. On the other hand, Bulbul confesses that she wants to be a supermodel and advises Karan that he does not need a large amount of money to start a business, but a big "idea". Back in India, Sajjan has a heart attack. Karan's mother Maya pawns her jewelry in order to arrange some amount of money for better facilities and an AC room at the hospital as his insurance could only afford a Non-AC room. This leaves Karan heart-broken, and he immediately decides to get rich by any means, he decides to start his own venture along with his friends. He comes up with an idea for smuggling branded Reebok shoes in India without any customs charges.
For this, they have to separate the consignment into two-halves, one half with only left shoes in Calcutta and the other half with only right shoes in Madras. At both places, the buyer will refuse to receive the consignment, hence the entire consignment will be confiscated. The confiscated consignment will then be auctioned in which Chandu (in Calcutta) and Karan (in Madras) will buy the entire consignment, pretending they are scrap dealers. Once the right shoes pair up with left shoes, the zero-valued product comes into a full value which can be sold at any profit without any customs charges. They name their venture "Friends and Company" and proceed to make a large fortune with it. When Karan is caught red-handed by Sajjan while putting away the black money, he explains the situation, including the fact that he is doing business with a smuggler. As a result, he is forced to leave the house and starts living with Bulbul and uses her to get contracts. After the government in India decides to reduce the import duty on foreign goods (including shoes), the friends decide to go to America. They get help from Karan's Uncle Jazz. They do the same business in the US as they did in India, only this time they import leather gloves. Soon, the group becomes excessively rich and starts to live royally. Zing meets Linda, who begin a relationship but Zing's alcoholism strains it and Chandu secretly starts to fall in love with Linda. Meanwhile, the police start to suspect Karan and his team, owing to which they change their business. Instead, one of the friends rents a lavish house for one hundred thousand dollars by taking a loan from a bank. Then the house will be sold to another friend and again that friend will take a loan from the same bank, hence repeating the cycle. Since the property of the person who cannot return the loan is used to be seized by the bank, one of them will declare thyself as bankrupt and the house gets seized, with an actual worth of one hundred thousand dollars, but the company will have already gained two hundred thousand dollars' profit. However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Zing and Chandu get into a fight after Zing hits Linda. Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu weds Linda and quits the company to start a video store with her.
Alone and heartbroken, Karan visits India and secretly attends a function where Sajjan is being honored for his years of service to his company. Upon seeing this, he realizes his mistake. On his return to America, he is arrested and put in jail for 6 months. He is bailed out after Bulbul comes and gives up Zing's, Chandu's and her share from what they earned in the company. Karan starts working with his uncle. One day, he meets Bulbul, who is revealed to be pregnant with his child and the lovers reconcile. At Uncle Jazz's office, Karan finds out that his uncle's entire consignment of imported shirts from Madras has been rejected as the color bleeds after washing. The news reaches to stock market due to which Jazz company's share fall down to 30%. Karan sees an opportunity and thinks of another brilliant idea and Karan patches up with Zing, Chandu and his family to start another new venture. Zing also apologizes to Chandu and says that he is happy that Linda is with Chandu. This time, he makes Jazz's buyers believe that his company offers a new kind of shirt in the market, which changes its color every time it is washed, hence a common man gets a new shirt every time he washes it. The buyers order a trial order of 5,000 pieces. Linda, who is one of Michael Jackson's backstage dancers, promotes their shirt that he wears in one of his concerts. The public goes crazy over this new shirt, due to which Karan receives another order, this time for a much larger number of shirts. The shares of Jazz's company skyrocket as the public buys many shirts, hence recovering his Uncle Jazz' loss. Karan, Zing, Chandu, and Bulbul are now partners with Jazz in "Friends and Company", but it is turned into a public limited company. With his wife, son, friends and having made his father proud, Karan is finally content with his life.

David Jacobs is an American sociologist and professor emeritus of sociology at Ohio State University. He is known for his work in political sociology and political economy, which has included research on issues such as labor relations, policing, and capital punishment. For example, his research has found that death sentences are most common in U.S. states where lynchings were formerly the most frequent, and that black death row inmates convicted of killing whites are more likely to be executed than whites convicted of killing blacks. Jacobs also noted that U.S. states with the largest African American minorities were more likely to maintain the death penalty.

Gymnocalycium horstii is a globular cactus resembling a loaf of bread from a bakery. Plants have a squat appearance and spines that are curved back towards the body. Plants usually offset over time, creating interesting specimens. The body of this species is glossy and the flower is always white. Its close relative Gymnocalycium buenekeri which occurs 200 km westward has a very similar but dull body with always pink flowers. Gymnocalycium horstii occurs only in the southern Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul and has been considered endangered since 2010 due to wild specimens being collected for the plant trade.

The black saw-wing (Psalidoprocne pristoptera), also known as the blue saw-wing or black rough-winged swallow, is a small passerine bird in the swallow family.
Distribution and habitat
The black rough-winged swallow breeds in open wooded habitats, and has a preference for wetter areas, although some races occur in mountain grassland habitat. It breeds across Africa from eastern Nigeria and Ethiopia south to Angola, northern Zimbabwe and northern Mozambique. The subspecies P. p. holomelaena breeds down south-eastern Africa from southern Mozambique to the Cape in South Africa.
This species is mainly resident, apart from seasonal local or altitudinal movements, but P. p. holomelaena is migratory, spending the southern winter north of the breeding range. The nominate race P. p. pristoptera of the mountains of northern Ethiopia moves south after breeding.
Description
The black rough-winged swallow is a small swallow at 13–15 cm length with a forked tail. Its plumage is blue-glossed black. Sexes are similar, but the female has shorter outer tail feathers, and less obvious wing serrations. Juveniles are brown with little gloss, and have short tails.
There are many subspecies of this swallow, which some authorities may split into different species. In particular, four northeastern races, including nominate P. p. pristoptera, have conspicuous white underwing coverts (all other subspecies are green-glossed and have completely dark underwings), and may be split as the eastern rough-winged swallow or eastern saw-wing (swallow), P. orientalis. This leaves P. p. holomelaena as the black rough-winged swallow, P. holomelaena. Other subspecies are also sometimes elevated to species status, but Turner and Rose take the view that all the races of the black rough-winged swallow are, at best, incipient species.
Subspecies
Shari saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) chalybdea
Petit's saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) petiti
Mangbettu saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) mangbettorum

Blue saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) pristoptera
Brown saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) antinorii
Blanford's saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) blanfordi
Eastern saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) orientalis
Includes the race reichenowi
Black saw-wing Psalidoprocne (pristoptera) holomelas
Includes races massaica and ruwenzori
Behaviour
Black rough-winged swallows are usually seen in pairs or small groups hunting for flying insects in woodland clearings and edges, above forest, or over water. Their flight is weak and fluttering. It is a quiet species, but it gives a soft alarm call. There is also a contact call described for as for P. p. holomelaena and for orientalis.
Breeding
The nest is constructed from grass, moss or similar materials, and built in a 30–60 cm long burrow in a vertical sand or clay bank. This is usually an old burrow of another species like a kingfisher, but may be excavated by the breeding pair. The clutch is two, sometimes three, white eggs. Only one parent, probably the female, incubates for 14–19 days to hatching, with a further 24–27 days until the young fledge.

The Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility (NWEF) operated through the Cold War investigating aircraft-weapon interfaces to provide United States Navy aircraft with nuclear weapons delivery capability.
History
The United States Army Air Corps began using Kirtland Field south of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the early years of World War II. The adjacent Sandia Base was created as a training facility. Several units from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory were relocated to the Sandia Base in 1945 to use the Kirtland Field flight test facilities. Kirtland Field was designated Kirtland Air Force Base in 1947, and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) operated on Sandia Base. When the United States Air Force established the Air Force Special Weapons Command at Kirtland Air Force Base in 1949, the United States Navy formed a detachment to investigate nuclear capabilities for naval aircraft and assist the AFSWP with naval equipment for demonstrations and training. This detachment was headed by CDR Thomas Walker who had been working at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory as the prospective commander of the 4th atomic bomb mission which was cancelled following the surrender of Japan. In 1952 this detachment was designated the Naval Air Special Weapons Facility (NASWF) to conduct special weapons tests on the White Sands Missile Range and Tonopah Test Range in coordination with the United States Atomic Energy Commission. As other nuclear weapons delivery systems were developed through the late 1950s, the mission expanded to include ballistic missiles, guided missiles, and torpedoes. In March 1961 NASWF was redesignated the Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility with mission expanded to include safety studies on nuclear weapons. Aircraft used for NWEF testing were decorated with a unique thunderbird image. NWEF personnel became known as the Rio Grande Navy among the Albuquerque community. Popularity of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta encouraged NWEF personnel to form the Navy Balloon Team as a recruiting effort in 1976. Operations at Sandia Base ceased in 1993 after Base Realignment and Closure transferred the functions of NWEF to the weapons division of the Naval Air Warfare Center.
NWEF testing
Early work involved adapting the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, A-3 Skywarrior, and A-4 Skyhawk for Mark 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 18, 27, and 39 bombs. As missiles replaced those earlier weapons the B28, B43, B57, and B61 nuclear bombs were tested with the Grumman A-6 Intruder, LTV A-7 Corsair II, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, and the A-4 Skyhawk.
Mk 90 Betty and Mk 101 Lulu nuclear depth bombs were tested with Lockheed P-2 Neptune, Lockheed P-3 Orion, and Martin P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft, the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopter, and the Grumman S-2 Tracker. The Mk 101 Lulu was also tested for NATO allies with the Canadair CP-107 Argus, Avro Shackleton, and Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. These aircraft and the Bréguet 1150 Atlantic were later tested with the B57 nuclear bomb, while the A-1, A-3, and A-4 were tested with the Mk 105 Hotpoint anti-submarine weapon.

Peer Baierlein (born 16 May 1972 in Stuttgart, West Germany) is a German musician and composer.
Biography
Peer Baierlein started playing the accordion at the age of 7 and then switched to the trumpet when he was 9. After several years in the local brass band he started his professional studies at the early age of 16 at the Musikhochschule Köln in Germany. He first became a classical trumpet teacher before beginning his studies with Prof. Malte Burba as an orchestra musician at the Musikhochschule Köln and with Arno Lange at the 'Deutsche Oper' in Berlin.
In 1996, he moved to Leuven in Belgium to study with his favourite jazz-trumpet player Bert Joris at the Lemmensinstituut. Upon completion of his studies, he moved for a year to New York City in 2000, to take lessons form John McNeil and to play his instrument abroad. He then came back to Belgium, where he finished his studies for jazz trumpet and -after that- specialised as ‘lead-trumpet', also at the Lemmensinstituut. Between 2005 and 2007, Peer Baierlein has been studying classical composition with Piet Swerts.

Frank Owen (born 1939) is an American abstract painter based in Keene, New York.
Early life and education
Owen was born in 1939 in Kalispell, Montana and spent much of his childhood in Woodland, California.
After two years at Antioch College, Owen returned to California and attended Sacramento State before joining the University of California, Davis arts program. At UC Davis, Owen studied under William T. Wiley and Wayne Thiebaud alongside artists including David Gilhooly, Richard Shaw, Stephen Kaltenbach and Bruce Nauman. While a student, Owen exhibited works in Davis, Chico and Sacramento, and collaborated with Nauman on 16mm film projects. He graduated with a B.A. in 1966 and an M.A. in 1968, and received a Regents Fellowship in 1967-1968.
Artistic career
Owen moved to New York after completing his M.A., joining a community of SoHo-based artists. His first solo New York show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1972 included a number of large canvases described by the art critic David L. Shirey as "[r]esembling something like Paisley prints or enlarged marble paper gone berserk". The large works produced during this period were described in 1974 by Newsweek art critic Douglas Davis as "richly impacted with rough, writhing shapes and textured in hundreds of colors that have been poured and whipped onto the surface."
In 1975 Owen again collaborated with Bruce Nauman on the film project Pursuit, in which 16 people are shown running on a conveyor belt, one by one, until exhausted.
In 1979, Owen established a professional relationship with the Nancy Hoffman Gallery that continues to the present day. His first solo show with Hoffman took place in 1981, again featuring large-scale works including one eighteen feet wide.
After moving permanently to the Adirondacks in 1981 to join his wife and her family, Owen's work began to include elements drawn from the surroundings of his new home, as he described in a 1987 interview:
Since 1999, Owen's work has been roughly divided into two series: Venetians, inspired by the colors of Venetian glass beads, and works that draw from the seasonal colors of the Adirondacks and embed images of leaves, sticks, and stones between layers of paint.
Style and technique
Owen's early professional work is built upon the gestural abstraction of Jackson Pollock, using acrylic paint partially mixed with vivid pigments and poured on paper or canvas from buckets, bottles or caps, then manipulated to create a marbled effect. In 1973 the critic Peter Schjeldahl described this early work as having a "particular dialectic... between an overall 'marbleized' look that is essentially impersonal — it is hard to imagine that a mere human hand could have performed anything so intricately gorgeous — and subtle, intelligently directed exertions of drawing and composition that become apparent on closer scrutiny."
The most prominent technique in Owen's work is a distinctive process known as "painting in verso". Owen adopted this method in the 1970s at the prompting of his friend Art Schade, initially using large beds of modelling clay, carved and cut to create spaces into which paint could be poured. Once dry, the paint was lifted from the clay, manipulated further, and affixed to the canvas front-to-back to create a three-dimensional surface.
Owen shifted from clay to use high-density polyethylene as the base to create the "skins" that make up his works; he describes himself as a "laminator", visualizing the finished piece and assembling it in layers:
Throughout his career, Owen's work has featured vibrant juxtaposed colors, with later works making frequent use of color disharmony between organic and geometric forms.
Academic career
After graduating from UC Davis, Owen took up a position at Sacramento State before moving to the east coast. Between 1970 and 1980 he taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York. During the 1980s he held visiting artist and lecturer positions, including at Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He completed his academic career at the University of Vermont, joining its arts faculty in 1993 and retiring as a full professor in 2011.

The "Slant Step"
In 1963, William T. Wiley bought an oddly-slanted wood and linoleum step stool at a junk shop in Mill Valley, California for fifty cents, and gave it to Bruce Nauman, who kept it in his studio. The stool attracted the attention of students and faculty at the UC Davis art program, as a found object that provided "cultish inspiration", provoking drawings, sculptures and other work. In September 1966 it was exhibited alongside those works in the Slant Step Show at the Berkeley Gallery in San Francisco; during the exhibition, the step vanished from the gallery, supposedly taken by Richard Serra to New York and subsequently returned to California by Stephen Kaltenbach.
In 2010, Owen disclosed that he had taken the step from Davis in 1967 and used it as a teaching aid in his various faculty positions. He and other UC Davis alumni artists collectively served as its caretakers, occasionally loaning it to exhibitions and dubbing themselves "The New York Society for the Preservation of the Slant Step": "Somebody has got to keep the damn thing so we -- myself, Arthur Schade, and a couple of other buddies -- kept it."
In 2012, Owen and Schale donated the step to UC Davis in conjunction with the exhibition "Flatlanders on the Slant", valuing the piece for tax purposes at the fifty cents it cost Wiley in 1963. In 2014, the writer and artist Peter Plagens established the purpose of the step: it was designed to raise the knees while defecating.

Pat Glennon (23 August 1927 – 14 February 2004) was an Australian jockey raised in the Ascot Vale area in Melbourne, not far from the Flemington Racecourse. Glennon rode his first winner, a horse named Alares, trained by his father, at a bush track Bacchus Marsh at the age of 13.
Glennon then moved to South Australia, where he rode with great success, quickly becoming one of the leading apprentices in Adelaide. Linking with Jim Cummings' team (the father of the great Bart), he went on to pilot Comic Court to victory in the 1950 Melbourne Cup. He would later go on to win another Cup in 1959 with the Richard W. Roden trained Macdougal.
Wanting to embellish his already solid career, Glennon went abroad seeking further opportunities. Settling in Ireland,
where he stepped into shoes of Garnet Bougoure as Vincent O'Briens number one hoop. He soon blossomed into a fearsome rider, winning the jockey's championship. While in Ireland, he came to terms with the French trainer Etienne Pollet and accepted a contract to ply his trade in France. It is here that he and Sea-Bird came together. He and the son of Dan Cupid would sweep through the 1965 flat season winning all before them, culminating in victories in both The Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Sea-Bird would end his racing days as the highest rated flat horse of all time.
Pat Glennon would become the only Australian jockey to taste success in the Epsom Derby, Melbourne Cup and the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe. He died on 14 February 2004 at the age of 76.

Rajiv Ramon van La Parra (born 4 June 1991) is a Dutch professional footballer. A winger, he can also play as a striker. At international level, he has represented the Netherlands U21.
Van La Parra played his first senior games in France with Caen before returning to the Netherlands in 2011 for a three-season-long stay with SC Heerenveen. In June 2014, he moved to England to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, who loaned him to Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town before he joined the latter in 2016.
Club career
Caen
Van La Parra is a product of the Feyenoord youth system, but made his senior debut instead for French Ligue 1 club Caen on 8 November 2008, having agreed a four-year contract in June 2008. He cited the potential to reach the highest level while playing in France as the reason for his transfer.
The right winger made only two appearances for Caen's first team during his first season, and the club ended the campaign being relegated. Despite this relegation, Van La Parra would make only a further eight appearances as the team won promotion back to the top flight, but did register his first senior goal; against Guingamp on 5 April 2009. During these seasons, he instead gained playing time in Caen's second team that competed in the Championnat de France amateur.
SC Heerenveen
In summer 2011, his contract was terminated and he returned to the Netherlands in search of a new club. After an unsuccessful trial at AZ Alkmaar, he eventually signed a one-year contract with fellow Eredivisie side SC Heerenveen on 30 August 2011. After scoring six times during 26 appearances in his debut season, Heerenveen elected to take up an option in his contract for two further seasons. Over these three seasons, Van La Parra made 94 appearances (including playing in the Europa League), scoring 16 times.
Wolverhampton Wanderers
His contract from Heerenveen expired in the summer of 2014, and after rejecting a new contract, on 10 June it was announced that he would move to English Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom he had signed a three-year contract. He made his debut in the first match on 10 August 2014 against Norwich City, and was named man of the match. He scored his first goal for Wolves against Fulham in the FA Cup on 13 January 2015. His first league goal came against future club Brighton & Hove Albion in a 1–1 draw on 14 March 2015.
On 26 November 2015, Van La Parra signed a loan deal with Brighton, lasting until 2 January 2016.
Huddersfield Town
On 11 March 2016, after some speculation, Van La Parra signed on loan for fellow Championship side Huddersfield Town for the rest of the season, with the move becoming a permanent deal in the summer, on a three-year contract. He made his debut for the Terriers in the 4–1 West Yorkshire derby win against Leeds United at Elland Road on 19 March, and scored his first goal in their 1–0 win over his former club Wolves at the Kirklees Stadium on 27 August.
Van La Parra was an instrumental part of the Huddersfield Town side that was promoted to the Premier League in the 2016–17 season. He was then a regular as Huddersfield went on to survive relegation in the following season. After falling out of favour following Huddersfield's relegation, Van La Parra made it known he wished to leave the club.
Red Star Belgrade and Logroñés
On 31 August 2019, Van La Parra signed a three-year contract with Serbian club Red Star Belgrade in a €1.2 million transfer from Huddersfield Town.
On 16 November 2020, free agent van La Parra signed a one-year deal with Spanish Segunda División side UD Logroñés. He was released from his contract on 31 January 2021, having made four appearances for the side.
Würzburger Kickers
Van La Parra joined 2. Bundesliga club Würzburger Kickers on a free transfer on 1 February 2021, a day after being released by Logroñes.
Personal life
Born in the Netherlands, Van La Parra is of Surinamese descent. One of his half-brothers, Georginio Wijnaldum, currently plays for Paris Saint-Germain, while another, Giliano Wijnaldum, is a free agent. His cousin, Giovanni Drenthe, is also a professional footballer, playing for SV Excelsior in Suriname, while another, Royston Drenthe, came out of retirement and now plays for Racing Murcia.

Exercise prescription commonly refers to the specific plan of fitness-related activities that are designed for a specified purpose, which is often developed by a fitness or rehabilitation, or Exercise medicine specialist for the client or patient. Due to the specific and unique needs and interests of the client/patient, the goal of exercise prescription should be focused on motivation and customization, thus making achieving goals more likely to become successful. Exercise prescription should take into account the patient's medical history, and a pre-examination of a patient's physical fitness to make sure a person has the capacity to perform the exercises.
Patient referral
In the United Kingdom there is a scheme called "Exercise on prescription" or "Exercise Referral" in which doctors are able to prescribe exercise to those with conditions that benefit from it, such as asthma, depression, or obesity. The initiative particularly aimed to lower the rate of heart disease. National standards for such initiatives from doctors were established by the Department of Health in 2001. Exercise on prescription aims to prevent deterioration of conditions, and views exercise as a preventative health measure. Fitness classes or a course at the local gym are available on prescription at a reduced rate to people who might benefit from them. It aims to make it easier for people to follow their doctors' advice about taking more exercise or losing weight. Such preventative measures hope to lead to savings for the National Health Service.
Researchers in New Zealand have also discussed the benefits of exercise referral by medical practitioners there. In New Zealand it is known as a green prescription, while in the United States a similar initiative is known as Exercise is Medicine. A green prescription is a referral given by a doctor or nurse to a patient, with exercise and lifestyle goals written on them. The term, used by health practitioners in New Zealand draws parallel to the usual prescriptions given to patients for medications, and emphasizes the importance of exercise in improving their condition, and not relying on drugs. The green prescription is written after discussing the issues and goals in the consultation. Studies have shown that an increase in exercise, better sense of well-being, and a decrease in blood pressure results from using the method. A decreased risk of coronary heart disease has not been shown. This was shown in two studies, one by Swinburn (1998), that surveyed patients in Auckland and Dunedin. The other was Elley (2003) and was done in 42 practices in the same region of New Zealand.
General practitioners like the idea as it formalizes what they are telling the patient about how their lifestyle changes are necessary (Swinburn 1997). There has previously not been sufficient education of general practitioners on Exercise Prescription, compared to drug and procedural education, although the need to confidently prescribe exercise increases as the evidence shows of its benefits. If not confident or in difficult cases, General practitioners can refer on to Exercise physiologists, Physiotherapists or Sport & Exercise medicine specialists.
Research in Australia has suggested that an exercise prescription program would be very beneficial and many ICU physiotherapists are already performing this practice, however there is no national standards to govern how this practice is administered so there is great variety in the ways this is administered therefore more research is needed.
For specific diseases
Osteoarthritis
Studies show that exercise prescription aids in both preventing and minimizing the effects of joint disorders such as osteoarthritis. Evidence shows that in addition to the general physiological, psychological and functional benefits gained from exercise, greater quadriceps strength has a mitigating effect on knee joint pain.
Depression
A large body of research indicates that exercise prescription has beneficial effects for patients with depression. One study shows a significant improvement for a randomized group of women with major depressive disorder engaging in a twice-weekly resistance training program compared to a control group. The reasons for this marked change is thought to have biochemical, physiological and psychosocial aspects.
Migraine
Although routine physical activity could be an aggravating factor for migraine, physical exercise is considered to be part of a non-pharmacological strategy for migraine prevention. Migraine patients tend to have less pleasure in physical activity due to fear-avoidance and anxiety sensitivity.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
Blockage or closing of the arteries of the lower limbs impairs blood flow to the legs and results in significant reduction in physical capacity. Alternate exercise prescriptions to walking are considered. Aerobic exercises such as arm-cranking or cycling are recommended. Risk factors for disease progression should also be taken into account when aiming to improve waling ability. Functional capacity should be determined prior to commencement of prescribe exercise programs.
Diabetes mellitus
The number of individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus are rapidly increasing and a lot of evidence suggests this is due to an insufficiently active lifestyle.
Benefits of exercise include stress reduction, reduced risk of heart disease, lowers blood pressure, helps control weight and aids insulin in improving management of diabetes. Exercise that is not too strenuous is recommended. Such activities may include walking, swimming, gardening, cycling or golfing.
Incidental activities are encouraged, such as using the stairs instead of an escalator/lift or walking short distances instead of driving.
Dr. Gebel, who works at James Cook University's Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention, conducted a study reporting increased health benefits through incorporation of more vigorous exercise. He stated that this could include 'vigorous gardening', not necessarily meaning going to the gym.
Diabetes Australia suggest 30 minutes of exercise daily as a suitable target, which can be divided into three 10-minute sessions throughout the day.
Exercise programs however should be tailored and delivered by individuals with appropriate qualifications.
Cancer
Exercise is not only recommended for preventing many types of cancer, but is now recommended as part of treatment for many cancers based on the results of scientific trials.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)
Patients with COPD can have an improved quality of live if the correct exercise program is prescribed to them. This program should help increase aerobic capacity (rate that a person can take oxygen from the air), increase endurance, and decrease dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Exercise recommendations
According to Exercise and Sport Science Australia, a minimum amount of 210 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 125 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise should be performed per week. Exercise should include both aerobic and resistance training. For greater health benefits, exercise should be performed regularly with no more than a two-day gap between training sessions. Exercise that improves cardiorespiratory fitness should be done 5–7 days a week for 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate intensity. If the exercise is done at a vigorous intensity the training sessions only have to be preformed 3–5 days a week for 20 to 60 minutes each session. Flexibility should be trained for at least 10 minutes after a training session and should be done at least twice a week.
Elderly
Research has found that having a well planned exercise routine can greatly benefit the elderly. It an reduce the risks of coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and insulin resilience, hypertension and obesity as well as vast improvements in bone density and muscle mass.
Exercise program development
Exercise prescription is designed to modulate acute exercise programming variables to create the adaptations desired by the individual or sport. With aerobic exercise prescription, the type of exercise, duration of exercise, frequency, and duration is adjusted. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined. Prescription of stretching and other activities is also commonly seen.
Exercise prescription can be divided into 5 components:
Type of exercise or activity (e.g., walking, swimming, cycling)
Specific workloads (e.g., watts, walking speed)
Duration and frequency of the activity or exercise session
Intensity guidelines – Target heart rate (THR) range and estimated rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
Precautions regarding certain orthopedic (or other) concerns or related comments

Glynn County is located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 79,626. The county seat is Brunswick. Glynn County is part of the Brunswick, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Glynn County, one of the state's original eight counties created on February 5, 1777, was named after John Glynn, a member of the British House of Commons who defended the cause of the American Colonies before the American Revolution. The Battle of Bloody Marsh was fought in Glynn County. James Oglethorpe built Fort Frederica, which was used a base in the American Revolutionary War. Glynn Academy, established to educate boys, is the second oldest school in Georgia.
Glynn County includes the most prominent of the Sea Islands of Georgia, including Jekyll Island, St. Simons Island, and Sea Island. The Georgia poet Sidney Lanier immortalized the seacoast there in his poem, "The Marshes of Glynn", which begins:
Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven
With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven
Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs,--
Emerald twilights,--
Virginal shy lights,
Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows,
When lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades
Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods,
Of the heavenly woods and glades,
That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within
The wide sea-marshes of Glynn;--
During World War II, Naval Air Station Glynco, named for the county, was a major base for training for blimps and anti-submarine warfare. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) now uses a substantial part of the former NAS as its main campus.

Superfund sites
Glynn County is home to four Superfund sites. Those include the "LCP Chemicals Georgia" site, the "Brunswick Wood Preserving" site, the "Hercules 009 Landfill" site, and the "Terry Creek Dredge Spoil Areas/Hercules Outfall" site.
The Hanlin Group, Inc., which maintained a facility named "LCP Chemicals" in Glynn County just outside the corporate limits of Brunswick, was convicted of dumping 150 tons of mercury into Purvis Creek, a tributary of the Turtle River and surrounding tidal marshes between the mid-1980s and its closure in 1994. Three executives were sentenced to prison time over the incident.
The LCP facility had been declared a Superfund site when it closed in 1994. It had been under scrutiny by the EPA after Service biologists discovered mercury poisoning in endangered wood storks on St. Simons Island. Fish, shellfish, crabs, and shrimps taken in coastal waters, as well as other bird species, also contained the toxic metal. The Service traced the source of the contamination to the LCP plant and documented the extent of the damage to wildlife resources. Their effort resulted in the addition of Endangered Species Act charges to those that would be brought against Hanlin and its officers.
Crime
In 2020, the FBI ranked the Brunswick metropolitan area (which includes the counties of Glynn, Brantley and McIntosh) as the 7th most dangerous metropolitan area in the state of Georgia.
On August 29, 2009, Glenn County resident Guy Heinze Jr. murdered eight members of his extended family including his father, Guy Heinze Sr. in the family's trailer located in New Hope Plantation Mobile Home Park near Brunswick. Two others were critically injured, with one dying later in a hospital in Savannah. Heinze Jr. avoided the death penalty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole on October 30, 2013.

"Someone You Loved" is a song recorded by British singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi. It was released as a download on 8 November 2018 through Vertigo Records and Universal Music as the third single from his second extended play, Breach (2018), and was later included on his debut album, Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent (2019). The song was written by Capaldi, Samuel Romans, and its producers Thomas Barnes, Peter Kelleher and Benjamin Kohn. It was serviced to radio stations on 16 April 2019 as the first US single.
"Someone You Loved" was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song became Capaldi's first number one single, spending seven consecutive weeks atop of the chart and was the best selling single of 2019 in the UK. It also peaked at number one on the Irish Singles Chart in March 2019. In the United States, "Someone You Loved", a piano ballad, was a sleeper hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in its 24th week on the chart. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards. It also received an award for Song of the Year at the 2020 Brit Awards. As of 2021, "Someone You Loved" is the 5th most streamed song on Spotify with 2.3 billion streams on Spotify.
Background and composition
In an interview with the French magazine Brut, Capaldi revealed he wrote the song about his grandmother who had died. In an interview with NME, Capaldi revealed that it took him six months to write the song. He said, "A lot of people say that 'the best songs fall into your lap' and that they're the easiest ones to write and take the shortest amount of time: I wholeheartedly disagree with that. I think my best songs come from me sitting at a piano, bashing my head against a brick wall for hours and hours on end to get one good melody." "Someone You Loved" is played in the tempo of 110 BPM and key signature of D♭ major.
Music videos
There are two music videos to accompany "Someone You Loved".
The first music video was released on 8 February 2019, starring actor Peter Capaldi, who is Lewis Capaldi's second cousin once removed. It was directed by filmmaker Phil Beastall. Filming took place in Buxton in late January 2019. The video was made in partnership with charity organisation Live Life Give Life in order to raise awareness for the issue of organ donation. It contains a message of loss and hope, telling a story of a husband who is trying to cope with the death of his wife. She became the heart donor for the young mother of another family, saving her life. Eventually the two families are brought together and the main character knows that his wife's heart continues to live on.
The official video, featuring the singer was released on 29 August 2019. Here, Capaldi wanders the streets, following his lost love as his friends and strangers try to stop him from chasing after her.
Capaldi said: "For me the video is about the people we surround ourselves with that have the strength when we don't and help us continue to make the right decisions in moments of fear or hardship. In the moment we often choose to ignore friends and family, thinking our judgement is better, but of course in hindsight when you're in that headspace it's almost impossible to make the right decisions."
Chart performance
"Someone You Loved" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for seven consecutive weeks. It is also Capaldi's first entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 85 on the issue dated 25 May 2019 and becoming the singer's first number-one single in the country on the issue dated 2 November 2019. It reached number one after 24 weeks on the chart, becoming one of the longest climbs to the top position in Billboard history. After three non-consecutive weeks on top it was replaced by Post Malone's "Circles".
In Ireland, the single cumulated 26.8 million streams in 2019 and was the biggest-selling song in the country that year.

Muhammad Said al-Attar () (26 November 1927 – 20 November 2005) was the acting Prime Minister of Yemen for five months in 1994. During his career, he held various ministerial positions in Yemen and represented his country at the United Nations. From 1974 to 1985, Muhammad Said Al-Attar was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia (currently ESCWA).
Career
Muhammad Said Al-Attar was born in 1927 in Djibouti from a Yemeni father originally from Al-Hojariya, (in Taez governorate, Al-Shomayatayn district) and a Yemeni mother from Ash Shihr coastal town in Hadhramaut governorate (Southern Yemen).
He undertook his primary and secondary education between Djibouti and Aden, before moving to Paris where he obtained several degrees in French literature from the University of Paris and a doctorate (Ph.D) in economics and social science from the Faculté des Lettres at the Sorbonne. Between 1959 and 1962, he was a research fellow at the Institut d'Etudes du Developpement Economic et Social in Paris.
In 1962, Muhammad Said Al-Attar joined the Republican revolutionary movement in Northern Yemen and supported the “26 September revolution” against the Imamat .
In November 1962, he was appointed as the first Director General of the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a member of the Supreme Council for Economic Affairs. He subsequently acted as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Economy and member of the High Committee for Planning from 1965 to 1967, and played a crucial role during the “70 days siege of Sanaa” in 1967. Between 1968 and 1971, Al-Attar was the Permanent Representative of the Arab Republic of Yemen at the United Nations in New York; he was appointed to this position again in 1973. He held the rank of Ambassador when he represented Yemen at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund conferences in 1971, and at the 1972 General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.
In December 1973, Al-Attar was appointed Executive Secretary of the newly established United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia (currently ESCWA) with the rank of United Nations Under-Secretary General. He held this position until 1985 when he returned to the Arab Republic of Yemen.
Before and after Yemeni reunification, he served in the government as Acting Prime Minister (1994), Deputy Prime Minister (1985-1990, 1992–1994, 1995-1997), Minister of Development (1985-1990), President of the Central Planning Body (1985), Minister of Industry (1990 -1992), President of the General Investment Authority (1992-1993) and Minister of Petrol and Mineral resources (1995-1997). Between 1997 and 2002, Al-Attar was the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Yemen to the United Nations in Geneva.
Muhammad Said Al-Attar died on 20 November 2005 in Beirut where he was receiving medical treatment.
In 2007, Faysal Al-Oubuthani wrote in Al-Hayat newspaper: “We must recognise for a moment what this Yemeni man has given his country and all the Arab countries. A cultured economist fluent in foreign languages who has worked tirelessly to elevate the name of his country in international and regional fora while striding to gain respect for all Arab countries. Those who knew him closely and worked under his supervision can testify to the praise and recognition he gained from international economists and officials of several international organizations.”
Al-Attar was a member of the International Sociological Association (Madrid), the International Institute for Economic Sciences (Geneva), the Third World Forum (Dakar) and the Arabic Center for Studies (Amman).
Honours
Muhammad Said Al-Attar received the Legion of Honour (Ordre National de la Légion d'honneur, the highest French order of merit).
Publications
Author of “Le sous-développement économique et social du Yemen: perspectives de la révolution yéménite”
He published articles and studies in various newspapers and magazines, including “Le Monde” (Paris), “Politique Etrangere” (Paris), “Economie et Humanisme” (Paris), “Revolution Africaine” (Alger), “ Al-Ahram” and “Al-Taliah” (Cairo), “Dirassat Arabia” (Beirut) and “Jeune Afrique” (Paris).

Disperis is a genus of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It has about 78 species. Most of the species are from tropical and southern Africa, as well as Indian Ocean islands. A few are native to the tropical or the warmer subtropical regions of Asia and Malesia.
Etymology
The genus name Disperis derives from the ancient greek (), meaning "twice", and (), meaning "bag", "pouch", because of to the pouches formed by the lateral sepals.
Range and variation
Disperis consists of two subgenera, Disperis and Dryorkis. Subgenus Disperis has been well sampled in a molecular phylogenetic study, but subgenus Dryorkis has not. Subgenus Disperis has about 30 species and is distinguished by an entire lip appendage. Most of its species are from southern Africa. A few are from East Africa and Madagascar. Subgenus Dryorkis has about 48 species and is distinguished by a 2-lobed lip appendage. It is found throughout tropical Africa as well as Madagascar and nearby islands, and it has one widespread species in tropical Asia.
Pollination
Like members of the subtribe Coryciinae sensu stricto, Disperis is pollinated by oil collecting bees of the genus Rediviva. The oil is produced on the lip appendage, usually near its apex. Disperis has independently evolved a floral morphology much like that of Coryciinae s.s. in order to attract these pollinators.
Relationships
In the Genera Orchidacearum work, Disperis has been placed in the subtribe Coryciinae. However, molecular phylogeny studies challenged this taxonomic view. Analysis of the nuclear ribosomal ITS first suggested the polyphyly of Coryciinae as Disperis did not branch with Corycium and Pterygodium. Moreover, Disperis appeared more closely related to Brownleea than to the subtribe Coryciinae, though this affinity did not receive strong statistical support. In a classification of orchids that was published in 2015, Disperis was transferred to the subtribe Brownleeinae. Brownleea and Disperis have a similar pollen structure and an upright labellum that lies over the front of the stigma. A median sepal spur is found in all six species of Brownleea and in many species of Disperis.

Hugo Jabini is a Saramaka politician and environmental leader from Suriname. In 1998 he became the spokesman of the Association of Saamaka Authorities (Dutch acronym VSG). In 2007 he and Wanze Eduards were part of the VSG team that won an landrights lawsuit against the Surinamese government in international court. For their work in the landrights struggle they shared the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2009. From 2010 to 2015 Jabini was a member of the Surinamese National Assembly, as part of the National Democratic Party (NDP).
Biography
Jabini is from village of Tutubuka in the district Boven Suriname. Both his mother and his grandfather were captains. In 2010 he graduated from the Anton de Kom University after a comparative law study comparing Surinamese and Saamaka land rights protections.
In 1998 Jabini became spokesman of the Association of Saamaka Authorities (Dutch acronym VSG), an organization in which 61 Saamaka villages worked together in the struggle for Indigenous land rights. These rights were being threatened by industrial mining and logging. On November 28, 2007, Jabini and Wanze Eduards, also of the VSG, won a lawsuit against the state of Suriname that they had filed of behalf of the Saramaka people at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. For their work on the land rights struggle the two men were jointly awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2009.
In 2010 Jabini was elected member of the Surinamese National Assembly as part of the NDP slate of candidates. He was also chosen from among fifteen candidates as a member of Parliamentarians for Global Action. In 2015 Jabini was not included on the NDP's candidate list for the general election. He was not given a reason for this change. Earlier, during the budget development process he had offered the critique that the landrights matters had still not been resolved, and that the government was still giving out natural resource extraction concessions in Saamaka territory.

Ceremony information
The ceremony took place in the Royal Albert Hall and was hosted by Irish television comedian Graham Norton, who had previously hosted the 2019 British Academy Television Awards. Viewing ratings for the ceremony fell to a twelve-year low, peaking at 3.5 million, though being the most-viewed show in the UK after 22:00. The ratings drop may be a result of the broadcast delay, with many live news outlets publishing the results before they were televised and revealed on television.
Discussions about the lack of diversity within the award nominations surrounded the ceremony, with the host referring to it as "the year when white men finally broke through". He also described eleven-time nominee Joker as "essentially the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter". Best Director presenter (a category of all-male nominees) Rebel Wilson joked about the absence of females in the category, quipping: "Honestly, I just don't have the balls." Best Actor in a Leading Role winner Joaquin Phoenix used his speech to comment on the "systemic racism" of the BAFTAs and acting industry in general. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, BAFTA chairwoman Pippa Harris addressed her frustration in the lack of recognition for female directors, as well as the issues around diversity as a whole. In his closing speech to the ceremony, BAFTA president Prince William had prepared a speech discussing the issue, saying that "a wide-ranging review of the whole awards process" was underway and that lack of diversity "simply cannot be right in this day and age".
1917 was the night's biggest winner, winning seven prizes in total of its nine nominations, including Best Film and Best Director (Sam Mendes), despite not having any acting nominees and thus becoming a favourite for the then upcoming 92nd Academy Awards; it lost to Parasite. Mendes became the first British winner to win Best Director in eleven years. Since votes for the Academy Awards must be registered two days after the BAFTA Awards, Screen Daily noted that 1917 would be a safe choice for Academy members, who are averse to streaming films based on 1917s marketing as a "must-see on the big screen". This compares to the Netflix film The Irishman being the night's biggest loser, taking no awards despite ten nominations; Netflix productions in total received twenty-three nominations, winning only two: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Best Animated Film (Klaus). Screen Daily also suggested that there is anecdotal evidence of Netflix not supporting its nominees as much as it did last year for Roma (2018). The writers of Screen Daily additionally suggested that there was some controversy surrounding the British identity of some films nominated for Outstanding British Film; 1917 is financed by the US, and Retablo is a Peruvian film co-produced with Norway and Germany, whose Peruvian director—Álvaro Delgado-Aparicio—only lives in London. The ceremony also marked the first year since the 30th British Academy Film Awards (1977) in which there were no British acting winners.
Wins marking diversity were Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Bait, a film described by its writer-director as "a black and white, 16-millimetre, hand-processed, post-synced film in Academy ratio about Cornish fishing people"; Best Documentary for For Sama, a personal story of bombings at a Syrian hospital made by the family involved, with them using their speech to "implore the UK not to ignore the ongoing plight of the people of the Syrian city of Idlib"; and the Rising Star Award for Micheal Ward, star of Rapman's Blue Story (which received no nominations), who used his speech to say that he "feels like we're going in the right direction" in terms of diversity.
Best Actress in a Leading Role winner Renée Zellweger noted in the press room that she felt like part of "the British gang"; after accepting her award, Hugh Grant had taken to the stage to present, quipping "well done Jones" as Zellweger left, a reference to their roles in the British film Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). Later in the press room, the young Sama Al-Kateab, who had been held by her parents on stage while accepting Best Documentary, was allowed to roam and took to running the length of the stage and playing with microphones. With his fifth win for Best Cinematography for 1917, Roger Deakins becomes the most-decorated BAFTA winner in the category. Collecting his BAFTA, he said: "I think it was George Orwell that said all films are special but some films are more special than others, and for me this was a really special film." The recent Brexit was also mentioned, appearing in Brad Pitt's acceptance speech for Best Actor in a Supporting Role delivered by co-star Margot Robbie; Pitt's speech also noted that he would name his award "Harry" because he's going to take it to the United States.

John Joe Doherty (born 1968) is a former Irish Gaelic footballer and manager who played for Naomh Columba and the Donegal county team, later managing Donegal.
Biography
He won the 1987 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship with Donegal.
He captained his club to the 1990 Donegal Senior Football Championship.
Doherty, having recovered from a bone he broke while playing with his club, started against Armagh in the 1990 Ulster Senior Football Championship final, won by Donegal. He was a member of the Donegal team that won the county's first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1992. Martin Shovlin played instead of him in the semi-final against Mayo; however, Doherty started the final against Dublin. He was selected as an Star in 1993. He believes it was his performance in the 1992–93 National Football League final in which Donegal drew nine points apiece with Dublin at Croke Park that led to him receiving the Star; Doherty marked Charlie Redmond who proceeded to get himself sent off, as did Keith Barr shortly afterwards.
He was captain of his county team in 1998.
Early life
After leaving Carrick National School, Doherty attended the local Vocational School. During his time in Carrick Vocational School he played on the schools senior team who were the first school in the county to win the Ulster Schools Markey Cup. Five years later, at the age of 22, he captained his local Naomh Columba Senior Team to their second county title in 1990.
In November 2008, following the resignation of the previous manager Brian McIver, Doherty was confirmed as the new Donegal senior manager. Doherty resigned in 2010; Jim McGuinness replaced him one month later.
He previously managed his club Naomh Columba, Naomh Mhura to a Donegal Junior Football Championship and the Donegal under-21 team.

Cedar Bayou is a salt water channel on the Texas coast that separates San Jose Island from Matagorda Island. The pass serves as a water exchange between the Gulf of Mexico and the San Antonio, Matagorda and Aransas Bay systems.
History
Cedar Bayou was first closed in 1979 to protect Mesquite Bay from an oil spill in the Gulf. Hurricane Allen partially reopened the pass in 1980, and it was fully opened by dredging in 1988.

Steady Diet of Nothing is the second studio album by American post-hardcore band Fugazi, released in July 1991 by Dischord Records. Although a persistent rumor alleges that the title is an allusion to a quote by the late American stand-up comedian Bill Hicks, the album title predates the Hicks quote by several years and was actually thought up by bassist Joe Lally.
Although well received and popular at the time of its release, Steady Diet is often overlooked by many music journalists when writing about Fugazi's career, but remains a favorite among fans of the band.
Recording
Steady Diet of Nothing was recorded during January and February 1991 at Inner Ear Studios and is notable for being the group's first self-produced release. As a result of not having an outside producer besides engineer Don Zientara, the album's recording and mixing sessions were tough on the band. Guy Picciotto said of making the record, "[it] was a tough record for us to make. It was our first attempt at producing and mixing by ourselves, and we didn't feel like we had a really good handle, technically, on what we wanted to do. And we were also pretty fried from a shitload of back-to-back touring. I appreciate Steady Diet for a lot of things, but there was a flatness to both the performances and the sound that was weird to us." Singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye explained, "It was like we were walking on eggshells, trying not to offend each other. No one would say, "Turn your guitar down," or, "Turn the drums down." So we ended up getting a democratic mix, and a lot of times democratic mixes equal bad mixes. And I feel Steady Diet is a classic example of us being very conservative, although a lot of people think it's our best record."
Music and lyrics
Musically, the album is far more sparse than the band's other works, with the conservative, dry production serving to highlight the rhythm section of bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty. "Although you could probably trace their influences to numerous sources," wrote Steve Park of The Boston Phoenix, "Fugazi's music is about the natural fusion of two genres: hardcore and reggae. But unlike Bad Brains, they blend genres into a true hybrid rather than two easily distinguishable parts." The band's entry in Trouser Press writes that the album "sets up a dichotomy between razorblade ferocity and methodical determination; pulling firmly with one hand and jabbing angrily with the other, Fugazi opens the door to a world of mixed emotions and conflicting impulses. The pressure instilled by the band's ability to hold itself to an economical beat and escaping shards of tense guitar is barely relieved by the stormy whorls of flat-out aggression into which they typically feed. (The instrumental “Steady Diet” whips the latter into a dangerous froth.)" It also notes the band's guitar sound ("a loose-stringed jangle like an electrified fence being plucked") and the "urgent" vocals of MacKaye and Picciotto. The guitar tone on "Long Division" has been described as being "so dry, they could have been recorded direct." "Latin Roots" recalled the band's earlier dub-influenced stylings, with Canty laying down a Stewart Copeland-influenced drum beat.
Trouser Press praised the band's avoidance of "obvious" lyrical themes for the most part, noting that: "Unlike most punk anthems, the haiku-like lyrics of “Exit Only” will probably still convey the same meaning 20 years from now." A retrospective write-up on the album by Stylus Magazine's Cosmo Lee similarly writes that: "Unlike, say, Rage Against the Machine's "Killing in the Name," a closed system of slogans, Steady Diet leaves space for interpretation, sonically, lyrically, and visually (the figure on the cover will forever remain inscrutable). In this way, it's Fugazi at their best: ditching the easy answers of Minor Threat, and asking hard questions." The song "Long Division", for example, "examines the slow, no-fault disintegration of a friendship" whereas "Latin Roots" - a song about a "sexual encounter" - sees Picciotto coming to terms with his own Italian ancestry. (AllMusic's Andy Kellman additionally notes that his idiosyncratic vocals on the song result in many of the lyrics being commonly misheard.) The song "Runaway Return" even "recasts the age-old prodigal son story in a modern context." However, much of Steady Diet's lyrics are still political, with Guy Picciotto recalling that the band at the time were affected negatively by the then-ongoing Gulf War: “I think we all started to feel that America was just becoming a madhouse, [...] and it depressed us a lot.” An anti-war theme was noted in the lyrics to "Nice New Outfit" in addition to the band's usual anti-consumerist stance. "Dear Justice Letter" was inspired by Supreme Court liberal stalwart William J. Brennan, who had recently retired. The band addressed the subject of personal freedom on the pro-choice anthem "Reclamation" and "KYEO" ("keep your eyes open") was dedicated by MacKaye to Rodney King during the 'Steady Diet' tour.
Release
Six months before the release, Dischord had pre-orders of over 160,000 for the album. In August 1993, more than two years after the album's release, MacKaye told Billboard magazine that Steady Diet of Nothing had sold 215,000 units. Both MacKaye and Picciotto would later attribute the album's relatively-mild response to the alternative rock boom heralded by the release of Nirvana's Nevermind two months after Steady Diet. According to Picciotto (who was on tour with the band in Australia at the time): “It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had, [...] Nevermind was so huge, and people were so fucking blown away. We were just like, ‘What the fuck is going on here?' It was so crazy. On one hand, the shows were bigger, but on the other hand, it felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did.” Despite this, Steady Diet of Nothing was the band's first album to chart in the UK, where it peaked at #63.
Critical reception
Steady Diet of Nothing received mostly positive reviews upon release. Steve Park of The Boston Phoenix wrote that the band pulled off "a double triumph by mixing music and politics without diluting the entertainment and adrenaline." He noted, however, that the album failed to capture the "immediate intensity" of their live performances. Andy Kellman wrote that while the album was "not nearly as neck-gnawing as Repeater, Steady Diet still packs a sizable wallop, but with slower tempos and less deliberate instrumentation." He took issue, however, with the vagueness of the lyrics which "border[s] on equivocality at times -- which has its advantages and disadvantages."
A mixed review came from Robert Christgau, who simply awarded the album a "Neither" score, indicating a release that "may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't."
Legacy
Lost At Sea ranked it the 84th greatest album of the nineties. Suuns and Buke and Gase covered the track "Long Division".
The 2021 Fugazi tribute album Silence Is a Dangerous Sound: A Tribute to Fugazi - featuring bands such as La Dispute, Failure, Shai Hulud, Big Ups, Zao and 38 others - takes its name from a lyric in "KYEO".

Nathan Basha is an Australian motivational speaker, filmmaker and advocate around equity in employment access for people with disability.
Basha was born with Down syndrome, and states that doctors told his parents when he was born they could "'institutionalise' him, adopt him out or take him home." Basha says they took him home and "made a pact to do everything they could do to make my life as ordinary as possible".
Career
In 2010, Basha began working at Sydney radio station Nova 96.9 as an office assistant, where he still works alongside radio hosts Fitzy and Wippa.
Basha founded his motivational speaking social enterprise No Boundaries in 2012, through which he seeks to inspire others living with disability to find their dream job, and positively impact social attitudes—specifically those in the Australian corporate sector—around the employment of people with disabilities.
In 2014, Basha was nominated for the Australian Human Rights Commission's Young People's Human Rights Medal.
Basha is passionate about films and filmmaking and, in 2016, he became an ambassador for Bus Stop Films.
Also in 2016, he was featured in a video for a New South Wales government advertising campaign called "Don't Dis My Ability", where he shares his experience of living with Down syndrome, which he describes as "a disadvantage, not a disability." He was one of four people with a disability to be featured in the campaign, which seeks to share the benefits of employment for people with disability and the organisations they work for.
He was a finalist for the New South Wales 2016 Young Australian of the Year Award for his work as a disability advocate. In the same year, Basha received a Community Service Award from the New South Wales government for his work in advocating for people with disability.
In 2019, Australian painter Patrick Pace painted Basha for his submission to the 2019 Archibald Prize, one of Australia's most high-profile portraiture competitions.
In 2021, Basha was announced as a co-executive producer on Bus Stop Films' first feature film, "Baby Cat". The film seeks to tell the story of the lived experience of a woman living with trisomy 21 (a form of Down syndrome), and is currently in pre-production.
Basha was featured in a 2021 interview with paralympian Dylan Alcott as part of his series Dylan Alcott Interviews on SBS television.
He is an ambassador for the Australian Federal Government program IncludeAbility.

Prinsesse Charlottes Gade (lit. "Princess Charlottes Street") is a street in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, Denmark, linking Meinungsgade in the southeast with Jagtvej in the northwest.
Guldberg Byplads, a public space and playground, is located at the corner with Sjællandsgade.
History
The street was created in the 1850s. The new street was named after Princess Charlotte Frederica, the first wife of Christian VIII and the mother of Frederick VII. The street followed the east side of Svendsens Reberbane, a several hundred metres long ropewalk.
Notable buildings
Nørrebro Lilleskole (No. 34-36) is a self-owning primary school. The building is the former home of the Jewish Carolineskolen. It was built as Copenhagen's Jewish boys' school which had until then been based in Skindergade. The school was merged with the city's Jewish girls' school under the name Carolineskolen in 1945. It relocated to a former stockings factory on Bomhusvej in the Ryvangen Quarter of Østerbro in 1974.
KEA Prinsesse Charlottes Gade (No. 38) is a branch of KEA – Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. The building was constructed as a branch of the Technical Society's School. It was completed in 1900 from a design by Frederik Bøttger and Christian Larsen. It now houses KRA's construction & technology programmes as well as the student-run Monkey Bar.
The former Prinsesse Charlottes Gade School (No. 46) was one of the first primary schools in Nørrebro. It opened in 1875 as a branch of Sankt Hansgade School. The building was designed by Hans Jørgen Holm. The building is now operated as a daycare under the name Hulahophuset. The building on the other side of the street was built by Copenhagen Municipality in 1884 as stated in an inscription on the facade.
Public art, monuments and memorials
On the gable of the former Sjællandsgade School is a stone plaque commemorating the reunification of Sønderjylland with Denmark in 1920. The plaque features a symbolic relief of a woman approaching another woman seated on a klismos, both with their arms stretched out towards each other as if they are about to embrace. Below the relief is an inscription: "This stone was installed by the school's pupils in exhilaration over the reunification of Sønderjylland with Denmark 1920".

Albert Wittmer Jr. (March 9, 1896 – March 10, 1950) was an American football and basketball player and coach, lawyer, and state legislator. He was a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who attended Allegheny High School and Mercersburg Academy. His father, Albert Wittmer, Sr., was a Pennsylvania native who worked as a butcher in a slaughterhouse. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Wittmer lived in Pittsburgh with his parents, two younger brothers and a younger sister. Wittmer attended Westminster College for one year before enrolling at Princeton University. Wittmer's education was interrupted by military service, as he served in the United States Navy during World War I. Wittmer played college football and basketball at Princeton. He played at the halfback and center positions in football and the guard position in basketball and was selected as the captain of the basketball team in 1921.
After graduating from Princeton, he served as the head coach of the Princeton Tigers men's basketball team for 10 years from 1922 to 1932. His record of 115–86 ranks him as the third winningest basketball coach in Princeton history. His 1924–25 team was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Wittmer also served as the line coach for the Princeton Tigers football team for nine years from 1922 to 1930. In 1931, he was asked to take over as the head football coach and compiled a record in that capacity of 1–7. After retiring from coaching, Wittmer received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He served in the New Jersey State Legislature in the early 1930s and later practiced law in Princeton, New Jersey. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Wittmer was living in Princeton, New Jersey, with his wife, Leah Wittmer, and their daughter Mary (age 1-10/12) and Margaret (age 3-11/12). His profession at that time was listed as a lawyer in general practice. He died suddenly after suffering a heart attack at his sister's home following a party celebrating his 53rd birthday. He had been living with his sister since poor health had caused him to retire.

Clatworthy is a village and civil parish in the Somerset West and Taunton district of Somerset, England. It is situated from Wellington and four miles (6 km) from Wiveliscombe on the southern slopes of the Brendon Hills and close to the Exmoor National Park.
The Clatworthy Reservoir is run by Wessex Water and has a capacity of 5,364,000 cubic metres, supplying some 200,000 homes. It impounds the head waters of the River Tone and the surrounding area is used for walking and fishing.
History
The name of the village means the "homestead where burdock grows". The name appears in the Doomesday Book, 1086, and is the Norman version of the original Anglo Saxon name which was Clota's Wertig [farm]. The Normans changed the name to clateurde which became clatworthy and in some instances Clotworthy.
The parish of Clatworthy was part of the Williton and Freemanners A Hundred.
Just west of the village, at the edge of Exmoor National Park, is the Clatworthy Reservoir, which impounds the headwaters of River Tone and supplies water to some 200,000 homes and businesses, some as far away as Yeovil. An Iron Age enclosure known as Clatworthy Castle was sited on the wooded slopes above the reservoir and there are round barrows in the north of the parish.
Governance
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.
The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.
Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.
It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.
Religious sites
The parish Church of St Mary Magdalene has a 12th-century tower. The nave was rebuilt in 1872, while the chancel was rebuilt and the tower altered between 1860 and 1883.

Newmarket is an English card game of the matching type for any number of players. It is a domestic gambling game, involving more chance than skill, and emerged in the 1880s as an improvement of the older game of Pope Joan. It became known in America as Stops or Boodle before developing into Michigan (see below). In 1981, Newmarket was still the sixth most popular card game in Britain.
History
Pope Joan was an English gambling game with an elaborate staking board in the shape of a rotating multi-compartment dish whose popularity waned in favour of Newmarket in the second half of the 19th century. The earliest known rules appear in The Bazaar, Exchange and Mart in 1875; it differs from later rules in that no spare hand is dealt to increase the number of stop cards.
In America, it was also known as Newmarket to begin with, but later became known as Stops or Boodle before being superseded there by Michigan in the 1920s. Meanwhile Newmarket continues to be a popular family game in the UK, although both it and Michigan are being displaced by games of the Eights family. The 1885 American Hoyle contains the earliest transatlantic rules.
Different rules use different cards on the staking layout which are from a second pack, except where stated. These cards became known as boodles or boodle cards in America. Other names include money cards, luxuries or, in alluding to Newmarket Racecourse, horses.
Heather (1875) – K, Q, Kn and 10
Dick (1885) – A, K, Q and Kn
"Trumps" (1897) – A, K, Q and Kn
Dawson (1923) – A, K, Q and J
Phillips (1957) – A, K, Q and J
Arnold (1988) – an A, K, Q and J of different suits.
Kansil (2001) – A, K, Q and J
Parlett (south London, 2008) – four Kings from the player's pack.
Parlett ("original rules") – an A, K, Q and J of different suits.
Newmarket (1885)
An early description of the rules is given in 1885 edition of The American Hoyle on which the following is based:
Preliminaries
Newmarket is a round game for any number of players using a pack of 52 French-suited cards from which the 8 has been removed. It requires a staking board to which the following cards from a second pack have been affixed: A, K, Q, Kn.
Any player shuffles the pack, has it cut by the person to his right and then deals one card, face up, to each player in clockwise order beginning with the eldest hand (the player to his left). As soon as any player receives a Knave, he becomes the first dealer.
Stakes
Players stake an agreed number of chips upon any of the cards on the staking layout, distributing them as they choose. The dealer stakes double the amount in likewise fashion.
Deal and play
The pack is shuffled and cut before the cards are dealt in entirety, individually, beginning with the eldest hand again. He also deals an extra hand for stops immediately before dealing to himself. There are no trumps.
Eldest leads the lowest card of any suit that he has and names the card as he does so. The player with the next higher card in suit sequence plays and names it. The cards rank from Ace (lowest) to King (highest). Play continues in this way until a stop is reached. A player may play several cards in succession as long as they are in suit sequence.
A stop is a card that stops the sequence continuing because no-one holds it or because it is the highest card; so the four Kings and the 7 are always stops. Also a card ranking immediately below a card in the spare hand are stops. When a stop is played, all the cards are turned face down and the player of the stop (the last card to be played), leads to the next round by playing the lowest card he has of any suit.
If a player plays any of the cards on the staking layout, he sweeps the stakes on that card. If the stakes on any card are not claimed during the round (e.g. because that card is in the spare hand), they remain in place for the next round. If any are left at the end of the session, they are claimed by lot.
Play continues until someone has got rid of all their cards and says "out!" He earns from each other player one chip for each card that player holds.
Newmarket (2011)
The following modern rules are based on Arnold (2011). The main differences from Dick are:
The 8 is not removed from the pack
Any K, Q, J and 10 may be used as staking cards as long as they are of different suits. They have picked up the American nickname of boodles.
There is a separate pool which the winner sweeps instead of claiming a chip per card held by his adversaries
Stakes are prescribed: one to the pool and four to the staking layout
Preliminaries
A standard pack is used with cards ranking in their natural order, Aces low. A King, Queen, Jack and Ten from a second pack are laid in a row on the table; these are called boodles. Deal and play are clockwise. Any player may shuffle and then distribute the cards, individually, until a Jack appears, whereupon the player who received the Jack, will deal first.
Stakes
Each player antes five chips: one to a central pool and the other four to the boodles in any combination he chooses.
Play
The cards are now dealt, singly and in rotation, to each player and, lastly, to a spare hand that is not subsequently touched. Eldest leads by playing any card face up as long as it is the lowest card he holds of that suit. The player with the next higher card in suit sequence now plays it; players may thus play more than one card in succession. Players announce the name of the card as they play and place the card in front of them, not in a common pile or run. This continues until the sequence reaches the King or no-one has the next higher card because it is in the spare hand. Once again, the stops are the Kings and any card immediately below a card in the spare hand. When a sequence stops, the player who played last starts a new sequence with a card that is the lowest of its suit in his hand. Whenever a player plays a card that matches a boodle, he claims the stakes on it. The first player to go out by shedding all his cards sweeps the pool and the next deal starts.
Michigan
Michigan is the popular US version of Newmarket and differs from the 2011 version of Newmarket (above) in the following respects:
The boodles are an A, K, Q and J of different suits, not the K, Q, J and 10
Aces are high
There is no pool. Players ante one chip to each boodle, while the dealer antes two to each
The spare hand is dealt first, not last. It is a widow with which the dealer may exchange his hand
Players must change suit when a suit is stopped
Winning: as in the earliest rules, the winner collects from each adversary one chip per card held in the hand
Arnold points out that both Newmarket and Michigan have a considerable number of variations.

Cape Keltie () is an ice-covered cape on the Clarie Coast of Antarctica, west of Cape Cesney. It was discovered from the Aurora by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911–14) under Douglas Mawson, and roughly charted at a distance of about as lying in 66°5′S 133°0′E. It was named by Mawson for Sir John Scott Keltie, Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, 1892–1915. The identification of this feature is based upon the G.D. Blodgett map of 1955, compiled from aerial photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946–47).

Telecommunications in Western Sahara include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.
Morocco claims the Western Sahara territory and administers Moroccan law through Moroccan institutions in the estimated 85 percent of the territory it controls. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario), an organization that has sought independence for the former Spanish territory since 1973, disputes Morocco's claim to sovereignty over the territory. Because of this long running dispute, many traditional telecommunication statistics are not reported separately for the Western Sahara.
Radio and television
Radio stations:
Morocco's state broadcaster, Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision (SNRT, formerly RTM) operates a radio service from Laayoune (2008);
Polisario-backed medium wave (AM) and shortwave radio stations are on the air (2008);
Unofficial amateur radio stations occasionally operate from Polisario territory. This is classified as the DXCC entity "Western Sahara". Operators use callsigns with the prefix "S0"; an informal identifier that has not been issued by the International Telecommunication Union.
Radios: 56,000 (1997).
Television stations: Morocco's state broadcaster, SNRT, operates a TV service that is relayed in the territory (2008). The Polisario-owned territory operates a minor television service known by the name of RASD TV.
Television sets: 6,000 (1997).
Telephones
Calling code: +212
International call prefix: 00
Main lines: about 2,000 lines in use (1999 estimate).
Mobile cellular: Unknown.
Telephone system: sparse and limited system; tied into Morocco's system by microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, and satellite (2008).
Satellite earth stations: 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) linked to Rabat, Morocco (2008).
Internet
Top-level domain: none, as a disputed territory no country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is assigned, however, .eh is reserved for this purpose, and will be assigned if the competing claimants reach an agreement.
Internet users: unknown (2012).
Fixed broadband: unknown (2012).
Wireless broadband: unknown (2012).
Internet hosts: no hosts explicitly associated with Western Sahara (2012).
IPv4: no addresses allocated (2012).
Internet Service Providers (ISPs): NA
Internet censorship and surveillance
There is no indication that Internet access in the territory differs from that in internationally recognized Morocco, which was generally open. Morocco was listed as engaged in selective Internet filtering in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas and as little or no evidence of filtering in the political area by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in August 2009. Freedom House listed Morocco's "Internet Freedom Status" as "Partly Free" in its 2013 Freedom on the Net report.
Morocco considers the part of the territory that it administers to be an integral component of the kingdom with the same laws and structures regarding civil liberties, political, and economic rights. Moroccan law prohibits citizens from criticizing Islam or the institution of the monarchy or to oppose the government's official position regarding territorial integrity and Western Sahara. Saharan media outlets and bloggers practice self-censorship on these issues, and there are no reports of government action against them for what they write. Human rights and Sahrawi bloggers affiliated with leftist political groups assume that authorities closely monitor their activities and feel the need to hide their identities.

Saint-Jean-Berchmans Church () is a Roman Catholic church in the Petite-Patrie neighbourhood of the Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie borough in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located on Rosemont Boulevard, east of Papineau Avenue.
Church
Saint-Jean-Berchmans Church was built from 1938 to 1939 based on plans by Lucien Parent and René-Rodolphe Tourville. It is characterized by a Latin cross, a nave with three aisles, and its stone cladding. The church possesses a Casavant Frères organ (opus 1620) dating from its foundation. The church showcases ornamental forged iron by Pancrace Balangero. Balangero was commissioned by the firm Tourville Parent for the work. Balangero was active as an ironsmith in Montreal from 1914 to 1957. His works can be found all over Quebec and Ontario, with examples in Valleyfield, Drummondville, Ottawa and the Montérégie region.
Saint-Jean Berchmans Parish
The parish of St. John Berchmans was formed in 1908 but, because of lack of funds, the church was only completed 30 years later. During this period, religious services were held in a crypt.

East Harbour Regional Park is a regional park stretching from Baring Head along the east side of the Wellington Harbour along the east side of Eastbourne. It is located in Lower Hutt City, in the Wellington Region of New Zealand's North Island.
The park is operated by Wellington Regional Council.
Geography
The park covers the bush-clad hills between Eastbourne and Wainuiomata, from near sea level to up to (Lowry). Several tracks, some along ridges and one into the valley of Butterfly Creek, connect the entrances on the Wellington Harbour side and the entrances on the Wainuiomata side.
The southern portion of the park includes the Kohangatera and Kohangapiripiri lakes.
History
Local Māori occupied the area before European settlement, with a network of routes connecting settlements along the eastern harbour coast.
Te Atiawa were continuing to visit the area for seasonal fishing and berry-picking when the New Zealand Company began organised European settlement in the region in 1839, and were continuing to occupy the area late into the 19th century.
Days Bay became popular for picnics and walking from the 1890s. Tracks were built in the area under a Great Depression work scheme, making the Butterfly Creek picnic area more popular from the 1930s.
There were several shipwrecks along the coast, even after the Pencarrow Lighthouse was built in 1906 and Baring Head Lighthouse was built in 1925.
The area became the base for a proposed regional park in 1973.
Volunteers began planting native trees in the park in 2018, and had planted almost 7000 trees by 2021. The plantings include trees along the coast, and toitoi, flax, and ngaio along the Wainuiomata River bank.
Wellington Regional Council consulted on the future of the park in 2020, opting reduce stock grazing and increase native bush and wetlands.
As of 2021, there were plans to establish overnight accommodation near the Baring Head Lighthouse.
Recreation
The park is used for mountain biking, cycling, walking, running and tramping. There is a 6 kilometre return walk from the coastal carpark to Baring Head Lighthouse.
Dogs are permitted on a leash during summer months, but are not permitted lower lighthouse, the Parangarahu Lakes Area or at Baring Head/Orua-pouanui at any time. There is a ban on dogs during the August to October lambing season.
Fireworks are prohibited.

Paravai Muniyamma (25 June 1937 – 29 March 2020) was an Indian folk singer and actress. She got the adjective Paravai as she was born in a village called Paravai in Madurai. She featured in many Tamil films mostly in supporting roles and also worked as a playback singer. Muniyamma also had her own cooking show on Kalaignar TV. She was introduced by music director Vidyasagar in the Tamil film industry.
Career
Muniyamma pursued her career as a singer by performing at cultural temple functions and also performed around 2,000 stage performances of folk songs in her 60s, which also include shows in London, Singapore and Malaysia on behalf of the Lakshman Sruthi. In an interview with The Hindu in 2004, she once pointed out the fact that her overseas international folk related programmes stand testimony to the fact that human race has a passion towards folk art and culture.
She was approached by several musical directors during her peak, notably by A. R. Rahman to croon a song for the 1995 film Muthu, however she turned down the offer due to unknown reasons. She was also approached by music director Vidyasagar to croon a folk song for the film Dhool (2003) and she accepted the offer. She made her film debut as playback singer with the film Dhool and sang her first film song "Singam Pola Nadanthu Vaaraan" which was well acclaimed by the audience as the song was shot during a fighting sequence. She was eventually cast in a supporting role in the same film by director which also eventually marked her film acting debut at the age of 66. She then appeared in over 50 films, usually playing grandmother roles. The success of the film and the song prompted further acting and singing offers for Muniyamma from the film industry.
After she was hospitalized in 2015, the Tamil film industry helped her, including actors Sivakarthikeyan, Sarathkumar and Vishal. Then, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa helped her under the MGR welfare scheme by arranging 6 lakhs fixed deposit in her name, and actor Dhanush took care of her treatment expenses.
In November 2019, she was rumoured to have died after being critically ill. In February 2020, she came to promote and watch the film Maayanadhi in theatre after a request from actor Abi Saravanan despite being critically ill for years. She was awarded the Kalaimamani in 2019 by the government of Tamil Nadu.

Sir John Chalker Crosbie (11 September 1876 – 5 October 1932) was a Newfoundland merchant and politician.
An aggressive and energetic entrepreneur, he created a fortune (which he lost) and started the Crosbie dynasty. His son, Chesley Crosbie, and grandson, John Crosbie were both affluent politicians. In 1900 Crosbie founded Crosbie and Co. and by 1920 was one of the leading fish exporters in Newfoundland.
He entered politics as MHA for Bay de Verde in 1908. After Edward Morris resigned at the end of 1917, Crosbie served as Prime Minister in a caretaker capacity until 5 January 1918, when William Lloyd took office. He was Minister of Shipping in 1919 and Minister of Finance and Customs under Prime Minister Walter Monroe from 1924 to 1928.

Paso Robles High School (PRHS) is the only comprehensive high school located in the city of Paso Robles, California. The school receives its students from George H. Flamson Middle School and Daniel E. Lewis Middle School, both located in Paso Robles, and from the Lillian Larsen School, a public K-8 school in San Miguel, California, Cappy Culver Elementary and Middle School, a public K-8 school in Lake Nacimiento, California, and Pleasant Valley Elementary School, a public K-8 school located in an outlying area of northeastern San Luis Obispo County. Additionally, the school receives students from private K-8 schools such as Trinity Lutheran School and St. Rose Catholic School, both located in Paso Robles, and some from Santa Lucia School located in Templeton, California
The school boasts strong vocational, agricultural, and college preparatory programs, as well as a limited number of honors and AP courses in the fields of history/social science (honors/AP), English language/literature (honors/AP), mathematics (AP) and science (AP). Foreign languages offered include Spanish, French, and American Sign Language. The school has also maintained the largest SkillsUSA organization in California for several years, and it is an AVID National Demonstration School.
The first high school in San Luis Obispo County, Paso Robles High School was built in 1892 and graduated its first senior class in 1896. Constructed with locally made bricks, the stately three-story structure was located at 17th Street and Vine Street, where Marie Bauer Elementary sits now. A decade upon opening, the high school and upper-level auditorium would languish in the aftermath of the San Francisco Earthquake in 1906. A new location was built at 24th and Spring Street, and the faulted building was later razed in 1939. In the 1960s, the 24th Street campus was refurbished, with subsequent additions to what later became Flamson Middle School. (By 2003, the San Simeon Earthquake rendered the structures unsalvageable, and a new middle school was constructed.) By 1980, the third PRHS campus was built on Niblick Road, where it stands today. However, football games continue at War Memorial Stadium on the Flamson Middle School campus to a faithful attendance of PRHS boosters. Most other competitive sporting events are held on the PRHS campus. Although the school's athletic facilities are somewhat limited, the campus plays host to an extensive agricultural education facility. The school's mascot is the bearcat.
Paso Robles High School was ranked #5 in U.S. News & World Report's "Best High Schools in the San Luis Obispo, CA Area".
Sports
Paso Robles High School was the northernmost high school in the western half of the CIF Southern Section for decades.
In 2018, Paso Robles transferred into the CIF Central Section along with most schools in San Luis Obispo County in a bid to reduce travel expenses and to be more regional. Now playing in the Mountain League as part of the Central Coast Athletic Association, in years past PRHS used to belong to the since-reformed Northern League, Los Padres League and Pac-8 League memberships.

Kompakt: Total 3 or Total 3 was released on 31 July 2001. The album is the third installment of the influential Cologne-based microhouse label's annual compilation of vinyl releases and exclusives from its biggest artists and most promising newcomers. Vinyl and CD editions are quite different since only six songs are included on both formats. All tracks on the vinyl format were previously unreleased when the compilation came out. "Departures" was since included on Closer Musik's album After Love, "So Weit Wie Noch Nie" was since released on 12 inches, both on Kompakt in 2002.

Daniel Moreira (born 8 August 1977) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker.
Club career
Born in Maubeuge, Moreira started his career with Valenciennes FC before moving to Guingamp. He finished as the runners-up of the 1997 Coupe de France playing for them.
In 1998, he transferred to RC Lens. He won the Coupe de la Ligue with the Les Sang et Or in 1999, scoring the winning goal in the final against Metz, and got very close from winning the national championship in 2002. After spending six years at Stade Félix Bollaert, he was rewarded with a move to Toulouse FC. In the 2005–06 season, he formed a formidable attacking partnership alongside Brazilian-born Tunisian forward Santos, scoring 15 goals between them in Ligue 1.
On 22 June 2006, Moreira agreed to join Stade Rennais for a fee of €5,500,000.
Moreira made a less than impressive season at his new club, not scoring after 29 appearances (17 of them as starter). In 2008, he was then loaned to recently promoted Grenoble where, on 9 August, he scored a goal for his debut against Sochaux at the 89th minute to ensure an unexpected 2–1 away win for Grenoble's first Ligue 1 game for 43 years.
In August 2009 he transferred to US Boulogne. After a complicated knee injury, he retired from professional football in December 2010.
International career
Moreira was born in France, and is of Portuguese descent. Moreira has earned 3 caps in his career, making his debut for the France national team on 20 November 2002 in a 3–0 win against Serbia.

Laugh Parade was a group of weekly gag cartoons written by Bunny Hoest and drawn by John Reiner. It ran in Parade, a Sunday newspaper magazine supplement.
Laugh Parade displayed three or four single-panel cartoons, one of which was Howard Huge. Reiner used an ink wash to give the strip a greyish, monochromatic tone. Hoest and Reiner collaborate on another cartoon series called The Lockhorns, which is distributed by King Features Syndicate. The Lockhorns was created in 1968 by Bill Hoest, who followed with the creation of Laugh Parade in 1980 and Howard Huge in 1981.
In 1986, the publishers of Parade, Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc., filed for a trademark of Laugh Parade, and they renewed that trademark in 2007.
The Hoest and Reiner feature had no association with the humor magazine Laugh Parade, published during the 1960s and 1970s by Magazine Management. That publication featured cartoons by Don Orehek and others.
Awards
Reiner won the National Cartoonists Society's Gag Cartoons Award in 1994.

Charles Jameson Matinga was a politician in Nyasaland before the colony obtained independence from the British.
He was elected President-General of the Nyasaland African Congress in 1945, after the death of Levi Zililo Mumba.
In 1950, he was thrown out of office. Later he formed a pro-government party. After Malawi achieved independence in 1964, he was forced into exile.
Background
Charles Matinga had a long career in the civil service, based in Blantyre, and ran a brick-making business on the side. He was a member of the Free Church of Scotland Mission and an active member of the Blantyre Native Association.
In a 1943 speech, Matinga praised the earlier missionaries who had come to the country before 1914 and worked to help Africans advance, but said that later arrivals had brought racist ideas and prejudices and had failed to promote African interests.
He also strongly criticised the administration for failing to meet African demands for advancement. However, he continued to believe in working within the system to improve it rather than in rebellion against the system.
NAC leader
Africans had been represented in the Protectorate of Nyasaland by the Native Administration of chiefs and headmen, and by local Native Associations. The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC), formed in 1943/1944 was the first organization that attempted to work at a national level.
Charles Matinga was elected first Vice-President of the Congress at the first general meeting in October 1944, with Levi Mumba being elected President-General.
Charles Wesley Mlanga, editor of the Blantyre newspaper Zo-Ona, was elected Secretary General and James Dixon Phiri, a clerk in the Public Works Department, was elected assistant secretary-general.
When Mumba died in January 1945, Matinga was elected to succeed him as President, with the Reverend Charles Chinula as Vice-President.
Matinga surprised the government by raising the issue of land grievances, and demanding African majority representation on the Legislative Council and other administrative bodies.
Dr. Hastings Banda, who had a practice in London at the time, was a supporter of Congress. Banda wrote to Matinga in March 1945 saying that he would support the Congress in England by giving lectures and talking to influential people whom he knew such as Sir Arthur Creech Jones and Rita Hinden. He asked that Matinga keep him informed of events in Nyasaland so they could work together to the common goal. However, according to Banda, Matinga was determined to go his own way and even refused an offer by Banda to pay for a permanent organizer for the Congress. Possible Matinga saw Banda as a potential rival.
In the 1930s the concept of a Federation of the colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had been proposed, and the idea gained increased support in the 1940s among the colonial administrators. This was seen as a betrayal by NAC leaders such as Matinga and James Frederick Sangala, who thought the Colonial Office was discarding the principle that African interests were paramount, instead favoring White colonists.
After federation was discussed in more detail at the second Victoria Falls conference in 1949, Matinga wrote Banda in London asking for support in fighting federalism.
The NAC decided to send a delegation to London to meet the Colonial Secretary and discuss provisions for educating Africans in Nyasaland, and by May 1947 had raised enough funds to send two members, Matinga and the Vice-President Charles Chinula. In London they would be joined by Hastings Banda. In November 1947 they were told that the Secretary of State would receive them. Matinga left for Cape Town to take the ship to the United Kingdom, but took the Secretary General of Congress, Andrew Mponda, rather than Chinula.
The party met with Arthur Creech Jones, now the Labour Party's Secretary of State, and gained agreement on the importance of secondary education. This led to establishment of a new secondary school at Dedza in 1951.
It was also agreed to establish a teachers training college as Domasi.
Matinga's action in taking his protégé Mponda with him rather than Chinula caused widespread anger among the NAC members, compounded by accusations that Matinga had misused NAC funds on the trip, and by Matinga's failure to attend NAC meetings and report on the trip after he had returned. Sangala managed to prevent police action regarding the funds. But Matinga did not report to Congress until the spring of 1949, and then gave only a verbal summary.
When the delegates asked for a full written report, Matinga walked out. The NAC was no longer an effective organization.
Under pressure from Congress delegates, Sangala (who had been one of the original prime movers in organizing the NAC), called a conference on 1 January 1950. Matinga surprised everyone by attending and chairing the first session of the meeting. However, the meeting resolved to dismiss him for abuse of funds. Sangala was forced into desperate efforts to recreate the Congress, arranging a session in August 1950 at which he was elected Vice President and James Chinyama became President.
Later career
The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland became a reality in 1953, against strong opposition from NAC members, some of whom were arrested.
Charles Matinga, Andrew Mponda and Orton Ching'oli Chirwa formed the Nyasaland Progressive Association, dedicated to working within the new reality of the Federation.
Matinga became a Federal Member of Parliament.
In 1957 and early 1958 the Governor of Nyasaland, Sir Robert Armitage, was attempting to formulate a view of how to evolve the government of the protectorate which he could present to the Colonial Office when he went on leave to London.
In September he met with T.D.T. Banda and other NAC leaders who were pushing for an elected legislative council composed primarily of Africans. He met Charles Matinga's Progressive Party on 20 February 1958, and sensed that they did not feel Africans were ready to run the government, but wanted nominated representatives to work with the government. He summarised the views of Matinga's party as: "In other words they wanted a lot of friendly Africans and Europeans to collaborate with friendly officials. But, of course, politics cannot be this easily organized".
In July 1962, along with J. R. N. Chinyama and Pemba Ndovi, Matinga formed the Convention African National Union (CANU), a rival party to the dominant Malawi Congress Party. CANU called for an end to "one man, one party, one leader in Nyasaland" .
After independence in 1964, people felt bitterly about men such as Matinga who they felt were traitors for having supported the colonial rulers during the struggle for independence.
Matinga left Malawi and settled in Southern Rhodesia.
In 1973, the exiled "Capricorns" who had sided with white-led pro-federation parties - Matinga, Matthews Phiri and Manoah Chirwa - asked President Hastings Banda to be allowed to return to Malawi. Banda asked delegates at the annual MCP convention what they thought about the request. However, he became furious with some who proposed allowing their return, and accused them of sympathy with rebels.

Penarth Town Council is an elected community council serving the town of Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales.
Background
Penarth has had a council of one form or another since the 1890s. Penarth Town Council came into existence in 1974 at the same time as local government reorganisation.
Town councillors represent Penarth's views on various committees and to wider public bodies. It gives out awards and grants. The council is responsible for Penarth Cemetery (which was originally acquired by Penarth Urban District Council in 1903) and the town allotments.
The council also manages three important buildings in the town, namely West House (the council headquarters), The Paget Rooms (a theatre in the town centre) and The Kymin (a Georgian house near the seafront). West House was purchased from Vale of Glamorgan Council for £100,000 and is the location for the council chamber (where council meetings are held), a Register Office (for births and deaths) and is a licensed wedding venue.
Representation
Sixteen councillors are elected from the four electoral wards in the town, namely: Cornerswell (4), Plymouth (4), St Augustine's (5) and Stanwell (3). In 2017 eleven of the seats were won by the Labour Party and five by the Conservatives.
In January 2018 the council supported recommendations that five senior councillors would receive an allowance of £500 per year.
Mayor
The council elects a town mayor and deputy mayor annually.
Council composition
Following the election on 4 May 2017 Labour were the largest party. The Conservatives increased their numbers from four to five, winning back a seat from Labour for the St Augustine's ward. Candidates also stood for Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Penarth First Independents, though these other parties didn't win any seats. Stanwell councillor Janice Birch, who'd first been elected in 1975, stood down at this election.

The Altiplano (Spanish for "high plain"), Collao (Quechua and Aymara: Qullaw, meaning "place of the Qulla") or Andean Plateau, in west-central South America, is the most extensive high plateau on Earth outside Tibet. The plateau is located at the same latitude where the north-south trending Andes are the widest. The bulk of the Altiplano lies in Bolivia, but its northern parts lie in Peru, and its southwestern fringes lie in Chile.
The plateau hosts several cities of these three nations, including El Alto, La Paz, Oruro, and Puno. The northeastern Altiplano is more humid than the southwestern area. The latter area has several salares, or salt flats, due to its aridity. At the Bolivia–Peru border lies Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America. South of that in Bolivia was Lake Poopó, which was declared dried up and defunct as of December 2015. It is unclear if this second-largest lake in Bolivia can be revitalized.
The Altiplano was the site of several pre-Columbian cultures, including the Chiripa, Tiawanaku and the Inca Empire. Spain conquered the region in the 16th century.
Major economic activities in the Altiplano include mining, llama and vicuña herding, and services in the cities. There is some international tourism.
Geography
The Altiplano is an area of inland drainage (endorheism) lying in the central Andes, occupying parts of northern Chile, western Bolivia, southern Peru and northwest Argentina. Its height averages about 3,750 meters (12,300 feet), slightly less than that of the Tibetan Plateau. Unlike conditions in Tibet, the Altiplano is dominated by massive active volcanoes of the Central Volcanic Zone to the west, such as Ampato (6288 m), Tutupaca (5,816 m), Parinacota (6348 m), Guallatiri (6071 m), Paruma (5,728 m), Uturunku (6,008 m) and Licancabur (5,916 m), and the Cordillera Real in the north east with Illampu (6,368 m), Huayna Potosí (6,088 m), Janq'u Uma (6,427 m) and Illimani (6,438 m). The Atacama Desert, one of the driest areas on the planet, lies to the southwest of the Altiplano; to the east lies the humid Amazon rainforest.
The Altiplano is noted for hypoxic air caused by very high elevation. The communities that inhabit the Altiplano include Qulla, Uros, Quechua and Aymara.
Geology
Several mechanisms have been put forth for the formation of the Altiplano plateau; hypotheses try to explain why the topography in the Andes incorporates this large area of low relief at high altitude (high plateau) within the orogen:
Existence of weaknesses in the Earth's crust prior to tectonic shortening. Such weaknesses would cause the partition of tectonic deformation and uplift into the eastern and western cordillera, leaving the necessary space for the formation of the altiplano basin.
Magmatic processes rooted in the asthenosphere might have contributed to uplift of the plateau.
Climate has controlled the spatial distribution of erosion and sediment deposition, controlling the lubrication along the subducting Nazca Plate and hence influencing the transmission of tectonic forces into South America.
Climate also determined the formation of internal drainage (endorheism) and sediment trapping within the Andes, potentially blocking tectonic deformation in the central area between the two cordilleras, and expelling deformation towards the flanks of the orogen
Convective removal of the dense lower lithosphere beneath the Altiplano caused that region to isostatically 'float' higher
At various times during the Pleistocene epoch, both the southern and northern Altiplano were covered by vast pluvial lakes. Remnants are Lake Titicaca, straddling the Peru–Bolivia border, and Poopó, a salt lake that extends south of Oruro, Bolivia. Salar de Uyuni, locally known as Salar de Tunupa, and Salar de Coipasa are two large dry salt flats formed after the Altiplano paleolakes dried out.
Climate
The term Altiplano is sometimes used to identify the altitude zone and the type of climate that prevails within it: it is colder than that of the tierra fría but not as cold as that of the tierra helada. Scientists classify the latter as commencing at an elevation of approximately 4,500 meters (or about 15,000 feet). Alternate names used in place of altiplano in this context include puna and páramos.
In general the climate is cool and humid to semi-arid and even arid, with mean annual temperatures that vary from near the western mountain range to near Lake Titicaca; and total annual rainfall that ranges between less than to the south west to more than near and over Lake Titicaca. The diurnal cycle of temperature is very wide, with maximum temperatures in the order of and the minimum in the order of .
The coldest temperatures occur in the southwestern portion of the Altiplano during the winter months of June and July. The seasonal cycle of rainfall is marked, with the rainy season concentrated between December and March. The rest of the year tends to be very dry, cool, windy and sunny. Snowfall may happen between April and September, especially to the north, but it is not very common (between one and five times a year).

Emerson Bennett' (March 16, 1822 – May 11, 1905) was an American author primarily known for his lively romantic adventure tales depicting American frontier life. He was the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories.
At one time, Bennett was one of the most popular authors in America. Several of his books reportedly sold over 100,000 copies. Bennett's work frequently appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Ledger and other periodicals. Some of his writings were translated into other languages. Bennett also wrote poetry and edited several periodicals. However these other literary endeavors never met with the commercial success of his prose fiction. Bennett wrote light, sensational and heroic adventure tales which many readers found engaging. His work sometimes first appeared in serialized form in newspapers and periodicals, which were subsequently reissued in book form.
Despite selling well at times, Bennett's fiction is generally regarded as substantially lacking in literary merit. He is more remembered as one of the leading novelists of the “yaller kivers” period of mid-nineteenth century American fiction, (so called for the “yellow covers” on the cheap sensational novels sold in railway stations and by newsboys during that era.) His books have also been called "dime novels". Bennett's popularity declined significantly during his later life.
Bennett was born in Monson, Massachusetts on May 16, 1822 and attended local schools and Monson Academy. At 17, he left home with the intention of becoming a writer. Little is known about this period of Bennett's life. It is known that after leaving home he moved initially to New York City, and then later to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Pittsburgh, eventually relocating to Cincinnati in 1844. During this period he lived frugally and supported himself in several sales jobs. Unable to gain steady employment as a writer, he took work going on the road throughout Ohio selling subscriptions for the Western Literary Journal. Returning from one of these sales trips, Bennett learned that a story he had written while in Philadelphia had been published. On the strength of this first successful story, Bennett was able to obtain a commission to write a serialized story for the Western Literary Journal. Many more publications of Bennett's work followed. Bennett also edited several periodical publications during his career. In 1847 Bennett married Eliza G. Daly. In 1850, he returned to Philadelphia, where he eventually retired. He spent the last few years of his life as a resident of the Masonic Home in that city, until his death in 1905 at the age of 82.
Although not altogether without artistic merit, Bennett's fiction has been characterized as derivative and formulaic, lacking originality. His work was also at times overtly racist or antisemitic. Today Bennett is remembered primarily as a figure of historical interest for the depictions he rendered of life on the American frontier. Bennett at times incorporated actual historical persons and events into his fictionalized stories. Bennett himself is considered a noteworthy figure in the early history of American popular fiction.
Personal life
In 1947, Bennett married Eliza G. Daly in Philadelphia.

The FIFA Club World Cup is an international association football competition organised by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship was first contested as the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards.
The current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament.
Pep Guardiola is the first and currently the only manager to have won the tournament on three occasions; he led Spanish club Barcelona to success in 2009 and 2011, and coached German side Bayern Munich to victory in 2013. Carlo Ancelotti (in 2007 and 2014) and Zinedine Zidane (in 2016 and 2017) have won two titles each. Ten other managers have each won the competition once. Thomas Tuchel is the most recent manager to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, doing so with Chelsea in the 2021 edition.
List of managers in the final
Brazilian, Spanish and German managers hold the joint-record for most consecutive appearances of winning coaches, with three back-to-back triumphs each; a Brazilian manager won the final in 2000, 2005 and 2006, a Spanish manager did so in 2009, 2010 and 2011, while a German manager accomplished the feat in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Spanish managers have won also won the most total finals, with five (the aforementioned three, plus in 2013 and 2015).
Rafael Benítez of Spain became the first manager to reach the FIFA Club World Cup final with a foreign club when English side Liverpool side lost the 2005 final under his leadership; he led other foreign clubs to the final on two further occasions, winning in 2010 with Italian side Internazionale and losing in 2012 with English team Chelsea. Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Zinedine Zidane, Santiago Solari, Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel are the other managers to win the final with a foreign club, with Zidane the only one to accomplish this on multiple occasions, in 2016 and 2017 as manager of Real Madrid.
Along with Zidane, Guardiola is the only other manager to have led the same club to the final on more than one occasion, coming out victorious with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. He also won the final in 2013 as coach of Bayern Munich, becoming the first manager to win the trophy three times.
The inaugural final in 2000 remains the only one to see two managers from the same nation, with both hailing from Brazil.
Results by manager
Pep Guardiola is the only manager to have won three FIFA Club World Cups: twice with Barcelona and once with Bayern Munich. Rafael Benítez, alongside Guardiola, holds the record for the most appearances in the final, leading English clubs Liverpool and Chelsea, as well as Italian club Internazionale, to one final each. Lamine N'Diaye of Senegal in 2010, Faouzi Benzarti of Tunisia in 2013 and Masatada Ishii of Japan in 2016 hold the distinction of being the only non-European and non-South American managers to have appeared in the final. The aforementioned three managers, as well as Zoran Mamić in 2018 and Ricardo Ferretti in 2020, are the only ones to have led a club outside Europe and South America into the decisive match.
Results by nationality
Spanish managers have had the most success in the competition, amassing five titles in seven total final appearances. Brazilian managers have won four titles, German managers have won three, French and Italian managers have each won two, and a Scottish manager has won the title once. Argentine managers hold the dubious record of the most losses in the final with five, including defeats in three consecutive editions; a manager from Argentina has only won the competition on one occasion.
Results by continent
European managers remain the most successful of the competition, with a total of thirteen titles. Their South American counterparts are second with five titles, while Africa has had two managers lead a club into the final, and Asia has had one.

Fry sauce is a condiment often served with French fries or tostones (twice-fried plantain slices) in many places in the world. It is usually a combination of one part tomato ketchup and two parts mayonnaise. Historically, the Argentinian Salsa golf is most likely the first ketchup and mayonnaise sauce, having been invented in the 1920s by Luis Leloir.
In the United States
Although sauce composed of a mixture of equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise appears in a New Orleans cookbook published in 1900, fry sauce was popularized in Utah. It may have first appeared there in 1955 at Stan's Drive-In, which was then a franchise of Arctic Circle. Another possible origin for fry sauce was the "pink sauce" served in 1941 at Don Carlos Barbecue in Salt Lake City. In his essay on Utah fry sauce, Michael P. Christensen noted that fry sauce "functions as a cultural identifier for Utahns." The Arctic Circle chain still serves fry sauce in its western United States restaurants.
In April 2018, Heinz announced the release of "Mayochup", a mixture of the two sauces, because 500,000+ users voted "yes" in a Twitter poll asking Americans if they wanted to see it in stores. A number of Twitter users responded that such a mixture already existed as "fry sauce" and "fancy sauce". The sauce arrived at U.S. retailers' shelves in September 2018.
Several fast food chains have individually branded variants of fry sauce using a mayonnaise and ketchup base, including Zaxby's, Raising Cane's, and Freddy's.
The sauce is also closely related to Yum Yum sauce, which is popular in Japanese steakhouses in America.
Outside the United States
In Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, a similar condiment known as (golf sauce) is a popular dressing for fries, burgers, steak sandwiches, and seafood salads. According to tradition, the sauce was invented by Luis Federico Leloir, a Nobel laureate and restaurant patron, at a golf club in Mar del Plata, Argentina, during the mid-1920s. In Spain and Colombia, it is known as salsa rosa or salsa rosada, a variant of cocktail sauce or Marie Rose sauce.
In France, many Turkish restaurants and fast food establishments serve fry sauce and call it ; it is also common for customers to request (a dab of mayonnaise and a dab of ketchup) alongside their French fries at such places. Both sauce cocktail and the thousand island-like sauce cocktail can often be found in supermarkets.
In Germany, a popular product called (red white) is sold in toothpaste-style tubes; it consists of unmixed ketchup and mayonnaise, which form a red-and-white striped string when squeezed out. Fries at restaurants are sometimes served with an equal mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise. This style of serving is often called Pommes Rot-Weiß or, colloquially Pommes Schranke (barrier gate) due to the red white coloration of those. or (fry sauce) is a lightly spiced mayonnaise similar to the Dutch . A condiment similar to the American fry sauce is known as , but it is more often used for döner kebab than for French fries.
In Iceland, a condiment similar to fry sauce called (cocktail sauce) is popular.
In the Philippines, a similar sauce is made by combining mayonnaise and banana ketchup. It is commonly used as a dipping sauce for fried food like french fries and cheese sticks (deep fried cheese wrapped in lumpia wrapper) but also for appetizers like lumpia.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically, London, this sauce is known as "burger sauce", and is served in one of two ways:
Premixed, similarly to the photos above;
Separate, but together, similar to the Turkish . The ketchup is put in the container followed by the mayonnaise, and is mixed by hand by the consumer, using the desired foodstuffs to mix them together as it is dipped.
In Puerto Rico, mayokétchup is widely used with , sandwiches, burgers, and fried foods. It is made of two parts ketchup and one part mayonnaise with the addition of garlic.

Kevin Coe (born Frederick Harlan Coe on February 2, 1947) is an American convicted rapist from Spokane, Washington, often referred to in the news media as the South Hill Rapist. As of May 2008, Coe is still a suspect in dozens of rapes, the number of which is unusually large; his convictions received an unusual amount of attention from appeals courts. Coe's mother, Ruth, was convicted of hiring a hitman against the judge and the prosecutor at her son's trial following his conviction. The bizarre relationship between Coe and his mother became the subject of a nonfiction book, Son: A Psychopath and his Victims, by the crime author Jack Olsen.
On July 31, 1982, Coe legally changed his first name to Kevin.
Arrest and trial
During the wave of sexual assaults perpetrated in Spokane between 1978 and 1981, many involved an extreme level of physical injury to the victims. Due to a distinctive "signature," a gloved fist or fingers rammed in the mouth and throat of his victims, police suspected the rapes to be the work of a single offender, whom the media soon dubbed the South Hill Rapist.
In 1981, after a school custodian observed a car illegally parked in a bus drop-off zone during the time a daylight rape occurred, police traced the vehicle registration to Gordon Coe, the managing editor of the Spokane Chronicle. The senior Coe was in charge of a program to receive tips on the rapist's identity. Gordon was ruled out due to his age; his son, Fred also known as "Kevin" a former Las Vegas radio announcer and unsuccessful real estate agent, had the use of the car. Police placed a tracking device on Kevin Coe's car and discovered that, in addition to targeting lone female joggers, he was apparently stalking city buses for victims.
After several victims identified him in photo lineups, Coe was arrested on six charges of first degree rape, although authorities believe he was actually responsible for numerous incidents of voyeurism, indecent exposure, indecent assaults and at least 43 rapes. One of Coe's victims was former KREM-TVAnd KING-TV meteorologist and former KHQ-TV anchor Shelly Monahan, but her case was not one of the six; she underwent hypnosis but was not able to identify her attacker.
Coe was originally put on trial in 1981 and convicted on four of the six charges of rape. The case was a strong circumstantial one: in addition to positive identification given by the six victims, Coe had received speeding tickets in the same areas right after the rapes occurred; his blood type matched that left at the scene; and like the rapist, he was a secretor, meaning his blood type showed up in his bodily fluids. Coe's alibi was that he was either having breakfast or dining with his parents during the time the attacks occurred, or else, as his socialite mother Ruth testified, teaming up with her in a mother-and-son vigilante squad to follow local buses in order to try to capture the real rapist themselves.
At sentencing, a psychiatrist hired by the defense testified that Coe had confessed to the sixth rape; this did nothing to reduce his consecutive sentences, which amounted to life plus 75 years. Coe would later recant this, claiming he had concocted the story thinking he'd be sentenced to a psychosexual treatment center instead of prison.
In June 1984, three years after Coe's trial, Washington's Supreme Court tossed out all of his convictions because many of the victims had been hypnotized before formally identifying him, in the hope of providing more details to the rapist's identity. Coe was released on bail for a year before the new proceeding, where he was retried on the four counts for which he had been convicted, and was convicted again on three and sentenced to life plus 55 years. His appeal of the new convictions also made it all the way to the Washington Supreme Court, which in 1985 overturned two and upheld one (where his accuser clearly saw his face during the attack, so there had been no need to hypnotize her).
Mother's arrest
Three months after Coe was convicted, Ruth was arrested for trying to solicit the murder or maiming of her son's prosecutor and judge. She was convicted the next year and served several months in jail.
Confinement history
Coe served the entire 25 years of his sentence at Walla Walla State Penitentiary. Maintaining his innocence, he did not attend any prison counseling programs. Coe became eligible for parole in 1992 but never applied.
In 1990, Washington passed the Community Protection Act, a "civil commitment" statute that allows the state to indefinitely retain dangerous sexually violent predators even after their criminal sentences ended. If found guilty by a jury of possessing a "mental defect" that makes them likely to reoffend, offenders are sent to the Special Commitment Center on McNeil Island, where they receive treatment for mental disorders linked to sexual deviancy. Prosecutors attempted to apply this statute to Coe; on Dec. 22, 2007, a judge postponed the trial until his sentence was due for completion in September 2008.
While preparing for the hearing, a new search of the Spokane Police's evidence room turned up a box containing a rape kit slide with DNA, which was a match to Coe. However, the DNA evidence that matched Coe's was not for any of the other rape convictions that had been overturned, but for the rape for which he had just served time. Upon the completion of his prison sentence, Coe was transferred to McNeil Island to await the civil commit trial, which began on September 15, 2008. On October 15, 2008, the prosecution and defense rested their case. The next day, after several hours of deliberation, the jury decided that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Coe was a violent sexual predator; he was committed to McNeil Island indefinitely.
As of March 24, 2011, as reported in the Spokane Spokesman-Review, Coe's appeal of the trial proceeding to be civilly committed as a sexual predator was denied:
... 23 victims identified Coe as their attacker in crimes that occurred during the decade leading up to Coe's 1981 arrest. She [Psychologist Amy Phenix] enumerated another 30 sex crimes in which the victims could not identify their attacker, but said she believed Coe was the perpetrator because of similarities to the other attacks.
Coe has been diagnosed with mixed personality disorder with narcissistic, histrionic and antisocial features.

Hervé Porquet (born 22 March 1957) is a French former professional footballer who played as a forward. He notably played in the Division 1 for Paris Saint-Germain from 1977 to 1979.
Club career
Porquet played for ASA Montereau and FC Brunoy in his youth before joining Meaux. At Meaux, he made several performances in the Coupe de France that helped him sign for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 1977. He signed for the club as a professional trainee. In two seasons at PSG, he scored over 50 goals for the reserve side, and made ten appearances in the Division 1, scoring two goals. In January 2007, Porquet recalled his goal for PSG against Bordeaux on 17 December 1977 as his "best memory" at Paris Saint-Germain. He came on as a substitute and scored the winner for Les Parisiens at the 85th minute, being the quickest player to latch onto Carlos Bianchi's shot that was stopped by the Bordeaux goalkeeper Philippe Bergeroo.
For his performances at Paris Saint-Germain, Porquet attracted interest from Valenciennes and Troyes. However, he instead signed for Division 3 side Fontainebleau in 1979. In 2014, Porquet explained that he "does not regret at all [his] choice". He explained that he had recently been married, and that he was looking to prepare his post-football career. In Fontainebleau, he was offered a job as a foreman in an industrial company. In 1982, Porquet moved to Le Mée-sur-Seine, where he met Christian Quillay, who offered him to join his amateur club, Le Mée SF. Porquet accepted, thereby ending his professional career. He would go on to play for the club's first team until 1992.
International career
Porquet was a youth international for France. He has also played for , representing the , at cadet, youth, and senior level.
Personal life
Porquet married in the 1970s. After retiring from football in 1992, he continued playing for the "veterans" team of Le Mée SF until 2001. After having been introduced by Christian Quillay, Porquet worked as a sales executive for Continental, an automotive parts company. Porquet would keep the job for over 30 years. He is also an artist; he has created a website where he shows off his artistic works, usually paintings and drawings.

A false sunrise is any of several atmospheric optical phenomena in which the Sun appears to have risen, but is actually still some distance below the horizon. A number of different atmospheric conditions can be responsible for this effect, all of which divert the sunlight in such a way as to allow it to reach the observer's eye, thereby giving the impression that the light comes directly from the Sun itself. The spread of light can sometimes be deceivingly similar to a true sun.
Several atmospheric phenomena that may alternatively be called a "false sunrise" are:
Simple reflection of the sunlight off the bottom of the clouds.
A type of ice crystal halo, such as an upper tangent arc or, more commonly, an upper sun pillar (similar to a subsun, but extending above the sun instead of below it). Like all halos, these phenomena are caused by the reflection and/or refraction of sunlight by ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, often in the form of cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. The temperature on the ground is irrelevant to their occurrence, meaning that halos can be seen throughout the year and in all climates.
A type of mirage, specifically the Novaya Zemlya effect. Restricted mainly to the polar regions, this phenomenon was named after its first observation on Novaya Zemlya during the third polar expedition led by Willem Barentsz in 1596/97, when the Sun was seen above the horizon "in his full roundnesse" two weeks before its predicted return after the polar night. The account, written by officer Gerrit de Veer, was met with general scepticism for centuries, and not until modern times was the effect proven to be genuine.
The term "false sunrise" should not be confused with "false dawn", which is a term sometimes used to refer to the zodiacal light.

The southern pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor) is a species of bird in the family Leiothrichidae, found in dry savannah of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
Description
The southern pied babbler is a medium-sized cooperatively breeding passerine bird. Groups range in size from 2-16 adults, but pairs are rare. The species is sexually monomorphic, with males and females indistinguishable from physical characteristics. Each group comprises a dominant breeding pair that monopolise access to breeding opportunities. Recent genetic research has confirmed that these dominant pairs are responsible for more than 95% of young hatched. Occasional mixed parentage has been observed, but is predictable in most cases: subordinates primarily gain parentage when a new (unrelated) immigrant disperses into the group, or a new group is founded. All group members cooperate to help raise the young hatched from a single clutch. Clutch size varies between two and five, with a modal clutch size of three.
Cooperative behaviours include: provisioning young (both in the nest and post-fledging), sentinel behaviour, territory border defense, teaching behaviour and babysitting behaviour (where semi-independent fledglings follow adults between foraging sites and away from predators). The breeding season extends from late-September to early April, although this varies between years and is strongly rain-dependent. Groups can raise up to three successful clutches per breeding season. Average incubation time is 14 days, and average time between hatching and fledging is 16 days. Fledging time varies according to group size: small groups tend to fledge their young earlier than large groups. Post-fledging, young are poorly mobile, unable to fly, and rely entirely on adult group members for food. Fledgling foraging efficiency develops slowly, and fledglings can continue to be provisioned by adults for up to four months post-fledging. The amount of care that young receive during this stage has long-term effects: fledglings that receive care for the longest periods tend to be heavier and better foragers than their counterparts. In addition, they are more likely to successfully disperse from their natal group and consequently begin reproducing earlier than their “failed-disperser” counterparts.
Behaviour
Aggression toward fledglings is most commonly observed when the dominant pair have begun to incubate another brood. During this period, begging fledglings will be punished by parents using aggressive behaviour such as jumping on the youngster. In all cases, fledglings stop begging immediately following attack. Brood overlap results in a distinctive division of labour, with subordinate adults continuing to care for fledglings while the dominant pair concentrate their effort on the new brood. Owing to the extended period of post-fledging care in this species, this can result in dependent young from multiple broods being raised simultaneously.
Pied babblers are strongly territorial, and defend their borders using wing and vocal displays on a near daily basis. These fights rarely lead to physical aggression and injury from such fights is very rare. Groups defend the same territory year-round and small groups tend to lose portions of their territory to larger neighbouring groups.
Research on pied babblers has provided the first evidence of teaching behaviour in an avian species. Pied babblers teach their young by giving a specific purr call each time they deliver food. Young learn to associate this call with food and reach out of the nest each time they hear it. Adults exploit this association to encourage young to fledge by giving the purr call at a distance from the nest, enticing young to follow them. Post-fledging, adults continue to use the call to encourage young to move between foraging areas or away from predators. This call is also used to recruit independent fledglings to a rich foraging site, and may thus provide young with information on where to forage to locate rich food sources.
Research on pied babblers has also provided evidence of task partitioning behaviour. In this species, the dominant pair are able to leave their dependent young in the care of helpers and initiate a new brood. This allows brood overlap: several broods of dependent young can be raised at the same time. Such a behaviour highlights the benefits of cooperative breeding: many helpers allow breeders to invest in more broods. Parents initiate this task partitioning by aggressively punishing offspring that beg at them for food. This repeated punishment results in young fledglings begging for food from helpers rather than their parents: freeing up their parents to breed again.
Interspecific interactions
Pied babblers have a complex interspecific interaction with the kleptoparasitic fork-tailed drongo, Dicrurus adsimilis. Drongos perch above and follow babbler groups between foraging sites and give alarm calls each time a predator is seen. When drongos are present, babblers invest less time in sentinel behaviour. However, drongos occasionally give false alarm calls and then swoop down to steal the food items that the foraging babblers have dropped upon hearing an alarm call. To avoid the cost of kleptoparasitism, large babbler groups, which have enough group members to participate in sentinel behaviour, do not tolerate drongos and aggressively chase them away from the group. Consequently, they suffer very few losses to kleptoparasitic attack. However, small groups do not have enough group members to provide sentinel behaviour without affecting time invested in other behaviours such as foraging or provisioning young. These groups therefore tolerate occasional kleptoparasitic attacks in return for the sentinel duties that drongos provide.
Young pied babblers have difficulty handling larger food items such as scorpions, skinks and solifuges, and take a lot longer to break these food items down than adults. This makes them ideal victims for attacks by fork-tailed drongos: research has revealed that drongos specifically target young babblers for kleptoparasitic attacks and gain greater foraging success by doing so.
The Pied Babbler Research Project
The Pied Babbler Research Project was established by Dr Amanda Ridley in 2003 for the purpose of studying many aspects of cooperative breeding behaviour over the long-term. The population comprises fully habituated groups of wild pied babblers. The average number of groups in the population varies between 10-18 each year. Research is conducted continuously by scientists and postgraduate students and involves investigations into population dynamics, the causes and consequences of helping behaviour, sexual selection, foraging ecology, interspecific interactions, vocal communication, parent-offspring conflict, kin recognition, maternal effects, physiology and reproductive conflict.
Inbreeding avoidance
Individuals appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates. Although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range within which genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated. In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

The Grand Italian Trail (Italian: Sentiero Italia) is a 6166-kilometer-long hiking trail that crosses the entire territory of Italy, passing through six UNESCO Heritage Sites, 15 national parks, and many other parks and nature reserves.
Overview
The path, which is divided into 368 legs, begins in Trieste and then crosses the entire Alpine Arc, the entire Apennine mountain chain, Sicily and Sardinia before ending at Santa Teresa Gallura in Sardinia. The trail uses long sections of pre-existing trails including the Grand Alpine Trail (GTA: Grande Traversata delle Alpi), the Ligurian Mountain Trail (AVML: Alta Via dei Monti Liguri), and the Tuscan Grand Apennine Trail (GEA: Grande Escursione Appenninica).
History
The original idea for this trail originated in 1983 within a group of ambitious hikers. With the help of the Italian Alpine Club, the trail became a reality in 1995 in the first ever CamminaItalia ("Walk Italy"), an event in which a group of trekkers departed from a Sardinian coastal village and covered the entire trail in eight months. The accomplishment was repeated in 1999; this time with the collaboration of the Italian National Alpine Association.
Since this time, the evolution of this project has slowed. While the trail blaze was chosen for the trail - a marking of red-white-red with "SI" written underneath in black - many legs of the trail remain un-marked and are only a part of the GIT on the map.
Track
The official track is constantly verified and updated at the official site of the Grand Italian Trail.
Each leg is described by a brief summary and completed with a GPS Track easy to download.
Besides the historic track, new variants are present, so hikers can adapt their journey and touch other parts of the country. For example, a different starting point of the GIT is set in the heart of Puglia and joins the classic route in the region of Molise. In central Italy a variant enters in the region of Lazio. Other variants can be found also in the norden part of the trail, where a separate path reaches Courmayeur in the region of Valle d'Aosta.
However, the original track begins in northern Sardinia and ends in Friuli Venezia Giulia, at a memorial stone in Lazzaretto (near Trieste).

Sloboda () is a Serbian ammunition and manufacturing company founded in 1948. Its headquarters is in Čačak, Serbia. With around 2,000 employees, it is one of the largest enterprises in Čačak and Moravica District.
History
Sloboda was established on 12 October 1948 by the Yugoslav government. In Tito's Yugoslavia, it was one of the largest enterprises in the country, having around 7,000 employees. It manufactured a variety of products, for military use and for home appliances. The production was greatly reduced during the 1990s breakup of Yugoslavia, when Western countries imposed sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the company's facilities were several times bombed.
In 2016, one of its destroyed facilities was reconstructed and put into operation. In November 2017, former prominent company's subsidiary "Sloboda aparati" (home appliances), finally transferred its facilities to Sloboda Čačak (military ammunition). During 2017, the Government of Serbia invested two million euros in company's modernization, for the needs of defense industry. From 2010 to 2017, 30 million euros has been invested in company's facility. As of 2017, the company has around 2,300 employees and new contracts worth 150 million euros. In May 2018, the Serbian Minister of Defence announced further investments over the next three years.
In 2018, the company celebrated its 70-year anniversary.

European dances refer to various dances originating in Europe. Since Medieval ages, many European dances tend to be refined, as some are based on the court dances of aristocrats.
History
In ancient times, European dances were performed as either sacred dances in religious ceremonies or for popular entertainment.
Greek dance included religious worship, education, religious or civil ceremonies and festivities. One famous Greek dance is the dithyramb, in honor of Dionysus.
Originally Rome had exclusively religious dances. As Rome gained dominance, including conquering Greece, more dance traditions were absorbed. The Bacchanalia and Lupercalia festivals highlight the importance of dance in Rome.
Under Christianity, dance fell under the control and condemnation of the Church. Records of Medieval dance are fragmented and limited, but a noteworthy dance reference from the medieval period is the allegory of the Danse Macabre.
During the Renaissance, dance became more diverse. Country dances, performed for pleasure, became distinct from court dances, which had ceremonial and political functions.
Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniqueswhich are used in many other dance genres and cultures.
John Playford's The English Dancing Master(1651) listed over a hundred tunes, each with its own figures. This was enormously popular, reprinted constantly for 80 years and much enlarged. Playford and his successors had a practical monopoly on the publication of dance manuals until 1711, and ceased publishing around 1728. During this period English country dances took a variety of forms including finite sets for two, three and four couples as well as circles and squares.
In Germany, from a modified Ländler, the waltz was introduced in all the European courts. Thus, group dance gives way to couples dance.
In the 17th century, the French minuet, characterized by its bows, courtesies and gallant gestures, permeated the European cultural landscape.
In the 19th century, the French can-can (also spelled cancan as in the original French /kɑ̃kɑ̃/) is a high-energy, physically demanding dance that became a popular music-hall dance in the 1840s, continuing in popularity in French cabaret to this day. Originally danced by couples, it is now traditionally associated with a chorus line of female dancers. The main features of the dance are the vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, along with high kicks, splits, and cartwheels.
National traditions
Germany
Germany does not have an official national dance, but recognized dance styles include:
The Schuhplattler: This dance is thought to date from Neolithic times, about 3000 BC, but it is first of record in 1030 AD, when a monk in the Tegernsee Abbey of Bavaria described a village dance containing leaps and hand gestures. Over the centuries, the form gradually evolved as farmers, hunters, and woodsmen practiced it in the isolated towns and villages of the Bavarian and Tyrolean Alps.
Ländler: A dance for couples showing fierceness and trampling. Sometimes it is purely instrumental and sometimes is accompanied by vocal arrangements including yodeling. When ballroom dancing became popular in Europe in the 19th century, Ländler became faster and more elegant and men took the nails off of the boots they danced with. It is believed to be the forerunner of the waltz.
Polka: A popular dance appeared in Bohemia in 1830.
Ireland
Irish Dance refers to a group of traditional dance forms originating from Ireland, encompassing dancing both solo and in groups, and dancing for social, competitive, and performance purposes. Irish dance in its current form developed from various influences such as earlier native Irish dance, English country dancing and later possibly French quadrilles, as it became popular in Britain and Ireland during the 19th Century. Dance was taught by "travelling dance masters" across Ireland in the 17th-18th century, and separate dance forms developed according to regional practice and differing purposes. Irish dance became a significant part of Irish culture, particularly for Irish nationalist movements.
Hungary
Hungarian dance refers to the folk dances practised and performed by the Hungarians, both amongst the populations native to Hungary and its neighbours, and also amongst the Hungarian diaspora.
According to György Martin, a prominent folklore expert, Hungarian dances can be divided into two categories. The first refers to dances performed in the middle ages while the second relates to the 18th and 19th century. Hungarians have been noted for their "exceptionally well developed sense of rhythm". In the mid-19th century, Musicologist Theodor Billroth performed tests with troops of various nationalities stationed in Vienna and found that the Hungarian troops outperformed others in keeping time with music.
Improvisation and energetic movements are often mentioned as being characteristic of Hungarian dance.
Russia
Many Russian dances became known from the 10th century. Russia witnessed various invasions from other countries. Due to its location and size the country also came into contact with many different cultures through migration and trading. In turn, a Eurasian cultural mix of music and dance helped develop Russian folk dances.
Many of these early dances were performed and practiced by the lower classes. Typically the upper classes would watch performers rather than participate in the dances themselves.
The original Russian folk dance traditions continue to play an important part in the culture of the country and have been in constant interaction with Russia's many ethnic groups. Russian folk dances are also in interrelations with other types of artistic expressions. One example can be seen in the Ballets Russes, which invokes Russian folk dances and music in its pieces.
Ukraine
The main dance genres of Ukrainian folk dance are round dance, as one of the oldest types of folk dance art, the performance of which is associated with calendar rites, and everyday dance, which includes metelitsa, hopak, kozachok, hutsulka, kolomyika, square dance, polka.
Italy
Italian folk dance has been an integral part of Italian culture for centuries. Dance has been a continuous thread in Italian life from Dante through the Renaissance, the advent of the tarantella in Southern Italy, and the modern revivals of folk music and dance.

Radio resource management (RRM) is the system level management of co-channel interference, radio resources, and other radio transmission characteristics in wireless communication systems, for example cellular networks, wireless local area networks, wireless sensor systems, and radio broadcasting networks. RRM involves strategies and algorithms for controlling parameters such as transmit power, user allocation, beamforming, data rates, handover criteria, modulation scheme, error coding scheme, etc. The objective is to utilize the limited radio-frequency spectrum resources and radio network infrastructure as efficiently as possible.
RRM concerns multi-user and multi-cell network capacity issues, rather than the point-to-point channel capacity. Traditional telecommunications research and education often dwell on channel coding and source coding with a single user in mind, but when several users and adjacent base stations share the same frequency channel it may not be possible to achieve the maximum channel capacity. Efficient dynamic RRM schemes may increase the system spectral efficiency by an order of magnitude, which often is considerably more than what is possible by introducing advanced channel coding and source coding schemes. RRM is especially important in systems limited by co-channel interference rather than by noise, for example cellular systems and broadcast networks homogeneously covering large areas, and wireless networks consisting of many adjacent access points that may reuse the same channel frequencies.
The cost for deploying a wireless network is normally dominated by base station sites (real estate costs, planning, maintenance, distribution network, energy, etc.) and sometimes also by frequency license fees. So, the objective of radio resource management is typically to maximize the system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit or Erlang/MHz/site, under some kind of user fairness constraint, for example, that the grade of service should be above a certain level. The latter involves covering a certain area and avoiding outage due to co-channel interference, noise, attenuation caused by path losses, fading caused by shadowing and multipath, Doppler shift and other forms of distortion. The grade of service is also affected by blocking due to admission control, scheduling starvation or inability to guarantee quality of service that is requested by the users.
While classical radio resource managements primarily considered the allocation of time and frequency resources (with fixed spatial reuse patterns), recent multi-user MIMO techniques enables adaptive resource management also in the spatial domain. In cellular networks, this means that the fractional frequency reuse in the GSM standard has been replaced by a universal frequency reuse in LTE standard.
Static radio resource management
Static RRM involves manual as well as computer-aided fixed cell planning or radio network planning. Examples:
Frequency allocation band plans decided by standardization bodies, by national frequency authorities and in frequency resource auctions.
Deployment of base station sites (or broadcasting transmitter site)
Antenna heights
Channel frequency plans
Sector antenna directions
Selection of modulation and channel coding parameters
Base station antenna space diversity, for example
Receiver micro diversity using antenna combining
Transmitter macro diversity such as OFDM single frequency networks (SFN)
Static RRM schemes are used in many traditional wireless systems, for example 1G and 2G cellular systems, in today's wireless local area networks and in non-cellular systems, for example broadcasting systems. Examples of static RRM schemes are:
Circuit mode communication using FDMA and TDMA.
Fixed channel allocation (FCA)
Static handover criteria
Dynamic radio resource management
Dynamic RRM schemes adaptively adjust the radio network parameters to the traffic load, user positions, user mobility, quality of service requirements, base station density, etc. Dynamic RRM schemes are considered in the design of wireless systems, in view to minimize expensive manual cell planning and achieve "tighter" frequency reuse patterns, resulting in improved system spectral efficiency.
Some schemes are centralized, where several base stations and access points are controlled by a Radio Network Controller (RNC). Others are distributed, either autonomous algorithms in mobile stations, base stations or wireless access points, or coordinated by exchanging information among these stations.
Examples of dynamic RRM schemes are:
Power control algorithms
Precoding algorithms
Link adaptation algorithms
Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) or Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) algorithms, allowing "cell breathing"
Traffic adaptive handover criteria, allowing "cell breathing"
Re-use partitioning
Adaptive filtering
Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC)
Dynamic diversity schemes, for example
Soft handover
Dynamic single-frequency networks (DSFN)
Phased array antenna with
beamforming
Multiple-input multiple-output communications (MIMO)
Space-time coding
Admission control
Dynamic bandwidth allocation using resource reservation multiple access schemes or statistical multiplexing, for example Spread spectrum and/or packet radio
Channel-dependent scheduling, for instance
Max-min fair scheduling using for example fair queuing
Proportionally fair scheduling using for example weighted fair queuing
Maximum throughput scheduling (gives low grade of service due to starvation)
Dynamic packet assignment (DPA)
Packet and Resource Plan Scheduling (PARPS) schemes
Mobile ad hoc networks using multihop communication
Cognitive radio
Green communication
QoS-aware RRM
Femtocells
Inter-cell radio resource management
Future networks like the LTE standard (defined by 3GPP) are designed for a frequency reuse of one. In such networks, neighboring cells use the same frequency spectrum. Such standards exploit Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and can thus be highly efficient in terms of spectrum, but required close coordination between cells to avoid excessive inter-cell interference. Like in most cellular system deployments, the overall system spectral efficiency is not range limited or noise limited, but interference limited. Inter-cell radio resource management coordinates resource allocation between different cell sites by using multi-user MIMO techniques. There are various means of inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) already defined in the standard. Dynamic single-frequency networks, coordinated scheduling, multi-site MIMO or joint multi-cell precoding are other examples for inter-cell radio resource management.

Operation Desert Scorpion was a major U.S. operation to identify and eliminate anti-coalition forces while simultaneously delivering humanitarian aid. The area of operation was mainly in north-central Iraq and was conducted between 15 and 29 June 2003. The stated task and purpose of Operation Desert Scorpion was to defeat remaining enemy non-compliant forces. It was planned as a major operation supporting the first "post-hostilities" campaign plan which had been issued just a week prior to its inception.
Background
The operation followed Operation Peninsula Strike, which had ended three days earlier, and was part of a U.S response to a major spike in attacks by anti-coalition forces that began in late May 2003. Operation Peninsula Strike was a 4th Infantry Division operation and was directly influenced by earlier warning orders of Operation Desert Scorpion. This operation was supported from Camp Spearhead Kuwait, by the 149th Transportation Company (POCC), 10th Transportation BN (TML), 7th Transportation GRP (COMP).
The operation
Combined Joint Task Force 7 conducted the operation that included elements from the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, 1st Armored Division, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. The scheme of maneuver was first to gain intelligence to identify those elements, or forces, in Iraq that were preventing the establishment of interim governing capability. Simultaneously, the operation was to identify those elements who were supporting governance and stability in Iraq, and identify public works projects that would enable their efforts. The operation was designed to commence with country wide operations that defeated those remaining non – compliant forces while simultaneously providing funds and projects to those areas, and local leaders, who supported the growth of Iraqi governance and stability.
The 3rd Infantry Division conducted five raids and detained 20. The 3ID also seized 20 anti-tank rounds, three AK-47s, one Rocket propelled grenade and some C4 explosives along with detonators. The 3ID's humanitarian contributions to the operation included coordinating a trash collection service and removing 64 loads of trash from Fallujah and continued to work with the municipality to re-establish a waste collection system.
The 4th Infantry Division conducted 43 raids in an area ranging from Kirkuk in the north to Taji in the south and initially detained 288 individuals. Sixty-five of the detained were held. The unit seized three AK-47s, one mortar site and one Dragunov night sight. The division also placed a contract for playground equipment and a retaining wall for a school in their area, assisted a general hospital with $1,000 drug and supply purchase and purchased an ambulance.
Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division conducted three raids and detained 12 individuals. The 101st Airborne Division also worked to rebuild drainage ditches and renovating the mayor's office in Makhmur, along with rebuilding at kindergarten schools.
The 1st Armored Division executed offensive actions in Baghdad conducting six raids and detaining 22 individuals. The unit seized nine rifles, eight pistols, three knives, two boxes of grenades, one bomb and three 127mm rounds.
The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment conducted 11 raids and detained 39 individuals. It also passed out school supplies to the local schools in the eastern part of Iraq.
Aftermath
During the raids, two former Iraqi generals turned themselves in, Maj. Gen. Abdul Ali Jasmin, secretary of the Defense Ministry, and Brig. Gen. Abdullah Ali Jasmin, head of the Iraqi Military Academy and were detained for questioning. Operation Desert Scorpion also resulted in the seizure of eight million Dollars as well as a large sum of British pounds and Euros.
In addition to the 1,330 suspects being detained, 497 AK-47s, 235 hand grenades, 124 RPGs, 22 belt-fed machine guns, 130 pistols, 100 rifles, 8,122 rounds and ammunition were also seized.
Unfortunately, the operation did not achieve the desired effects. It was hampered initially by a failure to provide for the public works projects so critical to its success. While the Divisions' submitted a total of approximately $53 million in requirements, only some $20 million were funded. Thus, the force did not achieve its aim to publicly demonstrate commitment to rewarding those who supported stability in Iraq. As well, the force did not allow time to develop the intelligence required to find, target and then attack the leaders of local insurgent movements. However, the legacy of Operation Desert Scorpion is still seen today in operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It has become a pattern for operations in both theaters.

The Lafayette County Courthouse is located in Oxford, Mississippi and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The current structure was constructed in 1872 to replace an earlier building burned during the Civil War by Union troops directed by General Andrew Jackson Smith. Spires Boling of the firm Willis, Sloan and Trigg was the courthouse's architect. Two subsequent expansions of the building were performed. In 1952 and 1953, the west and east bays were added. The structure was renovated in 1981.
The Courthouse currently houses several judicial courtrooms and related offices, including the Third Circuit Judicial District Court, and the Third Circuit District Drug Court, which both serve Benton, Calhoun, Chickasaw, Lafayette, Marshall, Tippah, and Union counties. The Courthouse also contains the office of the Circuit Court Clerk.
According to the court's website, "Mississippi's Circuit Courts hear felony criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits. Circuit Courts hear appeals from County, Justice and Municipal courts and from administrative boards and commissions such as the Workers' Compensation Commission and the Mississippi Department of Employment Security."
As the structural centerpiece to the home of William Faulkner, the Courthouse also plays a significant role in Faulkner's fictional Jefferson County. The Courthouse appears in multiple works. These include stories featuring the lawyer Gavin Stevens (including Knight's Gambit), the dramatic ending to The Sound and the Fury, and elements of Go Down, Moses.

Angel Witch are a British heavy metal band which formed in London in 1976 as part of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) movement.
Biography
Formation
The band formed, originally under the name of Lucifer, of guitarist and vocalist Kevin Heybourne, guitarist Rob Downing, drummer Steve Jones, and bassist Barry Clements. Lucifer split and Steve Jones joined Bruce Dickinson to form Speed. The remnants of Lucifer became Angel Witch, with the exceptions of Clements, who was replaced by Kevin Riddles, and Steve Jones, who was replaced by Steve Coleman. The following year Rob Downing left the band.
Limited chart success, brief record deal
Angel Witch's first song to achieve mainstream popularity was "Baphomet", which was included on a compilation titled Metal for Muthas. This song drew a fair amount of attention to the band, and they eventually signed a recording deal with EMI. However, the deal was soon cancelled, due to manager Ken Heybourne refusing to hand Angel Witch over to professional management, and the poor performance of their first single released under the EMI label in 1980, which was entitled "Sweet Danger" and lasted a single week on the UK Singles Chart. This was their only UK chart listing and despite being quite an achievement for a NWOBHM group, spending a single week at No. 75 (the lowest position in the charts) meant they were listed as the 'least successful chart act of all time' in the Guinness Book of Hit Records. This same feat was repeated by fellow NWOBHM group Grand Prix with their Keep On Believing 7" in 1983.
Debut album
In 1980, Bronze Records picked up the band and they soon proceeded to record and release their debut album, self-titled Angel Witch. This album is considered one of the most notable from the new wave of British heavy metal.
Break-ups and re-unions
Subsequent to the album's release, the band's structure began to fall apart. The sacking of Dave Hogg, and Kevin Riddles leaving the band to join Tytan, and despite Heybourne's attempts to continue Angel Witch with other musicians, the end of the band was declared and he joined Deep Machine.
Angel Witch returned to activity on 1982, when Heybourne and two musicians from Deep Machine - namely vocalist Roger Marsden and drummer Ricky Bruce - left to assemble a new Angel Witch line-up together with bassist Jerry Cunningham. This line-up lasted a very short time, as Marsden's voice did not fit the style of the band very well. He was fired from the band and Heybourne assumed the vocals once more.
By 1983, the band had ceased its activities, and Heybourne moved to Blind Fury. In 1984, Angel Witch was once more brought to life, this time with the help of bassist Peter Gordelier (ex-Marquis De Sade), singer Dave Tattum and with Dave Hogg returning to the drums. This line-up recorded the album Screamin' N' Bleedin. Dave Hogg was sacked yet again. He was replaced by Spencer Hollman. With the new drummer they recorded Frontal Assault, which deviated heavily from Angel Witch's previous albums, having many melodic elements.
Dave Tattum was released the same year and for a few years Angel Witch played as a trio on sporadic live performances. In 1989, they recorded a new live album, entitled simply Live.
Creation of American group
Heybourne decided that it was in the band's best interest to move to the United States, but the other members had no way of accomplishing that, having stable lives on their home country. Thus, an American incarnation of Angel Witch was born. It was composed of Heybourne, bassist Jon Torres (Lȧȧz Rockit, Ulysses Siren), drummer Tom Hunting (Exodus) and guitarist Doug Piercy (Heathen, Anvil Chorus). This line-up functioned quite well, and soon the band had booked a fair number of shows throughout the US. However, it was found that Heybourne had some pending issues regarding immigration, and he was arrested one day before the first concert of the band. Without Heybourne, Angel Witch was soon dissolved.
New lineup in the 2000s and 2010s
After the release of the Resurrection compilation in 2000, the band intended to play together once more, but after a series of internal conflicts, Heybourne assembled yet another line-up, with new members.
They were on the bill for the traditional Orange Goblin Christmas show at The Camden Underworld, London, on Saturday 20 December 2008.
In 2009, their eponymous song "Angel Witch" was featured on the soundtrack of the action-adventure videogame, Brütal Legend.
In 2011, Angel Witch entered in the studio to record their fourth studio album, entitled As Above, So Below. It was recorded with Kevin Heybourne on guitar and vocals, Will Palmer on the bass guitar, Bill Steer on the guitar, and Andrew Prestidge on the drums. They also returned to playing live, with a second stage headline slot at Bloodstock Open Air in 2011.
One-time Angel Witch bassist Jon Torres died on 3 September 2013 of a reported heart failure. He was 51 years old.
The band continues to tour and play festivals.
On 30 August 2019, the band released a new single, 'Don't Turn Your Back', which subsequently debuted at number 17 on the Kerrang! Rock Chart before rising to 14 in its second and final week.
Legacy
Angel Witch have been claimed as an influence by many notable metal musicians, including Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) who graced the February 2010 cover of Decibel magazine wearing an Angel Witch shirt, Tom G. Warrior (Celtic Frost), and Chuck Schuldiner (Death). Bands that have covered Angel Witch songs in concert or on record include Trouble ("Confused" live), Six Feet Under ("Confused" on Graveyard Classics), Blood Curse ("Angel Witch" on their debut album "Sorceress"), Onslaught ("Confused" on In Search of Sanity), Skull Fist ("Angel Witch" live), Battle Ram ("Angel Witch" on the Smash the Gates EP), S.A.Slayer ("Dr. Phibes" & "Angel Witch" live) and Exodus ("Angel of Death" on Blood In, Blood Out as bonus track), Amazing Maze, which is a one off album by Italian Power Metal band Labyrinth under a different name ("Angel Witch").
In 2007, German label Unbroken Records issued a Tribute to Angel Witch compilation album featuring 15 underground metal acts covering songs from the band's early singles and first three full-length releases.

The Piréz people (Hungarian: Pirézek) are a fictional nation invented by Tárki, a Hungarian polling company, to measure attitudes regarding immigration.
The Piréz
In 2006 the Tárki Institute conducted a survey to assess Hungarian attitudes toward foreigners, asking if immigration should be controlled strictly. Some of the questions concerned the fictitious Piréz people. The survey revealed that, according to 61% of those who answered the questionnaire, immigration to Hungary should be controlled, and 59% opposed the immigration of the fictional Piréz.
The results of the survey, including the fact that "Piréz" people are fictitious, were widely reported in the Hungarian media.
The majority (61%) would consider allowing or disallowing immigration depending on a migrant's national origin (other respondents' views, whether in support of or opposed to immigration, took no account of migrants' origins). Those who thought distinctions on the grounds of origin should be made were highly dismissive of Arabs, 87% saying their migration should be restricted. 81% of them thought Chinese immigration should be controlled, and 68% disfavoured the immigration of the non-existing Piréz.
Later allusions
On January 29, 2018, Zoom.hu published the results of a poll created by Policy Agenda, where potential voters were asked whether they believe the "Party of George Soros" has the potential of winning the 2018 elections in Hungary - no such party exists or ever existed, yet only 24% of the answers indicated that they knew of this. The article, alluding to the Hungarian government's long-running campaign against Soros, noted that "Soros is the new Piréz".

(c. 1250 – c. 1310) was a 13th-century astronomer and mathematician from Samarkand.
Life and works
Nothing is known of al-Samarqandi's life except that he composed his most important works in the last two decades of the 7th and early decades of the 8th centuries A.H. He wrote works on theology, logic, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy which have proved important in their own right and also in giving information about the works of other scientists of his period. Al-Samarqandi wrote a work Risala fi adab al-bahth which discussed the method of intellectual investigation of reasoning using dialectic. Such methods of enquiry were much used by the ancient Greeks. He also wrote Synopsis of Astronomy, and produced a star catalogue for the year 1276–77. In mathematics, al-Samarqandi is famous for a short work of only 20 pages which discusses 35 of Euclid's propositions. Although a short work, al-Samarqandi consulted widely the works of other Muslim mathematicians before writing it. For example, he refers to writings by Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, al-Jawhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī.

Miguel Ángel Quevedo y de la Lastra (July 31, 1908 – August 12, 1969) was the publisher and editor of Bohemia Magazine, the most popular news-weekly of its day in Cuba and Latin America, known for its political journalism and editorial writing.
In May 1908, Quevedo's father, Miguel Ángel Quevedo y Pérez, first published the magazine Bohemia, which he named after his favorite opera, La bohème, by Giacomo Puccini. The magazine folded after a few issues but returned in 1910 and became one of Cuba's most popular weeklies within a few years. Due to failing health, Quevedo Pérez turned over the running of Bohemia to his son, Quevedo de la Lastra (then only eighteen years old), on January 1, 1927. Almost immediately, the young Quevedo became one of the principle voices of opposition to the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado, a distinction for which he was jailed several times in the early 1930s. The young Quevedo also became a vocal critic of the myriad dictatorships that gripped Latin America in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s, Quevedo and Bohemia led the mainstream Cuban press in denouncing the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and supported the insurrection and revolution against Batista's regime. On July 26, 1958 the magazine published the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, a document that purported to unify the opposition groups fighting Batista. On January 11, 1959, one million copies of a special edition of the magazine were printed, and sold out in just a few hours.
Quevedo sought political asylum in the Venezuelan embassy in Havana in the summer of 1960 and arrived in Miami on September 7, 1960. The following month he published Bohemia Libre with $40,000 monthly from the U.S. State Department until after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The magazine was subsequently edited in Miami, Florida, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Caracas, Venezuela. On August 12, 1969, weeks after his publication went bankrupt and he was heavily indebted to loan sharks and had cashed large checks without funds, the inveterate bachelor committed suicide in the Caracas apartment that he shared with his sister Rosa Margarita Quevedo. He shot himself in the right temple with a 38 caliber revolver. Next to his body was found a letter to "the competent authorities and to public opinion" saying that "absolutely no one should be blamed for his death." He "begged forgiveness from anyone he may have offended in any way." Another letter was addressed to his sister, who heard the gunshot in his bedroom while she was in the kitchen.
After his death, journalist Ernesto Montaner published in Miami an apocryphal suicide letter from Quevedo stating that Bohemia Magazine invented the 20,000 figures that is commonly cited for the number of deaths under Fulgencio Batista's regime. The original letter or its facsimile has never appeared and journalist Agustin Tamargo denounced it as a fraud by Montaner.

Craig Ellis is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played as a or in the 1970s and 1980s. Ellis played for Newtown and Western Suburbs in the NSWRL competition.
Playing career
Ellis began his career with Newtown in 1978 making his debut in Round 18 against Cronulla which ended in a 44–0 defeat. Newtown went on to finish last that year winning only 2 games all season. In 1979, Newtown brought in Warren Ryan as the new coach of the club and he transformed the team from easy beats to a competitive side. In 1981, Newtown qualified for their first grand final in 26 years as they played against Parramatta. Ellis made 14 appearances that year including the grand final itself. Newtown went into the second half of the match holding a shock lead until Parramatta stormed home to win their first premiership 20–10.
Ellis played with Newtown for a further two seasons but missed out on playing in the club's final ever first grade game against Canberra. It was decided at the end of 1983 that Newtown along with Western Suburbs were to be expelled from the competition by the authority of the NSWRL board. In the coming months, Western Suburbs took the NSWRL to court and won their case to be reinstated. Newtown lacked the financial resources to challenge the decision and were omitted from the 1984 season.
In 1984, Ellis joined Western Suburbs as the club finished last on the table. In the four years Ellis spent at Western Suburbs the club finished second last twice and finished bottom of the table in 1987. Ellis final game in first grade was a 24–12 loss to Illawarra.

Elections to Leeds City Council were held on 1 May 1975. One third of the seats, as well as an extra vacancy in Aireborough, were up for election. Labour had gained a seat from a by-election in Burley in the interim, prompted by the arrest of incumbent Conservative Ray Forbes in connection with arms smuggling.
The election resulted in a substantial swing to the Conservatives, helping them gain six seats in total, with four from Labour (Burley, Kirkstall, Pudsey South and Wortley) and two from the Liberals (Horsforth and Otley). This established the Conservatives as the largest party on the council, but with the council remaining under no overall control.

This result has the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections:

The Estonian Red () is an Estonian breed of dairy cattle. It was developed in the second half of the nineteenth century from cross-breeding of local cattle with imported stock of the Angeln, Danish Red and North Slesvig Red breeds. The coat is red, but sometimes it varies from red-white to brown and rarely black.
Its conservation status was not listed by the FAO in 2007; in 2021 it was reported to DAD-IS as "endangered". It is one of the constituent breeds of the European Red Dairy Breed.

Daisy Kadibil (née Burungu; 1923 – 30 March 2018) was an Aboriginal Australian woman whose experiences shaped the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence and subsequent film Rabbit-Proof Fence.
She was a member of the Stolen Generations, which were Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government.
Early life
Kadibil was born in 1923.
Her mother was of the Martu people and her father Thomas Craig was of English descent, making her "half-caste" in the eyes of the Australian government.
In 1931 when Kadibil was about 8 years old, she was removed from her family in the Jigalong Community by the Australian government and sent to the Moore River Native Settlement.
Her cousins Molly Craig and Gracie, whose mothers were Daisy's aunts, were also taken from home and sent to Moore River as well.
Daisy and Molly shared a father, Thomas Craig, making them both half-sisters and cousins.
The girls stayed only one night in the internment camp before making their escape to travel home.
Estimates of their journey range from long.
The trip took the girls 8 weeks to complete; they used Australia's rabbit-proof fence as a guide to travel north.
The journey home was difficult, as the girls had to sleep under bushes or in rabbit burrows.
Molly carried each of the younger girls in turn as they evaded search parties sent out by A. O. Neville; they also found their own food.
Farmers and hunters aided the girls by giving them food as well.
Book based on her experiences
Kadibil's niece Doris Pilkington Garimara, who was Molly's daughter, authored Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, which was published in 1996.
Doris had also been sent to the Moore River internment camp, and was not reunited with her mother Molly for 20 years.
Later life and death
After winning the Deadly Annomination Award in 1995 for her community work and abilities, Kadibil worked as a housekeeper and cook on stations in the Pilbara of Western Australia.
She married and had four children.
She had children in Wiluna, Western Australia, (who then later on had 31 children and 80 grandchildren) then returned to Jigalong.
Members of her family established and still head the Parnngurr Community.
She died in a nursing home in South Hedland, Western Australia on 30 March, 2018.

was one of the principal disciples of Bashō, and himself also a respected haiku writer in the Genroku period of Japan. Originally, he was a samurai from Owari, but he had to leave military service due to ill health. Taking up the literary life, he became a devout disciple of Bashō, and when the Master died in 1694, Naito mourned him for a full three years, and remained his devout follower for the rest of his life.
Examples of Naitō's Haiku
Mountains and plains/ all are taken by the snow --/ nothing remains
No need to cling/ to things --/ floating frog.
These branches/ were the first to bud --/ falling blossoms.
A lightning bolt/ splits in two and strikes/ the mountaintop.
The sleet falls/ As if coming through the bottom/ Of loneliness.

Theodore Ayrault Dodge (May 28, 1842 – October 26, 1909) was an American officer, military historian, and businessman. He fought as a Union officer in the American Civil War; as a writer, he was devoted to both the Civil War and the great generals of ancient and European history.
Early life
Born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, he received a military education in Berlin and attended University College London and the University of Heidelberg. Returning to the United States in 1861, he promptly enlisted as a private in the New York volunteer infantry. Over the course of the Civil War, he rose to the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel, losing his right leg at the Battle of Gettysburg. He served at the War Department from 1864 and was commissioned in the regular army in 1866. In 1870, he retired with the rank of major, after which he lived in Boston.
Retirement and death
He invested in various enterprises to manufacture hydraulic hoses, but they failed. Based on a novel tubular loom invented by James E. Gillespie and Robert Cowen, he founded the Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Company in 1884. He later moved to Paris, where he died. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia.
Literary career
His works on the Civil War include The Campaign of Chancellorsville (1881) and Bird's Eye View of the Civil War (1883). From 1890 to 1907, he also published twelve volumes of his History of the Art of War: Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, although the volumes on Frederick the Great were not completed before his death. The work has been broken up into individual biographies for modern publication. In addition, his military journal, covering his time with the Army of the Potomac from the Seven Days Battles to Gettysburg, has recently been compiled and published by noted historian Stephen W. Sears under the title On Campaign with the Army of the Potomac: The Civil War Journal of Theodore Ayrault Dodge.

Manokwari Regency is a regency in West Papua, Indonesia. Following the splitting away of twenty of its former districts in 2013, it now covers an area of 3,168.28 km2 and had a population of 192,663 at the 2020 Census. The administrative centre (regency seat) is presently at the town of Manokwari, which is also the capital of the province, but under proposals currently under consideration by the Indonesian Parliament, the town is intended to be split off from the regency to form a separate independent city.
Administration
At the 2010 Census, Manokwari Regency comprised 29 districts (Kecamatan) with an area of 34,970 km2 and a 2010 Census population of 187,726, but in 2013 two new regencies - South Manokwari Regency (Manokwari Selantan) with six districts, and Arfak Mountains Regency (Pegunungan Arfak) with ten districts - were created from parts of the Manokwari Regency, while the most westerly four districts (Kebar, Amberbaken, Mubrani and Senopi, which were the largest in area of the remaining districts, although sparsely populated) were removed from Manokwari Regency and added to the Tambrauw Regency.
The residual area of Manokwari Regency thus comprised nine districts, listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census. The table also includes the location of the district centres, the number of administrative villages (rural desa and urban kelurahan) in each district, and its postal code.
Notes: (a) except for the village of Mebji, with a post code of 98315. (b) except for the villages of Manokwari Timur (with a post code of 98311) and Amban (with a post code of 98314). (c) includes the offshore islands of Pulau Lemon and Pulau Mansinam. (d) except for the two villages of Arowi and Pasir Putih (with a post code of 98313). (e) includes the offshore islands of Pulau Irbor, Pulau Irbor Utara, Pulau Kaki and Pulau Waisupi. (g) includes the offshore island of Pulau Raimuti.

Mariarosaria (Mariolina) Padula (died 29 September 2012) was an Italian mathematical physicist specializing in fluid dynamics, including free boundary problems and compressible flow with viscosity. She was a professor of mathematical physics at the University of Ferrara, and is also known for revitalizing and heading the university's mathematical journal, Annali dell'Università di Ferrara, and forging it into an internationally known journal.
Education and career
Padula studied mathematics at the University of Naples Federico II, and published her first works in mathematical physics in 1973. She was a student of Salvatore Rionero.
She continued at the University of Naples as an assistant and associate professor until 1994, when she won a professorship at the University of Basilicata. In 1995, she moved to the department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Ferrara, where she remained for the rest of her career.
Book
Padula was the author of a monograph on her research specialty, Asymptotic stability of steady compressible fluids (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 2024, Springer, 2011).
Recognition
A symposium on mathematical fluid dynamics in Padula's honor was held at the University of Ferrara in 2014. In the same year, a special issue of Annali dell'Università di Ferrara was published in her memory.
Personal life
Padula married another student of Rionero, Giovanni Paolo Galdi; they later separated. She was the mother of Giovanbattista Galdi, a professor of linguistics at Ghent University.

The Memorial for Yelü Yanning (耶律延寧) is the oldest known Khitan inscription of significant length and for now the oldest major written attestation of a Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) language. Dated 986, it is written in the Mongolic Khitan language using the Khitan large script. With 19 lines and 271 characters it was found in 1964 at Baimu Mountain, Chaoyang County, Liaoning, China. and is now kept in the Liaoning Province Museum, China. The Khitan word 'jau' (hundred) which occurs in line 13 of the upper-right Khitan section of the inscription and which is written with the large script character 百 is one of the earliest fully deciphered Mongolic words preserved in a Mongolic inscription.
Yelü Yanning
Yelü Yanning is not mentioned in the Liaoshi or other Khitan historical documents. The discovery of his memorial inscription in 1964 gave the first information about him. Yelü Yanning (946-985) was a high ranking Khitan military officer of the Liao dynasty. Yelü Yanning's family belonged to the imperial household and had a place in the horizontal gers of the Khitan Khan. His great-grandfather Gaoligu, grandfather Zhiwubu and his father Sage were all widely known as brave and expert warriors who repeatedly accomplished meritorious deeds. His father Sage was given the title "Imperial Tutor Honorable Duke". When the Jingzong Emperor Yelü Xian succeeded to the throne Yelü Yanning was recruited as a jinshi (close supporter). Yelü Yanning was gradually given various titles such as "State-defending Righteous Outstanding Minister", "Sublime Fortunate Minister", "High Inspector", "Imperial Censor", "State High Support" and "Great General".
He was given 500 families in Qishui county. Yanning scrupulously performed his guard duties, always ensuring the Emperor's safety and earning the deep trust of the Jingzong Emperor and Empress Xiaochuo. After the Jingzong Emperor died in 982, Empress Xiao was regent. During this time the Zubu confederacy (Keraites) in central Mongolia raised armies against the Liao dynasty and pushed eastwards, profoundly affecting the Niaogu, Dilie, Shiwei (Mongols) and others. Emperor Shengzong Yelü Longxu and Empress Xiao sent Yelü Yanning to pacify the northern borderland. Yelü Yanning reached the area of present-day Hulunbuir in Inner Mongolia near the source of the Heilongjiang river and continued to the Kherlen River in present-day eastern Mongolia where he met with success. He died in the third year of the Tonghe period (30 December 985) due to complications of his wounds.

The Adventures of Smilin' Jack (1943) is a Universal movie serial based on the popular comic strip The Adventures of Smilin' Jack by Zack Mosley. It was directed by Lewis D. Collins and Ray Taylor.
Plot
In 1941, an American aviator, 'Smilin' Jack' Martin wishes to resign as an advisor to the Nationalist Chinese Army in order to return to the United States to enlist as an aviator in America's military buildup prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. He is delayed when the Chinese discover that the neutral Tibetan like Mandon "Province" contains a secret road from India to China crucial for the Allied war effort. Determined to obtain the secret for themselves, or equally determined to have the secret destroyed is the Japanese espionage organisation "The Black Samurai" and the German intelligence agent Fräulein von Teufel who masquerades as an American newspaper reporter.
Cast
Production
The serial was based on the comic strip by Zack Moseley but it was not in the spirit of the strip as would normally be expected from a Universal production. Very little of the original comic strip was used and a new character, Tommy Thompson, was created by Universal. The similarity to Tommy Tomkins, of the Tailspin Tommy stories, may imply a crossover of sorts. Cline suggests that it was "a quick attempt to get a story on screen about a topical subject, and could have had almost any flyer with any name as a hero.”

"The Last Film" is a song by English band Kissing the Pink, released as both a 7" and 12" single from their debut studio album, Naked (1983).
Their only Top 20 hit, it peaked at No. 19 on the UK Singles Chart. The single features the non-album track, "Shine" as its B-side.
Sylvia Griffin sang the middle 8 but left the band whilst they were still recording the rest of the album.
When lead singer Nick Whitecross was asked about the lyrics to the song he said that they were “just about a soldier who sat in a tent watching one of those 40s or 50s Hollywood war films just before he's about to go out and fight for real. It's not controversial, war is horrible and unglamorous.”

Kalabak (), also known as Halabak is a mountain belonging to the Šar Mountains, located in Albania and Kosovo. Kalabak's height is above sea level and is located near the southern tip of Kosovo. Kalabak and its surroundings are treeless so it is an ideal place for shepherds to raise their sheep and the Šarplaninac as the protector.

The Cameroon Baptist Church () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Cameroon. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Douala.
History
The organization has its origins in a mission of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1845 by English and Jamaican missionaries such as Joseph Jackson Fuller and Joseph Merrick. The missionary Joseph Merrick, a Jamaican, son of freed slaves, on his first arrival in 1843 takes up to spread the Gospel while promoting a spirit of independence in his preaching.
In 1886, two years after the signing of the treaty between the Germans and the Duala, when the German authorities expelled the Baptist Mission Society and transferred its work to the Basel Mission, the Native Baptist Church congregation led by Reverend Joshua Dibundu Dibue protested vigorously and stood up for their self-governing.
It was officially founded in Douala in 1888 as the Native Baptist Church.
In 1917, under French rule the Native Baptist Church was again opposed to the authority of the Paris Mission (Société des Missions Evangéliques de Paris).
Appointed as president of the Native Baptist Church in 1921, Reverend Adolf Lotin A Same continued the struggle for the local church independence. Criticized by French pastors, he was publicly deposed of his ministerial duties in 1922. Repression came hard. The Native Baptist Churches were closed down. The Reverend Lotin was forced to preach in secret. He was readmitted in 1932 but served several other jail terms, little appreciated as he was by French authorities. Generally considered as the first nationalist leader from French colonial times, this music composer left over 200 canticles written according to the ngosso rhythm. According to a denomination census released in 2020, it claimed 135 churches and 16,000 members.

Cape Rymill () is a steep, metamorphic rock cliff standing opposite the central part of Hearst Island and jutting out from the icecap along the east coast of Palmer Land. Named for John Rymill by members of the East Base of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) who charted this coast by land and from the air in 1940. Rymill was the leader of the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE), and in 1936 sledged eastward across Antarctic Peninsula to 6945S, 6328W.

Self-checkouts (SCOs), also known as assisted checkouts (ACOs) or self-service checkouts, are machines that provide a mechanism for customers to complete their own transaction from a retailer without needing a traditional staffed checkout. When using SCOs, customers scan item barcodes before paying for their total shop without needing one-to-one staff assistance. Self-checkouts are used mainly in supermarkets, although they aren't uncommon in department or convenience stores. Most self-checkout areas are supervised by at least one staff member, often assisting customers process transactions, correcting prices, or otherwise providing service.
As of 2013, there were 191,000 self-checkout units deployed across the globe, and by 2025, it is predicted that 1.2 million units will be installed worldwide. The machines were originally invented by David R. Humble at Deerfield Beach, Florida-based company CheckRobot Inc., with NCR Corporation having the largest market share. They were introduced to the public in July 1986; the first machine, produced by CheckRobot, was installed in a Kroger store near Atlanta, Georgia.
Typical systems
In self-checkout systems, the customer is typically required to:
Scan product barcodes where these exist
Weigh products (such as fresh produce) without barcodes and select the variety on a touchscreen display.
Place all scanned items into a "bagging area". The weight observed in the bagging area is verified against previously stored information to ensure that the correct item is bagged, allowing the customer to proceed only if the observed and expected weights match.
There is normally at least one supervising staff member who will assist customers when required, authorise the sale of age-restricted products such as medicines, alcohol, knives and tobacco, remove or de-sensitize electronic article surveillance devices, and provide additional loss prevention and customer service.
A semi-random selection of customers is generally selected for a manual scan by supervising staff member to scare off shoplifters. Customers are selected for further scanning by algorithms which can take into account their previous shopping history, time spent in store or at checkout, and specific high-risk products bought.
Advantages
One benefit to the retailer in providing self-checkout machines is in reduced labour costs: one attendant can often run four to six checkout lanes with the work of the cashier now being assumed by the customer. The size of a self-checkout machine is also smaller than a traditional checkout manned by a cashier; thus, a store can save space, which could be used for more shelves, display cabinets, or additional checkouts.
Costco began to institute self-checkout screens for their food courts in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the food court's kitchen staff to focus solely on food preparation and service. The system requires payment via debit or credit card, ending the need for customers to exchange paper money or coinage with those employees, a common vector for disease transmission.
Customers who do not want to interact with the cashier can use the self-checkout. Systems which allow payment through mobile payment or a digital wallet system allow the customer to purchase their items without having to touch any part of the system, outside the bagging area, though if they utilize returned reusable bags, it can be a completely 'touchless' experience.
Self-checkout can also sometimes be faster than using a cashier lane. This can reduce the length of checkout lines and wait times. In a 2014 survey by NCR, 42% of customers said they liked the convenience of self-checkout, while 39% said it was faster than the cashier-assisted line. 90% of those surveyed responded as being users of self-checkout, with 7% of respondents saying they will always use self-checkout regardless of store lines and number of items. Respondents in Italy and Australia said they "always use self-checkout" at a rate of 13% and 9% respectively.
One advantage is that self-checkouts can, if the necessary investment is made, provide a partly multilingual service. (It cannot be fully bilingual unless the goods themselves are labelled in all the relevant languages, which is often not the case.) For example, Tesco's Welsh stores which can serve customers in Welsh, whereas finding enough fluent Welsh-speakers as staff can be difficult because in some areas only a small proportion of local people have Welsh as their first language.
Disadvantages
In 2002, a study was carried out where people with disabilities used self-checkout machines, and found that existing checkout machines were not designed for accessibility.
Noise pollution
Customers often complain about the repeated robotic-sounding messages coming from self-service checkouts. In 2015, supermarket Tesco replaced the robotic announcements with more human-sounding voice prompts in response to criticism.
Retailers have been known to use novelty voices for their self-service checkouts. For example, discount store Poundland has used the voices of Yoda, Elvis Presley, Count Dracula and Father Christmas on various occasions. In 2019, Marks & Spencer replaced its regular checkout announcers with the voices of judges from that year's season of Britain's Got Talent. The new voices led to an increase in customer complaints, with many questioning the appropriateness of some of the comments.
Shoplifting
Self-checkout machines make it easy to shoplift. Countermeasures, such as sensors, are often annoying and ineffective.
Some supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Tesco, and Asda in the United Kingdom, have started installing monitors with CCTV screens that show customers a video of themselves using tills.
Inventory record corruption
As customers are not trained to scan items, they may erroneously think that promotion items, such as 'buy one, get one' only need to be scanned once. It can also occur that the customer scans a different variety of a product that has the same price. Both of these scenarios would corrupt the inventory records of the retailer.
Scanning while shopping
An alternative system (self-scanning) consists of a portable barcode scanner that is used by the customer to scan and bag items while shopping. When the customer has finished shopping, the scanner is brought to a checkout kiosk, where the information from the barcode scanner is downloaded to the kiosk, usually in conjunction with a customer loyalty card. The customer pays and receives a receipt at the checkout kiosk. The integrity of the system is maintained through the use of random audits or RFID. Stop & Shop uses handheld scanners or mobile phone apps for its "ScanIt!" as-you-go system for customers who want to use it.
The Walmart-owned warehouse club, Sam's Club, allows customers to download an app and scan items into their cart using a mobile application. In summer 2018, Walmart China launched its Wechat-based "Scan and Go" program, allowing customers to scan items into their carts without downloading another mobile app, while paying through Wechat Payment or Alipay. The "Scan and Go" program carried 30% of all payments made in Chinese stores, and even improved sales in certain markets by 10%.
In December 2016, Amazon announced a bricks and mortar store in Seattle under the name Amazon Go, which uses a variety of cameras and sensors in order to see what customers are putting into their shopping bags. The customers scan a QR code when they enter the store through a companion app, which is linked to their Amazon.com account. When the customer exits the store, the items in their bag are automatically charged to the account.
Hybrid systems
Suppliers like ITAB, NCR, Wincor-Nixdorf, and others have manufactured hybrid checkout systems that allows the checkout counter to be switched between either a cashier operated mode or a customer self-service mode.
Open-source systems
In 2010, the open-source-self-check project was announced. By using hardware and open source software, this library self-checkout system costs less than one-tenth of the commercial version.
A Java-based open source self check client for libraries, which has been used at the University of Oxford, is also available under a GPL v3 license.
RFID-based system
Several experimental stores in China use a combination of RFID and cameras to determine which products a customer has picked. Upon leaving, the customer passes through an RFID-reading gate and only has to pay the bill to check out.
Regulation
A California appeal court confirmed in September 2013, with a 2–1 majority, a law banning the sale of alcohol through self-checkouts. The law requires alcohol only to be sold in face-to-face transactions with staff members, as is mandatory for cigarettes, spray paint and some over-the-counter medication. The California Grocers Association condemned the bill, stating how SCOs already lock out alcohol, requiring store staff to verify and approve purchases of alcohol. Similarly, the court said that a previous direction from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was of no legal affect as it was not given for discussion or public comment.
The Oregon AFL–CIO has backed a proposed ballot measure in Oregon, US to prohibit stores from operating more than two self-checkout machines.
Camera-based systems
As of April 2022, camera-based self-checkout machines are in use at some baseball stadiums in the United States. Systems manufactured by Caper Counters (acquired by Instacart) allow customers to put items in a designated area but not align them to expose the barcode.
Cashierless stores use cameras throughout the entire store. Customers either pay the bill on the way out, or register a smartphone on the way in so they can "just walk out" with their selected items.

According to a 2007 newspaper report, Source Columba (Latin columba, "pigeon") was the code name for the Confidential Pigeon Service, an unconventional British intelligence gathering operation in World War II.
It involved air-dropping homing pigeons behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and the Netherlands as a means for locals to convey information, such as troop movements, to British intelligence. From 1940 onwards, hundreds of pigeon cases were parachuted into Europe, each case including – apart from the pigeon – sheets of very thin paper, a special pencil and a tube for storing the message, as well as French and Dutch instructions on how to fill in a report. A recent copy of a London newspaper was also included as proof of good faith.
In 1944, prior to the imminent Allied invasion, German counterintelligence sought to counteract (or co-opt) Source Columba by dropping pigeons of their own. These pigeon cases, accompanied by a packet of English cigarettes, were purporting to be British also and carried instructions to communicate the names of the local patriots to the Allies. The Résistance, for its part, let it be known that the best way to deal with these false birds would be to smoke the cigarettes and eat the pigeons.
Despite such interference, the operation was reported to have been remarkably successful, yielding useful intelligence in over fifty percent of the received messages. 31 Source Columba pigeons eventually received the Dickin Medal, the highest British military decoration for animals. The operation became public only after National Archives files relating to it were released in 2007. However the method and a few actual cases were described in some detail in Dr R.V. Jones' autobiographical book Most Secret War in 1978.

Saint-Édouard Church () is a Roman Catholic church in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is dedicated to Edward the Confessor, the King of England from 1047 until 1066. Its construction started in 1901 and was completed in 1909.
Its address is 6500 Saint-Vallier Street, near the intersection of Saint Denis Street and Beaubien Street.
History
Montreal grew rapidly in the 1890s. Saint-Édouard parish and its church were the result. In 1895, a meeting was convened by the canon Bruchesi and the formation of a parish was requested almost unanimously. On December 14, 1895, Monsignor Édouard-Charles Fabre erected the parish and applied to the Archbishop of Montreal for the construction of a temporary Chapel on the Saint Denis Street along with the presence of a resident priest. The request was accepted and construction began. The Chapel on the rue Saint-Denis opened in May 1896. One hundred and twenty families inhabited the parish. By 1897, the parish grew to 400 families. The Saint-Denis Street chapel replied to the request a few years later due to the rapid population growth at the end of 19th century. A larger church was needed.
In 1901, the parishioners decided that the construction of a church and a Presbytery was necessary, and chose the architect to prepare the plans of the base. By 1905, the parish grew to 1,200 families. In 1906, the parishioners accepted the plans of the architect Joseph-Ovide Turgeon for the church. The construction of the church top began in 1907. The limestone was extracted from the Martineau Quarry where Père Marquette Park is now located. The church was completed in 1909. The entire front facade of the church is made up of elements of limestone. Arrows of copper sit atop the bells. The organ was built in 1913 by Casavant Frères in Saint-Hyacinthe. It has three manuals and pedals. The organ is still in very good condition. The church bells, manufactured by the Georges Pacard in Haute-Savoie, were added in 1922.
In the mid-1970, architect John Bland restored the colors and designs of the altar of celebration and the ambon in a contemporary manner.

The first roadside bomb was aimed towards a civilian bus, with gunmen shooting at fleeing survivors and then retreating into the bush, killing farmers who encountered them. The second roadside bomb was aimed towards a military vehicle, injuring three soldiers. The Sri Lankan Government has blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for the attacks.

In mathematics, the JSJ decomposition, also known as the toral decomposition, is a topological construct given by the following theorem:
Irreducible orientable closed (i.e., compact and without boundary) 3-manifolds have a unique (up to isotopy) minimal collection of disjointly embedded incompressible tori such that each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either atoroidal or Seifert-fibered.
The acronym JSJ is for William Jaco, Peter Shalen, and Klaus Johannson. The first two worked together, and the third worked independently.
The characteristic submanifold
An alternative version of the JSJ decomposition states:
A closed irreducible orientable 3-manifold M has a submanifold Σ that is a Seifert manifold (possibly disconnected and with boundary) whose complement is atoroidal (and possibly disconnected).
The submanifold Σ with the smallest number of boundary tori is called the characteristic submanifold of M; it is unique (up to isotopy). Cutting the manifold along the tori bounding the characteristic submanifold is also sometimes called a JSJ decomposition, though it may have more tori than the standard JSJ decomposition.
The boundary of the characteristic submanifold Σ is a union of tori that are almost the same as the tori appearing in the JSJ decomposition. However there is a subtle difference: if one of the tori in the JSJ decomposition is "non-separating", then the boundary of the characteristic submanifold has two parallel copies of it (and the region between them is a Seifert manifold isomorphic to the product of a torus and a unit interval).
The set of tori bounding the characteristic submanifold can be characterised as the unique (up to isotopy) minimal collection of disjointly embedded incompressible tori such that closure of each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either atoroidal or Seifert-fibered.
The JSJ decomposition is not quite the same as the decomposition in the geometrization conjecture, because some of the pieces in the JSJ decomposition might not have finite volume geometric structures. For example, the mapping torus of an Anosov map of a torus has a finite volume sol structure, but its JSJ decomposition cuts it open along one torus to produce a product of a torus and a unit interval, and the interior of this has no finite volume geometric structure.

The Col. Thomas Carpenter III House is a historic house at 77 Bay State Road in Rehoboth, Massachusetts.
The Georgian architecture style house was built in 1755 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Family
Thomas Carpenter was born October 24, 1733, in Rehoboth, Bristol County, Massachusetts and died April 26, 1807, in Rehoboth. He married on December 26, 1754, Elizabeth Moulton (born 1736 Bristol County, Massachusetts, died May 17, 1804, in Rehoboth) and they moved into the newly built house now on 77 Bay State Road before it was fully finished in September 1755. On December 22, 1755, their first daughter Elizabeth was born in their new home.
By August 1776 they would have twelve children born in the now historic house. Unfortunately, several children would also die within the walls of their home. These were an unknown child in 1759, Sarah in 1775 who was age 15, William in 1763 as an infant, James in 1764 as an infant, and Nathan in 1772 who died as an infant. Another Nathan, age 12½, in 1789 may have died due to an accident outside the house. Those children who reached maturity were Elizabeth (born 1755), Thomas (born 1758), Stephen (born 1765), James (born 1767), Rebecca (born 1769), and Peter (born 1772).
Colonel Thomas Carpenter was the son of Thomas Carpenter (born 1692 and died 1779 in Rehoboth) and Mary Barstow (born about 1696 and died 1783 in Rehoboth) and he was the great great grandson of the William Carpenter the immigrant who was born in England in 1605 of the Rehoboth Carpenter family).

Mary H. Boergers (born February 10, 1946) is an American politician and educator. She was appointed to a seat on the Maryland House of Delegates in 1981, and served until 1990, when she won election to the Maryland Senate. During Boergers's political career, she represented the 17th and 18th districts of Maryland. She was highly involved in Maryland politics, especially concerned with issues of education, drugs and crime, environment, labor, and women's concerns.
Early life and education
Boergers was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on February 10, 1946. Her mother was a high school teacher and her father was an auditor for an insurance company. Her family later moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Boergers attended the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota and graduated with her Bachelors of Arts in 1968. After graduating, she moved to Washington, D.C. to attend Catholic University of America, earning a Masters of Arts in American History in 1970.
Career
Mary Boergers taught high school history at Rockville High School in Montgomery County, Maryland. She later was a lobbyist for the National Organization for Women and fund raised for Rep. Michael Barnes. Boergers continued to engage herself in politics, particularly in the areas of education, drugs and crime, environment, labor, and women's concerns.
In 1981, Mary Boergers was appointed to the Maryland House of Delegates, representing the 18th district. She replaced David L. Scull who resigned from the role. She was a member of the Ways and Means Committee (1981-1988), House of Delegates (1983-1990), and the Economic Matters Committee (1988-1990). She was the president of Women Legislators of Maryland from 1990 to 1991.
In 1990, Boergers was elected to the Maryland Senate seat representing 17th district and served from 1991 to 1994. She ran on a pro-choice platform against a pro-life candidate.
Boergers ran for Governor of Maryland in 1994. Her running mate was Barbara Osborn Kreamer; they were the first all-female top ticket in Maryland. Boergers received 9% of the democratic primary votes, losing the primary election to the later elected Parris Glendening.
Personal life
Mary Boergers is married to David Boergers and they have two children.

Date Munehiro or Chihiro（Japanese:伊達 宗広 or 千広; June 24, 1802 – May 18, 1877) was a Japanese samurai of Kii Domain and Scholar of Kokugaku, living during the late Edo and early Meiji periods. He was father of Mutsu Munemitsu（陸奥 宗光). His penname was Jitoku (自得)．
Life
In 1802, he was born the son of Usami Sukenaga (宇佐美 祐長), a samurai of Kii Domain, and he became an adoptive son of his uncle, Date Moriaki (伊達 盛明). He inherited a patrimony by 12 years old, and was appointed "Kansatsu (監察)" by 18 years old. He assisted Karō of Kii Domain, and promoted the reform of that domain, and took the lead in the Sonnō jōi movement. In 1852, he was arrested by an opponent for his dangerous Sonnō jōi activity and was imprisoned for nearly 10 years in the town of Tanabe (紀伊 田辺). In 1861, he was released by the agency of Yamanouchi Yōdō (山内 容堂), who was a daimyō of Tosa Domain (土佐). He transferred his patrimony to his adoptive son, Date Muneoki （伊達 宗興） and retired. But he returned to the Sonnō jōi movement with Muneoki. They were arrested by Kii Domain officials, and were imprisoned again in 1865. After the Meiji Restoration, he was released in 1869. In his later years, he lived in Fukagawa, Tokyo with his son, Mutsu Munemitsu.
Works and books
Almost all of Date Munehiro's works were formed while in confinement. He learned at Motoori Ōhira（本居大平）when he was young. He despised Buddhism because he was a very active person. But when he was imprisoned in Kii Tanabe, he borrowed the Issai-Sūtra (一切経) from a temple in the neighborhood and read it every day. One day he experienced Buddhist enlightenment.

Charles Compton Cavendish, 1st Baron Chesham (28 August 1793 – 12 November 1863) was a British Liberal politician.
Early life
Cavendish was the fourth son of George Augustus Henry Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington, third son of the former Prime Minister William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, and his wife Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle, daughter of the architect Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork. His mother was Lady Elizabeth Compton, daughter of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton.
Career
In 1814, at the age of 21, Cavendish was elected Member of Parliament for Aylesbury, a seat he held until 1818, and later sat for Newtown from 1821 to 1830, for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) from 1831 to 1832, for East Sussex from 1832 to 1841, for Youghal from 1841 to 1847 and for Buckinghamshire from 1847 to 1857. In 1858 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Chesham, of Chesham in the County of Buckingham.
Personal life
Lord Chesham married Lady Catherine Susan Gordon, daughter of George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly, in 1814. Together, they were the parents of three children:
William George Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham
Hon. Susan Sophia Cavendish, who married Thomas Trevor, 22nd Baron Dacre
Hon. Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, who married, as his second wife, George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford.

The name Sigar can refer to four people in Scandinavian mythology, surrounding the legends of Sigurd the dragon slayer. One of them only appears as the friend of Helgi Hjörvarðsson in the eddic lay Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar. The other two appear as the villainous members of the same clan in several sources.
Icelandic sources
Snorri Sturluson writes in the Skáldskaparmál that two Sigars belong to the same clan, the Siklings, and that they are the relatives of Siggeir, the villainous Geatish king in the Völsunga saga.
In Hversu Noregr byggðist, it is given in more detail that Sigar the elder had two sons, Sigmund and Siggeir who killed Völsung. Sigmund had the son Sigar the younger, who killed Hagbard.
It is told in the Völsunga saga that Sigar the younger was in a feud with Hagbard and Haki and his sons. He had kidnapped one of Haki's daughters and murdered a second:
Sigar the younger is also mentioned in Háleygjatal (as quoted in Ynglinga saga), where a gallows is referred to as "Sigar's steed" (Sigars jó):
Gesta Danorum
In Gesta Danorum (book 7), Saxo tells that Sigar had a daughter named Signy. Sigar was in a feud with Haki's brother Hagbard, but was informed by Signy's handmaid, that Hagbard had a secret love affair with Signy. Sigar decided to hang Hagbard, who, however, managed to inform Signy of this. Signy set her house on fire and succumbed in the flames while Hagbard executed himself in the gallows. Sigar tried in vain to save both Hagbard and Signy but failed. His only consolation was to bury the treacherous maid alive.
Gesta Danorum disagrees with the other sources by presenting Sigar as the son of Sywaldus, who was the son of Yngwin, a Geatish king who became the king of Denmark.

Chobotarska Synagogue is a Jewish religious building located at 17 Chobotarska Street in the City of Kharkiv, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. A "Yeshiva Ketana" and a "Yeshiva Gedola" of the Kharkiv Jewish community are located nearby. The synagogue was designed by architect Boris Isaakovich Gershkovich in 1912. The opening took place the following year. The building is made of brick. The synagogue has a yellow facade with triple windows on the ground floor and single windows on the second floor which are framed by white cornices and arches. Chobotarska Synagogue operated from 1912 until the 1930s when it was closed, and the traffic police department was placed instead in the synagogue building by the Soviet authorities. After Ukraine gained independence, in 2003, the building was returned to its original owners. A Jewish school was opened. On the morning of March 15, 2022, the Yeshiva of the Kharkiv Jewish Community was damaged during a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. A rocket or shrapnel pierced the roof of the building.

The outcomes paradox is one of the terms for the observation that patients with schizophrenia in developing countries benefit much more from therapy than those in Western countries. This is surprising because the reverse holds for most diseases: "the richer and more developed the country, the better the patient outcome".
The outcomes paradox came to light in late 60s due to studies done by World Health Organization across the world and has become an "axiom" in international psychiatry since. In a study in India, it was revealed that the better outcome among patients is due to socio-cultural factors such as family, community, and local conditions. For this reason, related WHO programmes in India are community- and family-based.
Cohen et al. criticize this view, and argue that the data do not support this conclusion. There is also a concept called "equivalent outcome paradox", which describes the condition where varying methods of psychotherapy based on different techniques and theoretical orientations tend to produce the same outcome.

The Tactical Control System (TCS) is a group of protocols that govern the command and control system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
History
Developed by EG&G Technical Services and Raytheon, starting in 1999, the Tactical Control System is designed to run UAVs in all branches of the United States military as well as NATO STANAG 4586 compliant UAVs. Raytheon developed the systems to run on computers using a type of Unix operating system called Solaris 8 from Sun Microsystems. Raytheon also developed a system for the Linux operating system.
According to the winning Raytheon bid for the development of the TCS system, it will feature:
Simultaneous control of multiple UAVs
Compliance with NATO's Standardization Agreement 4586
Integration of plug and play payloads
Weaponization of the Fire Scout and Fire Scout operational evaluations
Testing
Raytheon was to undergo formal Operational Evaluation with Fire Scout in fiscal year 2008. Until then, tests to determine the progress of the system's development were ongoing. Positive results included:
December 2004 - A scaled down laptop version of TCS, the Multiple Vehicle Control System (MVCS), was able to control two UAVs flying over Arizona simultaneously. The MVCS was also able to simultaneously control an unmanned surface vessel operating on Chesapeake Bay near Norfolk, Virginia.
January 2005 - The TCS system was able to complete a vertical shipboard landing on a moving target, the US Navy ship USS Nashville, independent of any pilot. This was the first time such a feat had ever been achieved.
April 10, 2006 - Raytheon Company successfully simulated simultaneous command and control of two unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and an unmanned surface vehicle from one common control system.

The Centre de recherche et de documentation sur Hegel (Research Center for the Writings of Hegel and Marx) was established at the Philosophy Department of the University of Poitiers in 1969. Its founding, under Professor Jacques D'Hondt, was a significant event in the French philosophical field. This center attempted to coordinate the research of an objective, scientific and philosophical nature on the origins and ideas of the theologian Hegel and the atheist Marx.
The idea for this Center appeared around a Seminar of Jean Hyppolite, Professor of the College of France, during conversations between Jean Hyppolite and Jacques D'Hondt. Their proposal was supported by George Canguilhem and materialized within a broader intent to decentralize French philosophical research between the College of France, the University of Paris and the University of Poitiers.
The death of Jean Hyppolite in 1969, however, deprived the Research Center of its Parisian anchor.
Its first convention in November, 1969 included Professors D'Hondt, Pucelle, Delhomme and Garaudy, of the Philosophy Department of University of Poitiers, and other notable researchers, including Mssrs. Dubarle, Bruaire, Sichirollo, Bess, Garniron, Guillaumaud, Hoffmann, Janicaud, Méthais, Planty, Ricci, Vadée, Mrs. Jalley and Miss Thomas. Other associates included Mssrs. Doz, Saintillan, Large, Wetzel, Bourdin, Draper, Gauvin, Olivier, Francisci, Fleischmann, Mrs. Königson and Mrs. Draper-Josa.
In 1975, the Professor Planty succèeded J. D'Hondt. J. D'Hondt's final seminar on Hegel and Marx was completed in 1981. Professor Jean-Louis L'Baron succeeded Professor Planty in 1991.
Around this timeframe the USSR had fallen, and Marxist studies significantly declined in the West. The Research Center for the Writings of Hegel and Marx ceased to exist in 1998, and was replaced by the Research center on Hegel and German Idealism.

Transworld (26 February 1974 – 24 June 2001) was an American-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Bred in Kentucky he was sent to race in Europe after being sold for $375,000 as a yearling. His brief racing career comprised only five races between May and September 1977 but he showed himself to be a high-class staying colt with wins in the Churchill Stakes, Ulster Derby and Irish St. Leger. He returned to America his stud career and had some success as a breeding stallion. Transworld died in 2001 at the age of 27.
Background
Transworld was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and four white socks bred in Kentucky by Elmendorf Farm. As a yearling he was put up for auction and was sold for $375,000. He was sent to race in Europe where he was trained by Vincent O'Brien and competed in the colours of Simon Fraser.
His sire Prince John recorded his biggest wi in the Garden State Stakes before his career was ended prematurely by injury. He became a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Speak John, Stage Door Johnny, Typecast, Silent Screen and Deceit. Transworld's dam Hornpipe failed to win a race but produced several other winners including Transworld's full brother Protagonist, the American Champion two-year-old colt of 1973. She was a granddaughter of Galatea who won the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks in 1939.
Racing career
1977: three-year-old season
Transworld was unraced as juvenile in 1976 and made his debut in the Group 2 Gallinule Stakes over one and a half miles at the Curragh in May 1977. He showed some promise but finished unplaced behind his stablemate Alleged. In June he was sent to Ascot Racecourse in England for the Churchill Stakes, which was run over one and a half miles on the Saturday following the Royal Ascot meeting. He started favourite and overcame some difficulties in running before pulling away and winning by four lengths from the Guy Harwood-trained Mallard Song. Later that month he was sent to Down Royal in Northern Ireland and recorded a very easy wi in the Ulster Derby. In August at the Curragh he attempted to win his third consecutive race in the Blandford Stakes but was beaten a length into second by the Dermot Weld-trained Panamint with the filly Sassabunda in third.
In the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh on 17 September Transworld was partnered by Tommy Murphy after Lester Piggott opted to ride the O'Brien stables main hope Valinsky, the winner of the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Despite being rejected by the stable's top jockey, the colt was strongly supported in the betting market and started the 13/2 third choice behind Valinsky and Panamint. The other six runners included Sassabunda, Orchestra (Nijinsky Stakes) and Aristocracy (Whitehall Stakes). Murphy sent Tranworld into the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, shaking off his closest pursuer Valinsky early in the straight and drawing clear of the field to win by four lengths from Orchestra. His victory gave Vincent O'Brien a third consecutive win in the contest after the Caucasus in 1975 and Meneval in 1976.
At the end of the year the independent Timeform organisation gave Transworld a rating of 121, sixteen pounds behind their Horse of the Year Alleged.
Stud record
Transworld was exported to the United States and was expected to continue his track career. He was, however, retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Elmendorf Farm before moving to the Gainesway Farm in Kentucky and being relocated to the Stonewall Farm in New York in 1994. He died in June 2001 Alexander Farm near Byers, Colorado at the age of 27. The best of his offspring was the outstanding steeplechaser Lonesome Glory but he sired several other top-class performers including Winton (Venezuelan Horse of the Year), Powder Break (Pan American Handicap), The Hague (Hollywood Turf Cup) and Only Queens (Demoiselle Stakes).

The 14 July 1953 demonstration was an incident in Paris during which a march of the Algerian anti-colonial Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties was halted by the police, killing seven and seriously injuring about 50.
Background
Since 1936, though interrupted by the Vichy period and the German occupation, the French Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labour in France, and several similar movements organized a parade in Paris each Bastille Day to celebrate the values of the republic.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Algerian separatists from the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD), led by Messali Hadj, took part in the parade in spite of their differences with the French Communist Party on the issue of Algerian independence.
In 1953, tensions were high. The demonstrations on International Workers' Day had been met with violence by the police. The next year, on May 28th, 1952, the Algerian communist Hocine Bélaïd was killed during the demonstration against Americal General Ridgway's visit to France; the general was accused of using biological weapons in Korea.
Events
The demonstration was very closely watched by the authorities; "offensive" signs, flags, and banners had been banned by the prefecture of police, along with "seditious" songs and chants. The march was to follow a traditional course, travelling from Place de la République to Place de la Nation. However, when it reached Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine, some off-duty paratroopers attacked the demonstrators; they were beaten by the demonstrators and six were wounded. The paratroopers continued to aggress the demonstrators; the police removed them each time, but made no arrests.
The demonstrators clashed with police at Place de la Nation, where most of the protesters dispersed. The parade planned by the MTLD continued somewhat farther in spite of heavy rain, as some marchers went toward Avenue du Trône to drop their signs and flags in an MTLD truck.
There, and without warning, the police opened fire on them on their own initiative without direction from their command. This escalated the demonstration; the Algerian demonstrators used barricades to attack the police and burned at least two police cars between 5:00 PM and 5:30 PM. Seven people were killed: six Algerian workers, and one worker from the General Confederation of Labour. Besides the deaths, over 50 demonstrators were injured, at least 40 by gunshots. About fifty police officers were injured: between three and five by stabbing, and the remainder by makeshift weapons.
Aftermath
The Parisian authorities immediately tried to paint the demonstration as a clandestine riot. To avoid public discussion, the government charged one police administrator with rebellion and violence on July 15th, a charge which would not have required an investigation into the police shootings. Despite this, that September, the scope of the judicial inquiry was expanded when family members of the victims moved an adhesion procedure. Even in spite of this, few Algerian witnesses were heard in the trial. The trial ended when the judge stayed the proceedings by issuing a non-lieu on October 22nd, 1957, later confirmed on appeal on January 23rd, 1958.
The French press was indignant about the shootings, but some newspapers also denounced both the communists and the separatists for assaulting the police. The communists held a large meeting on July 21st, the same day the Algerian victims' funerals were held, but did not take up the MTLD's demands for Algerian independence.

Beale Street Music Festival (BSMF)
About
The Beale Street Music Festival is a three-day music festival that has both a mix of big-name stars and local musical acts. Held during the first weekend of May in the city's Tom Lee Park at the foot of Beale Street, it is considered to be the kick-off event of the entire Memphis in May International Festival celebration. It typically hosts over 100,000 people during the weekend. The Beale Street Music Festival is the only program that has been held every year since the inception of Memphis in May in 1977. Its history can be traced back to the 1800s, when African-American musicians throughout the South would come to Beale Street and perform.
Past Performers
The Beale Street Music Festival is known for featuring an eclectic mix of genres on its lineup every year, from blues and rock 'n roll to rap and pop. The list of bands and musicians that have performed at the festival continue to grow each year, but the list includes Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ray Charles, B.B. King in '91 (d.2015, lived in Memphis), John Lee Hooker in '91, Booker T. and the M.G.'s in '99, Jerry Lee Lewis from Memphis in '03, Box Tops from Memphis in '97, Big Star in '99, Fuel from the Jackson, TN area in '04, Saliva from Memphis in '04, Willie Nelson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Al Green in '09 (now a preacher in Memphis), Isaac Hayes from Memphis in '00 (d.2008), John Prine, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Black Crowes, Van Morrison, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Foo Fighters, The Killers, Snoop Dogg, Kid Rock, John Mayer, Journey, Nelly, Steely Dan, Allman Brothers, Santana, James Taylor, Bobby "Blue" Bland, Korn, The Avett Brothers, Mumford & Sons, Kings of Leon from Nashville in '17, Paramore from Nashville in '15, 10 Years from Knoxville in '06, Soundgarden, Wiz Khalifa, Jane's Addiction, Chuck Berry, The Black Keys, Avenged Sevenfold, Alabama Shakes, Lenny Kravitz, Ed Sheeran, Neil Young, Beck, Paul Simon, Ziggy Marley, Sturgill Simpson, Aretha Franklin in '09 (d.2018, born in Memphis), Earth, Wind & Fire in '10 (Maurice White was born in Memphis and d.2016), Yo Gotti in '16, Three 6 Mafia (from Memphis) in '06, Weezer, and many more.
International Week
Every year the festival recognizes a different country, most recently saluting the Czech Republic in 2018. A week of events that typically begin the day after the Beale Street Music Fest, International Week is dedicated to a country and showcases the foods and culture of that nation. While International Week provides a learning experience for the community at large, the core is a comprehensive educational program for area youth in public and private schools throughout Memphis and Shelby County. The goal of International Week is for area students, by the time they graduate from high school, to have had the opportunity to experience the customs and cultures of 12 countries. The festival's first two honored countries — Japan and Canada – have been featured twice.
Perhaps most important are the trade delegates that visit Memphis and have introductions to suitable, high-level trade partners.
Honored countries
Through the years, the Memphis in May International Festival has played host to ambassadors, exhibits and performance troupes from 38 countries. The milestone twentieth annual event in 1996 honored all previous selected countries. The 2019 event honored the bicentennials of the founding of the city of Memphis and of the establishment of Shelby County. The West African nation of Ghana, originally selected for honor in 2020, is slated for focus during festivities in 2022 due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (WCBCC)
History
The WCBCC started in 1978 with 26 teams. The contest drew 50 teams in 1979, 80 in 1980, and 180 teams from nine states in 1981. It has now grown to be the largest pork barbecue competition in the world.
More than 250 teams from 20+ states and several countries compete, and an estimated 100,000 people attend the competition. Media from around the world, including BBC and The Food Network, come to the city to cover the event.
Credit for the original idea of a barbecue contest goes to Rodney Baber, chairman of the Memphis in May events committee in 1977, and his co-worker Jack Powell, Tennessee's reigning chili champ at the time.
The original champion at the first competition was Bessie Louise Cathey, who won a $500 prize, a sizable return for her $12 entry fee. Today, the prizes for each event range from $300 to $15,000 for the main cooking competition, and from $250 to $2,500 for the ancillary contests. Today's entry fees range from $700 to $2,600 just for renting the necessary booth space, and an extra $60 per competition entry. Some teams regularly budget amounts in excess of $15,000 just for the competition and booth.
In 1989, when MIM officials discovered that there was a feast in Honolulu which earned the title of "largest barbecue" in the Guinness Book of Records, they calculated the amount of food prepared at the WCBCC. The total was 55,297 pounds of pork, and thus earned the WCBCC a record in the 1990 edition. Over 16 tons of pork were smoked at the 2016 WCBCC.
The 2017 World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest was the first time the event spanned four days instead of three. In addition, the Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q team became the first five-time champion of the event (2017, '14, '11, '03, '00).
No contests were held in 2020-21.
Food events
The competition has three official meat categories: rib, shoulder and whole hog. There is also the Patio Porkers division, which encourages up to 40 amateur teams (who have not previously won the Patio Porker division in the WCBCC) to enter. Only wood and charcoal cooking is allowed at the event, no gas or any other sort of heat system is allowed to be used.
Beyond those main categories, teams also compete in several other ancillary contests over the four-day event, including: Best Sauce (Tomato/Mustard/Vinegar), Frank's Red Hot Hot Wings, Kingsford Tour of Champions and Anything But (Exotic/Beef/Seafood/Poultry).
Special events
Ms. Piggie - Teams dress up contestants as pigs, and then perform songs or skits on stage.
Best Booth - Booths are judged on design, originality and connection with the honored country.
T-Shirt Design - Shirts are judged on design, originality and connection with the honored country.
Sauce Wrestling - Things get a little messy with this one as teams send a representative to the wrestling ring filled with over 40 gallons of barbecue sauce.
Big Hog Run - Coined as "America's most prestigious .2K race," the Big Hog Run is a thrilling 656-foot sprint down Beale Street. Only WCBCC team members and judges are allowing to compete.
Cooker Caravan - The Cooker Caravan provides the public a behind-the-scenes look at competition barbecue by offering guided tours to teams in each championship category.

In the episode, without introducing himself, HSY conducts a spontaneous interview with the guests before launching into the show's standard three-segment format. Mahira and Fawad are asked about their life, success, and achievements after their groundbreaking serial Humsafar. HSY then launches the show's three segments, running each with Mahira first and then Fawad. Mahira wins the game, taking the prize of a PKR 50,000 voucher/gift-hamper from the Contradictions furniture store.

No Doctors were an American rock and roll band based out of California's San Francisco Bay Area. Their music drew from a wide range of styles and traditions, most prominently noise, punk, blues, metal, and jazz. Members included guitarist Elvis S. deMorrow, Chauncey Chaumpers on guitar, Mr. Brians on drums, Mr. Clopez on drums, and CansaFis Foote on saxophone, with vocal duties distributed amongst its members in a socialist-collectivist fashion.
History
Early career
Chauncey Chaumpers, CansaFis Foote, and Elvis deMorrow began creating music together in Minnetonka, Minnesota in 1998. A cast of revolving sidemen were to come in and out of the band throughout their early career. Prior to playing as No Doctors, Foote and Chaumpers had created experimental noise recordings for the purpose of psychic investigation, while deMorrow had distributed cassetteworks under the names of "Peyote Tax Return" and "F*ck Your Yankee Bluejeans," created together with an artist now known solely as "Devilman" (RIP).
Still teenagers, the boys began playing sporadic live shows around Minneapolis-St. Paul, inspired by much of the underground noise scene as documented by local record labels E.F. Tapes, Destijl, Fusetron, and the local fanzine Muckraker.
They were soon approached by CEO Matthew St-Germaine with the idea of assisting with a record label, called Freedom From. Much of their early years as a band were influenced heavily by the diverse and radical roster of artists that was quickly cultivated. The Argentine avant-space trio Reynols was to have an exceptional influence on philosophy when the boys accompanied the band on their first American tour, where they explored Minecxio and the role of the No-Mind.
S/T LP
The year 2000 saw No Doctors moving to Chicago to begin work on their debut album. At this point the band expanded into a consistent sextet, with the additions of Mr Brians on drums, Patrick Fogarty on bass, and W Cłøpŝkí on subtle whispers. Numerous other sidemen appeared as well, including the notorious Kevekev. Several distinct copies of the album were initially circulated, as noted by critic Liz Armstrong of the Chicago Reader. The album's deft integration of Minnesotan völk-noise inflections into rock's idiom curried little favor from elite urban critics, but secured the band's place in the American noise underground.
Hunting Season
No Doctors' second record, Hunting Season, was scheduled to be engineered by David N. Feldman, who handled the first album, but Feldman was under contract with R. Kelly and unavailable (Kelly taunted the group with Feldman's cameo in the video for Ignition (Remix) as the dancing white hipster.) Instead the record was recorded at Tarantula Hill in Baltimore with the assistance of Twig Harper and Carly Ptak (Nautical Almanac), and Chiara Giovando (Black Elf Speaks, Black Coitus Family, Harrias, Motörhead). The album was a move away from the dada influences of the first album toward a greater connection with punk rock and heavy metal. Critics repeatedly compared the work to the Velvet Underground, Pussy Galore, and Royal Trux, and Amir Karim Nezar went so far as to declare "No Doctors are the living incarnations of Satan."
ERP Saints
ERP Saints followed in 2004 as a tribute to the East Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. This session saw the band stripped down to a quartet. Critics such as Larry Dolman and Matt Weir praised the effort for its clarity and noted a definitive shift in aesthetics: a turning to the light.
Origin & Tectonics
In the fall of 2004 No Doctors relocated to the Bay Area, where they shared a practice space with friends Deerhoof and Kreamy 'Lectric Santa, frequently played live shows in the Bay area, and embarked on a California-only tour in October–November 2006 entitled "US Out of CA." They also released several tracks through compilations and a 7" entitled "T-Bone (Pts 1 & 2)," and released their third full-length album "Origin & Tectonics" on CD/LP in June 2007. No Doctors officially disbanded during the liquidity crises of late 2008, settling outstanding obligations to creditors and dividing all remaining assets in order to recoup market losses sustained from bundled toxic derivatives. Fis and B started Careerers, Elvis plays as Black Stool, and Chauncey abandoned music, taking a gig in contract security. There is no word on the other drummer.
Martian Clxpæs
The oft-silent Clophez lies at the heart of No Doctors' sound. Understanding the mutable essence of the Clops will unlock the band's signature sound for those who have a reasonable understanding of musical and poetic activities and are willing to study the information with due diligence. Critic Dean Roth summed up his analysis of the phenomenon with his statement, "Cloaps resonates throughout No Doctors' unique idiom like a schwa through the language of the sphinxes."
The character was first presented to the general public through the cover of No Doctors' debut LP, depicted beneath a hooded robe and clutching an enormous pair of drumsticks. Since then similarly garbed individuals have sporadically appeared with No Doctors in concert, generally operating percussive devices of a highly unorthodox nature. These devices have ranged from gigantic rolls of Pionite to glass jars full of water to other bands' amplifiers, often but not always attacked with his signature baseball-bat-sized drumsticks. Beware, he got a new pair.
Occasionally taking the place of Mr. Brians himself, CLPX has more generally appeared alongside the regular drummer in a tandem mode, though his role has been nothing if not inconsistent. Some have charged that the role amounts to little more than the band dressing up an outside business consultant. Others have romanticized the donning of the cloak as a passing of political power or even mystical significance. Regardless, there have been at least four "clopezi" who have chosen to distinguish themselves: "'W' Clopex," "Martin the Moon Doggie," "'Claps' Mulligan", and "Carlito Lopez."
It is generally accepted that the spelling of clxpz must remain inconsistent in order to properly convey the meaning of the term. The term "Clophesgian" is similarly employed to reference a wide number of seemingly incongruent or contradictory ideologies, dependent on context, including but not limited to finance, metaphysics, and aquatic lifestyles.
Rumors of a Clopezian States of America issuing its own currency have NOT been substantiated.

Arnold Rosner (November 8, 1945 in New York City – November 8, 2013) was an American composer of classical music.
Biography
Rosner got his training at State University of New York at Buffalo, New York. According to his own account, he "learned practically nothing" there.
Rosner developed an individual style that fused elements of Renaissance music with the heightened drama and rich sonorities of late romanticism. He composed three operas, eight symphonies, six string quartets, chamber music and songs. Many of his compositions were influenced by his Jewish background, but also by Catholicism. Most of his music is available on recording.

"So Much for Pretending" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Bryan White. It was released in June 1996 as the second single from his album Between Now and Forever. The song was White's third No. 1 single – and with a pair of weeks on top (September 21–28, 1996), his only multi-week No. 1 – on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart.
White co-wrote the song with John Tirro and Derek George, the latter of whom was a former member of the band Pearl River.
Music video
The music video was directed by Jeffrey C. Phillips and premiered in mid-1996.
The video is also noted for a cameo appearance by then-Texas Rangers first baseman Will Clark, who is seen walking with White down the tunnel at The Ballpark in Arlington.

The British Youths Open Championship was a youths golf tournament that was played from 1954 to 1994. It was 72-hole stroke-play event for golfers under 22. From 1954 to 1962, it was organised by a committee led by Sam Bunton, a Glasgow architect, and was open to assistant professionals as well as amateurs, but from 1963, it was taken over by The R&A and became an amateur-only event, called: the British Youths Open Amateur Championship. The R&A dropped the event because they felt it was no longer needed to bridge the gap between boy's and men's golf. A 54-hole girls' event was also held. In 1963, the event was taken over by the Scottish Ladies' Golfing Association and called the Scottish Girls' Open Stroke-play Championship.
Winners
(p) = professional
In 1954 there was an under-18 section which was won by Ronnie Shade.
International matches
In 1955, an international match between England and Scotland was arranged the day before the start of the championship, although the match had a lower age limit than that used in the championship. Another match was arranged the following year, although the result was decided on holes rather than matches. There was no match in 1957 but it was arranged again in 1958 and 1959. From 1960, the event was contested for the Alex Mackay Memorial Trophy.
In 1967, a second match was arranged, between Great Britain & Ireland and the Continent of Europe, later called the EGA Trophy. This was played the day before the start of the championship with the England/Scotland match being played a day earlier. The same system was retained for a number of years while the EGA Trophy match was played before the championship. In 1976, and on a number of occasions from 1980, the EGA Trophy match was not played in connection with the championship, and on those occasions, the England/Scotland match was played the day before the championship rather than two days before.
British Girls' Stroke-play Championship
The girls section of the British Youths Open Championship was later called the British Girls' Stroke-play Championship. It was played over 54 holes. In 1963, the event was taken over by the Scottish Ladies' Golfing Association and called the Scottish Girls' Open Stroke-play Championship. The Scottish under-21 event was played from 1963 until 2015, when it was dropped from the schedule. The last winner was Cloe Frankish.

The Return of the Pharaoh: From the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D. is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel by Nicholas Meyer, published in 2021. It takes place after Meyer's other Holmes pastiches, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, The West End Horror, The Canary Trainer and The Adventure of the Peculiar Protocols.
Reception
Kirkus Reviews praised the "rousing adventure" but conceded that "the climactic revelation of the murderer will catch some readers sheepishly admitting that they'd forgotten there was a mystery to be solved." Publishers Weekly found the book "disappointing" and said "Fans of the author's creative reimaginings of Conan Doyle's characters will hope for a return to form next time." The Associated Press praised the novel, saying it "blends old with new, giving readers familiar stories with parallels to and hints of more modern takes."

Turtle Islands Park (Taman Pulau Penyu) is located within the Turtle Islands, which lie in the Sulu Sea some north of Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia. It consists of 3 islands - Selingaan, Little Bakkungan and Gulisaan (often spelt with -an instead of the traditional -aan), including the surrounding coral reefs and ocean. The Park is noted for its green turtles and hawksbill turtles which lay their eggs on the beaches of the islands. The Park covers an area of 17.4 km². The name Turtle Islands, however, refers to 10 islands, 3 of which are part of Turtle Islands Park of Malaysia, and 7 which belong to the Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary of Tawi-Tawi province, Philippines.
On 1 August 1966, the first turtle hatchery in Malaysia was established on Selingan, funded entirely by the Sabah state government. Turtle hatcheries on the remaining two islands followed shortly after. In 1972, Selingan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisan were designated as a Game and Bird Sanctuary. In 1977, this status was upgraded to that of a Marine Park. Permanent park staff monitor the turtles, protect the hatcheries and tag the turtles for research purposes. Libaran Island is also designated within the park boundaries, however it is not a major turtle hatching spot.
Turtle Islands Park is administered by Sabah Parks.
Selingan Island
Only on Selingan are there chalets for overnight visitors, and those who wish to see the turtles laying eggs must stay overnight. A curious fact of the three islands is that turtles come ashore nightly, not only during certain seasons and thus one is virtually guaranteed to see them. During the peak season (October) up to 50 turtles come ashore to lay eggs.
However, park rules and regulations are strictly enforced and visitors are not allowed on the beach from sunset to sunrise so as not to disturb the turtles. A ranger will call all visitors to observe only one turtle laying eggs per night. The eggs are collected and the visitors vacate the beach immediately so as not to scare away other turtles, which are very sensitive to movement on the beach. After the laying and collection of eggs, and eventual tagging of the turtle if it is a first-time visitor, tourists are allowed into the hatchery to observe the further work of the rangers: the transplantation of the freshly laid eggs into a man-made incubation chamber. The chamber is no different from that of the turtle: between 60–75 cm deep, in the sand, but within a protected hatchery to make it impossible for natural predators to dig the nests open. Since temperature determines the sex of the turtles part of the hatchery is shaded, while the rest remains under the open sun.
After the transplantation of the eggs visitors will get turtle hatchlings – baby turtles – to release into the sea, which is also done by night to further increase their chances of survival.
Not all nests are emptied by the park rangers, but some remain undisturbed and develop naturally. By conserving the turtles the park does not want to endanger other wildlife on the island: many animals that are natural predators of the turtles such as monitor lizards, a crab specialising in turtle hatchlings, eagles and other birds, and marine animals such as sharks. They need the turtles for their survival.
The turtle conservation programme in Sabah is the oldest in the world and with the most detailed statistics and research. Marine turtles have been around for 230 million years at least, but because of human activities they have been brought, over the past hundred years, to the brink of extinction.

Franciscus Carree or Frans Carré (ca. 1630 - 1669) was a Dutch painter.
He was either born in Leeuwarden or Antwerp. In 1649 he married Janneke Padtbrugge in The Hague where he became a member of the guild, and spent most of his career. Between 1658 and 1661 he lived in Amsterdam. It is not known who was his instructor, but he grew to be sufficiently esteemed to be appointed first painter to the Stadtholder William Frederick in Leeuwarden in 1664. He excelled in painting landscapes and village festivals, but his works are little known outside his own country. He left an etching of the funeral catafalque of the Stadtholder in November 1664. He died at Amsterdam, The Hague, or Leeuwarden in 1669.

Large-signal modeling is a common analysis method used in electronic engineering to describe nonlinear devices in terms of the underlying nonlinear equations.
In circuits containing nonlinear elements such as transistors, diodes, and vacuum tubes, under "large signal conditions", AC signals have high enough magnitude that nonlinear effects must be considered.
"Large signal" is the opposite of "small signal", which means that the circuit can be reduced to a linearized equivalent circuit around its operating point with sufficient accuracy.
Differences between Small Signal and Large Signal
A small signal model takes a circuit and based on an operating point (bias) and linearizes all the components. Nothing changes because the assumption is that the signal is so small that the operating point (gain, capacitance, etc.) doesn't change.
A large signal model, on the other hand, takes into account the fact that the large signal actually affects the operating point, as well as that elements are non-linear and circuits can be limited by power supply values to avoid variation in operating point. A small signal model ignores simultaneous variations in the gain and supply values.

La Torre is a barrio in the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 1,574.
History
Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of La Torre barrio was 2,008.
Sectors
Barrios (which are roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.
The following sectors are in La Torre barrio:

The Theban Tomb TT99 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna. It forms part of the Theban Necropolis, situated on the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor. The sepulchre is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian noble, Senneferi. It has been worked on by an expedition from the University of Cambridge since 1992.
HLHM Ostracon
The HLHM ostracon, or the Halaḥam inscription is a limestone shard, discovered during the excavation of tomb TT99 in Thebes, bearing lines of hieratic and hieroglyphic characters on two sides written in black ink. This inscription bears a lesser-known letter order of early Semitic script, known as "Halaham", and is believed to date as old (circa fifteenth century BCE) as the tomb itself. These lettered inscriptions are the earliest predecessors to the modern Hebrew alphabet (Aleph, Bet, Gimel).

Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico is an artist residency program in the artists' colony of Taos, New Mexico. The Foundation, which offers prize fellowships to painters, poets, sculptors, writers, playwrights, composers, photographers and filmmakers, was established in 1954 and incorporated as a private nonprofit in 1958. The Foundation was conceived, funded, and organized by Helene Billing Wurlitzer (1874-1963), a philanthropist from Cincinnati who relocated to Taos in the early 1940s.
History
The New Mexico iteration of Helene Wurlitzer's foundation began in Cincinnati, Ohio. Both her husband's family and her birth family had been supportive of music and visual arts organizations as well as medical research and Germanic institutions. Helene's Cincinnati philanthropy included funding the development of a radio and television department at the College of Music of Cincinnati. She also supported a musical scholarship program for the school. One of the recipients of her support was a young opera student from Taos, Eduardo Rael, who would later introduce her to his home town.
In Taos in 1954, Helene and Henry Sauerwein, a young intellectual from Baltimore who was new to Taos, conceived of moving the Ohio foundation officially to New Mexico, which was completed by 1956. The focus would be an artist residency program with occasional, as-needed scholarships for local youth and living stipends for artists in need. The structure of the foundation was as much Henry's vision as it was Helene's. Henry served as director, and Helene kept the activities funded. The board of trustees, at Helene's request, was always to include members of the Native, Hispanic, and Anglo communities.
The Helene Wurlitzer Foundation artist residency program is now the oldest such program west of the Mississippi, offering residency grants to creatives of national and international origin. Residents are selected by panels of jurors who specialize in the artistic discipline of the applicant; initial selection is based purely on the merit of their creative works.
Each year, three sessions (two at 12 weeks and one at 10 weeks) bring a total of 33 artists to the Taos campus. Artists in residence have no imposed expectations, quotas, or requirements during their stay. Helene believed in supporting artists in their process, and understood the ripple effects that unburdened time can have on a creative life.
The Foundation's mission is to support the artist and the creative process.
The campus
In 1940, when Helene decided Taos would be her new home, she purchased property from Eduardo Rael's mother. The land was a short walk from Taos Plaza at the center of town and included three small adobe homes on acres of alfalfa fields. She lived in one of those casitas while her hacienda-style home was being built by local builder and craftsman, Arturo Vicente Martinez y Salazar. Over 20-plus years, Helene acquired property adjacent to her own land and designed and built three new casitas. The result was a campus with eleven residences and a commons house for visiting artists, writers, and composers, in addition to her home and guesthouse.
The original home of Helene Wurlitzer, known as the Main House, is an example of classic Taos adobe architecture and contains a large collection of early 20th century, Hispanic, and Native American art, all collected by Helene.
The 15-acre campus consists of open fields bordered by old-growth trees, connected to a centuries-old network of acequias, a traditional means of supplying water to the Taos valley. In 2018, the foundation began restoration of the acequias network. By July 2019, for the first time in several decades, the acequias irrigating the southern part of the campus flowed again.
Leadership
The foundation's first director was Henry A. Sauerwein III (1918 – 1996). As a young academic who spoke many languages, Sauerwein had worked for the Pentagon throughout WWII before moving to Taos. He led the foundation from 1954 until his death in 1996, when the directorship transitioned to his assistant, Michael Knight. After 17 years, Nic Knight took up the mantle in 2015 and continues as executive director.
The foundation functions on an annual budget of approximately $250,000, with one full-time and one part-time administrative employee. The grounds and facilities are maintained by a staff of three, with additional seasonal help.
The board of directors includes seven people from the Taos community.

Liturgical music originated as a part of religious ceremony, and includes a number of traditions, both ancient and modern. Liturgical music is well known as a part of Catholic Mass, the Anglican Holy Communion service (or Eucharist) and Evensong, the Lutheran Divine Service, the Orthodox liturgy and other Christian services including the Divine Office. Some claim that such ceremonial music in the Christian tradition can be traced back to both the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and synagogue worship of the Jews.
The qualities that create the distinctive character of liturgical music are based on the notion that liturgical music is conceived and composed according to the norms and needs of the various historic liturgies of particular denominations.
Roman Catholic church music
The interest taken by the Catholic Church in music is shown not only by practitioners, but also by numerous enactments and regulations calculated to foster music worthy of Divine service. Contemporary Catholic official church policy is expressed in the documents of the Second Vatican Council Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy promulgated by Pope Paul VI on December 4, 1963 (items 112–121); and most particularly Musicam sacram, the Instruction on Music In The Liturgy from the Sacred Congregation for Rites, on March 5, 1967.
While there have been historic disputes within the church where elaborate music has been under criticism, there are many period works by Orlandus de Lassus, Allegri, Vittoria, where the most elaborate means of expression are employed in liturgical music, but which, nevertheless, are spontaneous outpourings of adoring hearts (cf. contrapuntal or polyphonic music). Besides plain chant and the polyphonic style, the Catholic Church also permits homophonic or figured compositions with or without instrumental accompaniment, written either in ecclesiastical modes, or the modern major or minor keys. Gregorian chant is warmly recommended by the Catholic Church, as both polyphonic music and modern unison music for the assembly.
Prior to the Second Vatican Council, according to the motu proprio of Pius X (November 22, 1903), the following were the general guiding principles of the Church: "Sacred music should possess, in the highest degree, the qualities proper to the liturgy, or more precisely, sanctity and purity of form from which its other character of universality spontaneously springs. It must be holy, and must therefore exclude all profanity, not only from itself but also from the manner in which it is presented by those who execute it. It must be true art, for otherwise it cannot exercise on the minds of the hearers that influence which the Church meditates when she welcomes into her liturgy the art of music. But it must also be universal, in the sense that, while every nation is permitted to admit into its ecclesiastical compositions those special forms which may be said to constitute its native music, still these forms must be subordinated in such a manner to the general characteristics of sacred music, that no one of any nation may receive an impression other than good on hearing them.". This was expanded upon by Pope Pius XII in his motu proprio Musicae sacrae.
In 1963, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium) of the Second Vatican Council directed that "bishops and other pastors of souls must be at pains to ensure that, whenever the sacred action is to be celebrated with song, the whole body of the faithful may be able to contribute that active participation which is rightly theirs, as laid down in Art. 28 and 30," where we read: "To promote active participation, the people should be encouraged to take part by means of acclamations, responses, psalmody, antiphons, and songs. Full and active participation of the people is a recurring theme in the Vatican II document. To achieve this fulsome congregational participation, great restraint in introducing new hymns has proven most helpful.
Anglican church music
While music is important within many types of Anglican service, it forms a prominent part of choral Mattins and Evensong.

The Great Man's Lady is a 1942 American Western film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. It is based on the short story "The Human Side" by Viña Delmar.
It was filmed at two locations in Thousand Oaks, California: Joel McCrea Ranch and nearby Moorpark Road.
Plot
A statue is being dedicated to the late founder of Hoyt City, and reporters from around the country have gathered, speculating that "the old lady's going to talk." When the anticipated "old lady" does not appear at the event, they rush to her home. She is centenarian, Hannah Sempler Hoyt, who lives in an old mansion among the skyscrapers of Hoyt City. As she confronts the press who have barged in, a photographer says, "Hold it, Mrs. Hoyt!" She replies that her name is Hannah Sempler, and refuses to answer their questions as to whether she and Hoyt had been married, which as another reporter says, would make him a bigamist. The intruders leave, having learned nothing to prove or disprove the many rumors, but Hannah is persuaded to tell her story to a young female biographer who lags behind. She reminisces about her experiences with Ethan Hoyt in the American West.
In 1848, a teenaged Hannah Sempler is squired by her wealthy father's associate, Mr. Cadwallader, but she is not interested. Hannah meets and flirts with a young pioneer and dreamer, Ethan Hoyt, who comes to her home seeking financial backing from her father in order to build a city in the western wilderness. Her father rejects Ethan's proposal, stating that it is too risky. Hannah, however, falls in love with the young man, and quite impulsively, they elope and head west. The first years of their marriage are not easy, but the couple are happy. When Ethan loses all his money and possessions in a drunken gambling spree to Steely Edwards, Hannah wins back his losses and befriends Steely, who accompanies the couple to Sacramento, California, where they hope to strike it rich mining.
In Sacramento, Hannah and Ethan spend less time together, with Ethan working long hours in the mines. One day, Hannah discovers silver on Ethan's boots, carried from the Virginia City mine where he had been working. Hannah knows she is pregnant, but does not reveal this to Ethan, knowing he would never leave her behind in that condition. Instead she encourages Ethan to go to Virginia City and find his fortune in the silver mines. Thinking Hannah wants him gone so she can be with Steely, Ethan leaves her with no intention of returning.
After he leaves for Virginia City, the friendship between Hannah and Steely grows. Steely looks after Hannah and her twin babies. When Sacramento is threatened by torrential flooding, Hannah plans to travel to San Francisco. But knowing that Hannah still loves Ethan, Steely arranges for her to travel by coach to Virginia City to be with her husband—he will go to San Francisco alone. As the coach crosses a bridge near Sacramento, the river overflows and washes away the coach and its passengers. Hannah survives, but the babies perish.
After burying the twins, and believing that Hannah is also dead, Steely travels to Virginia City to tell Ethan the tragic news. It has been years since they've seen or spoken, and by now Ethan has become a wealthy man. When Steely tells him that Hannah is dead, Ethan shoots him, saying, "He killed my wife." Thinking that Hannah and Steely are now dead—Steely actually survives the shooting—Ethan continues his dream of building a great city.
Steely returns to Sacramento and discovers that Hannah is still alive. He tells her that Ethan, who believes she is dead, has married another woman. Steely and Hannah move to San Francisco and open a gambling casino. Years later, Hannah's father visits her and urges her to "disappear" so as not to threaten the political future of Ethan Hoyt, who is now representing her father's railroad interests. Hannah refuses her father's request, and travels to Hoyt City, where she watches Ethan giving a political speech. No longer a champion of the people as he once dreamed of becoming, Ethan is now a man of wealth and power, participating in corrupt practices to achieve private goals. Ethan sees Hannah in the crowd and they meet. She tells him that she had divorced him, knowing his political future would be ruined by scandal if it were known they were still married. She reminds him of the dreamer he once was. He goes off with a renewed idealism, devoting the rest of his life to helping the less fortunate, even at his own expense.
The story concludes as it started, with the aged Hannah and the young female biographer discussing Ethan Hoyt, standing beneath the impressive statue. Hannah has been alone for many years now. Steely died in the 1906 San Francisco fire, the same year that Ethan returned to Hoyt City, to die in Hannah's mansion. No one knew why he chose to do this, and for some thirty more years Hannah has remained silent about their marriage. The biographer now realizes the profound role that Hannah played in Ethan's life and success, and in the founding of this now great city. Also aware of Ethan's mythic reputation, she kisses Hannah sweetly, saying, "I'm kissing my biography [of Ethan] goodbye." Before Hanna leaves the statue, the old woman tears up the marriage certificate she has kept all these years, saying of his myth, and perhaps their relationship, "Forever, Ethan. Now no one can change it. Forever."
