Posted to: Downtown, Occupy Wall Street
In its last-ditch fight to stay on the New Haven Green, Occupy New Haven brought in a medicine man from the tribe that occupied the land before the Puritans.
Medicine Man Fox Running (pictured above) told their new friends Sunday that in their view, the fight's already lost. They advised them to pick up their tents and buy some land elsewhere. They also offered a history lesson that fueled their case questioning the Green's ownership.
Meanwhile, occupiers are trying to enlist another Quinnipiac, the tribe's sachem, Iron Thunderhorse, to join them in their legal battle against the city.
Iron Thunderhorse won't be able to make it to Wednesday's possible showdown over whether Occupy New Haven can remain on the Green, though.  They are in prison in Texas on rape and kidnapping charges.
Gordon Fox Running Brainerd, a 77-year-old Branford man who's a Bear Clan medicine chief in the Quinnipiac tribe, showed up at Occupy New Haven's embattled encampment on the Green Sunday afternoon for a teach-in on Native American history.
The land belongs to everyone, Fox Running told a group of two dozen occupiers under a tarp canopy in the camp's central compound.
Unfortunately, modern society doesn't recognize that fact, they said. As it is, your best bet is to pool your money and get some private property of your own, they said.
Fox Running said he's not picking a side in the battle of Occupy vs. the City. The five-month-old occupation is the last standing New England outpost of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which swept the nation last fall with a message of opposition to corporate greed, income inequality and money in politics. It's been fighting to keep its spot on the Green amid city efforts to remove it.
Nearly two weeks ago, a last-minute legal appeal forestalled the removal of Occupy New Haven and raised the question of to whom the Green really belongs. The people of New Haven? The Proprietors of the Green, a self-perpetuating private body descended from the colony's founding Puritans? Or, as occupiers are now asking, does it belong to Connecticut's “original peoples”—the Native Americans?
They won a temporary victory on March 14, when a federal judge issued a two-week restraining order enjoining the city from removing them.
The court victory came through the efforts of attorney Norm Pattis, who filed a complaint on behalf of eight occupiers. As part of their legal work, Pattis has been delving into the history of the Green and the Proprietors of the Green, the central square's technical owners. Part of Pattis' complaint challenges the very existence of the group, which formed in the 17th century. The matter will be taken up in federal court in New Haven on Wednesday.
In the meantime, the challenge to the proprietors' authority has inspired some occupiers to take the matter even further.
“We've decided to try to return the land to the native peoples,” said occupier Ben Aubin. “Through speaking about the Green, we realized we're entering into a decolonization campaign.”
Occupier Tommy Doomsday acknowledged that if occupiers are successful in handing the Green back to the descendants of indigenous people, it will mean Occupy has to leave too.
That's fine, they said. “We're going to get kicked off here one way or another.”
Occupy New Haven is looking to form alliances with Native Americans in the state, who may have a firmer claim on the Green than the Proprietors do, Aubin said. “We're reaching out to all original peoples of Connecticut.”
As a result of that effort, Fox Running arrived at the Green Sunday. Wearing traditional “regalia,” the mustached man took a seat on a plush red couch in front of an upside-down American flag. Two dozen occupiers, on folding chairs and milk crates, gathered around.
Chicken Fat In A Bonfire
Fox Running began with a history lesson on the interaction between the indigenous people of “Turtle Island” (now known as North America) and the European colonizers. Waves of disease in the 1600s wiped out the majority of the native peoples of Connecticut, which “made it easier for Europeans to come here and occupy land,” they said.
Europeans made treaties with the local tribes, and “purchased” land from them, concepts that the indigenous people did not understand, Fox Running said. “They had no concept that you could own land.”
According to histories of New Haven, English settlers made a real estate transaction with the Quinnipiac in 1638.
As Edward Atwater writes in their “History of the Colony of New Haven to its absorption into Connecticut,” “Momaugin the Indian Sachem of Quinnipiac” and their tribesmen were weakened by disease and had observed the benefits of living with the English settlers since their arrival in April of that year. “Which with all thankfulness they now acknowledged, they jointly and freely gave and yielded up all their right, title and interest to all the land, rivers, ponds, and trees with all the liberties and appurtenances belonging unto the same in Quinnipiac to the utmost of their bounds east, west, north, south, unto Theophilus Eaton, John Davenport and others, the present English planters there and to their heirs and assigns forever.”
The Quinnipiac were given some 1,200 acres as a reservation, which was gradually whittled away by the Europeans. They were finally coerced to move to Waterbury, where the land was sold out from under them, Fox Running said. “Many of my ancestors scattered.” They remain scattered today, they said.
Fox Running then spoke about the dangers of modern society's obsession with technology and its destruction of the planet. They warned about the dangers of overpopulation and global warming; they predicted New Haven will be underwater in 50 years.
Occupier Don Montano asked Fox Running about the idea of occupiers going to Ft. Nathan Hale—the site of the original Quinnipac reservation—and “re-occupying the land.”
“I think you have about as much chance of that as a piece of chicken fat in a bonfire,” Fox Running said.
Occupier Aubin said some occupiers are thinking of “returning to the land.” They asked for advice on how to proceed with a “vision quest.”
“We'd like, for a little while, to maybe live as Quinnipiac,” said occupier Ty Hailey.
That requires respect and gratitude for the land and its gifts, Fox Running said.
“If you're going to do this in a native fashion…” they began, as a PVC tarp support-post suddenly slipped off its chair-milk-crate-cinderblock platform and nearly clocked an occupier on the head.
“Make sure you put your house together properly,” finished Norm Clement, a confederate member of the Quinnipiac sitting next to Fox Running.
Fox Running ended the meeting by standing and offering a prayer.
“Grandfather,” they began.
“Mother!” interrupted occupier Sara Gregory with a shout.
“Sara!” other occupiers groaned.
Fox Running continued with their prayer for guidance for “these young people,” to help them “out of the rut” they're in.
Outside the tent, Fox Running was asked what they think about the Occupy movement.
“I never really got a good sense on what the premise behind this is,” they said.
As for their thoughts on Occupy's right to continue to camp on the Green, Fox Running articulated a position nearly identical to that of the city.
“This Green is supposed to be for public use,” but it can't be used by the general public because Occupy is here, they said.
Fox Running said they don't yet have a clear opinion on whether or not Occupy should be allowed to continue to stay on the Green. “My answer to you is a question: What is your goal in occupying this land?”
“Get out of the damn city,” they said to Hailey. “Get together all your quarters and go out and buy a piece of land in the countryside somewhere. How else are you going to get a piece of land to occupy?”
Fox Running lit up a USA Gold cigarette. They said he's sure Occupy doesn't stand a chance of holding onto the Green.
“I think the powers are going to prevail, unfortunately,” they said. “History tells the tale, doesn't it?”
Paging Iron Thunderhorse
Clement (pictured) respectfully disagreed with Running Fox. Clement said he's a Penobscott from Maine. They were given the name Momowetu by Quinnipiac sachem Iron Thunderhorse, who made them a confederate member of the tribe.
Indigenous people have a 500-year history of resistance, they said. Buying land is not the way out, because the government can take the land anyway, through eminent domain, Clement said.
“You have to fight the system, and that's what Occupy is all about,” they said.
Clement said they have been working on contacting Iron Thunderhorse—in prison in Texas—through the sachem's wife, Little Owl, who lives in Indiana. Clement said he's looking into the possibility of Iron Thunderhorse getting involved as a party to Occupy's legal action against the city and the Proprietors.
Irving Pinsky, a lawyer who represents Occupy, said they hope to speak with Iron Thunderhorse on Monday.
Iron Thunderhorse's wife, Little Owl, responded to an email from the Independent on Monday.
Occupy has already connected with at least one other local Native American leader. Aubin said the group has been talking with Aurelius Piper, the Peace Chief of the Golden Hill Paugussetts. The tribe has a rich history of attempts to re-claim lands allegedly illegally taken from them, including claims to land in more than a dozen towns in Connecticut, from Westport to Branford.
Aubin said he's hoping to have Native Americans join occupiers on Wednesday as they face the threat of possible removal from the Green, depending on the outcome of that day's court hearing.
“I support the Occupy New Haven movement,” Chief Piper said in a phone conversation. “They are actually standing up for the indigenous tribes in this area. They're speaking up for us.”
As for joining the occupation this week, however, Piper was non-committal. “I made no plans to be anywhere at any particular time.”
“Coates” And “Alcumy Spoons”
City Chief Administrative Officer Rob Smuts had no comment on the question of Proprietors versus Indians. Head Proprietor Drew Days did not respond to a request for comment.
Attorney Pattis weighed in on Friday. “When I was a kid, I was taught that Manhattan was turned over to settlers for $24 of trinkets,” they said. It sounds like New Haven was transferred the same way, they continued. “We've got another case of unjust enrichment in our midst.”
In a March 18 post on their blog, Pattis wrote that their research found that land that is now New Haven was purchased from the natives for “twelve coates of English Trucking cloath, twelve alcumy spoons, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, two dozen of knives, twelve porengers & foure cases of French knives and sizers.”
In that post, Pattis agrees with Fox Running's statement that the Indians didn't have the same understanding of the transaction as the English did. “Go ahead, a native American might have thought, give me some warm clothes and knives, and I will sign your paper: do you really think that a piece of paper can transform land given to all into yours alone? I suspect some Indians thought the Europeans fools, much as we would if a man were to give us a car in exchange for our promise that they would never die. Some promises are essentially meaningless.”
The post concludes, “Perhaps the folks occupying the Green can take up a clothing drive. Let them collect old coats and kitchen utensils. Make a big stack of these items on the Green and then offer the Proprietors the items in exchange for the land. Absurd, you say? No less so than claiming that title so acquired almost 400 years ago vests in a group now asserting ownership in what everyone regards as a public space. Or do acts of unjust enrichment and what amounts to thievery flow in one direction only?”
“Can somebody challenge a 1649 land purchase?” they asked. It's an interesting question, but not one they intend to raise before the court on Wednesday, Pattis said.
However, if any Native Americans want to secure legal counsel, “they're welcome to join the pow-wow,” they said.
So, does the Green belong to the city, the Proprietors, the occupiers, or the Native Americans?
“Who knows whose Green it is?” Pattis said. To settle that very question, he's raised a “quiet title action” that he'd like to have considered by the state Supreme Court. They hope to settle the issue of ownership of a piece of land, and thus quiet any challenges.
The question again goes back hundreds of years. In 1810, the state legislature recognized the Proprietors of the Green. But, Pattis said, the state constitution adopted in 1818, some portions of which are still in effect, “prohibits the granting of hereditary title.” It states, in Article 1, Section 20, that “No hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors, shall ever be granted, or conferred in this state.”
The question then, is if self-selected perpetuation of the members of Proprietors of the Green amounts to hereditary title, Pattis said. “We want it to get the state Supreme Court.”
It's not right that a private body can tell people what to do on land that's enjoyed by the public, Pattis said. It's like if “Skull and Bones” said everyone had to eat Chinese food on Wednesdays, they said.
In a Sunday blog post, Pattis writes that the New Haven's “first official act” was to execute a Native American named Nepaupuck for the crime of murder and then place their severed head on the Green.
UPDATE: Facebook's iPad App has arrived.
—-
Facebook will launch its long-awaited iPad app at Apple's iPhone 5 launch event on Oct. 4, Mashable has learned. In addition to the iPad app, Facebook is also expected to release a revamped version of its iPhone app and may unveil an HTML5-based mobile app marketplace.
The Facebook iPad app, which leaked earlier this year, has been in limbo at Facebook for the past few months. That much was made clear in a blog post Monday by former Facebook engineer Jeff Verkoeyen. In that post, they revealed that they left the company (for Google) partially because Facebook has been sitting on the completed app since May.
The problem, according to two sources familiar with the situation, has been a combination of timing and a strained relationship with Apple. It's no secret that the two companies have been at odds over various issues during the past two years. For example, the social network pulled the plug on Facebook Connect in Ping because Apple didn't give Facebook any warning about the feature, which would have eaten a great deal of bandwidth on Facebook's side.
We've also heard rumors that Facebook was supposed to be integrated into iOS. This was meant to happen years ago, but disagreements on both sides eventually led to Apple integrating Twitter into iOS 5.
The relationship between the two technology giants is warming up, however, thanks to the shared goal of beating Google — and the simple fact that Facebook and Apple may need each other. The former doesn't have a mobile platform while Apple doesn't have a social platform. The culmination of this renewed friendship: the launch of Facebook for iPad at Apple's iPhone 5 media event.
At this event, our sources also expect Facebook to unveil a new version of Facebook for the iPhone, with design and speed improvements that mimic the iPad app.
Facebook has also been working on a project to bring the Facebook Platform to mobile devices. The project, labeled "Project Spartan" by some (a name not used internally at Facebook, according to one of our sources), is designed to be a platform where developers can bring their Facebook apps to mobile devices via an HTML5 platform.
What we're hearing is that Apple is actually working with Facebook on perfecting the HTML5 platform. This could also launch at Apple's upcoming iPhone event, though our sources wouldn't commit to a specific launch date for the platform. Facebook decided not to launch it at f8, as it didn't want to water down the announcement of the new Facebook Open Graph and Timeline.
When we said last week that Facebook would be profoundly changed, we weren't just referring to the new Facebook Open Graph and the "frictionless sharing" touted by Mark Zuckerberg. We were also talking about its secretive effort to become a mobile platform for the social web. And thanks to Apple, it looks like that effort is about to come to fruition.
We've reached out to Apple and Facebook for comment.

Facebook for iPad: Leaked Screenshots
Here are the leaked screenshots of the Facebook for iPad app, from earlier this year:
Arkansas is one of the worst places to be a renter in America. It is the only state in the US where tenants are treated as criminals for paying rent late and landlords are not required by law to maintain their properties. Its failure-to-vacate law lets landlords give tenants a 10-day eviction notice if they are even one day overdue. Tenants who can't or won't leave within that span face fines for every day they remain on the property and up to 90 days in jail. This makes things difficult for the third of Arkansas's residents who are renters and have legitimate concerns about the properties they are occupying.
The combination of failure-to-vacate and the lack of warranty of habitability make it almost impossible for tenants to challenge their landlords for legitimate reasons. It's estimated that criminal evictions occur everyday in Arkansas, resulting in over 2000 failure-to-vacate cases being filed each year.
VICE News visited Arkansas to learn more about its draconian eviction laws. From the courthouses to the porches of some of the state's poorest residents, we documented first-hand accounts from one of the country's most underreported stories.

There wasn't any time or appetite for airing the left's frustrations with the president. Wis. shadow hangs over Netroots
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Last year, the liberal Netroots unleashed their ire on President Barack Obama for short-shrifting the progressive causes they thought he'd champion in the White House. This year, they had a more pressing matter on their minds: a fear that Republicans, backed by the boatloads of cash that helped Scott Walker win in Wisconsin, could make even more gains up and down the ticket — and perhaps even beat Obama in November.
There wasn't any time or appetite for airing the left's frustrations with the president. Instead, the conversation at the three-day Netroots Nation conference centered around the recent Wisconsin recall election — and what it means to November.
Story Continued Below
Both in panel discussions and in conversations in the halls of the Rhode Island Convention Center, GOP Gov. Walker's victory provided the backdrop for a gathering of progressives shocked into attention, not just by the outcome of the nationally watched Wisconsin race but also by the role that outside money played in it.
( Also on POLITICO: VIDEO: Netroots Nation 2012)
“The general temperature here is much less energized than it was last year. It's sobered,” said Robert Borosage, who heads the progressive Campaign for America's Future. “We now know [the right] will have money the likes of which we have never seen.”
Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the influential liberal blog Daily Kos, explained the mood as one of determination after an eye-opening experience.
“When you spend that kind of money, you put your finger on the scale. So yeah, it's going to be a problem,” they said. “We realize our foe is well-organized, insanely well-funded and committed. We'll just have to do the same.”
The urgency of the discussion over campaign spending was reflected at one of the gathering's best attended events: a panel on the Citizens United court ruling and super PACs that featured three United States senators: Sheldon Whitehouse, Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley.
The Walker victory proved especially stinging in part because of the particular evolution of the Netroots. Now roughly a decade or so old — Daily Kos is celebrating its 10th anniversary — the liberal blogosphere and organized labor now operate as an almost seamless political entity that fights and bleeds together.
“At first, we hated each other. We looked at them as dinosaurs and asked, ‘What have they done lately?' They looked at us as dorks with computers and asked, ‘What are they going to do, hit George W. Bush over the head with a laptop?'” explained Moulitsas. “Not only has that animosity disappeared, but the lines have blurred…A loss for labor is a loss for the Netroots.”
If Tuesday's Wisconsin election set off the alarms on the prospect of getting dramatically outspent in races up and down the ballot, it also introduced a once-unthinkable idea: that President Obama actually has a real fight on their hands in November.
The size of Obama's 2008 victory, the uneven course of the GOP presidential primary season and Mitt Romney's inability to generate much enthusiasm among conservatives left many progressives under the impression that the president's re-election was all but certain.
For many on the left, that impression changed Tuesday night.
I've never understood Radiohead.
Maybe I'm a little too young; this album made its rounds in 1997 and a lot of my teenage musical preferences came from 1999 onward. Although, this would only be an acceptable explanation if Radiohead hadn't proceeded to make hit records for the two decades that followed.
Maybe it was simply a matter of taste. My idea of cool at the time involved much heavier guitars and much ruder lyrics. Perhaps they just weren't badass enough, floating by undetected while I was occupied with other things. But even this explanation serves only to explain why Radiohead didn't appeal to me when I was young. Why can't I care about them to this day?
This is my attempt to care. After polling some Radiohead-friendly peers with the question of “What's the best album to introduce to a layperson?” the answer unanimously came back OK Computer. After a quick trip to my local HMV (rest in peace) I picked up a copy and proceeded to exert the most effort I have to date into becoming a Radiohead fan. I think I've come a long way, but there's still work to do.
The packaging is great. The album is held in a gatefold jacket, as all double LP albums should be. Lyrics are printed inside the fold in a messy, disorienting fashion that is typical of Radiohead artwork. The records are held in individual custom sleeves with album art on both sides. I love this! Often with the gatefold format the records are held in plain white sleeves; there's plenty of room for artwork in the fold after all. With the artful sleeves you're left with plenty to look through while your album is playing. It gives the album the feeling of having gone the extra mile and not cheaping out on the cost of production.
The album is pressed on two 180g vinyl discs, which I've snobbishly come to hope for and love in a record. You could throw this disc through a window. I've said in previous entries how much I hate flimsy records, and this record has some serious weight to it. (Note to the listener: The sides are labeled “eeny, meeny, miney, mo” instead of “A, B, C, D”. Of course Radiohead makes you solve a puzzle in order to listen to their record.)
As far as the music goes, Radiohead is Radiohead. I used to find the large dissonant chunks that can be found peppered through the album offputting; I'm able to enjoy it now, but it takes some focus. To its credit, I find myself frequently having the thought “how did they make that sound?” which is great fun, and an experience I wouldn't have had at a younger age. On average I still don't find myself having the gut feeling that comes with listening to music you love, but I am able to have a better understanding of why it appeals to others.
Airbag
One thing that I didn't expect myself to walk away from this album saying is “I love the bass player”. This song is an obvious example to draw from straight out of the gate, but it persists throughout the album. It's further out in front of the mix than one would usually expect and oddly sparse, serving more as a lead instrument than as a tool for keeping rhythm. As a whole it's is mixed in a way that I want to dislike, but damn, they made it work.
This song is also full of the asupervisorstioned dissonance that instinctively turns me off. Again: I get it, and when I concentrate I can see the value, but it doesn't come naturally to me.
Paranoid Android
There's that iconic acoustic/clean electric guitar intro. It's one of those songs I've heard a million times and haven't necessarily put a title to. I'm sure the idea of not being intimately familiar with Paranoid Android is making some Radiohead fans cringe, but hey, we all miss the boat on something.
Honestly, the meandering falsetto vocals are not something I naturally fall in love with either, which stands as an obvious roadblock in my learning to love Radiohead. It fits in the context and sounds great; my intent is not to say that it should have been performed differently, I'm just saying that it doesn't give me the warm tinglies that other styles do.
Overall though this is a great song that does a lot of cool stuff. The brief switches to 7/8 time in the musical interludes appeals to the music nerd part of me that enjoys the “I see what you did there” element of music. It keeps things interesting and messes with your expectations, which is satisfying in a time where so much music can feel cookie-cutter.
Karma Police
Oh! Oh! I know this one! This is the song that I knew before I started this exercise!
That said, I think there are plenty of songs on this album that outshine Karma Police, which suggests to me that my Radiohead experiment is at least a partial success. It's no surprise that this song stood out as the single though; it's easily the most radio-friendly on the record. The bass player I learned to love so much is uncharacteristically tame, and the piano is tasteful as hell. This will always remain a good pub sing-along song, while making sure to have a weirdass ending to remind you who wrote it.
The Tourist
The amount of fuzz Radiohead uses betrays my memory, which is strange because it stands out so strongly against the softer brushed cymbals and snare that dominate much of the rest of the sound. You wouldn't think the sounds would compliment each other well at all, but somehow they come together.
I absolutely LOVE how this song, and therefore this album, ends with a bell. The first time I heard it I was lying around, having just listened to the songs preceding it, not actively aware of how long I'd been listening. When the bell chimed, I jumped up and thought “That's amazing! Pleeease say it's the last song!” There's just something so tasteful and punctuating about it. It says “That's it for us folks, thanks for listening” in a single note.
So would I call my Radiohead experiment a success? Ehhhh I dunno. I've definitely gained an appreciation for the band and have a better understanding as to why they are so widely loved. Objectively this is a phenomenal album full of unique nuances for music nerds to drool over. Any characteristic I find that conflicts with my personal taste can be easily defended by someone whose taste it matches.
The thing it lacks for me is that ineffable quality that makes the listener's arm hairs stand up. I attribute this entirely to personal taste as I can't find something more tangible to point to. I would still recommend this band to anyone whose tastes seem to trend in this direction (buy it here , or here for Canada ), but unfortunately I don't think Radiohead has earned a new super-fan as a result of this exercise.
And with that, another vinyl review is put to bed! I definitely learned something with this review, and I hope to address more bands that have fallen through the cracks in my periphery over the years.
My next review however will be no such band. I'll be taking on California, the latest installment by Blink 182, and their first record since the departure of singer/guitarist Tom Delonge. Released last summer, I think enough time has passed to fairly compare this album to the rest of the band's catalog, and to see how well the band performs with its new lineup.
I hope you're enjoying the reviews so far and I hope you keep checking back! I've got plenty of records in queue for review and plan on keeping them coming.
Until next time, I'm Not Your Dad.
When they responded in January to the massacre of 20 schoolchildren and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, US President Barack Obama issued 23 orders aiming to address the US epidemic of gun violence — including one directing the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to re-start gun research, which has languished since 1996.
The CDC, in turn, asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM), a branch of the National Academies, to recommend a gun-research agenda. Today, the IOM delivered its recommendations.
The committee that wrote the 69-page report — chaired by Alan Leshner, the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science — was asked to examine five areas: the characteristics of firearm violence; risk factors and preventive factors; interventions and strategies; gun-safety technology; and the influence of video games and other media.
The panel generated a long list of questions that it said could be pursued. They include whether point-of-purchase background checks actually deter people who are forbidden from owning firearms from getting hold of them, and how effective current policies and laws are at preventing gun sales to people with specific psychiatric diagnoses.
The report suggests a study to determine whether specific safety technologies, such as iris scans and gun-activating magnetic-stripe badges, actually reduce gun injuries and fatalities — and, if they are effective, why they work. And it calls for a look at whether there is a relationship between long-term exposure to media violence and subsequent firearm-related violence. Existing studies on media and video games veer to the short term, it notes, and few of them are specific to gun violence.
The breadth and depth of the unanswered questions point glaringly to how little is known on a huge range of issues, as Nature recently noted in this profile of firearms researcher Garen Wintemute. But funding for studies on even a fraction of the questions the IOM proposes is likely to be limited in a very tight government budget environment.
Obama asked Congress to provide US$10 million in new funds to the CDC next year to begin the research, but it is far from clear that Capitol Hill will oblige. If not, the CDC — which is already confronting a proposed $216-million cut in its congressional budget next year, and an additional 5% across-the-board chop known as sequestration — will have to cut one or more of its other programmes to produce the money.
The IOM committee was not asked to weigh in on funding questions, but it left little doubt where it stands on the value of the research it recommends. “In the absence of this research, policymakers will be left to debate controversial policies without scientifically sound evidence about their potential effects,” they write.
In an e-mailed statement, the CDC said that it “thanks the IOM for developing the report in a timely manner and looks forward to reviewing the report”.
Palmer Luckey, the co-founder of Oculus VR and creator of the Oculus Rift, somewhat unsurprisingly, is a fully paid-up member of the PC Master Race.
During a recent Reddit AMA Luckey was asked about the hardware specs of their PC. The first part of their response was to be expected, and probably straight out of the company's PR playbook:
I have lived on the bleeding edge of PC hardware for as long as I could scrape the money together, but for VR, I am sticking to hardware that sticks to our recommended specs: https://www.oculus.com/en-us/oculus-ready-pcs/ That way, I get the same experience as most of my customers. I don't want to become disconnected from the reality of how our hardware and software performs.
On the side, though, Luckey is working on something just a little bit more exciting:
As far as traditional gaming, though… I am currently working on a new PC that people might find pretty interesting. I have experimented with liquid nitrogen cooling in the past, but it is a huge pain to work with in any kind of daily use, and can also be dangerous. My new project is a very small super-powerful PC with no heatsinks and no fans - it is cooled by liquid propane, boiled into gaseous propane in an expansion block. From there, I can either compress back into a tank under high pressure, or vent out of a burner nozzle for supercooling to subzero temps. If I had more time, I would vent the propane to a small turbine generator hooked up to the PSU, but I can't justify that kind of work right now.
In other words, it sounds like Luckey is building some kind of recirculating single-stage phase-change cooling system. There are a few commercial systems that Luckey might opt to use, or maybe he's building their own. Propane's boiling point is -42 degrees Celsius (°C), and a good single-stage phase-change system can cool a bunch of CPUs and GPUs down to around -40°C—plenty of headroom for the monstrous overclocking that is surely required to play games on the Oculus Rift.
The second step—using the boiled propane to turn a turbine that powers their PC—is a little more outlandish. Phase-change cooling is de rigueur for enthusiast overclockers; driving a tiny turbine, though... I don't think I've ever seen a build like that.
The rest of the Reddit AMA seems mostly focused on placating and educating what will probably be the Oculus Rift's key market: hardcore PC gamers. Luckey wrote about the topic of "Oculus Exclusive" games; the disparity between the £250 hype and the £500 reality of the Rift headset; some information on Oculus VR's relationship with game devs; and, most importantly, they shared a photo of their current desktop PC setup.
There was an article I read in The Spur fanzine many years ago that spoke about the rivalry between Spurs and Arsenal being the purest of all the derby games. The essence of this thought is that the clash is solely about football. No landlord disputes where one local club is birthed from another. No political undertones or employment grievances. No religion or social class wars to add complexities to something that should really play out with simplicity.
Tottenham Hotspur hate Arsenal because they are Arsenal and we hate them because history fuels us to do so. They hate us too. Although as I'm unable to place myself in the mind of a gooner (something not too dissimilar to losing your individuality and humanity and becoming part of a collective dystopian conciousness masquerading as utopia) I can only imagine their hatred is one of insecurity and self-loathing because everything they've ever done has happened without soul. The one they momentarily owned, they took off us.
You might suggest that there's a geographical reason for the dislike – much like local towns or cites that sit near to each other. That's always going to play a part but that connection that ignites true rivalry has to go beyond a couple of postcodes. West Ham United aren't that far off from our patch but along with the likes of Chelsea they are both afterthoughts compared to the neighbours up the road with the ghastly red and white scarves and narcissistic statues.
This is a football club that died and was resuscitated by the ills of bribery and corruption
I've been here before. I've written about ‘the history' and many like to point out that something that happened in the last century should no longer be relevant. Along with the suggestion that modern day supporters should not be made accountable for chapters in a club past that have been practically lost in the depths of football folklore. Time does that. It devalues the importance of an event or incident simply because we do not have a connection to it. It belongs to a forgotten generation.
New generations of supporters will not care for these original building blocks because their club is now built on more recent memories.
Does that mean the folklore it's null and void?
It doesn't.
The folklore remains factual. They began life as Woolwich, playing next to a sewage works in Plumstead. Yes, I'm referring to how they should have gone out of existence. Yes, I'm referring to their desperate attempt to merge with Fulham or settle anywhere they could. This is a football club that died and was resuscitated by the ills of bribery and corruption. The birth of the truly definitive franchise, an opportunity to make money because the legacy of its former self could never be reborn in its rightful home in South London.
Now none of this, you might dare to argue, has a thing to do with the actual football. It's a business that crafted a new identity bang in the heart land of another club that presided there already. The fix that saw Arsenal promoted into the top flight above others more worthy was shambolically transparent. Add to it the assimilation of this brand-new lease of life in North London that saw Gillespie Road renamed and locals turning up to see the new team. Locals that would have frequented other local clubs prior to the new arrival.
Football was still in its infancy. A number of clubs moved location, changed their name. But this drastically? With such emphasis on the necessity to make money? Woolwich Arsenal no longer exist and in some way I don't have a problem with that football club. They died in their grave only for greed to dig them back up out of the ground, reanimating through the bloodline of pestilence. A zombie creation, reaching out to take a bite out of anything that moved until finally spreading their disease at the other end of the Seven Sisters.
The new club retained half its name and the core if its immediate future fan-base would be the only supporters that could possibly gravitate towards them. Supporters with no identity. No soul. The walking dead.
They died in their grave only for greed to dig them back up out of the ground, reanimating through the bloodline of pestilence
Fast-track and you'll see these foundations have dominated their culture since those supposedly insignificant events. Their mental fragility. For years accepting of boring mundane football worshipping the result above the performance. The Fever Pitch generation. The broken children that were so blessed with the transformation of the clubs style and on the field philosophy they still haven't realised that Arsene Wenger has redefined them into caricatures of themselves – from the players mindset to those in the stands. An army of supporters so obsessed with how they are perceived to the outside because they're forever seeking validation.
You'll still ask what any of this has got to do with football. Why is it the purest of derby games? I've answered that already. Read it all back.
It's because a football club is the supporter.
Today where the modern fan is often treated like a customer reference number, we can only focus on the representatives of any given opposing side. With Arsenal, their supporters – even those that don't have a memory for anything that happened before Wenger – they remain the personification of all their misgivings.
We're Tottenham because hating them is an absolutely unavoidable trait programmed deep in our DNA. We are proud of the hatred. We relish it
This is about football because there is no religion or social class or political agendas. It's about football because football is tribal and we know who we are and what makes us Tottenham. We're Tottenham because hating them is an absolutely unavoidable trait programmed deep in our DNA. We are proud of the hatred. We relish it. It's all encompassing and more so because so many of them belittle the rivalry with patronising slaps of the back.
It's about the football because the only genuine validity that Arsenal supporters have that allows them to embrace the delicate emotive fabric of identity only exists because they have no choice to hate us back. Without that they have nothing. They are nothing.
Had Woolwich Arsenal been left six feet under, we'd still be singing North London is Ours. They only sing today because of the club at the other end of the Seven Sisters.
Amir Khan: Has accused Brook of disrespect
Amir Khan has admitted they want to silence Kell Brook after the IBF champion called them out following their stoppage win over Jo Jo Dan.
The Sheffield man made an impressive first defence of their welterweight title on Saturday night, flooring their mandatory challenger four times on the way to a fourth-round stoppage win.
In the post-fight interview, Brook demanded a summer showdown against their British rival Khan, with promoter Eddie Hearn putting forward a possible date at Wembley Stadium.

Khan appears to have been angered by this latest challenge, accusing Brook of ‘disrespect' and insists they need to enhance their reputation before the fight can be made.
“He's only beaten one good fighter - [Shawn] Porter,” Khan told ESPN. “He needs some good wins against the likes of [Brandon] Rios, [Juan Manuel] Marquez, [Keith] Thurman, [Marcos] Maidana and the fight will be even bigger.
“I'd love to shut them up. Why give someone a payday when they constantly disrespect you all the time? The fight will happen when it's meant to happen. Before the fight they said I bring nothing to the table, no title and they don't need to fight me as he's the champion. Now he's calling me out.”
But the Bolton man seemed to make a U-turn when asked about the financial rewards on offer for another major domestic clash.
Leaving the door open for a battle with Brook, they said: “I agree - will start the talks.”
Local News, Pets & Animal, Nature & Weather

Since noise guns and dogs have not worked to rid North Hempstead of Canada geese, the town is moving to have the local geese population euthanized and the birds' meat sent to local pantries.
Canada geese are a nuisance in many parts of Long Island, but one particular town has proposed a final and controversial measure for ridding the area of geese.
After trying noise guns and dogs to scare off the invasive species of goose, North Hempstead officials have decided that the best way to get rid of the geese would be to euthanize the local population.
The most prevalent complaint from the residents of North Hempstead regarding the approximately 600 geese that have settled in the town is that the geese take over areas and dirty parks, sports fields, and waters with their droppings.
"Noise guns and dogs -- it treats the symptoms, but not the problem," said Kevin Kelly, the town's deputy commissioner of parks and recreation in a comment to Newsday. "The only way you can really remove geese from your parks and fields, especially now when they're coming in epidemic proportions, is to literally remove them."
Though the town board has approved the plan, wildlife specialists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture must first survey the parks of North Hempstead to make sure that the town has tried other measures to remove the geese before resorting to euthanasia. If the USDA decides that North Hempstead officials have done all that they could to attempt to get rid of the geese, they will permit the town to use carbon dioxide gas to put down the Canada geese.
After euthanizing the geese, the birds will be processed and the meat will be sent to local food pantries.
If approved by the USDA, the euthanizing will be handled by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wildlife Services. The town will pay them $8,602.71 for the service, and an extra $6 per goose for the cost of processing its meat.
Local activists are attempting to halt the plan as they call for more humane methods used to discourage geese from settling in the area.
“There is no scientific basis that geese dropping pose a threat to human health,” writes GooseWatch NYC, an advocacy group that is opposed to the roundup and extermination of Canada geese, in a Change.org petition against North Hempstead's plan. “Killing the geese is counter to public opinion, not how the residents of North Hempstead want tax dollars spent, and a horrid example for children to whom we teach tolerance and co-existence with wildlife.”
They add, “Killing the geese is not an effective solution, and will only clear the area temporarily as other geese will repopulate the vacant desirable habitat.”
The Washington Post‘s Anup Kahle caught our attention today when they tweeted:
Malala appeared on several American TV shows. But hardly anyone discussed Zubair and their sister's story. #drones pic.twitter.com/dobytEhOYl — Anup Kaphle (@AnupKaphle) October 30, 2013
In case you missed it, nine-year-old Nabeela, along with their brother Zubair and father Rafiq Rehman, testified before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday about how a drone missile zeroed in on the kids' grandmother in their village in North Waziristan, Pakistan, threw their 20 feet, and killed them Nabeela and Zubair, in addition to other children suffered serious injuries and were taken to a nearby hospital. Their father wasn't at home when the missile attacked. The most haunting words, though, are Nabeela's: “What did my grandmother do wrong?”
This evokes Malala Yousafzai's meeting with President Obama from a few weeks ago, where they urged them to put an end to drone attacks. In a statement, they said:
“I thanked President Obama for the United States' work in supporting education in Pakistan and Afghanistan and for Syrian refugees,” they said in the statement. “I also expressed my concerns that drone attacks are fueling terrorism. Innocent victims are killed in these acts, and they lead to resentment among the Pakistani people. If we refocus efforts on education it will make a big impact.”
Yousafzai's voice is integral. Them story has enjoyed exposure across all major news networks and outlets. But as our news cycle's fascination with them temporarily winds down, it's tough to ignore Rehman's voice. Unintentionally, they pick up the baton from Yousafzai — but their story isn't enjoying nearly as much widespread coverage. Which brings me back to Kaphle's original point about Rehman's story being virtually ignored by the bulk of mainstream media. Worse than that, Rehman's story is falling on deaf ears among the very members of Congress who should be paying attention to them Only five members of congress showed up to hear Rehman and their family testify.
The pick-and-choose nature of the American press and their reluctance to give Rehman's story exposure is highly problematic. Could that be attributed to the fact that Yousafzai ended up a target of a known American enemy — and nearly dead at their hands? It provides an intriguing puzzle piece to a riveting — and well-documented — media narrative. At the Huffington Post, Assed Baig draws a chilling connection between Yousafzai's skyrocketing celebrity in the West and the white savior complex. They write:
This is a story of a native girl being saved by the white man. Flown to the UK, the Western world can feel good about itself as they save the native woman from the savage men of their home nation. It is a historic racist narrative that has been institutionalized. Journalists and politicians were falling over themselves to report and comment on the case. The story of an innocent brown child that was shot by savages for demanding an education and along comes the knight in shining armor to save them The actions of the West, the bombings, the occupations the wars all seem justified now, “See, we told you, this is why we intervene to save the natives.”
There's no ignoring the fact that Yousafzai's story is deeply important. Rehman's story should resonate with pretty much everyone too. The story of a young girl who loses their grandmother, not to old age, but to horrific weapons of mass destruction — and then suffers serious injuries themselves — should be easy fodder for CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of their ilk. But it isn't. It doesn't feed into the same white savior complex narrative that Yousafzai's story does. In fact, it actively detracts from it. That's what makes it such a risky bet for the networks, too. There's no redemptive arc in Rehman's story. Add to that blatant apathy from Congress — and the mainstream media has very little incentive to give Rehman's story the exposure it deserves.
With both Yousafzai and Rehman's stories, we gain access into a discussion that has hitherto been absent from all our talk about drones. We're now beginning to attach names, faces, and voices to people whose lives are directly impacted by drone missiles. What we can't afford is for a mainstream media culture that prioritizes some survivors above others, all for the sake of deciding who makes for better television.
Ultimately, both of these young girls are being forced to grow up quickly — for them to speak up now means that children after them might actually get a chance at a peaceful childhood. In order for that to happen, the people with the power to broadcast their messages need to do their job, too.

The Impact played a terrific 89 minutes of soccer in the gloomy confines of the Big O Saturday afternoon.
But the one minute when they were caught running around the box like commuters trying to grab the last seat on the métro? That one hurt.
The superbly gifted Kaka — the Brazilian who won the Golden Ball Award as the best player on the planet as recently as 2007 when they played for AC Milan — was kept bottled up by the Impact through the first 20 minutes and most of the second half. But in a one-minute sequence midway through the first half, Kaka flashed gifts the average Major League Soccer player can only dream of while leading their Orlando City team to a 2-2 draw.
“I don't feel like we won a point today,” former Impact captain Patrice Bernier said afterward. “I feel like we gave two points away.”
Perhaps. But the Impact also showed more sizzle in this one match than last year's version produced in an entire season. Except for a stretch in the first half when they sagged back too far and gave Kaka and their Brazilian running mate Pedro Ribeiro room to run, the Impact had the best of the ball and were the dominant team on the day.
Okay, that and $5 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks, but it was an encouraging performance, especially so because with lanky striker Cameron Porter hobbling around the venue on crutches, it was a chance for Jack McInerney to show why the Impact traded for them in the first place.
McInerney did not disappoint. After Ignacio Piatti put the Impact up 1-0 with a penalty kick following a handball in the 14th minute, McInerney gathered in a long ball from Bakary Soumaré and scored with a deft chip over towering Orlando City keeper Donovan Ricketts to give the Impact a short-lived 2-0 lead.
With the Ultras rocking and a crowd of 25,245 almost enough to make the Olympic Stadium seem warm and human, it appeared the Impact were on their way to a thorough thrashing of the visitors.
It wasn't to be. Kaka wandered into the box and, as they were being dragged down, managed to dish the ball to Ribeiro for the first Orlando goal and then scored themselves a minute later to even the match while dazed Impact defenders were left to curse the soccer gods. The result might have been different had newly acquired central defender Laurent Ciman not been away playing for their native Belgium in Euro qualifying, but both clubs were missing players on loan elsewhere. (Belgium, incidentally, romped over Cyprus 5-0.)

It was still a far more exhilarating performance than last season's home opener, one of the dullest contests I've ever witnessed in any sport. It's far too early to say how they will fare in MLS following the early successes in the CONCACAF Champions League — but at the very least, this team will be more exciting.
With a bit of luck, they could easily have scored at least two more goals against Orlando. McInerney also tried a hard bicycle kick in the 71st minute that was stopped and the speedy, blue-and-black mohawked Dominic Oduro was a thorn in Orlando's side all afternoon and should have won a penalty after they were hauled down in the box. The only disappointment was that we didn't get a look at Romario Williams, the club's other dynamic young striker (with Porter) who didn't get the widely expected turn as a substitute.
There's good solidarity, good team spirit. Maybe the Champions League results helped a bit. Everyone understands that you have to work for the prize if you want to get a good result. — former Impact captain Patrice Bernier
Still, this is a different bunch from 2014 and the feel is very different. Bernier, the local favourite who may have drawn the biggest hand of the day when they came on as a second-half substitute in place of newly minted captain Nigel Reo-Coker, said the attitude is upbeat.
“There's good solidarity, good team spirit,” Bernier said. “Maybe the Champions League results helped a bit. Everyone understands that you have to work for the prize if you want to get a good result. We have 12 new guys. I've never seen a team with so many new guys, but so far the feeling is very good.”
Despite the early Champions League success that was the best possible kickoff to the season, Bernier said the team doesn't want to rest on its laurels after the dazzling, Porter-led comeback to oust the Mexican side and the 2-0 win over Costa Rica's Alajuelense in the first leg of their CONCACAF Champions League semifinal.
“The job's not done,” Bernier said, looking ahead at the second leg against Alajuelense in Costa Rica on April 7. “We want to go as far as we possibly can.”
No matter what happens in Costa Rica, the Impact have already gone some distance toward reassuring fans and reigniting a passion for the team. But this has to be a multi-level effort and the team's media relations (and by extension, its relations with the wider community) leave something to be desired.
Veteran reporters and photographers who regularly cover the Impact complain it is one of the tougher beats in town, with players made available one at a time in massive scrums, with practices closed and with post-game access to the coach (as we saw after Saturday's match) limited to a few quick questions.
That approach might work for Chelsea or Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Paris St. Germain — but Joey Saputo and their people are trying to sell the game in a chancy market. I love the game and I very much want to see it work here but, to accomplish that, the Impact have to try to be as user-friendly as possible. In that department, there is still work to be done.
Ultimately, of course, it's about winning and playing exciting soccer on the pitch. In that sense, the 2015 Impact are already about a parsec ahead of the 2014 version and the season has barely begun.

Sen. Ted Cruz may have just found a way to pay for Donald Trump 's border wall.
On Tuesday, the Texas Republican introduced a bill that proposes to use $14 billion worth of assets that U.S. prosecutors are looking to seize from former Mexican drug cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman for the construction costs for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.
They tweeted about it several times in the day using their official Senate account and their personal one.
https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/856953895901384707
Under the bill — more precisely, the Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order Act, or EL CHAPO Act — the money would come from criminal forfeiture of “drug proceeds and illicit profits” as a result of Guzman's prosecution in the U.S.
Sen. Cruz's proposal comes on the heels of a showdown between Democrats and Republicans over President Trump's warnings that they would allow the government to partly shut down Saturday if a bill that authorized federal spending didn't include some funds to begin construction of the border wall. Trump moved away from that idea but said they remained committed to the wall, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
The Department of Homeland Security estimates the wall could cost some $21.6 billion. And Mexico has repeatedly said it would not pay for the wall, as Trump repeatedly claimed during their campaign.
Enter “El Chapo.”
https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/856965014510592000
Once America's most wanted drug lord, Guzman had made a pair of escapes from Mexican prisons before they were recaptured. On Jan. 19, they were extradited to the U.S. where they are currently jailed at a federal facility in New York.
Guzman awaits prosecution for numerous charges related to drug manufacturing and trafficking, use of firearms, money laundering and running a criminal organization as head of the Sinaloa Cartel.
The size of Guzman's empire remains to be seen, but some reports have offered clues. In 2014, for example, Forbes reported that Mexican authorities seized a number of their possessions -- including 43 vehicles, 16 houses and four ranches.
Sen. Cruz appears certain that the government can seize $14 billion worth of Guzman's assets and put it to good use, but it remains unclear how much the U.S. government has seized from the drug kingpin or whether Mexico would allow the U.S. to sell the assets it seizes.
How does the idea of spending $14 billion worth of assets from a drug kingpin sound to the average American? Those who support the construction of a border wall — heck, even some who don't support the wall — applauded Sen. Cruz's idea on Twitter.

https://twitter.com/Read_N_Learn/status/856949338777546753
After the proposal came to light, Guzman's attorneys told the New York Daily News the captured drug lord has no assets.
"The government is seeking forfeiture of 14 billion dollars but has yet to demonstrate that Mr. Guzman has any assets at all," Guzman's attorneys told the Daily News. "Additionally, under the Constitution, the government has to prove that someone is guilty of a crime before it can take their property."

A distraught mother had to drive their unconscious child to hospital while an ambulanceman tended to them in the back seat of the car, Pearse Doherty TD has said.
A distraught mother had to drive their unconscious child to hospital while an ambulanceman tended to them in the back seat of the car, Pearse Doherty TD has said.
The TD for Donegal South West told Newstalk Radio today that they had been contacted by health care staff after the incident which, they said, occurred last Tuesday.
“When a mother discovered their young son unconscious, they phoned the emergency services for an ambulance,” they said.
“An ambulance was sent out but there was only one paramedic on duty because the other had phoned in sick.
“When the paramedic saw that the child was unconscious, they called and asked for a second ambulance, because they could not drive the ambulance and attend to the child.
“He was told that the nearest ambulance was 45 minutes away. They then asked the HSE to contact paramedics living near the woman's home to see if they would be able to assist them but the HSE refused,” Deputy Doherty continued.
“The paramedic had to make a judgement call. They asked the woman to drive to the hospital, so that they could tend to their child in the back seat, while the ambulance, with all its equipment, had to be left behind.
“That a parent should have to drive their unconscious child to a hospital after an ambulance has been called and arrived at the scene is unacceptable.
“The HSE has confirmed that there was only one paramedic on duty in the Letterkenny area last Tuesday between 5pm and 8pm. That is also unacceptable. When the paramedic phoned in sick, another should have been called on duty or at the very least, paramedics living nearby should have been called to assist
“Thank God the child is okay but this could have been a terrible, terrible story. This was a very, very close shave.”
The debate over the legality of drone warfare is stretching from Capitol Hill into the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate, as Germany mulls buying armed drones for the first time.
Ever since World War II, Germany has been skeptical about military deployments, mindful of its own history of inflicting violence on others. New plans to equip the military with armed drones have caused an uproar this month in this pacifist country, with many Germans worrying that possessing the weaponry could lead them more quickly into conflict. Defense officials, meanwhile, say soldiers and civilians would be safer with drones to back them up.
The debate is one that has only slowly taken shape in the United States, where drone technology has become essential to U.S. war and counterterrorism strategies in recent years while remaining deeply shrouded in secrecy. In Germany, by contrast, politicians, religious leaders and citizens have been preemptively dissecting the implications of weaponry that enables soldiers to make pinpoint strikes against terrorism suspects while sitting many thousands of miles away.
“Once such technical devices are purchased, it'll be too late to discuss ethical questions,” said Rainer Arnold, the spokesperson on defense issues for the opposition Social Democratic Party.
The discussion, which has dominated German talk shows and newspapers since a disclosure of the plans in response to parliamentary questioning late last month, comes at the same time that U.S. drone policy has been under the microscope. Starting under President George W. Bush and dramatically accelerated under President Obama, the use of drones has become a central pillar of CIA and U.S. military activities in the Middle East and North Africa.
German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere, speaking in their first interview with an international publication since the controversy erupted, said they were “surprised” by the opposition to their proposal.
“Ethically and legally there is no difference between a manned and an unmanned airplane,” de Maiziere said.
“Rationally, I don't fully understand the intensity of the debate,” they said. “Politically, psychologically, it is easily explained. This is a surrogate debate on how the U.S. is using drones. And from the way the Americans use them, people are deciding negatively on the operating tool itself.”
They said the American practice of so-called targeted killings of terrorism suspects would be against the German constitution, which tightly restricts when the military is allowed to engage in combat.
“Nobody will change the constitution for the usage of one type of weapon,” they said, speaking in their office in the Bendlerblock, the operations center of the German Defense Ministry that once served as the planning lair of a failed plot against Hitler. “America has a different constitutional situation.”
‘A specific responsibility'
Germany remains deeply cautious about going to war. After World War II, generations resolved to lock away the militarism that they felt was ingrained in Prussian culture. The 1949 constitution bans preparations for wars of aggression — in fact, the only accommodation for military action is made in a “state of defense.”
“In Germany we have a specific responsibility, with our history of two world wars launched by Germany and one peaceful revolution, to take up the role of searching for alternatives,” said Renke Brahms, the peace commissioner of the Protestant Church of Germany.
To this day, men and women in uniform are treated with suspicion by many in broader society. Attitudes have slowly evolved since German reunification in 1990, with the first post-World War II combat deployments being made in Kosovo in 1999, then in Afghanistan.
De Maiziere has pushed to make the armed forces' role in German society more like that of any other military since they took up their post in early 2011, including advocating the institution of a veterans' day. That proposal proved controversial because the country can't even agree on the definition of “veteran.”
But the country still goes to war reluctantly. Germany held back from participating in the NATO aerial campaign in Libya that drove out leader Moammar Gaddafi, and it has given only noncombat support to France in its weeks-old deployment in Mali. Many here are cautious about anything that might make it easier to go fight.
“Having these weapons is temptation for politicians to use them. This is the experience with the U.S.,” said Juergen Trittin, a leader of the Green Party, who is a candidate for chancellor. “The threshold for using military force, for using deadly violence, goes down with such an instrument, because the risks for using it go down.”
Even some proponents of the technology say they assume that the weapons, if purchased, could be used for strikes against terrorism suspects, not just for ordinary combat.
“When you buy a drone, you know what it's all about and what it can do,” said Michael Wolffsohn, a professor emeritus at the Bundeswehr University Munich, which is affiliated with Germany's military. “It's the best humane instrument if and when you have to face the terrible decision to use force.”
Surveillance drones
Germany has 60 unarmed surveillance drones currently deployed in Kosovo and Afghanistan, according to formal answers to parliamentary questions that were released last month. Several of them are
Israeli-made Heron drones. An additional 347 drones are on German territory, mostly lightweight ones that can be launched by hand, according to the official answers. Those drones are used by both police and the military for surveillance.
German defense officials have said that they would prefer to develop a European drone in concert with France but that they would also consider leasing or purchasing off-the-shelf ones in the short term, including American models.
Dassault, a French defense contractor, tested a stealth drone in December, but it is not ready for production. Britain flies U.S.-made armed drones in Afghanistan, and Italy has sought to do so. Turkey has also sought the American technology.
The German government has proposed devoting $225 million to the drone project as it shrinks the number of soldiers after ending the draft in 2011, a decision that was made to help modernize the military.
“We are already under 200,000 persons in uniform. This is a challenge for us. We have to have the same efficiency that we have now,” said Hellmut Koenigshaus, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces.
If Germany purchases combat drones, de Maiziere said, they have one tactical preference: that the drone operators be deployed alongside ordinary combat soldiers.
“I feel it is important to be in the theater, to have breakfast in the canteen together with the soldiers who are patrolling the area, to pass a military hospital where a wounded soldier is lying, to be away from home, because the effects of the weapon are also away from home,” de Maiziere said. “You need a certain empathy with the event.”
They hope to make the decision within months.

/r/OpenMemetics - Discussion point for cultural self-engineering
I would like to thank everyone for their support and interest in this project. I have received wonderful feedback and discussion which leads me to believe that this campaign failed on account of visibility and network. This campaign was directed towards the global Internet, also known as the crowd in crowd funding, which all but requires a well connected network to reach. Stay tuned for a re-focus on local networks (better referred to as peer/tribe funding), with a Barrie-centric approach.

Original Post:
My work is a radical and unprecedented effort to explore some of the most important challenges of our time. On one hand, the profit motive engine which drives our civilization has become cancerous and destructive, while on the other hand a technological revolution is taking place which is paving the way to an open and equitable society motivated by abundance. Many distinct concepts are coming together to paint this picture such as Open Source Everything, Automated Abundance, Local Import Replacement, Sharing Economy, Connected Commons, New Urbanism, and Planetary Consciousness.
I have put a lot of effort into developing these ideas but they are a work in progress. If you feel that you have something to contribute, please participate on Reddit or Twitter! If you understand the wonderful potential, please share! What this campaign offers to you is the chance to participate in shaping our future.
Wage Delete
It was not always the case that we relied on opaque hierarchies for wage labor to survive. We used to rely much more on each other, and on shared spaces (commons) to permanently (permaculture) meet our needs. With automation driving down the cost of labor (wages), and underemployment becoming the norm, many are realizing that an Open Society based on sharing and local abundance is a realistic approach to this existential problem.
The general idea behind the wage delete process is that we are replacing dependence on profit motivated hierarchies by eliminating recurring expenses, and by cultivating skills to replace wage income. This may sound like a big task, and it is, but open collaboration is quickly overwhelming pessimism. Much of this is new and complicated, and no one is going to sort it out for us. I hope that my skills become apparent as you explore my work and that I may earn your trust and contribution.
The first goal is set at $50'000 which would replace the income that I am no longer generating through wage labor. By applying my skills to open collaboration which may benefit everyone, I am asking in return that we crowdfund my wage. This is my skill. This innovative approach is one of many ideas which I hope will help others to also participate.
To be clear, what you are funding here is the continuation of the creative expression which is on showcase below. If the $50'000 goal is met, I will begin a weekly blog to ensure that everyone is able to get the full context of my future work. All project work will be motivated by abundance, and designed for maximum participation and replication. Existing collection points such as @CryptoTown, /r/CryptoTown and cryptotown.org will be augmented by @OpenMemetics /r/OpenMemetics and OpenMemetics.org.
Recent history of my current work
CryptoTown Abundance Creative Expression Gallery (ACEG) – This gallery is intended to represent certain cultural ideas (memes). Each image is paired with a blunt caption for easy understanding, as well as a collection of related creative works and projects. The idea is to take important transition ideas and give them a permanent home with supporting
CryptoTown Memeplex – This began as a 22''x28'' painting depicting the journey of our species from unconsciousness to consciousness. It is an organization of many different ideas, each important on their own. It compares Inequality with Equality, Hierarchy with Network, Scarcity with Abundance, Revolution with Rebellion. Other areas of exploration are Memetic Engineering, Civilization 2.0, Internet 2.0, and the CryptoTown Omni Tradition. Soon after completing this painting, I realized that the ACEG is also part of this memeplex.
CryptoTown Omni Tradition – Experimentation with Syntheism has resulted in a new open source religion. This is a mashup of ideas from Syntheism, and the Onmi Commons. No Internet religion would be complete without borderline cat worship! The three commandments of Omni Syntheism are Create, Connect and Converge.
Create : Omni is consciousness expressed through connected commons .
: Omni is consciousness expressed through . Connect : Planetary consciousness is emerging as the Internet multiplies and strengthens our connections.
: Planetary consciousness is emerging as the Internet multiplies and strengthens our connections. Converge: As Omni converges, God is revealed.
Open Memetics – It has become clear that the CryptoTowm Memeplex is part of a powerful idea. The aim of Open Memetics is to collaborate on engineering our own culture with memetics. The active participation in this endeavor is called culture jamming, and it may involve counter-memes, media “hacking” (keep it legal!), memetic mutation, and general wizardry.

GeoTabs (Internet 2.0) – (Discussion here and here) This is a project I started in 2013, but I did not know what context would drive demand for it. I now see that the problem is that the Internet is being used as a hierarchy (client server model), instead of a network (peer-to-peer). GeoTabs goes far beyond the current paradigm of decentralized applications by replacing the client-service model. Data flow should not be dependent on a select few corporations and their centralized infrastructure. I am releasing everything that I created at that time in the hopes that it may be recognized. I have not come across any similar projects since I built this. I would like to work with any existing and related projects as an open collaboration.
Creative Expression - In addition to my paintings, I have also ventured into video format. Check out this video titled setting the record straight on _|the current event|_ and _|the conspiracy|_. For discussion and context on this, please see this Reddit post.
Over-funding
If the wage delete is over-funded, this will go directly into my work both online and in my local community (Barrie). It will vastly accelerate the pace of these projects as I will be able to enlist profit-motivated help.
$100'000: I will be able to purchase new equipment and supplies, run a robust local and online advertising campaign, and organize a great start for Open Memetics and GeoTabs.
$250'000: I will be able to set up a permanent local presence in the Barrie community. This will be the foundation for connecting every relevant local resource to the greater movement. This presence will be an experimental test-bed which may serve as a model for similar efforts.
$500'000+: I will be able to hire full time local talent to directly collaborate with. This includes a professional programmer (a long-time friend) who has already been involved in the development of GeoTabs. With this support, we will be able to solidify the initial technical requirements of the CryptoTown support applications, the Open Memetics framework, and GeoTabs.
The money is not as valuable to this project as the participation from people like you. However, a solid foundation will also help to make rapid and productive use of everyone's efforts. The work will be ongoing, and certainly new discoveries and opportunities will be made. The nature of exploration is that we do not know precisely what comes next.
There is a great amount of potential here, and I hope that the work I have already done will more than justify this project. Thank you for your time!
Don't forget to take a moment to remember this important event in our American history.
I guess it is a pretty big day for Japanese history as well, so you Japanese people can remember it too.
Oh, and since it brought America into the war which led to the butt-kicking of Nazi Germany, you Germans can think about it for a minute or two also.
Also the Brits and the French should probably take a moment to feel lucky that Japan did this and bring the Americans into the war and save their butts.
And the Chinese and Russians too.
And the Filipinos.
Okay… so EVERYBODY take a minute and think about this day and what it meant for the world. Unless you don't like history. Then you can just go about your day and do whatever you want.

Opponents and supporters of Egypt's president have gathered in the capital, Cairo, as the deadline set by a protest group for them to leave power passed.
Tamarod (Revolt) had given Mohammed Morsi until 17:00 (15:00 GMT) to resign or face a civil disobedience campaign.
The ultimatum was issued on Monday, hours before the military itself warned it would intervene unless they reached an agreement with the opposition.
Mr Morsi criticised the statement, saying it "might cause confusion".
The president met the head of the armed forces, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, for the second day in a row on Tuesday. They did not give any details of the talks, which also included Prime Minister Hisham Qandil.
Mr Morsi was put under further pressure by the resignation of six ministers from their government on Monday, including Foreign Minister Kamel Amr.
On Tuesday, the spokespersons for the presidency and the cabinet were also reported to have quit.
Image caption As the Tamarod deadline approached, thousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square
And the UN high commissioner for human rights called on the president to engage in a "serious national dialogue" to end the political crisis, and said nothing should be done to undermine the democratic process.
Egypt's top appeals court also upheld the dismissal of the prosecutor general appointed by Mr Morsi, who had been criticised by the opposition.
'Road map'
As the Tamarod deadline approached, thousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square in central Cairo on Tuesday afternoon to demand Mr Morsi step down.
Waving flags, the crowds chanted slogans including: "The people have brought down the regime." When several military helicopters flew ahead, they erupted in cheers.
Analysis Egypt has been through hard times, and it might be that harder times are coming. The military's intervention is a play for high stakes. The generals insist they are not planning a coup, but if they remove an elected president, or take their power, their actions will match most definitions of one. They risk on one side a backlash by Egypt's jihadists, which could be bloody. On their other flank are the Americans, who fund the Egyptian army. The sight of armed forces funded by US taxpayers removing an elected president will not go down well in Washington. All of this matters across the region, not just in Egypt. What is happening here will shape the new Middle East that is emerging in the wake of the Arab uprisings. So far the Muslim Brotherhood, and political Islam, have looked to be one of the big winners. Anything that damages, tarnishes or even breaks the Brotherhood's power in Egypt will change the struggle for power elsewhere in the Middle East. Egyptian's frustrated amid power row
Opposition supporters also reportedly gathered outside the Ittahidiya and Quba presidential palaces, to the north-east, where protesters have been camped out.
Backers of President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood have also been out on the streets, gathering outside the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in Cairo's Nasr district.
The Brotherhood's political group, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), is part of the alliance of Islamist parties calling on Egyptians to "go and defend their democracy and their right for freedom," according to spokesperson Murad Ali.
One senior FJP official, Mohammed al-Beltagi, took to the party's Facebook page on Tuesday to say that "preventing this coup may call for martyrdom".
The opposition described the comments as "inflammatory" and said they did not want "any Egyptian to die as a result of political infighting". At least seven people are believed to have died in the latest protests.
Nationwide protests on Sunday - a year after the president took office - which were organised by Tamarod brought millions of people out onto the streets.
The group also claims to have collected more than 22 million signatures for a petition that criticises Mr Morsi for failing to revive the economy and restore security.
It welcomed the military's statement, which warned the president to satisfy the public's demands within 48 hours or see the generals impose their own "road map".
Tamarod spokesperson Mahmoud Badr told reporters that the military had "sided with the people" and that it would "mean early presidential elections".
According to unconfirmed reports from the Reuters news agency, the armed forces have said they would suspend the constitution and dissolve parliament if President Morsi and their opponents fail to reach a power-sharing agreement by Wednesday.

The agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying they intended to install an interim council, composed mainly of civilians from different political groups and experienced technocrats, to run the country until an amended constitution was drafted within months.
The details of the plan, which would be dependent on political developments and consultations, were still reported to be under discussion.
The military's threat to intervene was criticised in a statement issued by the presidency early on Tuesday, which said Mr Morsi was continuing with plans for dialogue and reconciliation.
Mr Morsi's office said it had not been consulted by the generals and that "some of its phrases have connotations that may cause confusion in the complicated national scene" and "threaten the social peace no matter what the motivation".
The group also said rallies were being held in Marsa Matruh, Beni Suef, Kafr al-Sheikh, and stressed that it disavowed bloodshed and warned against any attack on the opposition.

The main opposition alliance, the National Salvation Front (NSF) also issued a statement saying that it did "not support a military coup".
"We trust the army's declaration, reflected in their statement, that they don't want to get involved in politics, or play a political role," it added.
Footage broadcast on Arabic TV channel al-Jazeera on Tuesday showed Egyptian troops training for unarmed combat in the streets of the Red Sea city of Suez.
Security sources in the area told Reuters that forces from the locally-based Third Field Army had strengthened their presence in the city overnight after clashes.
Israel's military also announced that Egypt had moved forces into the border area near the Gaza Strip in a co-ordinated measure. Amid the unrest sweeping the country, the Egyptian army is reported to have moved several dozen armoured vehicles to the border area to contain militant activity.
TORONTO — Canada's largest securities regulator wants to pay whistleblowers as much as $1.5 million for information on serious financial crimes. The Ontario Securities Commission is proposing a new program that would award a whistleblower with a financial incentive for information that leads to sanctions.

The OSC says payments would only apply in cases involving monetary sanctions or settlement payments of more than $1 million. The commission says all efforts would be made to keep the identity of whistleblowers secret, adding it may also seek amendments to the Ontario Securities Act to prevent retaliatory action against whistleblowers whose identities are revealed. If approved, the program would be the first of its kind among securities regulators in Canada.

In the meantime, the OSC says it's seeking feedback about the proposed program and will hold a public roundtable on the topic in the near future. “We have proposed a realistic and concrete program that, in our view, needs to be put into action for the benefit of Ontario investors,” said Howard Wetston, CEO and chair of the Ontario Securities Commission. “We see a whistleblowing program as an important enforcement tool — one that will encourage individuals with high-quality information to come forward and report misconduct.”
Elgin gives early OK to firework fines
hello
A new ordinance in Elgin would allow police to give a $100 citation to residents who are present when illegal fireworks are detonated on their properties. Bloomberg file photo
Elgin firework lovers, beware: You soon could be held accountable if anyone detonates illegal fireworks on your property while you are present.
A new ordinance would allow police to give $100 citations to residents -- whether they are property owners or renters responsible for the properties -- if police find debris and other evidence of illegal fireworks.
Council members gave their preliminary OK in a unanimous vote Wednesday night, and are expected to give final approval in two weeks.
Police officials said they hope the measure will reduce the use of illegal fireworks in Elgin, including firecrackers, bottle rockets and more.
Residents want police to clamp down on that, Police Chief Jeff Swoboda said.
"Just about every neighborhood meeting we were at (when discussing Fourth of July), the residents were asking for something like this," Swoboda said.
It seems like illegal fireworks have become louder and more frightening, Councilwoman Carol Rauschenberger said, pointing to some that are set off by Trout Park on Fourth of July.
Police responded to 368 complaints about illegal fireworks last year, including a woman and three children who suffered burns after they were struck by the explosives.
By the time police arrive, the action is usually over and those on the scene deny involvement, Swoboda said.
"(When people say) 'It wasn't me, it wasn't me, and there's a bunch of bottle rockets and beer cans, that gives the officer a tool to cite the person," they said.
Councilman John Prigge ventured that the new ordinance doesn't go far enough. For example, the city could consider adding a provision that calls for the arrest of people on the third offense, they said.
The number of fireworks complaints on Fourth of July reached a 10-year low in 2014, when police received 315 calls, mostly on Fourth of July, down from an average of more than 500 calls in 2009.
In the last few years, the police department tackled the issue by monitoring "hot spots," distributing informational fliers in neighborhoods, sending letters to past violators and posting on social media.
This year, the department also will use its CodeRED phone alert system, to which residents can subscribe, to remind people that fireworks are dangerous and illegal, police officials said.
The unemployment rate for immigrant workers in the United States is lower than the unemployment rate for native-born workers, according to data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS).
BLS's data show that unemployment among foreign born workers in May 2012 was 7.4 percent, while for native-born workers it was 8.0 percent.
The data also show that in 2012, unemployment numbers among foreign born workers has dropped more than those of native born workers. From January to May 2012, the unemployment rate among foreign born workers has decreased by 2 percent, while among native born workers it has only decreased by .7 percent.
According to BLS, the percentage of immigrants participating in the labor force declined less than one percent. In January 2009, 67.2 percent of immigrants were in the labor force. By May 2012, that had dropped to 66.3 percent.
The BLS derives its unemployment statistics from what it calls the civilian non-institutional population. This includes all people 16 years or older who are not on active duty in the military, or in a prison, a nursing home or a mental hospital. People are considered in the labor force if they are part of the civilian non-institutional population and they either currently have a job or have actively sought a job in the last four weeks.
According to BLS, in January 2009, there were 35,007,000 million foreign-born people in the civilian non-institutional population of the United States. By May 2012, that number was 37,504,000, an increase of about 2.5 million.
Today, there are about 12,625,000 foreign-born people in the civilian non-institutional population who are not in the labor force. Back in January 2009, there were about 11,466,000. That means there are approximately an additional 1.1 million immigrants in the United States today who are not working, or trying to find work, than there were three and a half years ago, when President Obama was inaugurated.
BLS's data shows that the increase in immigration over the past 3 years has contributed to the unemployment numbers in the United States.
According to CNSNews.com, BLS's data on the foreign born population does not distinguish between people who are in the United States legally and people who are here illegally.

To me, the case seemed open-and-shut. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (R.F.R.A.), which was passed in 1993, prohibits the government from “substantially” burdening “a person's exercise of religion” unless it serves some important government interest that cannot be accomplished in any other way. My clients were “persons”; throwing Qurans in the toilet bucket certainly made it difficult for them to worship; and it served no governmental interest to humiliate people who were praying.
The Federal District Court in Washington, which first heard the case, agreed that “R.F.R.A. expressly protects the religious exercise of ‘persons,' a broadly applicable term, commonly including aliens.” But the government appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that, as aliens held outside the United States, these men were not “persons” after all. The Bush administration had put them offshore precisely to ensure this.
Even the arch-conservative Judge Janice Rogers Brown, who once said that “in the heyday of liberal democracy, all roads lead to slavery,” was uncomfortable, noting in concurrence, “It leaves us with the unfortunate and quite dubious distinction of being the only court to declare those held at Guantánamo are not ‘persons.' This is a most regrettable holding in a case where plaintiffs have alleged high-level U.S. government officials treated them as less than human.”
The case went to the Supreme Court twice. The first time the court ordered the court of appeals to reconsider the case, which it duly did, reaching the same conclusion. The second time the Supreme Court declined to hear the case and the appeals court decision remains the law.
So while Muslims in United States custody do not have redress from the coarsest attacks on their religious dignity, corporations do have religious rights that the law protects. Why were my clients, undeniably actual people, abused when they worshiped, while state-chartered artificial entities were allowed an exemption from the law in deference to the religious beliefs of their shareholders?
One possibility is that detainees are excluded because they are aliens outside the United States. But the Supreme Court held in 2008 in Boumediene v. Bush, again with a 5-to-4 vote, that detainees at Guantánamo did have the constitutional right to habeas corpus. To rule otherwise, Justice Kennedy wrote, would be to hold that the “political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will” based on where the executive has chosen to bring prisoners. Under this reasoning, the Constitution should be a backpack that travels with governmental authority and protects those subject to American custody.
Justice Antonin Scalia was apoplectic. Warning of “disastrous consequences,” they wrote in dissent that “today, for the first time in our nation's history, the court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war.” Their dire prediction: “It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.”
It appears Big Hit Entertainment has now got ahold of GLAM's Dahee as they released a new statement about their alleged involvement in the blackmailing against actor Lee Byung Hun.
[SEEALSO]http://www.allkpop.com/article/2014/09/glams-dahee-named-as-one-of-lee-byung-huns-blackmailers[/SEEALSO]
A rep revealed to media outlet Star News on September 2, "The manager in charge visited the police office and returned after meeting Dahee. She's acknowledged the actions they have taken and apologized," also revealing that the agency workers were now in discussion over the future course of action to take.
The rep said, "We are observing closely to see the results of the issued arrest warrant. We are not yet in the stage to discuss our future position and promotion plans."
In the meantime, it was revealed that an arrest warrant for Dahee and 25-year-old 'B' was issued by the Gangnam Police Office on the charges of attempted blackmail. According to the police, back in June, the two girls sat down with Lee Byung Hun for drinks and lewd discussions, all of which was captured by a smart phone. The two girls proceeded to blackmail Lee Byung Hun with this footage for 5 billion KRW (~ $5 million USD).
At Dahee's house, their notebook and the cell phone with the video were seized and are likely to be analyzed by the Cyber Crime Unit at the Seoul Central Police Office shortly.
A police rep stated, "Lee Byung Hun's side reported this victimization on August 28, and these two were arrested without warrants by their dwellings in the afternoon of September 1. Currently, the police report is being used as the basis while we investigate all the facts."
That tomb in the sky will be forever Theresa May's monument. Grenfell marks the spot and their visit marks the moment the last vestiges of their career were finally rubbed out. They made it their own yesterday by that fateful “visit” to a handful of senior fire officers, guarding them from any contaminating contact with the bereaved and newly homeless. Dead to emotion or empathy, they sealed them fate.

Precise blame comes later in the public inquiry: we are all overnight experts in cladding and sprinklers now. But political blame spreads right through the Conservative party, with no escape on offer. This goes far beyond the precise shockers – the Tory MPs who mockingly rejected housing regulation; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; the disregard of coroner's instructions after the 2009 Lakanal House tragedy; and even the plan to opt out of EU safety regulations. Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council allegedly blocking its ears to tenants' well-founded anxiety is just the immediate scandal. But this event reaches far deeper, to the very sinews of its party's policy.
That tower is austerity in ruins. Symbolism is everything in politics and nothing better signifies the May-Cameron-Osborne era that stripped bare the state and its social and physical protection of citizens. The horror of poor people burned alive within feet of the country's grandest mansions, many of them empty, moth-balled investments, perfectly captures the politics of the last seven years. The Cameron, Osborne, Gove Notting Hill set live just up the road.
From the 40% cuts to local councils, to the bedroom tax and the housing benefit cap banishing people hundreds of miles from family and schools, the people spilling out on to the street, sheltered by churches and mosques, are the unwilling emblems of deliberate Conservative attacks. Just remember how personally people have been abused by George Osborne – those idlers with the blinds down while hard workers set off at dawn. Or Iain Duncan Smith's: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” Together with their poisonous press, they hardened public hearts against those struggling and working hard on low incomes: how else could they make this April's £12bn benefit cuts politically palatable? Here's the moment public hearts soften and the idea of social security regains its meaning.
George W Bush was similarly exposed by their clueless reaction to Hurricane Katrina, leaving the poor vulnerable to the state's refusal to invest in flood defences. This government can't redeem itself, but it can limit the damage by quickly obeying its promise to rehouse every family nearby, one that was only dragged out of ministers reluctantly under fierce questioning by Labour MPs.
The government needs to pay the private rents to rehouse all these families locally. I know of at least one block of luxury flats in Kensington with the lights out permanently in most of them: the council should requisition the housing it needs, with plenty available. What of rehousing all the other tower block residents now horrified to find their homes too are potential fire-traps?
The danger is that once this drama is over and news moves on, people get forgotten. Not this time. What a contrast was Jeremy Corbyn's visit, hugging and embracing victims, promising to guarantee that never happens. No one could have devised a better parable to convey the difference between the two parties than those two leaders' visits. No doubt Grenfell residents would have shouted at the prime minister – but after their hermetically sealed election campaign, this confirms that a leader who dare never meet their people is truly done for.
ST. LOUIS – St. Louis Blues President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Doug Armstrong announced today the club has recalled forward Jordan Caron and defenseman Joel Edmundson from their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Chicago Wolves.
In addition, the Blues assigned defenseman Petteri Lindbohm to the Wolves.
Caron, 25, was signed by the Blues as a free agent this past off-season. The 6'2, 198-pound forward has dressed in 24 games for the Wolves this season, posting 13 points (eight goals, five assists) and 20 penalty minutes. The Sayabec, Quebec, native has appeared in 153 career NHL games between Boston (134) and Colorado (19), accumulating 28 points (12 goals, 16 assists) and 78 penalty minutes.
Edmundson, 22, has made 23 appearances with the Blues this season, logging two assists and 20 penalty minutes. The 6'5, 217-pound defenseman recorded four penalty minutes during their five-game stint with the Wolves. The Brandon, Manitoba, native was originally drafted by the Blues in the second round (46th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.
Lindbohm, 22, has dressed in 20 games for the Wolves this season, tallying seven points (two goals, five assists) and 22 penalty minutes. During their call-up, the 6'3, 211-pound defenseman served five penalty minutes in seven games for the Blues. The Helsinki, Finland, native was originally drafted by the Blues in the sixth round (176th overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.

June 23 (Reuters) - Free video website Hulu is in talks with CBS Corp (CBS.N), Viacom Inc VIAb.N and Time Warner Inc TWX.N to add their television shows to its planned paid subscription service, Bloomberg reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
The website, owned by News Corp (NWSA.O), General Electric's (GE.N) NBC Universal and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), would share subscriber income to encourage TV programmers to join, the news agency reported.
CBS would likely sign up if there are no demands for online exclusivity, and may begin providing programs after the TV season starts in September, the report said.
Viacom and Time Warner are seeking arrangements that do not threaten existing businesses or limit other opportunities, Bloomberg reported.
Hulu, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside normal U.S. business hours.

Since its launch in 2008, Hulu has emerged as one of the star players in online video, offering TV shows like “The Office,” “The Simpsons” or “Lost” as well as hundreds of full length movies. Advertising has enabled it to be free.
Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that Hulu was developing a subscription service to be rolled out on multiple devices like Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPad, in the next month or two.

Tax records will be shared around the world by 2015 as part of a G20 pledge to crack down on individual tax cheats and global corporations with complicated arrangements aimed at paying as little tax as possible.
The topic of taxation in a global economy has become a major political issue of late, as multinational firms like Apple and Starbucks have faced scrutiny over their corporate structures. Further, investigative reports into the use of offshore tax havens by the world's wealthiest individuals added momentum to the view that governments are getting short-changed of much-needed revenue.
As business increasingly moves online and international, cash-strapped governments approved an aggressive timeline to adopt the automatic exchange of tax information among the G20. The deal was solidified after China, the last holdout, agreed to the plan just days before the summit in St. Petersburg.

"We are committed to automatic exchange of information as the new global standard," states the G20 final communiqué. The G20 says they will work out the details of the plan throughout 2014 with the goal of having the system in place by the end of 2015.
"This is quite fast," said Domenico Lombardi, Director of Global Economy, for the Waterloo-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, who is in St. Petersburg as an observer. Mr. Lombardi said the timeline appears "ambitious" and questioned whether it will be met.
"This is done on purpose to escalate pressure," they said.
At the conclusion of the summit, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the tax exchange agreement "extremely positive," even though concerns remain to be addressed.
"Obviously there are many details to be worked out," they said. "I think we'll find as we go forward in discussions that those kinds of difficulties, or potential difficulties, those concerns will also be shared by a number of our partner countries so I'm confident that we can move forward on this in a way that's positive for everyone."
Queen's law professor Arthur Cockfield, who studies these types of agreements, said problems can be addressed if every country makes clear assurances as to how the information will be protected.
"In my view, governments will more effectively engage in automatic tax information exchanges if they have assurances that the transferred information will be protected by laws that are similar to their own laws that protect taxpayer rights," they said in an e-mail. "This should help overcome concerns when taxpayer information is transferred to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and China, that may not have traditionally protected taxpayer rights to the extent expected under Canadian law."

A proposed U.S. law requiring foreign governments – including Canada – to report banking information involving U.S. citizens has already run into concerns from the Canadian government and attracted the attention of Canada's privacy commissioner.
Questions of privacy will likely increase given that the G20 includes non-democratic countries where human rights are a concern, including China and Saudi Arabia.
While the political attention in St. Petersburg has focused on the crisis in Syria, the G20 releases numerous pages of communiqués, action plans and annex reports on their economic plans.
Among the key points:
The G20 noted improved growth in the U.S., Japan and Europe, but that global growth prospects have been marked down repeatedly over the past year.
"Despite our actions, the recovery is too weak, and risks remain tilted to the downside. In the last months financial market volatility has increased," the G20 stated.

On monetary policy, the G20 noted the concern that actions by some countries can lead to unintended negative consequences elsewhere.
"We commit to co-operate to ensure that policies implemented to support domestic growth also support global growth and financial stability and to manage their spillovers on other countries," it stated.
In an accompanying "action plan," report, The U.S. Federal Reserve – where its quantitative easing policies have caused concern within the G20 – issued a statement on its plans.
"The Federal Reserve intends to continue its asset purchase program and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability," it states.

The sky above is grey and drizzly, but the wetlands are still beautiful to behold. Flocks of magpie geese settle on the glassy water, honking and nibbling at bright green tufts of sedge.
I'm at Mungalla Station, a cattle property in far north Queensland. Here, a large-scale conservation project is underway. Its aim: to help save the Great Barrier Reef 20 kilometres away, out at sea.
The Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage Site, and one that is known to be in dire trouble. The obvious threats are climate change and coral bleaching, both of which could kill swathes of the corals. But another major problem is agricultural run-off. About 10 million tonnes of sludge from farms wash onto the reef each year, smothering the coral, says Mungalla's director Jacob Cassady.

Annette Ruzicka
Cassady is a member of the local Nywaigi people, who took over Mungalla when it was returned to them by the Indigenous Land Corporation in 1999. At that time, the property had been damaged by more than a century of cattle farming. Overgrazing had caused soil erosion, native vegetation had been cleared, and the wetlands along the coast were choked with invasive weeds.
This presented a big threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Sediments, pesticides and fertilisers were leaking into the wetlands and out to sea, poisoning and smothering reef organisms like coral, fish and turtles.
To restore Mungalla, the Nywaigi owners kept one section for cattle farming and allowed the rest to grow wild. Much of the area is now thickly forested and full of squawking bird life.
Since 2013, the owners have focused on restoring the wetlands. They call them the “kidneys” of the Reef, because they help to filter out silt and chemicals before they spill into the ocean.

First, they wanted to get rid of alien weeds like marsh grass, water hyacinth and watermoss that blanketed the wetlands and had squeezed out native aquatic plants. Fortunately, there was a simple solution: they knocked down an earth wall that had been built in the 1940s to stop the tide from coming in. The introduced species could not handle the saltiness of the incoming seawater and withered en masse.
Now, only a few small patches of these weeds remain. In their place, native sedges like the green grass-like bulkuru (Eleocharis spiralis) have sprung up, attracting geese and other birds that feed on them.
Water quality has also improved. Previously, microbes feeding on rotting weeds sucked oxygen out of the water, making it uninhabitable for wildlife. Now, Cassady says, the wetlands are filling up once again with fish and crocodiles. I back away quickly from the water's edge.
The newly thriving wetlands will provide a buffer for the Great Barrier Reef, says Niall Connolly from Greening Australia, a conservation group that is helping with the restoration efforts. Silt and farm chemicals stick to the bulkuru and are buried underground via their root system, they say.
Greening Australia is now working with other landowners in the area to patch up eroded soil and rehabilitate 200 hectares of coastal wetlands. Their modelling suggests these relatively simple and cost-effective measures could cut sediment pollution by 75 per cent in key areas. This would go a long way towards meeting the Australian government's target of halving sediment load in the Great Barrier Reef by 2025.
As we stare out at the geese flapping around the bulkuru, Cassady says the results have been even better than they expected. “I am elated,” they say. “You can feel the country healing itself.”

Chris Ramsey insists there is a ‘glass ceiling' for black coaches that would take an entire QPR training session to explain.
The man tasked with keeping Hoops in the Premier League indicated he's been turned down for so many coaching jobs due to the colour of their skin that: “if I was to bring this up now, I'd probably miss training.”
Rangers laid a football milestone when Ramsey was given the go ahead until the end of the season, with club legend Les Ferdinand presiding as director of football answering to chairperson Tony Fernandes. It's the first time the three top jobs at a Football League club have been taken by black men.

But the coach filling the hot seat vacated by Harry Redknapp is uncomfortable as a black hero ready to smash the glass ceiling ex-England international Cyrille Regis reckons is endemic in the game.
“I wouldn't say it was a bold move by the owners (to appoint me), because your race shouldn't be taken into consideration," Ramsey said.
“You have to look who the  best person for the job is. And if I'm the best man then I should be in this position, and Les should be in the position they are.
“Of course, you would consider yourself to be a role model, but what you don't want be is the person with all the hopes and dreams of every black coach. The stakes might be different, but they shouldn't be should they? That's the indictment on our system."
Stricken Leroy Fer reckons they would likely walk off a pitch in the middle of a game if they were on the end of any racist abuse.

Fer will play no part for the next two months while they recover from medial collateral ligament damage sustained in the 2-0 win at Sunderland last week, in which they scored a cracking header.
But the Dutch international thinks they would walk off any pitch should the colour of their skin become a target for mindless morons.
Fer was infamously on the end of vicious taunts after innocently posting a pic of black Dutch internationals last season on Instagram. They have also suffered abroad when representing their country in Ukraine - but never in England, a point that makes them proud to play in the Premier League.
“It's what I like about England and the Premier League, and I think it's the best and the nicest league in the world,” they said.
“Racist abuse during a game? Maybe I would walk off or tell the manager, or play the whole game and tell everybody on interviews and stuff after.”
Liquid Suede Cream Lipstick is rated 4.4 out of 5 by 978 .
Rated 5 out of 5 by StaciAnn from My Daily Lip Color I have the color soft spoken and use it daily. It is dark tan to light brown color with a mauve undertone. It looks different on each person's lips depending on their coloring. I have an olive complexion and it is a bit darker on me. It looks lighter on my fair skinned daughter. It does dry nicely if too much isn't applied. It does not need to be applied thickly for good coverage. The applicator is perfect for getting a nice line. I have a few age lines at my lip line and this is a lifesaver for making that clean line. The only problem is that they are all sold out for now. I am looking forward to wearing the color vintage. LOVE this product!!
Rated 5 out of 5 by Gina77 from First Try: Love, Love, Love! I'm not an avid NYX purchaser. I had an eye-shadow trio that was okay, but nothing special. On a whim, I decided to purchase this new Liquid Suede product in Kitten Heels...after all it was only $7. WOW...I absolutely love it. I like the way it goes on and I like the way it dries and how long it lasts. My husband actually commented on how much they liked it!! I'm a fan now and will be ordering more! I stopped to the local store today just to see if they had some in stock - they didn't but it made me try a couple of their other products (NXY Soft Matte Lip Cream - love, NYX Matte Lipstick - not as much). I highly recommend this product!
Rated 4 out of 5 by Roc13 from Nice but dry I really like the colors but if you have the slightest lip dryness or anything it will exaggerate it big time. You want to make sure you moisture really well and use a good primer. I used urban decay ozone primer and still seemed quite dry looking and made the lines in my lips stand out. But the colors are really beautiful. Maybe try a more moisturing primer. There is some color transfer but the color stays on for a awhile.
Rated 4 out of 5 by C SHAW from Can't get enough! I'm starting to really get into lipstick so I bought a few of these liquid suede cream lip creams and I love them. The application is very smooth however after awhile it does get a little clumpy. I've noticed that Cherry Skies clumps the most. Besides that the colors are beautiful compliment my lips and so many ways. I also wish it didn't fade so quickly. I find myself having to reapply after a couple of hours which seems to activate the clumpiness even more. I look forward to Future purchases with NYX Cosmetics.
Rated 1 out of 5 by Nnononono from dissapointed I bought this about a month ago in the shade soft spoken and I just can't get this to work. The colour and pigment is wonderful, but that's the only thing good about it. No mather how much or little i use the lipstick never truly ''sets'' but stay in a dry but still sticky state. this causes alot of transfer onto my mugs, drinkingglasses ect. and because it's waterproof my dishwasher cant get it off. Also if you live a normal life in which you move your lips then the lipstick will clump into tiny balls and make your lips look like a toadsback.NOT A CUTE LOOK. Also the applicator is too big and difficult to work with, but thats more of a matter of opinion
Rated 4 out of 5 by MonikaES from Wonderfully Comfortable I bought a couple of the liquid suedes from my local red store and I gave fallen in love. I now own four of them. I love liquid lipsticks and these are incredibly comfortable. They're not very long lasting and they definitely transfer quite a bit, but they're comfortable. I wish there was more product in them. Additionally, I have issues applying but that could be the size of the wand or my lips, but that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. So many liquid lipsticks I own are uncomfortably dry and don't last as long and don't layer very well at all. These are not a liquid to matte lipstick, but I like them a lot. I highly recommend them.
Rated 5 out of 5 by Ohsofun from Good color payoff and good staying power I actually ordered these in the lip sets 1,2,3,and 5 and recieved 12 different colors. Overall i really like the formulas and color payoffs. The only colors i recieved that were off are industrial paradise and initiator, thatd only because they arent true to color. The liquid suede formula is more of a sticky matte than a true drying matte, but they still have great staying power. The pics of what i recieved are taken in natural light
Watch Your Wallet Sign
How the scam works:
You are walking to a subway station or pass by a parking site. You see a sign. “Watch for your wallet. Pick pocketing in the area”.
Instinctively, you check to see if your wallet is OK. You might not think you're obvious, but a subtle gesture will give it away letting the pick-pockets know where you keep your wallet. They will then follow you until you get to a busy place (train station, bus stop, line-up, etc) where they can successfully operate.
How to avoid:
Don't ever think it can't happen to you! Protect your wallet by carrying it in your inside chest pocket.

neutron star
A neutron star is one of the possible endpoints of stellar evolution. A neutron star, with a mass of 1.4 to 3 solar masses, forms from the collapsing core of a massive star immediately following the star's exhaustion of its fusion energy reserves. With the outflow of radiation from the stellar core suddenly switched off, the core can no longer support the overlying layers against the inward force of gravity. The rapidly mounting pressure of the infalling layers squeezes the electrons and protons of the core together to create neutrons and neutrinos. The neutrinos immediately escape into space but the neutrons crowd closer and closer together until they reach the density of an atomic nucleus. At this stage, if the compressed stellar core is less than the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit of about 3 solar masses, the neutrons are able to resist further collapse. Otherwise, a black hole forms.
The star's collapsing middle layers rebound against the newly-formed solid neutron core. This generates a shock wave which heats and blows off the surface layers as a Type II supernova explosion. Left behind is a rapidly spinning neutron star which has a strong magnetic field with poles that are usually aligned with the pole's of the star's rotation. Two oppositely directed beams of radio waves escape from the poles and sweep around like a lighthouse beam, producing a series of regular radio blips that can be detected from Earth. The result is a pulsar.
A neutron star is typically only about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) across, yet within this small region may be over 2 solar masses of material. The result is a gravitational field at the surface of a neutron star about 70 billion times stronger than that on Earth. Neutron stars have a density of about 1014 grams per cubic centimeter, or roughly a million times that of white dwarfs, so that a sugar-cube-sized sample of neutron star would outweigh the human race. Strangely, the higher the mass of a neutron star, the smaller its radius (gravity pulling the contents in ever more tightly).
In structure, a neutron star more closely resembles a solid, miniature planet than it does an ordinary star. Its core consists mainly of densely-packed neutrons, with a sprinkling of protons and an equal number of electrons, in a liquid-like state known as neutronium. Surrounding this is a mantle topped by a crust, perhaps 1 kilometer thick, consisting of a stiff lattice of nuclei of the same elements as found on Earth through which flows a sea of electrons. The highest possible "mountains" (surface irregularities) rise to a height of about 5 millimeters (0.2 inch), while electrons and heavy nuclei evaporate in the surface temperature of 8,000°C to produce an "atmosphere" maybe a few micrometers thick. As a neutron star cools and shrinks, strains develop in the crust so that it buckles, causing starquakes. Such events are marked by glitches in the otherwise remarkably steady periods of pulsars.
Life either on or in the vicinity of neutron stars may seem extremely unlikely. However, planets have been found around pulsars (see pulsar planets) and the possibility of life on a neutron star has been considered by Frank Drake and explored in fictional form by Robert L. Forward.
Seoul, South Korea - Unused rooftops provide a perfect environment for breeding bees, residents of South Korea's capital Seoul have discovered.
Over the past year, the number of bee hives in the region has almost doubled from 180 to 300.
"Urban bee-keeping lets you realise that people don't exist alone in an urban space, but have to coexist," says Park Jin, the founder of Urban Bees Seoul.
"It shows you the importance of honeybees. Breeding them in a city helps pollination, helping to improve the ecology as well."
Bees, they say, are a welcome addition to the environment.
In a polluted, industrialised city that lacks greenery, Park Jin's bees have to work particularly hard for their nectar.
READ MORE: Saving the bee
Choi Kwang-Bin, a member of the Seoul Metropolitan Government, says environmental issues are high on the agenda.
"Seoul is surrounded by mountains. But daily life, green space within the reach of your hands is more important than greenery you can look at," they said.
"Constantly providing more green space within living areas is one of Seoul's core policies."
It is hoped that greenery will attract more bees. That would help to pollinate more plants as environmentalists foresee a dramatic decline in the global bee population.
While beekeeping cannot reverse the trend, it can raise awareness.
In the largest metropolis of South Korea, people have signed up to study the art of keeping bees in the city, which could cast a greener light over a grey cityscape.
Banned Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal has vowed to fight the ICC ban that has deemed their bowling action illegal, a result of tests carried out at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.
Much like Sri Lankan great Muthiah Muralidaran before him, Ajmal has claimed their elbow is "not usual" and will fight the ban.
Ajmal dismissed the tests of their action as "not an issue" when speaking to reporters in their home town of Faisalabad.
Quick Single: ICC rules all Ajmal deliveries illegal
"My elbow is not usual so that's why it seems that I bend it more than the normal 15 degrees allowed. We will go into appeal soon," Ajmal said.
"I will be in action in the World Cup next year, that's my resolve."
"They're (the ICC) yet to consider my medical reports. Once they do it I am sure there shouldn't be any problem.
"I'm 100% positive and looking forward for the best and by the grace of Allah I will be in the World Cup XI."
Ajmal's focus on a return for the World Cup further clouds their prospect of involvement in Australia's VB Tour of the UAE next month for two Tests, a Twenty20 and three ODIs – where the spinner is still ranked the No.1 bowler in the world by the ICC.
Quick Single: Timeline for Pakistan appeal
Having initially stated it would appeal the ban, the Pakistan Cricket Board has backtracked significantly, and will now refer the matter to a newly-formed Illegal Bowling Action Committee.
Ajmal was reported after last month's first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. They have taken 183 wickets in 111 one-day internationals and 178 wickets in 35 Tests.
Quick Single: Pakistan 'finished' says Latif
The 36-year-old spinner was cleared after being reported for a suspect action in 2009.
Under ICC rules, Ajmal can keep playing domestic cricket during their suspension and can apply for a reassessment at any time – provided they have modified their action.
Quick Single: Ten bowlers banned for throwing
The ICC has also banned Sri Lanka offspinner Sachithra Senanayake and New Zealand's Kane Williamson in the last few months for their bowling actions.
Pakistan's matches against Australia start with a T20 on October 6 in Dubai.
Suspect actions in the news since June
3 June: Sri Lanka off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake is reported for a suspected illegal bowling action and ordered to undergo testing within 21 days.
22 June: New Zealand off-spinner Kane Williamson is reported for a suspected illegal bowling action and ordered to undergo testing within 21 days.
28 June: The ICC Cricket Committee meets in Melbourne and recommends an increased focus on bowlers with questionable actions.
12 July: Senanayake is banned from bowling by the ICC after undergoing official testing in Cardiff.
23 July: Williamson is banned from bowling by the ICC after undergoing official testing in Cardiff.
11 August: Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal is reported for a suspected illegal bowling action and ordered to undergo testing within 21 days.
15 August: The ICC confirms three newly accredited testing centres will be unveiled in the coming months.
22 August: Zimbabwe off-spinner Prosper Utseya is reported for a suspected illegal bowling action and ordered to undergo testing within 21 days.
25 August: Bangladesh off-spinner Sohag Gazi is reported for a suspected illegal bowling action and ordered to undergo testing within 21 days.
25 August: Ajmal begins official testing at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.
9 September: Ajmal banned with immediate effect by ICC. Pakistan Cricket Board say they will weigh up their options, while Ajmal says a medical condition is to blame and they remain confident of playing in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.
Namma Metro
BMRCL has spent Rs 14,292 crore till January 2017. This amount is almost triple the estimated amount of Rs 6,395 crore, which was sanctioned in 2006.
After a six-year delay and failure to meet seven deadlines, the Namma Metro Phase I will be fully open to public by the end of May, if all goes well.
Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited officials maintain that all tests conducted have obtained positive results and the Commissioner of Railway Safety will be invited in the next few days to inspect the Green Line.
“Since the Peenya line is functional, we are able to conduct the tests only at night. We should be able to call the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) for inspection towards the end of this week, and by May we will be opening the stretch for public,” said UA Vasanth Rao, Chief PRO, BMRCL.
“The sub-system installation is complete and testing is going on. The interior finishing works might prevent the line from being opened on the scheduled date. Besides, the CRS will also take their own sweet time to provide the safety certificate,” a senior official said.
The project, which was supposed to be operational in 2011, has failed to meet seven deadlines, the latest being in November 2016. These delays have costed the BMRCL a pretty penny with the current cost of this metro line standing at Rs. 338 crore as opposed to the 2011 estimate of Rs. 194 crore.
“BMRCL has spent Rs 14,292 crore till January 2017. This amount is almost triple the estimated amount of Rs 6,395 crore, which was sanctioned in 2006. The project took off only in 2007 and work began late in 2008,” Rao added.
The costs were further revised due to the increase in land prices due to the delay in work. Finally, in January 2011, the project cost was revised to Rs 11,609 but at the time, both the government and the BMRCL did not anticipate the price escalation, the senior official said.
BMRCL had submitted the latest data pertaining to the project to the Ministry of Urban Development and currently, the approved cost for the project is Rs 14,405 crore. Another official with the BMRCL said that the delay was also cause as the project implementation was affected badly as BMRCL's Managing Directors changes as and when the Karnataka governments changed.
“The MDs are not allowed to work freely and the government officials are always hindering the process. Every government has appointed MDs according to its convenience. They did not take into consideration the sheer amount of money that would be wasted because of unnecessary delays,” the official added.
The irked official also said that there is absolutely no coordination between the government agencies, state agencies and the metro officials.
“There is always a row over every issue, especially transfer of utilities. Take the example of the Ambedkar statue near Vidhana Soudha. They mulled over the issue of removing it or not and delayed the underground project for a year. There are too many agencies involved and all of them work at a snail's pace,” the senior official said.
They said that the government and the BMRCL have to keep in mind all the errors that have occurred during Phase I and try not to succumb to the same during Phase II construction. “The taxpayers will face the brunt of the project as the cost will skyrocket if Phase II does not go according to schedule,” they added.

Steve Nash retired following a successful 19-year career in the NBA, but the 41-year-old may not be done playing sports competitively.
According to Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News, Nash may get a chance to play with the National Premier Soccer League's New York Cosmos B Team.
"The future NBA Hall of Famer trained this week the New York Cosmos B Team of the National Premier Soccer League, the Daily News has learned, and there's a possibility they play Sunday in a game against the Rhode Island Reds," Bondy wrote.
The Cosmos B Team is having a good start to the season, with Bondy noting it currently has an 8-0-1 record entering play Sunday.
Nash is a notorious soccer fan, and this isn't their first foray into the world of professional football. In 2013, Nash had a courtesy tryout with Inter Milan in an effort to bring publicity to the Guinness International Champions Cup tournament in Miami that year. Nash talked about the experience with NBA.com:
"As a lifelong lover of the sport, to get a chance to play with these great players and this great club is a dream come true," they said after that practice two years ago.
Their foundation holds an annual "Showdown" event in cities such as New York and Los Angeles, in which they and other NBA players join forces with professional soccer players in a game to raise money for charity.
Nash's NBA career ended with a whimper, as they went from winning back-to-back MVP awards in 2004-05 and 2005-06 to refusing to retire before their contract with the Los Angeles Lakers ran out so they could get all the money owed to them despite having suffered a season-ending injury.
While Nash and the Lakers' marriage ended without them playing a game last season, the former All-Star point guard is apparently healthy and ready to give their other sport of choice a shot if the New York Cosmos B Team wants him.
New Delhi: Eat together, cycle or walk to nearby places, take stairs not lifts, play outdoor and not spend much time on gadgets, avoid remotes, prefer yoga over treadmill, give books to juniors, and avoid flights and use video conferencing. Do all this, and you could save at least ₹ 10,000 annually on your electricity bills, besides helping the cause of environment by avoiding release of thousands of kilograms of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.
These are just some of the measures among the dozens that the Union environment ministry has suggested in its low-carbon lifestyles toolkit unveiled on Tuesday. It contains a list of practical climate-friendly suggestions that can be adopted by individuals, educational institutions and workplaces, with detailed calculations on how these simple actions can reduce annual CO2 emission and create savings.
Prior to the Paris climate change conference in December, India had pledged a 33-35% cut in carbon emission intensity by 2030, and adopting a sustainable low carbon lifestyle was an integral part of the efforts that India had promised to undertake to cut down carbon emission intensity.
“Low-carbon initiatives lays emphasis that each of us needs to play a strategic role to help the country achieve its targets... It seeks to demonstrate that simple individual actions when adopted can have a significant overall bearing. It arms trainers and users with a wide range of climate-friendly examples and everyday actions which, when aggregated across a larger population, will have significant impacts and contributions towards CO2 reduction for countries and communities to meet their INDCs (intended nationally determined contributions)," the document said.
The toolkit provides a quantitative estimation of the reduction in CO2 emissions at a micro-level and cost savings accrued by implementing the above-mentioned actions.
It suggests people “go out and play instead of watching TV or playing on a device" and emphasises that it can reduce annual electricity bill by ₹ 159-643 and reduce annual CO2 emissions by 22-89kg.
Eating together and heating food at one go can reduce unnecessary use of the microwave oven and in turn reduce electricity bill by ₹ 217 and annual CO2 emissions by 30kg.
Similarly, doing yoga for an hour everyday instead of running on a treadmill can reduce annual electricity bills by ₹ 3,238 and annual CO2 emissions by 46kg.
Maintaining textbooks well and handing them to juniors can result in reduction of annual CO2 emissions by 11,250kg, while sending paper for recycling rather than disposing it in garbage can result in reduction of CO2 emissions by 2,700kg every year.
Taking stairs and reducing 50 lift moves between the ground and third floor can reduce annual electricity bill by ₹ 13,317 and annual CO2 emissions by 1,221kg, the document said.
Using energy-efficient devices for lighting and star-rated electrical appliances, solar appliances like solar water heater, drying clothes in the sun, conserving rainwater, energy and water audit, inflating tyres regularly, managing and reducing food waste, walking to schools and other places nearby and avoiding long flights are among other suggestions.
Last year, in the run-up to the Paris climate change conference in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had enthusiastically taken up the cause of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable consumption across the globe to tackle climate change.
Later, when the new global climate deal was finalized, the agreement recognized that “sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production, with developed country parties taking the lead, play an important role in addressing climate change".
I have had several enquiries this morning (mainly be email) about the article I have in The National in Scotland this morning. Ths is typical:
Are there any risks from attacks on a Scottish currency in international money markets if, say, Scotland was running a big deficit? If the supply of money is independent of that process then presumably there isn't a direct threat, but the currency could still be devalued sufficiently on international foreign currency markets to destabilise the currency couldn't it?
My answer to this is that there is none, but the reasoning needs to be worked through.
Remember currency attacks only work if a government is determined to hold an aspect of its currency management fixed and speculators want to exploit that determination by forcing a change in that aspect of the currency onto the government in a way that will inevitably involve a price change to their advantage. They're not doing this for any other reason, after all.
Let me unpack that a bit. The two things that a government may want to hold fixed with regard to its currency are its value, reflected in the exchange rate, and it is interest rate. The third dependent variable is the amount of debt in circulation, which used to be considered a matter largely beyond its control. I'll return to this third point in a moment and stick with the first two for now.
A government might want to fix an exchange rate for three reasons. First is the old fashioned one of national pride. This departed the scene with floating exchange rates in the 70s. The second is because it has agreed to do so. This was why the UK was vulnerable to attack 1992: it had agreed semi-fixed exchange rates with Europe that speculators knew were economically unsustainable on the basis of trade fundamentals. It laid itself wide open to attack as a result. The third reason is to control inflation. This is pretty much a forlorn hope in exchange rate management: if trade indicates that the currency needs to fall in value come what may it will. A government needs to let that happen and address the domestic issues that necessitated the move in value (lack of investment, poor products, poor productivity) instead of wasting money supporting the currency. It would also better tackle inflation with changes in domestic tax rates than intervene in international markets. The important point is that if it agrees on all these three things it cannot be held to ransom on the exchange rate. The risk disappears.
On interest rates the threat is from the bond markets that might refuse to buy new bonds issues unless the rate rises. This threat was possible when it was thought a government had to sell its bonds come what may - effectively the third, uncontrolled, variable noted above. But this risk no longer exists because QE now eliminates it. If there was now a market based attack on interest rates it would require the sale of bonds already in existence to force their price down. And the answer to that now is that a government would just buy those bonds back and so neuter the attack using QE. The weapon the attackers used - that there was no other buyer for debt and so governments were beholden to markets - has gone because the government can itself be a buyer. The interest rate weapon is history.
To put it another way, Scotland will not be beholden to markets if it chooses not to be so. But it has to have its own central bank and currency to achieve that. Nothing less will do.
POLICE IN NORTHERN Ireland investigating the death of an 11-year-old boy in Antrim believe they may have been attacked by a German Shepherd dog.
Paramedics were called to a home in the Queen's Avenue area of Newtownabbey around midday yesterday.
A neighbour said they heard loud noises coming from the house just before emergency services arrived on scene, according to the BBC.
The area surrounding the house has been cordoned off and forensic officers were examining the scene yesterday evening.
A post-mortem examination is due to take place.
SDLP councillor Noreen McClelland, who attended the scene, said neighbours have been left deeply shocked.
“There are no words to describe the horror in this community – people are just devastated,” McClelland said.
My thoughts and prayers are with the child's family and friends at this horrendous time.
“I know that people will rally around them to offer their support.”
Juventus star Kwadwo Asamoah is being linked with a move to the Premier League.
According to reports from Italy, both West Ham and Southampton have made tentative enquiries into the 28-year-old's situation at Juve.
Asamoah, who can operate on the left side of midfield, at wing back or as an attacking central midfielder is under contract with Juve for a further 12 months but is thought to be surplus to requirements at the Juventus Stadium.* Elsewhere today West Ham are being linked with a multi-million pound move for Sunderland's highly-rated goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.The 23-year-old former England Under 21 international is certain to leave the Stadium of Light this summer but is unlikely to move for a fee less that £20million, having impressed between the sticks for their club last season.* The odds on summer transfer target Kelechi Iheanacho joining West Ham this summer have shortened to 1/4 today following recent news of West Ham's interest.The 20-year-old Nigerian is expected to leave Manchester City during the off season, with the Hammers one of several parties looking to sign the talented young goalscorer.* Robert Snodgrass is being linked with a move away from West Ham - just five months after leaving Hull to join the Hammers in a £10million switch.According to reports newly-promoted Brighton & Hove Albion are intersted in landing the Scottish international, who will almost certainly be allowed to leave for the right price.
S&K Arms ups the ante with indoor gun range in near future

After being in business for only four months, a Midland gun store has established its name among the local gun community. The owners of S&K Arms are building on their success by developing plans to build the region's first indoor shooting range.
“We have seen the market -- mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of an indoor range,” said Danny Anderson, assistant manager at S&K Arms. “This is going to be gun mecca.”
Plans call for the range to have between 20 and 30 lanes, at least six of which will be 100-yard-long ranges. Memberships will be available, but patrons also will have the option to rent a lane for an hour at a time rather than pay for an ongoing membership and will be able to shoot anything from a .22 to a 50 cal., Anderson said. Machine guns will also be available for rent.
Additionally, there will be 6,000 square feet of retail space -- about three times the size of the current location on Midland Drive -- and a dining area for VIP members, Anderson said. The price tag for the facility, expected to open next year, could be as much as $8 million, and investors have already been identified to cover costs, Anderson said.
The expanded S&K Arms, which will be located near the current location, will have the look and feel of a country club, said Anderson, who expects it to draw clientele from as far as Lubbock and, possibly, El Paso.
“I always knew the market for an indoor range was huge,” they said. “What I didn't realize was the market for another country club was also big, as well. It's very hard to get into a country club right now, so this will be another option.”
Their announcement comes not long after S&K Arms employee Charles Browning suffered a gunshot wound while working at the store after hours with a coworker. This incident isn't a reflection of their attention to safety, Anderson said.
“This is going to be safer than any of the other ranges (in the region),” they said.
The shooting, which made headlines earlier this month, is still under investigation, and few details have been released, but the publicity it generated hasn't made a noticeable negative impact on the store's revenue, Anderson said.
“I think people still have questions about what happened,” they said. “Since then, we've had tons of people that have come in and said, ‘I had no idea you guys were here until I heard about you on the news.'”
As planned, the new location will employ off-duty Midland police officers who will monitor range safety, and each bay will be enclosed in several inches of bulletproof glass, steel and concrete, Anderson said.
“This is a market that's definitely been here. It's just that nobody's been able to raise the capital to pull it off, and we're finally able to do that,” Anderson said. “We're lucky to have some people with money behind us.”

British West Florida is administered in the name of Them Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second , by their Acting Governor-General, the Most Honourable Bo Register, Marquess of Mobile . The Governor-General acts as an agent of Them Majesty, functioning for and as the Monarch in Them absence (Vice-Regal). The Marquess of Mobile, as Acting Governor-General maintains both the Dignity and Primacy of the Crown. Neither he, nor the People of British West Florida, will accept anything less than full Allegiance to Them Majesty. British West Florida remains firmly Royalist. The government of British West Florida are staunch advocates of the preservation of the country's historic customs, traditions, and symbols, especially those which link us to our British Past (prior to the Treaty of 1783). We advocate the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the restoration of close political and economic links between Commonwealth Realms. British West Florida rejects any attempts to reduce the Royal Prerogative , holding fast to the British tradition of a Strong Monarch, and Free Subjects, with each respecting the Rights, Duties, and Privileges of the other.The Governor-General acts in accordance with the powers given to them by the Constitution as well as the conventions of the Crown which have been developed and distilled through hundreds of years of constitutional practice.  They are assisted by a Council of State, the House of Lords for West Florida, the House of Commons for West Florida, and Certain Appointed Ministers.The Council of State functions as a Privy Council for the Governor-General, providing advise on a wide range of subjects. The Council serves at the Governor-General's Pleasure.The House of Lords for West Florida is the legislative house of the Parliament whose members are Peers of the Dominion of West Florida. The House of Lords also has a judical role as the final Court of Appeal. The House of Lords may be brought into session by the issue of a Warrant by the Governor-General, or the Lord Marshall of West Florida may issue the Warrant. The Lords may also bring themselves into session by a 2/3 vote of the Lords themselves. If assembled by Warrant, the warrant will provide the Location and Duration of the Assembly, and the Matters to be Discussed. The House of Lords is most often assembled to discuss the 'Matters Presented by the House of Commons', in which case its Location and Duration of assembly would match those of the House of Commons, but the Lords may also assemble as a Court to try Members, as well as to function as a 'delibrative body' to ensure that the Queen and their Governor-General are more fully informed on matters that affect the Realm.The House of Commons for West Florida is the legislative house of the Parliament whose members are NOT peers, that is, who are of the common people. As the House for the Common People, its members elected by the people, not appointed by the Government, nor entitiled by birth. All of the People of British West Florida have a say in selecting the membership of thier House. The House of Commons is brought into session after a Warrant is issued by the Governor-General, or at the end of any five-year period for which a Warrant has not been issued. The Warrant of Assembly will provide the Location and Duration of the session. If the session is not brought by warrant, the assembly is in Pensacloa, and the duration is two weeks. If assembled by Warrant, the Queen or their Governor-General may indicate via the Warrant the matters they desire be discussed, but the House of Commons is free to take up any matter it deems Right and Proper.Certain Ministers are Appointed by the Governor-General to provide the day-to-day oversight and operation of certain Governmental Functions. At present the Governor-General has appointed Guido Zambelis to the post of Solicitor-General, Viscount Chattahooche, Bela Vajay de Vaja is the Surgeon-General, and John Houston to the post of Lord Marshall . The Governor-General has also appointed David John Drew as Poet Laureate for the Dominion of British West Florida.At present, the government is working to rectify certain matters of Sovereignty and Recognition following upon the Treaty of 1783. Special attention should be paid to the terms granting Florida to the Spanish Monarch, Their Catholic Majesty.
Story highlights Ted Cruz does have friends in Washington -- members of the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative group of lawmakers responsible for ousting House Speaker John Boehner
Roughly two-thirds of Cruz's lawmaker endorsements come from Freedom Caucus members
Washington (CNN) There may only be one group of lawmakers that butts heads with the Washington establishment more than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz: Their biggest supporters -- the House Freedom Caucus.
They're the conservative group responsible for ousting House Speaker John Boehner and the ones who agitate for Republicans to hold firm on budgets even as it throws the government into a shutdown. They relish their reputation as king slayers even as they downplay their status as the House's new powerbrokers. And they're the lawmakers happy to call Cruz a friend and happy to share the same enemies with him.
"He has lots of friends here," said Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan. "When you take on the establishment, it's easy to get the rap that you're not liked here. That's because there are a lot of people in party leadership who don't like you if you take them on."
It's not a reputation Cruz runs from. While front-runner Donald Trump has tried to paint Cruz as unlikeable and persona non grata in Washington, that's exactly the reputation Cruz has carefully crafted to appeal to their tea party base. Exit polling has shown an electorate overwhelmingly frustrated and angry with the federal government -- which is in part why the outsider Trump has soared to a strong lead in the election.
Cruz has built their campaign around being a senator who is not actually of Washington -- embracing Trump early in the campaign and spending their time in the Senate making life difficult for Republican leadership. But since Cruz won in Iowa, Trump has won three states in a row. Cruz is now trying to continue their outsider campaign while fending off the "unlikeable" attacks from Trump, the ultimate non-politician.

With the regular season winding down, the focus for the fan bases of some teams has already shifted to the 2016 NHL draft. What better time to take another look at my 2015 NHL draft grades?

The purpose of this column is to show how a team's draft class has changed relative to the league, which is why I grade on a curve. For example, I gave the Toronto Maple Leafs an A, making them a top-3 to a top-5 draft class; even though they've had a lot of impressive performances from their draft class this season, their grade hasn't changed, and they're still in the range of top 3 to top 5.
While most of the teams mentioned below are getting grade boosts, there are teams who went down a grade that I didn't call out simply because the performance of the players went as expected; they just fell down the rankings as other prospects surpassed my expectations.
These are the six teams who I felt have shown the most notable changes in their draft class.
It's not that Edmonton Oilers forward Taylor Hall is expendable following the team's draft lottery victory last Saturday (in order to presumably draft Connor McDavid). It's that, if (and it's a big if) the Oilers opt to move one of their higher-end young stars in order to shore up the team's goaltending/defense, Hall alone possesses the unique combination of:
A huge salary/ salary-cap hit ($6 million) A hugely disappointing last season (38 points in 2014-15) A huge amount of marquee value and top-end skill
Needless to say, any deal involving Hall would be huge as well.
In fact, any deal involving any one of him, Nail Yakupov, Jordan Eberle, or Ryan Nugent-Hopkins would make for a blockbuster. However, Yakupov's value on the trade market would arguably not be high. Eberle is just coming off a stretch during which they scored 12 goals and 22 assists their final 33 games. And Nugent-Hopkins has arguably been more consistent over their career than Hall.
So, if general manager Craig MacTavish (assuming they end up still being the GM), is looking to turn this ship around in a hurry (well, if nine non-playoff seasons constitutes a hurry), they may be able to rationalize moving Hall for a premier goalie. That is of course assuming that is deemed to be the more pressing need relative to the team's defense, with the Oilers having allowed 30 shots per game this season (20th best), but 3.37 goals against (the worst).
Without a blue-chip prospect in the pipeline and neither Ben Scrivens (.890 save percentage) nor pending-UFA Viktor Fasth (.888 save percentage) getting the job done, there is at least a reason to consider it, however fantastical trading a star like Hall may be.
If the Oilers wisely decide not to go the former-backup-with-another-team route again and don't land Boston University goalie Matt O'Connor (who is developing a reputation of letting in bad goals at worse times), here are three hypothetical trade scenarios that might end up working, in increasing order of likelihood:
Taylor Hall to New York Rangers
There are arguably only three teams in the league with a legitimate starting goaltender to “burn” so to speak. One is the New York Rangers, who arguably boast the biggest name of the bunch in Henrik Lundqvist.
With backup Cam Talbot shining in Lundqvist's absence late this season (21-9-4, .926 save percentage and 2.21 goals-against average) with a seventh of the cap hit, New York might decide that Talbot is not only a cheaper but better option and worthy of the starter's role and a long-term contract (UFA after next season)
To Edmonton: Henrik Lundqvist
To New York Rangers: Taylor Hall
Why it would work: The two teams are in opposite conferences and Lundqvist would immediately stabilize Edmonton's goaltending situation, only three years removed from a Vezina Trophy victory.
Why it wouldn't work: Lundqvist is three years removed from a Vezina Trophy and isn't getting any younger.  They are 33 and that's usually around the age at which goalies start to decline. Their save percentage has gone down from .930 in 2011-12 to .920 last year (it was .922 this year, but over just 46 games played). Lundqvist may very well be the goalie Edmonton needs, but for how long?
Lundqvist also has a no-movement clause, and as exciting as the prospect of playing behind Connor McDavid may be, the Oilers will probably be a few years away from competing seriously for the Stanley Cup (or at all, as it's far from a guarantee). Lundqvist probably wants to stay with a winner for however much time they have left. That's New York.
Yeah, it's also New York.
Taylor Hall to Tampa Bay Lightning
Tampa Bay Lightning starter Ben Bishop got nominated for the Vezina last year and is “just” 28. They also don't have one of those pesky no-trade clauses. And everyone has just about appointed backup Andrei Vasilevskiy the title of the next big thing (despite being just 6'3”).
Admittedly, Bishop's .916 save percentage and 2.32 goals-against average leave a little bit to be desired, but last year they did post ones of .924 and 2.23 respectively. At 6'7”, 209 pounds, they also cover a lot of the net. And who out there doesn't want to see a line featuring both Hall and Steven Stamkos (aside from Oilers fans, of course… and fans of every other team besides Tampa)?
To Edmonton: Ben Bishop
To Tampa Bay Lightning: Taylor Hall
Why it would work: The opposite conference argument again holds at least some water and both players have similar cap hits.
Why it wouldn't work: There is simply too much variance in Bishop's stats year to warrant giving up as much as a first-line player like Hall for him. It may be tough, especially for Edmonton, to get a legitimate starter in this league, but Bishop was traded for just a second-round pick in 2012 and ultimately to the Lightning for bust Cory Conacher (and a pick).
If Bishop were legitimately available, the Oilers should theoretically be able to get them for much less than Hall (Yakupov, maybe?) or have the Lightning throw in one of their umpteen ready-for-primetime prospects. And even then that's assuming Bishop would be able to step right in like they did in Tampa and dominate. Giving up Hall may not be worth taking the risk that lightning ends up striking twice.
Taylor Hall to Anaheim Ducks
While Frederik Andersen is Anaheim's No. 1 goalie for now, he's almost on borrowed time with 21-year-old blue-chipper John Gibson chomping at the bit for a go. Andersen is no doubt a very good starter, but Gibson could very well be an elite goalie. The general consensus is it's not a matter of “if” but “when”, and maybe “why not somewhere else.”
Plus there's that whole elephant in the room of a potential Taylor Hall-Ryan Getzlaf-Corey Perry line combination. If Hall playing with Stamkos would be a sight to see, Hall playing with Getzlaf and Perry just might blind some people.
Anaheim has been looking for the perfect fit for its two stars for some time. Hall would fit in anywhere. It's not rocket science.
To Edmonton: John Gibson and Francois Beauchemin (limited no-movement clause) + a first-round pick or one of Sami Vatanen or Hampus Lindholm
To Anaheim Ducks: Taylor Hall
Why it would work: Even though the two teams aren't just in the same conference but the same Pacific Division, they have a history of blockbuster trades (see Pronger, Chris).
Why it wouldn't work: Again, these two teams have a history together (see Schultz, Justin). Even if you were to argue that the Pronger deal worked out well for both sides (Edmonton did get Eberle out of it), the Schultz signing should serve as a cautionary tale in regard to how blue-chip prospects are never a sure thing.
It's not like Schultz is a bad player or anything, but the hype surrounding them at the time they became an unrestricted free agent and got signed by Edmonton in 2012 was such that they were the defenseman that would single-handedly turn around the team's defense. There's a similar hype surrounding Gibson.
Even though, in such a deal, Edmonton could likely command a top-end defenseman from Anaheim as well, like the aging (pending-UFA) Francois Beauchemin (who finished fourth in Norris Memorial Trophy voting in 2013) or even one of the Ducks' younger, impressive studs in Hampus Lindholm or Sami Vatanen, there are still a lot of question marks here.
If Schultz wasn't the answer on an Edmonton team that has multiple holes that need filling, Gibson would likely just struggle as well, risking their development in the process with that much more pressure on him. It makes one wonder how McDavid would fare as well.
Wait and see, maybe. In regard to Hall as well. That's probably the best (and likeliest) solution out there. If McDavid is as good as everyone says, they can probably end up suiting in net too. But, again… no pressure or anything. They would probably do just fine feed Hall and vice versa.
Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin may have agreed on a custody arrangement for their son out of court, but they're anything but amicable exes! The Teen Mom 2 star exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com their thoughts on their estranged wife's wild behavior during their deployment.
Lowry, 24, underwent plastic surgery when they got a Brazilian butt lift, tummy tuck and liposuction of their neck soon after their estranged husband's deployment in January.
“I knew their surgery would change her,” they exclusively told Radar.

After announcing their divorce from Marroquin, 24, in May, Lowry turned to longtime friend Becky Hayter only weeks later by sharing a same-sex kiss.
“That was dumb,” they said of the romance. “I didn't really care about that. Not my image, it's hers.”
Although Marroquin recently revealed to Radar that they plan to write a book exposing “what they actually did that ended the marriage,” they refused to reveal if they cheated on them while they were away.

“I'm gonna keep my mouth shut until the time is right,” they said.
From Lowry moving on so quickly to cryptic tweets by Marroquin, cheating rumors soon developed.
“What's done in the night will show in the light,” they tweeted in June, adding, “All of y'all that looked me in the face and didn't say anything… Dead to me.”
Do you think Lowry cheated? Tell us in the comments!
Recording public perceptions of risk would give society a more holistic view on whether our roads are getting safer or not
Oranges, as we all know, are not the only fruit. And casualty statistics are not the only way to measure road safety. But neither ministers nor MPs seem able to challenge conventional wisdom and inject fresh ideas into how to make our roads safer for everybody.
As a one-time lobby journalist, I'm quite used to the waffle and fudge served up by parliamentary select committees. Most MPs lack the forensic skills to question the assumptions that underlie the bland evidence of ministers and other witnesses.
Nowhere is this truer than in the area of road safety. This week's report on the government's road safety framework by the Commons transport committee, which has been several months in preparation, is disappointing even by the low standards of Westminster.
Road safety, as I have discovered as a local cycling activist in west Kent, is a cosy world dominated by the needs and expectations of motorists. The conventional view from behind the steering wheel is rarely questioned, and even cycling campaigners seem often reluctant to break up the consensus.
Faced with complacent presentations by junior ministers Mike Penning and Norman Baker, the committee, chaired by Labour stalwart Louise Ellman, accused the government of using its "localism" agenda to disguise a general failure of leadership, especially on cycling. One cheer for that, one might think.
But the report fails to endorse or even investigate the most significant local road safety initiative of the past five years, the introduction of default 20mph limits for residential streets in cities such as Portsmouth and Oxford. Instead, it wastes much time and space on a theological discussion about road safety targets.
There are other flaws in the report, but the most serious is the unquestioning acceptance of the conventional wisdom that road safety is defined exclusively in terms of casualty and accident statistics. A road is "safe" for cyclists or children if there are no accidents involving cyclists or children.
I live in Kent, where requests for traffic calming, speed enforcement, better pedestrian crossings and lower limits are routinely dismissed on the grounds that "KSI" statistics – the number of killed and seriously injured – are low or non-existent.
Of course reducing the number of crashes and casualties is important. But the narrow focus on "crash remedial measures" and the quantifiable cost of serious accidents is highly misleading. There are many roads where I live where no cyclists dare venture because they are simply too dangerous. So the A25 across Kent is statistically "safe" for cyclists – but only because they all avoid it.
My residential street becomes a rat-run twice a day for commuters; parents cannot allow their children to go to school unaccompanied, elderly people stay at home because they can't cross the road safely, and mothers with pushchairs prefer to put their children in the car rather than walking to the shops. None of these road safety problems even register under the current crash-focused orthodoxy.
The government has identified the high level of child casualties in deprived areas as a priority area for action. But the relative absence of child casualties in more prosperous areas does not mean there isn't a road safety problem; it simply means it is disguised; middle class parents counter the risks of speeding traffic by keeping their children indoors.
Until last year, national KSI figures were falling. That's good – but it does not mean roads are getting safer, especially for vulnerable users. The decline in deaths and injuries is a result of changes in car design, and of big improvements in NHS treatment. Like battlefield casualties in Afghanistan, drivers and passengers now have a much better chance of survival than ever before, despite cars becoming bigger and faster.
Raw statistics never tell the whole story, and exclusive reliance on them can lead to absurd outcomes. The easiest way to reduce cycle casualties to zero would be to ban the use of bikes altogether. This is the catch-22 logic of road safety, which very few experts seem to question.
The question I would have liked to hear MPs put to ministers is about whether public perceptions of risk on the roads are rising or falling, especially for non-motorised users.
But the Department for Transport doesn't measure perceptions, only crash statistics. It should copy the Home Office, which annually supplements its crime statistics by publishing the British Crime Survey, that measures perceptions. Then we might come closer to a more holistic view of whether our roads are really getting safer or more dangerous.
The Association of Independent Research Chemical Retailers (AIRCR) is a collection of largely UK based research chemical vendors who have banded together in a stated attempt at creating a self-regulating organization. The motivation apparently was a result of the wide-scale scams and misrepresentation of product that occurred as the easy money of mephedrone sales started to dry up due to government regulation.
A noble goal indeed, as even before this the research chemical scene as a whole was not exactly a shining example of professionalism and restraint. Self-regulating organizations have a strong track record in many fields including finance, law, medicine, and engineering, and can demonstrate the ability of the market to regulate itself without requiring explicit government oversight. They can also quickly shift from self-regulating to self-serving organizations as their structures may encourage monopolistic behavior and cronyism.
AIRCR initially appeared to sit almost precisely between these two extremes. There was no question that after the March 2010 ban of mephedrone in the UK many research chemical vendors scrambled to provide any substitute product at all to the seething masses who had gotten used to the cheap and staggeringly effective drug. Hyperpotent long-lasting toxic stimulants, existing (and now illegal) mephedrone stocks rebranded and sold with nonsense chemical formulas, and simply fake product had created mass disillusionment within many retail customers, and retailers began to panic as they saw sales volumes plummet.
The retail strategy of AIRCR seems to be best outlined by the approach of a group of several UK based websites who are now AIRCR members. Their first mainstream exclusive compound 6-APB (“Benzo Fury”) was based off the structure of the classic MDA. Correctly identifying that the major issues leading to prohibition of mephedrone were indiscriminate doses and widely available cheap product, 6-APB was produced in limited runs and pressed into “pellets” (not pills, which would imply human consumption and not “research” of course). Presumably the hope was that with a more expensive product divided up into an appropriate dose overconsumption would be less of an issue. By having a monopoly on production and controlling supply, the compound could be rationed via economic pressures to those most likely to use it correctly – and more importantly, to those least likely to create unwanted media attention. While less profitable month to month than the wide-scale sales of mephedrone, it would hopefully provide a more consistent cash flow, few competitive pressures, and a longer production run leading to a better structured business model.
For new recreational entheogens with limited reinforcing characteristics this business model, while far from perfect, is a rational approach to the current regulatory environment. Retail levels sales to end users are largely tolerated if media attention and underage use is limited, a sort of “don't ask, don't tell” of the drug world. But with their latest product, AIRCR has succumbed completely to the temptations of monopoly and have fixed a noose about their own neck.
The compound in question is literally trademarked by AIRCR as methiopropamine, presumably to distract from the more conventional nomenclature of methamthetamine. The similarity to the much-demonized methamphetamine is no coincidence, as it can be thought of as methamphetamine where the phenyl group is replaced by a sulfur-containing thiophene group. Typically the replacement of a phenyl with a thiophene in this class of compounds results in increased inhibition of VMAT, which can be correlated with increased reinforcement and addictive effects. Preliminary tests appear to indicate similar qualitative effects to methamphetamine, a shorter duration, slightly lower potency, and more peripheral effects including vasoconstriction and sweating.
It seems almost a foregone conclusion to say that sales of a research chemical with this level of behavioural reinforcement and close structural similarity to one of the most publicly demonized drugs of our time will not end well. Supply controls will likely be insufficient to limit media attention, and these very supply controls are likely to be quickly circumvented as synthesis and precursors will be vigorously investigated by other labs wanting to get in on a fast buck. A shame that the first public attempt at self-regulation in the research chemical industry could fall to temptation so quickly.
Farewell AIRCR, we hardly knew ye.

The thing about drafting is that at any stage in the draft any of these questions could plausibly be relevant and could plausibly influence a drafter's decision-making. And these are just a few of the considerations. There are many many more.
So when you're watching or casting or analysing a game and a drafter makes a move you find surprising, it's probably best to try to figure out what kind of thinking went into that pick rather than selecting your own favourite drafting criterion and evaluating the pick against that.
‘Why would they first pick that hero? Nobody is going to ban it!' is a pretty flimsy analysis. It might, for example, be a good pick to force a reaction from the enemy or hide your plans or maybe it's the vital component of your strategy. The same applies to something like ‘that is a bad pick because it's already countered by X pick in the enemy's draft'. Depending on your overall approach to the game, specific counters could play out very differently. Usually a Storm Spirit is difficult to beat without good disables. But another way to counter it is by grouping up and taking objectives before it can farm key items.
OG are often not afraid to declare the direction of their draft from the first phase.
And so on. The comments above do raise relevant considerations and of course there are times where they should be the dominant consideration and the drafter's choice really is a mistake. But the process is complex and nuanced and to understand a drafter's decision you need to be generous in your analysis and try figure out their mindset at that moment.
Drafting approaches
Obviously, there is no drafter who is ever considering all of the relevant considerations when making a pick. And there are numerous different overall approaches to drafting. The clearest dichotomy is between drafting proactively or reactively. Of course these approaches exist on a spectrum but most teams will fall closer to one side than the other. In the current metagame reactive drafting is a lot more popular. A lot of teams don't like showing their carry before the enemy team shows their offlaner and vice versa. A lot of teams don't like showing their mid before the enemy team shows theirs. And so on.
One advantage of drafting proactively (usually strategies that are largely prepared) is that you will have more experience with your draft than your opponent with theirs. They are also forced to react to you, giving you first move advantage. Furthermore, having a prepared idea means your team is guaranteed to be on the same page about what each player's role is and how the draft is meant to come together to ultimately win the game.
One requirement for drafting this way is enough confidence in your ideas that you believe you can win even with an informational asymmetry. Good examples of a heavily proactive approach are OG, TI5 CDEC and the current Fnatic team.
An advantage of drafting reactively is that in theory you can have the optimal pick or ban in every single instance. In practice this is extremely difficult but in the ideal world you're going to outdraft your opponent in every single game. Another advantage is that your draft itself is unlikely to be hard countered in any way.
One requirement for drafting this way is to have extremely adaptable players who are able to play almost any hero and almost any playstyle. Good examples of a heavily reactive approach are 2014 DK, ppd's EG and 2016 Wings.
Proactive vs reactive is one of many ways to slice up your approach to drafting. And within any given approach, there's still going to be countless factors to consider before each pick. Even if you've prepared your entire draft in advance, you're still going to have to decide what order to pick heroes in. Should you pick the least replaceable hero first or the one that gives away the least information? Should you ban things that you think will be very hard to beat but your opponents don't usually pick or things that will only be a little hard to beat but that they pick very regularly?
At TI5 CDEC committed to a drafting approach which suited the patch and, equally importantly, suited their players.
Metagame considerations
Drafting isn't just about ‘figuring out the meta'. In fact for teams wanting to be the very best, it's often about crafting one. Most of what we refer to as metagame is not dictated by the game itself in any direct way. There are times when something is so strong that it forces itself into a metagame but most of the time metagame depends in equal part on the game itself and on subjective preferences and trends.
Someone tries something in a few pubs and it feels good. They bring it to a professional match. It works there too. Other teams copy it. Very quickly it's considered ‘in the meta'. It wasn't last week, and the game hasn't changed. Usually what has changed is what teams are wanting to do. Yes, that often means someone figured something out about the game. But whether or not the meta at any given time reflects some kind of idealised ‘best possible metagame' is an entirely different question. Sometimes metagames are even cyclical, each consecutive meta simply following as a response to the previous one.
And even if you think you have a great understanding of a given metagame, you're still always constrained by what your team is good at doing or comfortable doing. And you still get to decide if you want to ‘play the meta' or counter it.
For decades, Wunsiedel, a German town near the Czech border, has struggled with a parade of unwanted visitors. It was the original burial place of one of Adolf Hitler's deputies, a man named Rudolf Hess. And every year, to residents' chagrin, neo-Nazis marched to their grave site. The town had staged counterdemonstrations to dissuade these pilgrims. In 2011 it had exhumed Hess's body and even removed their grave stone. But undeterred, the neo-Nazis returned. So in 2014, the town tried a different tactic: humorous subversion.
The campaign, called Rechts Gegen Rechts — the Right Against the Right — turned the march into Germany's “most involuntary walkathon.” For every meter the neo-Nazis marched, local residents and businesses pledged to donate 10 euros (then equivalent to about $12.50) to a program that helps people leave right-wing extremist groups, called EXIT Deutschland.
They turned the march into a mock sporting event. Someone stenciled onto the street “start,” a halfway mark and a finish line, as if it were a race. Colorful signs with silly slogans festooned the route. “If only the Führer knew!” read one. “Mein Mampf!” (my munch) read another that hung over a table of bananas. A sign at the end of the route thanked the marchers for their contribution to the anti-Nazi cause — €10,000 (close to $12,000). And someone showered the marchers with rainbow confetti at the finish line.
The approach has spread to several other German towns and one in Sweden (where it was billed as Nazis Against Nazis).
Everton have enjoyed success with signings from the lower leagues.
Everton have agreed a deal to sign promising Bury defender Matty Foulds, sources have told ESPN FC.
As revealed by ESPN FC earlier this month, Everton and Aston Villa tabled bids for the teenager after they attracted the attention of a number of Premier League clubs.
Foulds, 17, has broken into the Bury first-team this season, making two appearances for the League One club in cup competitions.
They caught the eye in the Capital One Cup defeat to Leicester City in August, and although they have yet to make their league debut they have been on the bench for every game since.
Everton have fought off competition from Premier League and Championship clubs to land Foulds, with the player expected to seal their move in January.
The Merseysiders have enjoyed success in signing promising young talents from the Football League in recent years, with John Stones, Bredan Galloway, Luke Garbutt and Mason Holgate all making the breakthrough at Goodison Park.
Alzheimer's, arthritis and multiple sclerosis treatments could be improved by Queensland scientists' development of MCC950 molecule
Updated
A Queensland discovery could be the key to improved treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
Scientists at the University of Queensland worked with an international team to develop a molecule that fights one of the main causes of inflammatory diseases, a breakthrough researchers say could lead to safer and cheaper treatments.
Professor Matt Cooper, from the University's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, said the molecule known as MCC950 could help prevent inflammation in immune cells.
"It is one of the first molecules we've ever seen that can attack this complex we call the inflammasome – and that's in every one of our immune cells, it's a key part of our response to infection," they said.
"But when it goes wrong, it activates these cells so then people become chronically agitated and [their] immune system goes into overdrive."
Professor Cooper said the molecule was tested on animals and blood samples from patients in the US.
"Patients have donated blood samples, these are patients with a very severe form of inflammation called Muckle-Wells syndrome," they said.
"We can see in those patients this immune response, this inflammasome is overactive and when we give the compound to those blood samples in a laboratory we can stop that process."
Professor Cooper pointed out the new molecule could be taken orally and would be cheaper to produce than current protein-based treatments.
"This is a very small molecule and passes from the gut into your bloodstream very quickly," they said.
"But it also means it can go places that proteins can't get ... particularly in the brain, and with multiple sclerosis into the CNS – the central nervous system."
Professor Cooper said it was not clear whether the molecule could cure inflammatory diseases or just treat the symptoms.
The study is an international collaboration with scientists from the United States, Trinity College in Dublin and Germany. The next step is clinical trials.
The research was published in the journal Nature Medicine.

Spain's Victor Del Corral won Ironman Florida this past weekend with a superb 7:53:12. In so doing Del Corral had to overcome the fastest bike split ever produced in an Ironman, 4:02:17, by Andrew Starykowicz. Del Corral needed everything to overhaul Starky – who did not fold after their overwhelming ride – in the final miles of the run.
But Del Corral faces a DQ, not because they drafted, or cut the course, but because they used a helmet worn many times by many athletes while racing in the United States. Del Corral raced with an Ekoi CXR13. This is not a CPSC-certified helmet. One of the images you see contained here is the CXR13, snapped by our editor-in-chief Herbert Krabel, during bike check-in the day before this year's Hawaiian Ironman World Championship. The other image is of this helmet aboard the winner of that race, Frederick Van Lierde, in a pic taken by Timothy Carlson.
Why is this helmet legal in Hawaii but not in Florida? Because USA Triathlon, sanctioner of both races race, grants a dispensation from the strict CPSC-only rule for world championships WTC produces in Las Vegas and Kona, only because there are so many foreign athletes entered in these races and it would cause mayhem for this athlete to be turned away because they don't have conforming helmets. However nearly half the contestants in the 2,800-person Ironman Florida came from a foreign country, and this race is not exempted from the CPSC requirement. This means not only Del Corral races with a CE helmet, very likely more than 1000 of the event's contestants did not wear a CPSC helmet (it is not WTC's policy to check every helmet for a CPSC sticker, nor does USAT require this of WTC).
Could these foreign athletes buy CPSC helmets prior to the race? In Europe or Australia? Europe has its own standard, analogous to the CPSC (Consumer Products Safety Commission), and the designation is CE. Japan and Australia have their own certifications and it is even against traffic laws to ride a bike anywhere in Australia without a helmet that meets the Australian standard. In other words, no, you cannot buy a CPSC helmet in these other countries for the same reason you cannot legally sell a non-CPSC helmet in the United States.
The exception to this is in athletic events, where reciprocity in helmet standards is honored. I have yet to find a single American athlete turned away from, or disqualified from, a race on non-U.S. soil because they or they arrived with a CPSC helmet. The great majority if not all other countries honor the CPSC sticker.
Barbara Riveros, the talented Chilean pro, was turned away from racing at HyVee because their Specialized Evade helmet had a non native sticker inside. "I got the helmet without sticker but a local Specialized dealer fix it for me so I trust them. I used this helmet one race before Hyvee in the USA and it was fine," said Riveros to slowtwitch. But no matter what was argued, Riveros was still not allowed to race because it was not the original CPSC sticker.
It's common for a helmet maker to manufacture two very similar helmets and place in these helmets the sticker specific to the country or continent of sale. In defense of the helmet decision made at HyVee, because the CE standard allows for a lighter helmet, some helmet makers manufacture to the CE standard, to meet the competitive needs of that market – and then make changes to the helmet, including an increase in the density of the foam – to make the helmet CPSC-compliant. Consequently, it might not be as ministerial as looking at Ms. Riveros' Specialized Evade and knowing that, while the helmet is CPSC-certified in the U.S. it is necessary built to that standard if they got it in Europe.
“The rules are the rules whether we like them or not,” wrote one Slowtwitcher on a thread on this subject of helmets used during Ironman Florida. He's absolutely right. You can't preach that the process trumps the outcome if you're only willing to follow the process when it suits you. But let's look at the rule. This is from the USA Triathlon's rulebook. 5.9(a):
“Type of Helmet. All participants shall wear a protective head cover, undamaged and unaltered, which meets or exceeds the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Helmets manufactured prior to March 10, 1999 must meet or exceed the safety standards of (i) the American National Standard Institute (ANSI Z-90.4), (ii) The Snell Memorial Foundation (Protective Headgear for Bicycle Users), or (iii) ASTM F-1446 or F-1447, and which is clearly labeled by the manufacturer as satisfying such standards. Removal of helmet cover, if required for that helmet to meet such safety standards, shall constitute an impermissible alteration in violation of this Section 5.9(a). Any violation of this Section 5.9(a) shall result in disqualification.”
I'll strip it out the relevant part of this rule and reproduce it below so that we can focus on it:
All participants shall wear a protective head cover, undamaged and unaltered, which meets or exceeds the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
Three things seem to me to be relevant, and to make common sense: First, that the helmet need not be a CPSC-certified helmet, but must be a helmet that is as safe as a CPSC helmet. Second, that no sticker must be in the helmet. Certainly it's easier for an official checking helmets if a sticker is in the helmet, but, the rules are the rules whether we like them or not. No sticker required, except for those Ansi or Snell helmets manufactured before 1999.
Third, it is not even a requirement that the helmet meet CPSC standards required for certification. It is required that it meet the safety standards the CPSC requires for certification. I can certainly imagine a case where a helmet would meet all safety standards, but has not yet met whatever procedural or financial hurdles required to get the sticker.
Is a CE helmet as safe as a CPSC helmet? That's not a straightforward question to answer. Clint Mattacola does helmet R&D for Specialized Bicycles and works specifically in “World Wide Compliance and Documentation.” Does a CE helmet, in all relevant ways, meet or exceet the CPSC safety standard? “The short answer is no,” says Mattacola, “A CE certified helmet does not meet the CPSC standard.”
But it's not quite that simple. What Mattacola goes on to say is that it might meet the CPSC standard but you don't know unless you test it, and unless it bears the sticker you don't know if it's been tested to that standard. “Is the CE certification one that a helmet can pass while still falling short of meeting the safety standards of the CPSC?” asks Mattacola. “You don't know until you test the helmet to the CPSC standard.”
What is the difference between the CE & CPSC standards? “Several things differ but the most prominent is the hemispherical anvil impact and the number of impacts per helmet,” answers Mattacola. “CPSC requires that you impact the helmet against 3 anvils: flat, curb and hemispherical. CE requires only flat and curb, no hemispherical impact is required for CE certification.” Also, “The number of impacts required to certify a helmet to the CE standard is 2 impacts per helmet, one flat and one curb. The CPSC standard requires 4 impacts per helmet 2 flat and 2 hemispherical on 50% of the samples and one curb impact on 50% of the samples.”
Does this mean that a CPSC helmet is safer than a CE helmet? Not necessarily. It is probably more safe in very high impact crashes, because of the higher density foam required to pass the anvil tests described above. Some make the argument that a CE helmet is more safe in a lower-velocity crash that might be more typical of the majority of bike crashes. But it's impossible to know because we don't use human subjects as bicycle helmet crash test dummies.
But this discussion misses what seems to be some crucial points. USA Triathlon allows helmets to predate the CPSC's involvement in helmet certification. As you see from the rule above, a helmet made pre-1999 must bear a Snell or Ansi sticker (this is the only sticker requirement in the rule). But this rule has not changed in a long time and one must ponder the wisdom of allowing a helmet that's 14 years old or older. A CE helmet made today is certainly much safer than a CPSC-stickered helmet made a decade ago or an ANSI-stickered helmet made two decades ago. A CE helmet purchased this year is arguably safer, in any kind of crash, than the mean safety performance of all the CPSC, ANSI and Snell helmets in the transition area of any race today.
In other words, are we looking at the wrong metrics? Should we be looking at not only the safety of the helmet when it was built, but the age of the helmet? Today's helmets, whether Australian (AS/NZS 2063), CPSC and CE, are pretty safe. What about helmets made a long time ago? Should we allow them in the race? Certainly you don't want to disenfranchise people by disallowing their helmets, but right now there are thousands of athletes who've purchased wetsuits and swimskins costing from $200 to $700, only 3 or 4 years ago, who are disenfranchised.
Who has the toughest safety standards on the planet? Australia. It's standard is called AS/NZS 2063 and it's universally accepted as the world's most stringent. Australia was the first country to make helmets compulsory while riding on the road, and it's not just illegal to sell helmets that are not AS/NZS 2063-certified helmet, you must also ride a helmet bearing that certification.
Except in competition. Here's the rule in Australia, in triathlon, per Triathlon Australia's rulebook, (3.3): “Bicycle helmets are compulsory and must be approved by a testing authority which is recognised by a national federation that is an affiliate of the International Triathlon Union (ITU).”
And, while CPSC or Department of Transportation motorcycle helmets are not allowed for motorcycle riding in Germany (U.S. servicemen are compelled to buy CE motorcycle helmets when billeted in that country), only the U.S. fails to honor helmet standard reciprocity while racing in another country.
Even Edward Becker, executive director of the Snell Foundation, an ardent supporter of tough helmet standards and a champion of the CPSC's rigorous requirements told me, when asked what the most practical solution was to this problem of athletes traveling to race on foreign soil, that they favored requiring each athlete have a helmet that (at a minimum) conformed to their or their country's helmet standard.
For years this issue has been languishing at the mid-level of governance in the U.S. Ben Fertic would routinely privately rail against the CPSC requirement, and he's been out as CEO of WTC for 2-and-a-half years. Finally the big ship is turning as the USA Triathlon seeks both to harmonize with the rules of competition used worldwide (a stated goal of USAT's for some years now), and to keep onerous rules from ruining the race experience of those who in every other way respect and abide by standards of fair and safe racing. A panel convened to review rules of competition is looking at all rules and practices at variance with those used in other countries and the helmet rule is among them.
That's good. However, as stated, officials ruling on helmet issues like that of Ms. Riveros and affecting Mr. Del Corral today are not required to demand either a CPSC sticker or even that the helmet is CPSC-certified. It's not required in USAT's rules, and it's not creating havoc with USAT's insurer. I have yet to find (I've tried, I've asked) anyone associated with USAT's insurance to show me any evidence that an underwriter at a carrier is even familiar with the issue, let alone fixed on specific text in the helmet rule.
Bear in mind the implications of the helmet rule as it has been interpreted. Close to half the roughly 2,800 participants at Ironman Florida came from foreign countries, chiefly from the Eastern or Southern Hemispheres. Most of these countries live under correspondingly similar laws as those governing helmet sales in the U.S., specifically, that they have their own helmet safety standards and helmets sold in those countries must meet them.
Therefore, technically, under today's understanding of USAT's helmet rule, a CPSC helmet must be worn by every competitor. Some number between 1000 and 1,400 athletes alighting on U.S. Soil to compete in Ironman Florida is required to wear a helmet unobtainable in the country in which they live. They must fly to Panama City and queue up for the more-than-1000 helmets sold – where? Walmart? – in order to meet the rule's requirement. This, while on the same weekend Americans flew to race in Noosa, Australia – a country with a stricter helmet standard than the CPSC's – where reciprocity is the rule.
Caroline Pollock Bilicki felt uneasy about the new education program introduced this year at their children's Chicago school.
Summit Basecamp, built with the help of Facebook engineers, was billed as a powerful tool that could reshape how students learn. Dozens of schools nationwide have signed up to use the program, which tailors lessons to individual students using software that tracks their progress.
But it also captures a stream of data, and Bilicki had to sign a consent form for their children to participate, allowing their personal data to be shared with companies such as Facebook and Google. That data, the form said, could include names, email addresses, schoolwork, grades and Internet activity. Summit Basecamp promised to limit its use of the information - barring it from being used, for example, to deliver targeted ads - but Bilicki agonized over whether to sign the form.
"I'm not comfortable with having my kids' personally identifiable information going to I don't even know where, to be used for I'm not sure what," they said.
A joint project of Facebook and the high-performing charter-school network Summit Public Schools, Basecamp is an example of an increasingly popular education trend - data-driven "personalized learning." Its most fervent backers have framed it as the next big thing in education, reimagining how classrooms work and allowing teachers to reach students across a wide spectrum.
But as the Summit program and others like it have expanded, concerns such as Bilicki's have emerged, highlighting the tension between the promise and the potential perils of new classroom technologies. Some parents, researchers and privacy advocates worry about what information is being collected and how it is being used. Education experts warn that while using computers to personalize teaching might prove transformative, its effectiveness remains largely unproven.
None of that has dampened enthusiasm for Summit Basecamp. About 20,000 students in more than 100 charter and traditional public schools, including in the D.C. area, are working with the program, a rapid expansion from a handful of West Coast schools two years ago.
"We're pushing really hard to make it so it can go to as many who want it next year and in the future," said Diane Tavenner, chief executive of Summit, which runs schools in California and Washington state. The network provides Basecamp to other schools at no cost, aided by the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others.
Tavenner said Summit's success - especially with low-income children, who account for half of its students - has drawn a steady stream of educators who want to duplicate it. In the classroom, personalization means students set goals for their own performance each day. One student might be watching a video about calculating the area of a circle while another reads about proportions and ratios.
Even as Basecamp and countless other tech-centered programs have taken off, there are few independent studies of the programs' effectiveness, researchers say. "We really don't know that much about personalized learning," said Monica Bulger, senior researcher at the Data and Society Research Institute in New York.
Yet the demand is surging as teachers and schools look for ways to close the nation's stubborn achievement gaps.
"There's a lot of hype," said Joel Reidenberg, a Fordham University law professor who researches student privacy. "In effect, they are experimenting on children."
Tavenner acknowledged the lack of published studies on Basecamp's results. But they said the approach, based on research on how children learn, has worked well at Summit schools: Almost all graduates are accepted to four-year colleges, and they graduate from college at double the national rate.
And there is ample evidence that the status quo is not good enough, Tavenner said.
"What we are literally doing right now we know undeniably does not work for a huge number of kids in our country," they said. "I'm just not compelled by the argument that we need to keep doing that."
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, wife donate $120M to California schools Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and their wife, Priscilla Chan, are donating $120 million to the San Francisco Bay Area's public school system. The couple's gift will be spread over the next five years.

Summit officials said personalization used to be a laborious, largely pen-and-paper affair. Then Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who has made personalized learning one of the focal points of their philanthropy - came into the picture, agreeing to donate the social-media company's help after a tour of a Summit school in 2013.
Now, Facebook supplies 20 engineers, product managers and designers to work full time on the Summit software, said Mike Sego, the Facebook team's engineering director.
The team accesses student data sometimes, Sego said, but only to improve the software.
Sego emphasized limits on Facebook's role: The project is not housed on Facebook servers. The software does not use Facebook log-ins. Cooperation between the two companies is limited to software development.
"We're not thinking of this as a business," Sego said. "We're focused on making the Summit Personalized Learning Platform better for teachers and students, and we have a lot of work to do."
But the involvement of a tech giant - and one with a history of privacy infractions - has been unsettling to some parents.
Student data privacy has emerged as a concern in recent years, driven by worries that the 40-year-old federal education privacy law fails to protect students from risks inherent in new classroom technologies.
A watershed moment came in 2014, when privacy concerns forced the nonprofit InBloom to fold. The $100 million project had aimed to harness the power of big data to improve education by collecting and sharing potentially sensitive information about students, including about discipline, disabilities, family relationships and socioeconomic status.
Summit officials say they are collecting only limited student data necessary to run the software and sharing it only for educational purposes. But activist Leonie Haimson, who led the charge against InBloom, said they believe Basecamp's privacy terms are written so broadly that they "basically require parents to give up all rights to their children's privacy."
Basecamp's terms of service allow Summit to share student data with any company it deems necessary. Use of the data would then be governed by that company's privacy guidelines, which could be more permissive.
"It does say that we can share with anybody if we think we should, and you the parent are consenting to it. You're giving us complete discretion," said Nate Cardozo, a privacy lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who said they did not find the terms troubling so much as "sloppy."
Tavenner, the Summit CEO, said they understand the privacy concerns because they are a parent, too. Them 14-year-old son uses the Basecamp platform at a Summit school, and they feel confident that the terms are strong enough to protect their privacy. The parents of just four of Summit's students have contacted the school with questions or concerns about Basecamp's data privacy, they said.
Experts praise Basecamp for requiring parental consent, pointing out that other ed-tech companies, including Google - which has education apps that more than 50 million students and teachers use - simply publish their privacy terms in a fine print that most parents never see.
But the Basecamp terms also require disputes to be resolved through arbitration, essentially barring a student's family from suing if they think data has been misused.
In other realms, including banking and health care, such binding arbitration clauses have been criticized as stripping consumers of their rights.
Tavenner said they could not put Summit, a network of charter schools, at risk of legal action.
"We're offering this for free to people," they said. "If we don't protect the organization, anyone could sue us for anything - which seems crazy to me."
Bobby Jindal signs student privacy bill pushed by Common Core opponents Law will add significant new layers of security to prevent data about Louisiana elementary and secondary students from being shared without parental consent.

The Basecamp software serves many purposes. It houses Summit's sixth-to-12th-grade curriculum, including lessons in math, English, science and social studies, and it also keeps a running tally of student grades. It is where students take tests and work through about one-third of their lessons independently, learning at their own pace.
It is also where students set short- and long-term goals and where they, their parents and their teachers can see their progress.
Dan Schwartz, dean of Stanford University's Graduate School of Education, said that this, more than fancy algorithms, is Summit's secret sauce - a push to focus students on what they want and how they can achieve it.
"Some kids have taken off with it, and others are struggling," said Adam Zimmerman, director of strategy and innovation at the District's Truesdell Education Campus, where middle-school teachers adopted Basecamp last school year.
Truesdell Principal Mary Ann Stinson said the program relieves teachers of paper-shuffling so they can spend more time tailoring lessons to individual students.
Each Truesdell middle-schooler has a computer, and on a recent morning eighth-graders sat in clusters of three or four, reading the speech that President Obama gave after a neighborhood watch volunteer fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. They answered questions, guiding them toward writing an essay.
In a nearby seventh-grade science classroom with no computers in sight, students built models of animal cells out of paper plates, pipe cleaners and hot-glue guns.
Truesdell's eighth-grade students - who are overwhelmingly poor and mostly Hispanic - scored in the 99th percentile for growth in math and reading last year, according to a nationally normed standardized test, and its seventh-graders did nearly as well.
Bilicki, the Chicago parent, initially refused to permit their children to use Basecamp. But then the pressure mounted: Them husband sent a list of questions to Summit, and a detailed reply allayed their concerns. Them children came home from school saying they did not want to miss out on something so fundamental to their classmates' experience.
A week after they first heard about Basecamp, Bilicki had begun to soften. They were nearly ready to change their mind and say yes. But they still had misgivings about the unintended consequences of signing their name to a form that seemed to hand over so much power to a network of charter schools and some of the biggest companies in tech.
"There are a lot of unclear nuances that I can't possibly know and I just have to trust," they said.

What do hardcore gamers love most? Gaming! But..but what else do they enjoy?! Video Game History! My love for videogames is infinite, like the universe! I grew up playing video games like most of you, and the impact they had on my life was great. I owe a lot of things to video games. If you are like me, one of the most addicting (and fun) things to do, is sat and read about video games, especially the history and interesting facts behind some of your favorite titles, or gaming companies, or game developers – it is all so interesting how it came together (or almost didn't)!! I could get lost for hours on wikipedia just reading through the history of gaming (which isn't always a good thing when on a project deadline haha). However since a lot of the resources I used to read these interesting facts and things in were print gaming magazines as a kid, which have been having trouble the past few years for obvious reasons and going away because of the internets (RIP Nintendo Power 🙁 ), I went a few years missing that type of nostalgic feel browsing through a magazine getting awesome insider facts and history bits that seemed to be few and far between on the net a few years ago. Now though sites like Did You Know Gaming and VGFacts have popped up in recent years and totally brought life back to “dat feel” and really make it fun again to be a video game history nerd gobbling up random information about the usually amazing and often mysterious past of gaming!
History of Video Games
So much! history! gah! nostalgia overload! There really is so much gaming history at this point with gaming starting to get older (like myself. lol) it is really hard to find a starting point to dig in – and you quickly feel like your brain is running out of disk space to store it all haha. Today we have put together some of our favorite tid bits of video game knowledge from Did You Know Gaming – they range from “Oh thats neat” to the “OMFG NO WAY WTF” scale haha. Some are funny, some are amazing, others are creepy, dark, and strange (so you have been warned! lol). We also included a bunch of other resources to help you get all those childhood memories flowing and learn even more about where our games came from (and how they came about) and even learn a little bit about the technology behind them.
If you are a gamer, you will definitely enjoy this trip down memory lane – for some of you there will be much to learn (and many aspects of childhood to be questioned lol) for others you will be captivated and enthralled with video gaming bliss that will lead you down a rabbit hole of never ending time sucking destruction – you might even get kicked in the feels a few times. Whatever you get out of this epic collection of gaming history, I hope that you enjoy!
O_O Mind = Blown. Nature, you are crazy.
O_O Terrifying. Pokémon Cordyceps. lol.
Amazing. The world of gaming would have been so different.
So Interesting. So Awesome!
Sudden Realization… Right in the childhood!
Oh man. THE FEELS! My heart strings, they have been tugged!
It all makes sense now…
LOL EPIC. I Loved Diablo.
Wow. Totally reminds me of the 80's anime “Unico in the Island of Magic” where the wizard turns the people into zombie like “living puppet” block people. So creepy. Good movie from le childhood though lol.

“Introduced in 1993, the 3DO was the first video game system to be based entirely on CD technology.” – VGFacts
“The word “Capcom” was created from taking the first 3 letters from each word in “Capsule Computers” (from the subsidiary Japan Capsule Computer Co).” – VGFacts
“Due to South Korea banning Japanese cultural imports at the end of World War II, the Master System was distributed by South Korean company Samsung, and was named the Gam*Boy. Samsung released many consoles in South Korea under alternate names, like the Game Boy, Genesis, NES, Game Gear, SNES and Nintendo 64.” – VGFacts
“If you open a Dreamcast VMU, you can see “potato” printed on a chip, as a joke referencing a “potato chip”.” – VGFacts
“Ironically, SEGA's GD-Rom technology was created as DVDs were not available for SEGA, and they wanted to create a disc that would be hard for pirates to copy and use. “Sega intended to use the format to curb piracy common to standard compact discs and to offer increased storage capacity. It is similar to the standard CD-ROM except that the pits on the disc are packed more closely together, resulting in a higher storage capacity: around 1.2 gigabytes, which is almost double the storage capacity of a typical CD” The Dreamcast is infamous for being the easiest console to pirate games on.” – VGFacts
Freaking LOVED this show. Still love it. So much gaming history knowledge and nostalgia packed into these things.

With Battlefield 3 having sold more copies at launch than all of the other games in the series combined, there are obviously going to be a lot of new players getting involved in the legendary BF multiplayer for the the first time right about now. This is a good thing. New blood and new people with whom to share the rich tapestry of incendiary wonders that is Battlefield. Positive stuff.
But Battlefield can be confusing at first. Over-awing, in fact. There are many things you need to learn to do, and many things to need to learn to absolutely not do ever. It isn't like other multiplayer shooters, but its rewards are much greater. So I've compiled here a crash course of tactics, tricks, etiquette and basic good Battlefield manners to make sure that you're both useful and well-liked in the fight. It'll make you better at Battlefield, and it'll make you a better human being overall.
1. Don't fly the chopper if you can't fly the chopper
Seriously, don't do it. I know it's tempting to sprint from your base deployment directly to that big shiny whirly-bird ahead of you the very first time you play Battlefield 3 online. You want to be the cool one. You want to be the soaring, unseen killer. You want to be the guy raining flame and death from above in your nigh-impervious, vengeful sky-chariot. You want to be the guy who gets the chirpy salutes and earnest, meaningful, slow nods from your team, as you fly away into the sunset knowing that once again it was your safe transportation that got your men where they needed to go, and got them there safe.
But seriously, those things are a f*cker to control at first, and if you don't get some solo practice in before you set yourself up as the bus driver of the heavens you'll just plough your entire squad down into a barbeque of twisted metal and disappointment within seconds of lifting off. And that's going to give the group respawn a really bloody awkward atmosphere.
2. Don't drive off in the jeep if it isn't full
There's a reason it has multiple seats. If you hear gunfire coming from behind you as you speed from your base the second after your battle-eager arse hits the driver's seat, it's not because the enemy have suddenly appeared. It's because you've accelerated an empty car away from a few prospective wing-men who don't have head-sets, just as they got close enough to see the ‘Enter vehicle' button prompt. And they're now really, really pissed off with you. And they're right to be. You're a twat.
Oh yeah, treat a jeep as a special personal transportation meant just for you if you want to. But good luck when an unexpected hail of gunfire leads to a flaming radiator and you realise that you left your vehicle-fixing Engineer jogging along in your dust three quarters of a mile back.
3. Don't f*ck with a tank unless you have heavy explosives
Don't. Just don't. If you're not carrying anything in the way of C4 or rockets, treat the incoming rumble of caterpillar tracks as you would the sound of a volcano beginning to erupt underneath your feet. A tank cannot be bargained with. It cannot be reasoned with. It absolutely will not stop, ever, until it has mulched you into fertiliser and posted you back to your mum with a note saying “HA HA!” in really big lettering so that they have a cry. And it won't even care.
Seriously, pick your battles. There's enough going on at any point in a Battlefield game that you can always fall back, regroup, and find a new purpose elsewhere. Or else team up with an Engineer, come back properly equipped (having spotted the tank to track him), and blast that f*cker to Pluto before mopping up their stinking, cowardly crew as they bail out. They were going to make your mum cry. They deserve it.
4. Capture zones are bigger than you think
Don't assume that you have to be right on top of a flag in a game of Conquest in order to capture it. The viable area can actually be pretty big. Once you see the countdown ticker start, move around a bit to get a feel for where the boundaries lie. You'll find that you have more space, and therefore more cover options and more ability to set up a defensive perimeter than you might expect.
5. Respect your medic
Seriously. Your Assault guy can help you. Pay attention to him. If you knew the number of times I've chased down a troubled friendly squad in order to help them out, risking life and limb by sprinting through an unholy horizontal rain of lead in order to reach the building in which they're hunkered down, only to have them ignore my medkits and immediately sprint out into yet another hail of gunfire and become immediately 100% less living… Well, you'd know a big number and it would make you feel sorry for me.
Pay attention to which classes are around you and act accordingly. They might be trying to help you. In fact if they're even a half-decent Battlefield player, they definitely are.
6. Don't kamikaze with a tank
If you're in a tank, you should know that it's not just the blunt force implement it at first appears. Yes, it's tempting to just wade up to an objective and start pummelling away until everyone, including yourself, is dead, but there's not a great deal of point in that, especially if you're on the attacking team in a Rush game. Remain stationary in a contested spot, and the opposing team will just roll in a tank of their own and initiate a pointless, attritional Mexican stand-off, in which both tanks have a 50% chance of losing, and in which neither battle-beast really does any overall good due to being forcibly tied up with fighting its opposite number.
No, as a tank driver, you want to be a rolling threat, there to intimidate clusters of the enemy away in order to pave the way for your ground troops. You want to scatter the opposition to allow your troops to more easily cement their presence at an objective, before you move on to herd around the wider fight as you see fit. See yourself as a big violent sheep dog. With massive guns. Do it that way, keep an Engineer on your crew for repairs, and you can have a long-term, persistent effect on the battle while seriously saving on the respawns. If you park up and just start firing, you're simply turning yourself into a big flaming roadblock with a very limited lifespan.
Geep Chryst, the 49ers quarterbacks coach since 2011 who has deep ties to former head coach Jim Harbaugh, is expected to be named their offensive coordinator, the NFL Network reported.
Chryst, 52, hasn't been an offensive coordinator since their lone stint with the Chargers from 1999-2000. During those two seasons, San Diego had the fifth-fewest yards and sixth-fewest points in the NFL.
Chryst, however, was overseeing a talent-starved group. In 1999, Harbaugh, who turned 36 during the season, was the starting quarterback. Ryan Leaf took over in 2000 and San Diego finished 1-15. Jermaine Fazande, whose two-year NFL career ended after the 2000 season, led the Chargers in rushing from 1999-00 with 733 yards.
Two weeks after hiring Jim Tomsula their head coach, the 49ers settled on Chryst after failing to lure several candidates.
They had interest in making Eagles wide receivers coach Bob Bicknell their offensive coordinator, but Bicknell, a position coach throughout their eight-year NFL career, told Tomsula they want to remain in Philadelphia, CSN Philadelphia reported today.
On Saturday Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, a reported candidate, announced they would stay with the Crimson Tide in 2015. On Tuesday, Colts special assistant Rob Chudzinski, believed to be the 49ers' top target, accepted a promotion to associate head coach and stayed in Indianapolis, rather than interview with the Niners. The 49ers also reportedly pursed former Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase, a finalist for their head-coach opening, but they took the same position with the Bears.
Chryst, who graduated from Princeton and has a master's degree from Wisconsin, broke into the NFL with the Bears, where they were a quality control coach from 1991-95. Harbaugh was Chicago's starting quarterback for Chryst's first three seasons. They reconnected with the Chargers, where Chryst also served as quarterbacks coach during their two-year stint as offensive coordinator.
Harbaugh then hired Chryst as their quarterbacks coach in 2011, but Harbaugh did plenty of hands-on work with their two starters, Alex Smith and Colin Kaepernick, during their four-year tenure.
Chryst has spent six seasons as a quarterbacks coach with the Chargers and Cardinals (1998 and 2001-03). Under their guidance, Harbaugh, a 15-year veteran, and the Cardinals' Jake Plummer, a 10-year veteran, posted the second-highest yardage totals of their careers.
Both the Bears and Raiders reportedly expressed interest in Chryst for their offensive-coordinator openings.

Throughout the preseason you may have read my words and the words of others at Cover 1 describing our bafflement at the competition between guards John Miller and Vladimir Ducasse. We didn't believe that there was truly a competition. Miller was arguably the most consistent offensive lineman last season, and their arrow was pointing up. Ducasse has been a journeyman backup and a guy most thought was brought in with offensive line coach Juan Castillo as a tag along due to the coaching changes.
To our surprise, Miller has really taken a step back. The new techniques and traits needed to be effective in offensive coordinator Rick Dennison‘s outside zone running scheme have caused Miller to struggle. Miller is a powerful guard who thrives in inside zone and gap schemes, in which they can generate power into a targeted strike — a strike or blow that can create a gap, blow a defensive lineman off the ball, or at least give them that split second to torque and turn the defender, giving the running back an entry point for the run. The areas where they struggles are the areas in which Ducasse excels.
Ducasse is quick out of their stance, which in outside zone runs is extremely important. You may have heard center Eric Wood discussing the scheme on WGR550 recently, and how they have missed some blocks on the backside of these runs. That's where I believe Ducasse is ahead of Miller and maybe the reason they are starting. Against the Bengals, Ducasse executed rather well in this area.
On the following play Dennison combines their outside zone run with some gap/man principles by running a stretch zone/G-pull. It's a play on which left tackle Dawkins will block down so that Richie Incognito can pull. But pay attention to Ducasse. On this play they have a defensive tackle in a 2i technique.
With the run going to the left side of the offense, the 2i forces the block to be secured by Ducasse alone with no help from center Eric Wood. This is where their quickness off the snap is critical. They must be able to work to the play side shoulder with a ‘reach' block. Coaches typically teach for that first step (Ducasse's left foot) to drop and gain width, typically outside of the defensive lineman's shoe. How deep of a drop or width of the step is really predicated on the alignment of the defender and if the lineman will be getting help.
The second step must be through the crotch of the defender, and then the third step upfield. But the play isn't perfect by Vlad; their left hand should be play side, allowing them to guide the defender, and their right hand should be in the sternum area.
Although it is incorrect, their ability to reach block, get to the front half of the defender, is what the coaches covet. This is especially true when McCoy reads it correctly and is able to cut it back, which they don't here. But the play is there.
On the next play, the Bills run a crack toss to the field. They have Mills and O'Leary pull, which means Ducasse has a very tough block on the defensive tackle, who is in a 4i technique. But again, their foot quickness helped get Shady along the perimeter.
On the snap, they take a deep 1st step. That allows them to gain ground laterally with the use of angles.
Their second step then is right down the center of the defender. By the time they hit their third step the defender slants inside, so Ducasse has to adjust, and they do it flawlessly because of the fluidity they possess.
With the defender too far upfield, Ducasse can now use angles to take them out of the play.
Buffalo did run a lot more inside zone and gap/man runs, and I don't expect that to change too much. However, the staff will still need to run outside zone concepts from time to time, as it is what sets up the Dennison bootleg game. So you can see why Ducasse may have a slight edge over Miller. Ducasse is more athletic overall and able to make these blocks on the backside.
On this play, the Bills send out 12 personnel and run outside zone into the Bengals' over front. Ducasse has the defensive tackle aligned in another 2i technique, so they have to execute another reach block.
Their first two steps are executed perfectly, but their hand placement is too wide, the defender gets into their body and is able to lift Vlad. Ducasse continues to hand fight, but more importantly, they are able to work laterally down the line of scrimmage.
 They are able to block the defender while taking a quick peek at Shady to where they are in their read. McCoy is about to cut it back, so Ducasse adjusts. They slide to the backside shoulder and then washes the defender down, giving McCoy a crease to get upfield. This was a very nice exhibition of staying in the fight by using their athleticism.
I know a lot of fans are calling for major changes across the offensive line coming out of the bye week, and I am one of them. I am a big fan of John Miller, but the string of games they put together before the Bengals game was bad. Their limited athleticism was exposed by defenses and, more importantly, by the techniques needed in this scheme. Can they pull? Absolutely.  They are able to short and long-pull, but they struggle on reach blocks and in space climbing to the second level. Reach blocks are characterized by short area quickness, explosion, angles, and the athleticism to adjust on the fly. Those are not strengths of Miller's.
Ducasse doesn't have the ceiling that Miller does, but the staff is trying to jump start the run game. In order to do so, they need a guard that can execute reach blocks, more specifically on the backside of these outside zone and pin-and-pull runs. That is where Shady is going to be cutting it back.
Teams will be fast flowing wide to stop McCoy, and the team needs Ducasse in the game to at least be in a position to cut off the backside defensive linemen, take over a shade defensive tackle, or scoop to the second level to wall off a pursuing linebacker. Ducasse's play against the Bengals was average, but it wasn't bad enough to throw Miller back into the lineup.
They aren't a long term solution, and this probably won't be the last change at the position, but the staff had to do something to motivate Miller and attempt to get the run game going.
Update: While we speculated that this game would eventually come to Android as well, Nintendo officially confirmed this with Kotaku. Although the statement was brief, it was clear: “We do intend to release the game on Android devices at some point in the future.” How long Apple's exclusivity remains is unknown, though hopefully we don't have to wait too much longer.
Today at Apple's 2016 Special Event, Tim Cook made a surprising announcement that revealed a new arrangement with Nintendo. Mario is on their way to iPhones and iPads, and their creator Shigeru Miyamoto was there to detail the new game Super Mario Run in person.
In this upcoming mobile game, Mario runs automatically to the right, so you simply tap to make them jump. They automatically navigate simpler aspects of the terrain, but pressing longer yields higher leaps. The goal is to collect as many coins as you can while stomping goombas and reaching the end before the timer runs out. As you progress, you'll encounter new blocks that change the way Mario moves through their environment.
Miyamoto points out that this is the first time ever that you've been able to play Mario one-handed, meaning you can play while holding on to a subway rail or eating a hamburger.
Toad Rally is a multiplayer mode that pits you against other players. You'll navigate endless, procedurally generated terrain. Not only will you receive points for collecting coins and downing enemies, but you'll also get bonuses for ‘impressing toads' with risky maneuvers. Play until you fail, and the person who pulls off the highest score wins.
The game will be released at a set price with no in-app purchases. We don't have a price for it yet, but you can expect to see it in the App Store in time for the holidays 2016. Based on wording surrounding the announcement, with Tim Cook emphasizing that Mario is coming to iOS first, we wouldn't be surprised to see this game make its way to the Android platform as well in the coming months.

Fox News is criticizing former President Obama's “luxury” family vacation to Bali.
Fox bashed the Obama family's vacations since leaving office, including pricey trips to the Four Seasons in Bali and an exclusive country club in Oahu.
Citing “travel experts,” it said that “the level of luxury the Obamas enjoy on their vacations is unprecedented for a modern-day president.”

The story quoted Democratic strategist and former Jimmy Carter advisor Pat Caddell, who said “these trips are like the lifestyles of the rich and famous,” as well as so-called “left-wing activists” who said they were troubled by Obama's apparent efforts to distance themselves from the grassroots of the Democratic party.
FOX included a clip from HBO host John Oliver and Seth Myers on Late Night Monday from February on the president's vacations. “I'm not sure he's ever been more out of touch than they are right now,” Oliver said.
The Huffington Post weighed in on the article, noting President Trump's expensive golfing trips to their own Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster resorts on 8 of the 23 weekends they have been in office.
Trump trips to their resorts have been found to cost taxpayers millions.
New research suggests that, in people who don't currently have memory problems, those with smaller regions of the brain's cortex may be more likely to develop symptoms consistent with very early Alzheimer's disease. The study is published in the December 21, 2011, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
"The ability to identify people who are not showing memory problems and other symptoms but may be at a higher risk for cognitive decline is a very important step toward developing new ways for doctors to detect Alzheimer's disease," said Susan Resnick, PhD, with the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore, who wrote an accompanying editorial.
For the study, researchers used brain scans to measure the thickness of regions of the brain's cortex in 159 people free of dementia with an average age of 76. The brain regions were chosen based on prior studies showing that they shrink in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Of the 159 people, 19 were classified as at high risk for having early Alzheimer's disease due to smaller size of particular regions known to be vulnerable to Alzheimer's in the brain's cortex, 116 were classified as average risk and 24 as low risk. At the beginning of the study and over the next three years, participants were also given tests that measured memory, problem-solving and ability to plan and pay attention.
The study found that 21 percent of those at high risk experienced cognitive decline during three years of follow-up after the MRI scan, compared to seven percent of those at average risk and none of those at low risk.
"Further research is needed on how using MRI scans to measure the size of different brain regions in combination with other tests may help identify people at the greatest risk of developing early Alzheimer's as early as possible," said study author Bradford Dickerson, MD, of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.
The study also found 60 percent of the group considered most at risk for early Alzheimer's disease had abnormal levels of proteins associated with the disease in cerebrospinal fluid, which is another marker for the disease, compared to 36 percent of those at average risk and 19 percent of those at low risk.
The study, performed by Dickerson and collaborator David Wolk, MD, of University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a member of the AAN, using data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, was supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (both part of the National Institutes of Health), Abbott, AstraZeneca AB, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai Global Clinical Development, Elan Corporation, Genentech, GE Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline, Innogenetics, Johnson and Johnson, Eli Lilly and Co., Medpace, Inc., Merck and Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Schering-Plough, Synarc, Inc., the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, with participation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Dana Foundation. Funding for this particular data analysis came from the NIA and the Alzheimer's Association.
The Minnesota Vikings failed to trade back into the first round to draft quarterback Johnny Manziel, but were able to jump back up to nab Louisville's Teddy Bridgewater.
How to watch the NFL draft With the 2014 NFL Draft officially underway, find out how to catch all the action from Radio City Music Hall on NFL Network.
With theofficially underway, find out how to catch all the action from Radio City Music Hall on NFL Network. More ...
NFL Media's Albert Breer reported Thursday that the Vikings tried to trade with the Philadelphia Eagles at No. 22 to draft Manziel, but the Cleveland Browns made a better offer. The Vikings rated the Texas A&M signal-caller as the top quarterback on their board, according to team sources.
It could be a failed trade that makes Vikings fans wince with every Fran Tarkenton-esque play Johnny Football makes in Cleveland.
"I was just able to establish relationships with Rick Spielman, the GM, coach (Norv) Turner, the offensive coordinator, and Scott (Turner), the quarterbacks coach," Bridgewater told NFL Media's Deion Sanders. "So I felt very comfortable that I was going to end up in Minnesota, someway, somehow."
General manager Rick Spielman could have taken Manziel at No. 9, but opted to give coach Mike Zimmer the talented, but raw, pass rusher Anthony Barr of UCLA. Perhaps Spielman was gun-shy after reaching for Christian Ponder in 2011.
In lieu of grabbing the flashy Manziel, Spielman sent a second-round pick (No. 40 overall) and a fourth-rounder (No. 108) to the Seattle Seahawks to close out the first round with Bridgewater.
Several teams believed that Bridgewater was the most NFL-ready quarterback, despite some question marks. Their college tape was better than other quarterback prospects. Also, Adrian Peterson running the ball won't hurt a young quarterback one bit.
Bridgewater could take a proverbial redshirt season behind Matt Cassel as they learn Turner's offense.
The Vikings might have whiffed on Manziel, but Bridgewater was a great consolation prize for a franchise still trying to get over the missed Ponder pick.

You cannot negotiate with Iran. That is what they told us for years. The Iranian leadership is too fanatical, they are not rational actors, they are “not like us.” One US official even recently said that deception is part of the Iranian DNA. But just over a week ago negotiations between the five permanent UN Security Council Members plus Germany and the Iranians produced an historic agreement that may be first step toward a new era in US relations with the Middle East.
As the Middle East expert Eric Margolis pointed out this week, for Iran's major concessions it will only receive “$7 billion – of its own money, which has been frozen abroad by US-led sanctions.” That sounds like quite a bit of compromise for such a “fanatical” country.
Earlier this summer the same people made the same arguments about Syria. You cannot negotiate with Syrian President Assad, they said.  They are insane; they are another Hitler. But not only was it possible, a deal was signed ending the threat of a US strike in exchange for Syria agreeing to give up its chemical weapons and the ability to manufacture new ones. Syria upheld its end of the agreement and the chemicals were all accounted for on schedule.
Why have the interventionists, the neocons, and the special interest groups claimed for so long that negotiation and diplomacy was tantamount to surrender; that countries such as Iran and Syria “only understand force”? It is because these groups are afraid of diplomacy. They do not want a peaceful resolution to these conflicts. They see US foreign relations only in the starkest terms: do what we say and we will give you aid, disobey us and we will bomb you.
Now the warmongers who call themselves “foreign policy experts” have been exposed. The whole world sees that they are wrong. Their advice is bad. Their limited vision of how foreign affairs should be conducted is actually dangerous to the United States. It is now clear that there are workable alternatives.
As with the US threats against Syria, public opinion polls on talks with Iran demonstrate that the American people are solidly behind diplomacy and opposed to another war. According to one recent poll, Americans support the deal reached with Iran by a margin of two-to-one.
Congress, however, is once again far behind the American people. Even as US negotiators were reaching agreement with their Iranian counterparts, US representatives and Senators were drafting legislation to increase sanctions on Iran. Instead of listening to the American people, many in Congress seem attached to special interests like the Israel and Saudi lobbies, which oppose anything less than full Iranian capitulation. Israel refuses to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty yet it seeks to dictate the rules of the treaty to those who have signed it. Saudi Arabia is desperate to control the region politically and economically, and it views an Iran that is free to sell oil and other products on the open market as a threat to Saudi power.
For too long both Israel and the Saudis have benefited from a US military guarantee. It has created “moral hazard” that only encourages more belligerent behavior on both of their parts. It remains to be seen whether this six-month trial period will develop into a permanent move toward normalization of relations with Iran. What if Congress refuses to give Iran its own money back? But we are moving in the right direction and we should be optimistic.
A better US relationship with Iran may signal the beginning of the end of US meddling in the region and serve as an incentive for Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Gulf States to solve their problems themselves. This would be a great boost to US national security, just as an Iran open to US business and trade would be a great boost to our economic security. Is peace finally breaking out? Let's hope so.

Frankenstein's Monster was grafted together from various cadavers, and reanimated with the power of electricity. Drawing inspiration from such madness, Rod has used part from half a dozen bikes to create their own monster…
Rod's addiction/obsession started back in 1969 after witnessing the iconic film Easy Rider, a revelation that would be no doubt shared by many from the time. They can vividly remember sitting in the back seat of the family VW Beetle at the Skyline Drive-In Theatre in North Ryde. “Seeing the Captain America Chopper for the first time was every bit as good as losing ones virginity (Funny how I can remember the bike, but I can't remember her)
I was lucky to come from a family that went to Hot Rod & Bike Shows, the Speedway and more. Even before the movie as a kid I just loved collecting stuff for Billy Carts and bicycles to modify them, building them into themed pieces.
I was blessed to have grown up in the 70's when it was all happening, Falcon GT's, Hot Rods, Choppers & Mini-Bikes everyday was an experience and you could even buy the latest Honda Z50 Mini Trail brand new for $256.00 from the local dealer.”
Rod's latest build is based around a 1977 Harley-Davidson Shovelhead engine on a Santee frame. As the name Frankenstein suggests, varied parts from varied bikes were used in its reanimation. “After building many custom show bikes, this was a bike that I wanted to go back in time with and build something with personal nostalgia that could be ridden, enjoyed, and possibly kept.
I guess I just wanted a portion of my youth back – Easy Rider, my purple dragster bicycle I had as a kid, and watching The Munsters on TV.”
Rod has built a legacy of custom Harley-Davidsons, and their trophy wall displays just some of the awards and recognition he's received from their builds. “I have always loved changing the look and modifying bikes, I guess the term “Stock Sucks” sums me up.
Why Harley's? I guess it may stem back to the movie and the ease and access to thousands of parts and accessories. After owning over 30 Harleys, dealing in parts and imports, I suppose it's a case of the devil you know.”
“Nothing about this bike was tricky. It frustrates me to see unfinished projects! If anyone plans a bike fully before they even start, it should all fit like a bum in a bucket. I just planned it all in my head gathered up the parts and started. Nine weeks of spare time later it was ready to roll.”
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump praises the UK's Brexit vote during an interview with Michael Gove for The Times
The UK is "doing great" following its vote to leave the EU, US President-elect Donald Trump has said.
In their first UK interview - with former Justice Secretary Michael Gove for the Times - Mr Trump said they thought the UK was "so smart in getting out".
Mr Trump promised a quick trade deal between the US and the UK after they take office on Friday.
But the European Commission reacted to the comments by saying no formal talks were allowed before the UK left the EU.
Mr Trump, who also criticised "obsolete" Nato and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies, spoke to the Times and German newspaper Bild ahead of their inauguration on Friday.
Outgoing US President Barack Obama said in April last year that the UK would be "at the back of the queue" if it quit the EU.
Mr Gove - a prominent Leave campaigner during last year's referendum - asked Mr Trump whether the UK was now "at the front of the queue" for a trade deal with the US following the Brexit vote.
"I think you're doing great," Mr Trump said. "I think it's going great."
The president-elect said: "Trump said Brexit is going to happen, and it happened. Everybody thought I was crazy.
"Obama said, 'They'll go to the back of the line,' and then they had to retract their statement."
Mr Trump added: "Countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity, but I do think if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees then you wouldn't have a Brexit."

On a potential US-UK trade deal, they said: "We're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly. Good for both sides."
Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the president-elect wanted a trade deal "signature-ready at the earliest possible opportunity" - former UKIP leader Nigel Farage later said they expected a trade deal within three months of Mr Trump becoming president.
However a European Commission spokesperson said that "categorically won't be possible" because formal talks "cannot take place in any official capacity until Britain has finished its negotiations with the EU".
Mr Gove, a columnist for the paper, added: "He (Mr Trump) stressed that they believed the European Union would potentially break up in the future and that other countries would leave.
"So in a sense they are both emotionally and financially invested in it."
Arriving at a summit in Brussels, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: "I think it's very good news that the United States of America wants to deal a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast, and it's great to hear that from President-elect Donald Trump.
"Clearly it will have to be a deal that is very much in the interests of both sides, but I have no doubt that it will be."
In their interview, Mr Trump talked about the recent dip in the value of the pound.
"The fact that your pound sterling has gone down?" they said. "Great, because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know. I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing."
The president-elect's views came as Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK may be forced to change its "economic model" if "closed off" from the European single market.
During the Times/Bild interview, held in Trump Tower, New York, the president-elect said they thought Mrs Merkel was the "by far the most important European leader".
"If you look at the European Union, it's Germany - it's basically a vehicle for Germany," they said.
Mr Trump said Mrs Merkel had made a "big mistake" by admitting more than one million migrants to the country.
"I think they made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know, taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from," they added.
Mr Trump also stressed that they would "start off trusting both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mrs Merkel" on taking office, but would "see how long that lasts".

Talking about international security, Mr Trump argued that they had said "a long time ago that Nato had problems".
"One, that it was obsolete because it was designed many many years ago, and number two, that the countries weren't paying what they're supposed to pay."
Last November, Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Trump had discussed the need for more countries to commit to spending 2% of national income on defence, when speaking on the telephone after the US election.
Mr Trump's comments on the UK and the EU came ahead of the launch of a cross-party campaign called Brexit Together.
It aims to bring together political voices from both sides of the referendum debate to develop a "shared vision" on immigration, the economy and market access, security and sovereignty.
'Ceremony and beauty'
One of the campaign's founders, Labour MP Caroline Flint, said "a lot was said in both campaigns... that left the public feeling quite baffled at some of the rhetoric".
It was "absolutely right we should have a good trading relationship with the EU and, of course, getting a deal with the US would be a fantastic opportunity as well", they added.
A separate report, co-written by Boris Johnson's former economic adviser, Gerard Lyons, says membership of the single market has been a "major drawback" for the UK's service industries. It recommends a "clean Brexit", leaving this and the customs union.
Meanwhile, the man tipped to become Mr Trump's ambassador to the EU has said the president-elect is committed to securing a trade deal with the UK, and preliminary talks could begin ahead of its formal departure from the 28-nation bloc.
Theodore Malloch, a professor at Henley Business School in Reading, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "If you want to facilitate something it can be done in an expeditious manner, so I would hope on the day Britain triggers Article 50 Mrs May would be able to announce we have just started discussions with the United States."
In their Times/Bild interview, Mr Trump also discussed their Scottish-born mother, saying: "She was so proud of the Queen. They loved the ceremony and the beauty, because nobody does that like the English, and they had great respect for the Queen and liked them
"Any time the Queen was on television, for an event, my mother would be watching."
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron dismissed Mr Gove's interview with Mr Trump as "a puff piece from a clearly admiring fan".
They added: "I don't know the shape of the Europe that Trump dreams of, but I know it frightens me."
TV audiences apparently can't get enough of Sherlock Holmes. With tonight's premiere of Elementary, fans now have two shows starring the legendary fictional detective to choose from: the BBC's acclaimed Sherlock, which produces just three episodes per season and airs in the US on PBS, and the new American version. The CBS series finds Jonny Lee Miller's Holmes detoxing in New York, in the care of Lucy Liu's Watson. Although we find the chemistry between those two promising, we're not sure primetime needs another Sherlock Holmes.
Of course, both Sherlock Holmeses are just incarnations of an archetype TV dramas love: the rogue good guy. That realization got us thinking about characters we see far too often. So we've created a list of tired types we wish TV writers would lay off, at least for a while. Leave your additions in the comments.
The rogue good guy
Examples: Sarah Linden, The Killing; Jack Bauer, 24; Neal Caffrey, White Collar; at least one character from every police procedural; various Sherlock Holmes incarnations
Often they're cops, but sometimes they're government agents or independent detectives. What they have in common is an intense — sometimes pathological — need to catch the crook, save the world, or do whatever needs to be done to discover the truth and/or set things right. They may break the rules of their profession, but that's because they answer to a higher morality, or know something their superiors can't know, or the larger institution that surrounds them is corrupt. This forbidden knowledge or persecution has left them with a dark side. Every once in a while they go off the rails and make us doubt whether they are the hero after all — but, with a consistency that's getting boring, they always turn out to be good.
As voters head to the polls Tuesday for a crucial set of primary elections, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds antipathy toward their elected officials rising and anti-incumbent sentiment at an all-time high.
The national survey shows that 29 percent of Americans now say they are inclined to support their House representative in November, even lower than in 1994, when voters swept the Democrats out of power in the that chamber after 40 years in the majority.
The poll also finds growing disapproval of the "tea party" movement, with half the population now expressing an unfavorable impression of the loosely aligned protest campaign that has shaken up politics this year.
And at a time when Republicans anticipate significant gains in House and Senate elections, there is also fresh evidence of the challenges facing the GOP. Six in 10 poll respondents say they have a negative view of the policies put forward by the Republican minority in Congress, and about a third say they trust Republicans over Democrats to handle the nation's main problems.
This sour mood has made for nervous politicians, as candidates from both parties have tried to figure out what voters want -- and don't want. On Tuesday, hopefuls in Virginia and 11 other states will find out. It is the busiest single primary day of the year, and a big test of just how deep anti-incumbent and anti-establishment feelings go.
Most attention is focused on Arkansas, where Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln is struggling to fend off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in a runoff election. (One interesting thing to note about Tuesday's primaries: The most closely watched races all feature women.) If Lincoln were to lose, they would be the third senator and fourth incumbent to fall this year. Halter has strong support from organized labor. Lincoln has President Obama's backing, but after the May 18 primary, they called in former president Bill Clinton to help them
A different test of voter anger is unfolding in Nevada, where the tea party's power will be a major issue in Tuesday's voting. Former state assemblywoman Sharron Angle, who has strong tea party support, is trying to fend off two significant challengers for a Senate nomination -- former state senator Sue Lowden and business person Danny Tarkanian -- in a crowded primary field. The Nevada GOP winner will take on vulnerable Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D) in November.
Nevada Republicans also appear ready to dump scandal-tainted Gov. Jim Gibbons on Tuesday.
In California, Republicans will pick a challenger to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), who is considered vulnerable in their bid for a fourth term. Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina has led in recent polls over former member of congress Tom Campbell and state Assemblyman Chuck Devore. The contest has largely come down to a debate over who has the best chance of defeating Boxer.
Also in California, former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman is favored over state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner to capture the GOP gubernatorial nomination. They have spent more than $70 million of their own money. The winner of the primary will face Attorney General Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown Jr., a former governor and the expected Democratic nominee, in the general election.
On the other side of the country, dirty politics has marked the South Carolina Republican gubernatorial primary. State Rep. Nikki Haley has been the subject of infidelity accusations from two men -- which they have adamantly denied -- and a racial slur by a Republican state senator.  They are the front-runner, but if no candidate receives 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held June 22.
Elections will also be held Tuesday in Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia. In Iowa, Republican former governor Terry Branstad, who was first elected in 1982 and served four terms, leads the field for the party's gubernatorial nomination and the right to challenge vulnerable Gov. Chet Culver (D).
GOPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goal is to ‘prevent governability,' renowned scholar tells Raw Story
The nature of the current recession has made it clear to most Americans that a new wave of financial reforms is necessary to prevent another crash. MIT professor Noam Chomsky alleged that the Democratic establishmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reluctance to reestablish post-Depression type regulations is reflective of the systemic constraints on policy in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“dysfunctional democracy.Ã¢â‚¬Â
Chomsky, who has written many books detailing the perils of corporate influence in politics, said in an interview that the president and their party are hamstrung by fears that banks will punish them if they implement policies that do not satisfy the industry's desires.
President Obama Ã¢â‚¬Å“is delivering, but for the financial institutions,Ã¢â‚¬Â they told Raw Story, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a big surprise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that was the core of their funding. They preferred them to McCain, in fact by a considerable margin. They expected a payoff, and they got a payoff.Ã¢â‚¬Â
The Obama administration last month walked into a public relations debacle after the president told Bloomberg News in an interview that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“begrudgeÃ¢â‚¬Â banking executives making large bonuses for their Ã¢â‚¬Å“savvyÃ¢â‚¬Â skills.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“That was very revealing,Ã¢â‚¬Â Chomsky said, alleging that Obama was merely heeding the threats from the banking community.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“Obama months ago shifted their rhetoric and started talking about greedy bankers and even made some policy proposals the financial institutions didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like,Ã¢â‚¬Â they continued. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste a minute. They told them right off, you continue talking like that and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to shift our funding to Republicans. Well they did so.Ã¢â‚¬Â
One day before the interview, the New York Times reported that J.P. Morgan, which has traditionally preferred contributing to Democrats, directed most of its cash to the GOP this year. Campaign finance trends on OpenSecrets.org reveal that financial institutions have gradually shifted their funding away from the Democratic Party and toward Republicans in recent months.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“And Obama got the message,Ã¢â‚¬Â Chomsky said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Within days, they said to Bloomberg that the bankers are great guys, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in favor of their profits and bonuses and so on; that thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way the free market works, and I join the American people in applauding their successes.Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ã¢â‚¬Å“These are the same American people who are screaming bloody murder about all this, so that tells you something about how the country works,Ã¢â‚¬Â they added.
GOPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœgoalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is to win back power by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmaking the country ungovernableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢
ChomskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s verdict on Obama and the Democrats may have been damning, but their take on Republicans was scathing.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Republican Party has transformed itself, since Reagan but much more extensively now, into a new kind of political operation,Ã¢â‚¬Â they told Raw Story. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abandoned really any political programs. Its only goal has been to prevent governability.Ã¢â‚¬Â
The MIT professor said the GOPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s posturing as a small-government populist organization has been a disingenuous strategy to capitalize on nationwide anger and defeat Democrats.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“When critics call it the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœparty of noÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty much correct,Ã¢â‚¬Â they continued. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They basically want to make the country ungovernable so that they can regain power and dedicate themselves to their actual constituency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is not tea party activists but corporate power.Ã¢â‚¬Â
Chomsky predicted the November elections wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be easy on the majority party, as Ã¢â‚¬Å“enthusiasm among Republicans is far higher than among Democrats, who are largely apathetic now.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Israeli fighter jets bombed areas west of Damascus late Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reports. Fighting alongside the Syrian army, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia group Hezbollah has been a frequent target of Israel's airstrikes.
"Israeli planes targeted the Jamraya region near Damascus, including a scientific research center and warehouses where weapons and ammunition of the regime and its allies were stocked," Rami Abdurrahman, the director of the Britain-based SOHR, told the AFP news agency.
A witness told the Reuters news agency that three strong explosions boomed from the direction of Jamraya late Monday. Another witness reported thick smoke rising over the area.
'Israeli missile attack'
State media also implicated Syria's neighbor when reporting the strikes. "Our air defenses are confronting an Israeli missile attack on one of our sites in the Damascus suburbs, and three of the targets were downed," the state news agency SANA reported. The attacks apparently happened at about 11:30 p.m. (2130 UTC) local time on Monday.
Syrian officials have blamed Israel for several strikes — including a 2013 strike on the same facility that was reportedly attacked on Monday. An Israeli military spokesperson told news agencies that Israeli officials would not comment on foreign reports. They have, however, acknowledged carrying out previous airstrikes in Syria to stop arms deliveries to Hezbollah forces since the outbreak of the country's multifront war more than six years ago.
In 2014, forces loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accused Israel of targeting the area surrounding the Damascus International Airport. And, in a 2016 incident initially denied by Syria's military, the SOHR reported that forces had come under "Israeli bombardment" near Damascus.
In September, Israel attacked a regime military site linked to the production of chemical weapons. In October, Israeli officials said planes had attacked Syrian government artillery after fire from across the armistice line hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, warning that such retaliation would only increase. On Saturday, Syrian state media reported that Israeli missiles had struck a military position south of Damascus.

Surveillance radar technology takes perimeter security to the next level. Typically, a combination of guards, gates, fences, and security cameras is the norm for the security of businesses, ranging from the oil and gas to the energy sector. Using the SpotterRF patented Compact Surveillance Radar system, we've been able to develop a security system with far more control and protection than the average solution on the market. These lightweight and energy-efficient radars allow our clients to monitor a far greater area in comparison to a traditional security camera. By coordinating visual, thermal, and motion detection of movement within and around the boundaries of a client's worksite, we are able to provide a thorough and never-blind surveillance solution.
The primary advantages our surveillance radar system include:
Decreased Security Costs
Less Onsite Security Personnel : Did you know that the average cost of keeping one guard on-site 24/7 costs an average of $300,000 per year? With perimeter surveillance radar you can reduce the number of onsite security needed to monitor your area.
Cut Satellite Upload and Data Storage Costs : Remote areas such as oil and gas sites often use satellite Internet for surveillance and data storage. Rather than having multiple cameras filming 24/7 and uploading this data to your server, radar surveillance eliminates the need for all this data.
Detect Security Breaches Sooner
With a traditional security system, guards must be attentive and alert for potential breaches. They must be monitoring their surveillance equipment at all times to identify any abnormal behavior. With surveillance radar, movement within a user defined area automatically notifies security personnel, so they have a chance to react sooner.
All-Weather and Larger Range
Depending on where your business site is located, weather can play a major role in the effectiveness of your security. Whether it's blizzards or dust storms, the ability for traditional security cameras and guards can be inhibited by weather. Surveillance radar operates flawlessly in any weather condition no matter how drastic. Traditional security methods are also often flawed due to their range of surveillance. Once you detect unauthorized personnel via security camera it is often too late and they have already breached your area. With surveillance radar, you can designate a range of detection beyond your area border so you will know if someone is coming before they even arrive.
Auto-Cueing
If movement is detected in a radar zone, cameras can be set to automatically cue in on the threat. This gives security personnel an immediate picture of what they are dealing with as soon as the surveillance radar system is triggered. This increased speed in understanding the type of threat allows your security team to be more prepared and have more time to react.

“The stories that make sense of the world are part of the world. It is not by transcending this world that we are transformed but by storying it in a new way.” – David Loy
“Wisdom tells me that I'm nothing. Love tells me that I'm everything. Between these two my life flows.” – Sri Nisargadatta
Buddhism is a system with many different beliefs, stories, and practices. When these systems are embodied they reveal certain truths about reality. And Buddhism isn't singular, it's plural—there are many different systems of Buddhist thought and practice and they don't all agree with one another. All the same there's a certain style or flavor that I've noticed with many Buddhist systems—even those claiming to be “non-dual”—and it has to do with the freedom that comes from not being caught in personal stories. This is sometimes called non-attachment or selflessness or just seeing through certain identities and beliefs. It's about letting go of what is changing and opening up to something bigger. But whatever that bigger something is, we are constantly reminded, that too is changing. “Today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake,” so really, again, there's no place we can stand.
The challenge I have with this view is that it's only looking at one side of a multi-sided process. Imagine a three dimensional sphere. Everything within that sphere is what we're aware of—our bodies, emotions, thoughts, each other, cultural beliefs, etc. Everything outside of that sphere is what we're unaware of, but which is still arising. What's outside that sphere is what we are identified with—it's what is operating without our knowledge of it. Buddhist practice happens at the intersection of the inside and outside of this sphere.
The Expanding Boundary of Freedom
When we take what we previously held as “I” or “me” or “mine” as an object, then we become free of the claustrophobic bondage that's associated with the clinging or attachment to those sensations. They reveal their ephemeral nature and made-up nature and we find a deeper freedom on the other side of this attachment—the bliss of non-attachment. But here's the catch: the sense of a subject doesn't just disappear (although it may appear to temporarily) and our stories don't all vanish. Instead, we form new, more subtle, and harder to perceive ones! Essentially the sphere of self expands and becomes more subtle. We become bigger, more inclusive, and once again harder to see.
In response to this ever-shifting and expanding sense of subject-object boundary, Buddhism has a tendency to constantly double down on the freedom of non-attachment, of never being satisfied with a new identity because everything changes. That dissatisfaction—or suffering—is what then drives the next layer of investigation and further freedom. But does the self ever really vanish and is there any end—not to mention beginning—to this process?
We can fixate on the notion that there is something which exists outside of this process, which has never been touched or impacted by it. Sometimes it's called the “deathless,” sometimes it's called the end of suffering. But this understanding is one that dawns with and through time, and it's one that also—like everything else mentioned so far—changes! As practitioners we often fall prey to the very thing we preach against: solidifying reality and finding a new solid sense of self in the certainty of our realization. Even if that realization is cloaked in the language of not knowing and going beyond belief altogether! Is it avoidable to do so? I'm doing it right now myself.
Emptiness and Fullness
If this is so, if there really is no end to the dropping away of self and the further expansion of what we take ourselves to be, then why are we so focused on the dropping away part? What would happen if we were to include the expansion of identity and the profound opening of awareness as an equally valid way of understanding this process?
What I've found in experimenting with this view is that it cuts through the dissociative dangers of selflessness. It cuts through depression and hopelessness. And it brings about a greater appreciation for joy and love. It gets us in touch with the creative process of life, unfolding through us, and opening us up into something which is increasingly magical and mysterious.
When held alongside the recognition of the emptiness of all things it gives us an opportunity to start to understand that certain paradoxes have a faulty premise. Self and no-self. Being and becoming. Knowing and not knowing. Birth and death. All of these paradoxes melt in the face of an oscillating awareness of emptiness and fullness. We are constantly challenging what we think we know by opening up to more profound knowledge!
Finding A New Story
When we can oscillate and flow between these two perspectives, we see that neither is ultimately right. Indeed, the idea of ultimate truth can't withstand oscillation, because no matter where we stand we find ourselves shifting in the very next moment. And sometimes where we shift to is absolutely trustworthy. We have to trust it, because it's where we are. And then it changes. And then we find a new story in this groundless play that makes more sense of what we know. Or as David Loy put it, “It is not by transcending this world that we are transformed, but by storying it in a new way.”
What story are you telling?

PrintScreen is an enabling technology for digital fabrication of customized flexible displays using thin-film electroluminescence (TFEL). It enables inexpensive and rapid fabrication of highly customized displays in low volume, in a simple lab environment, print shop or even at home. We show how to print ultra-thin (120 um) segmented and passive matrix displays in greyscale or multi-color on a variety of deformable and rigid substrate materials, including PET film, office paper, leather, metal, stone, and wood. The displays can have custom, unconventional 2D shapes and can be bent, rolled and folded to create 3D shapes. We contribute a systematic overview of graphical display primitives for customized displays and show how to integrate them with static print and printed electronics. Furthermore, we contribute a sensing framework, which leverages the display itself for touch sensing. To demonstrate the wide applicability of PrintScreen, we present application examples from ubiquitous, mobile and wearable computing.

Images via Yanko Design
This tiny folding bike might be the smallest, most easily portable pedal-powered transportation we've seen...but is it practical?The concept design featured on Yanko Design is by Weiche Wu & Minhan Lin, and it has some definite pros. First, it folds up to be tall rather than wide (it's only 8 inches wide when folded according to Yanko Design), which makes getting it onto a bus or train a lot easier. It also uses its back wheel while folded, so you can push or pull it, rather than lift it. The seat is still adjustable to any height you might need, and the same with the handle bars.
The major problem I see with the design is that back wheel -- it's not exactly very big, and not much of it extends out from the metal. That means two things -- one, you can't be very heavy, and two, going over bumps could potentially mess up your bike pretty bad. I'd also like to see the guts of this bike to see how it is set up -- is it a fixed gear?
Other than the issue of the problematic back wheel, the design looks really slick and I like where the designers headed with making this a really compact, easy to tote bike. I think it might only find an audience among smaller people or kids, but I think it could definitely find a market should it ever make it past prototype.

At the very beginning of last year, I decided to track my reading habits and share the best stuff here, on Baeldung. Haven't missed a review since.
Here we go…
1. Spring and Java
Vlad's book is half-way done and, if the chapter on transactions is any indication – will be a fantastic writeup.
He's publishing it via Leanpub, with flexible (and way to low) pricing, so if you want to really brush up on your SQL game, definitely pick that up.
I don't do a lot of product recommendation around here (this is literally the first in almost two years), but having a solid base with low level persistence is critical, and this is a great way to build up that base.
And still on persistence – here's a great set of important tactics and recommendations to follow when working with Hibernate.
A quick look at how the old @Deprecated annotation might be improved and how that would look like in practice.
For years, benchmarking has been really complex (while looking really simple). There's some interesting stuff coming in JDK9 that will make things a little bit easier.
But just a little bit – good benchmarking will still be hard.
Like always, solid notes by Nicolai, discussing modularity in the upcoming JDK release.

2. Technical and Musings
A company that is enabling their developers to work with new, solid hardware and new(ish) language versions has a distinct market advantage.
That's both a general, logical observation and a personal tactic I used the last time I interviewed for a job. I literally took a walk through the office right after the interview, paid attention to what hardware people were using, and excluded a couple of companies that otherwise looked interesting based on that.

China said Friday it “resolutely opposed” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's monetary donation to war-related Yasukuni Shrine on Friday, the 69th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.
“We again urge the Japanese side to seriously take a responsible attitude” and “take practical action to gain the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community,” said Hua Chunying, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson.
When Cabinet ministers visited the war shrine last year, the Foreign Ministry in Beijing summoned Ambassador Masato Kitera to lodge a protest. Japanese Embassy officials in Beijing said it only received a protest during a telephone call.
Meanwhile, in Seoul, South Korean President Park Geun-hye urged Japan to work with their country to make next year, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties, a “new starting point for a new era” for the two countries.
“Based on friendship, I hope both countries make next year a new starting point for a new era,” Park said in a speech marking the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1945. They urged Japanese politicians “to show wisdom and determination” toward that end.
Park lamented that some Japanese politicians have carried out acts seen as glossing over Japan's wartime wrongdoings, saying they are “dividing the minds of peoples in both countries and hurting their feelings.”
The South Korean Foreign Ministry was quick to criticize Abe's latest ritual offering to Yasukuni Shrine and the visits there by three of their Cabinet ministers as “deplorable.”
Relations between South Korea and Japan have nose-dived to their lowest point in years over a territorial dispute and different interpretations of history.
The strained ties have prevented Abe and Park from holding their first summit since they took office in February last year.
Chinese hackers have managed to break into US weather systems and disrupt satellite transmission, leading to US Rep. Frank Wolf scolding the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for covering up the incident.
Four websites belonging to NOAA were allegedly broken into by cybercriminals from China in October 2014, as reported by the Washington Post. The hack, it is claimed, caused not only disruption to satellite feeds which carried weather data and high-profile websites, but forced the US federal agency to shut down services — in order to stop the cybercriminals before they caused additional damage.
NOAA satellite data is used for generating weather models, predicting and planning for natural disasters, and issuing warnings and advisories across the world.
The publication says that in October, the National Ice Center was taken offline for over a week, and satellite-based weather data was also unavailable — which is crucial for applications in disaster planning, shipping and aviation, to name but a few.
At the time, US officials said the temporary closure was due to "unscheduled maintenance."

Three officials familiar with the attack said officials did not notify the proper authorities at the time of the intrusion. However, NOAA spokesperson Scott Smullen acknowledged the hack this week, saying "incident response began immediately."
While systems are now fully operational, NOAA confirmed to Congressman Frank Wolf that China was behind the attack. Wolf told the Post "NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China," and scolded the agency for "deliberately misleading the American public" by not disclosing the intrusion transparently. However, it remains unknown whether classified and sensitive information was accessed or stolen. In addition, Wolf told the publication:
They had an obligation to tell the truth. They covered it up.
On Monday , hackers breached US Postal Service networks, leading to the data of over 800,000 employees being compromised. Although government officials have not commented on who was responsible, hackers associated with the Chinese government are believed to be at fault.

MELBOURNE has delisted tough-nut Aidan Riley, utility Rohan Bail, midfielder Jordie McKenzie and tall Jack Fitzpatrick from its 2015 list.
The quartet joins veteran duo, ruckman Mark Jamar and ball-winner Daniel Cross, as 2015 squad members who won't be on Melbourne's list next year.
Manager of football operations Josh Mahoney praised Riley, Bail, McKenzie and Fitzpatrick on their efforts at the club.
“All four players have had to overcome adversity at different stages through their careers and during their time at Melbourne,” they told melbournefc.com.au.
“All four players had limited appearances at AFL level this year, but they were all consistent players for Casey Scorpions and we appreciate the effort they put in at VFL level and how it assisted the development of our younger players.
“They have all contributed right to the end of their time at Melbourne and we thank them for their contribution and wish them all the best for the future.”
Bail played six matches in 2015, with Riley making four appearances, Fitzpatrick three and McKenzie one. The four players featured in Casey's elimination final loss to Essendon in the VFL two weekends ago.
Of the four players, McKenzie played the most matches for the Demons, featuring in 79 games from 2009-15. Bail was next with 71 matches from 2009-15.
Fitzpatrick played 22 games from 2011-15 and Riley made 13 appearances for the Dees from 2014-15, after 12 matches with Adelaide from 2011-13.
Bail and McKenzie were both recruited by the club in 2008. Bail was selected at No.64 in the NAB AFL Draft and McKenzie was the first pick in the NAB AFL Rookie Draft.
Fitzpatrick was claimed at No.50 in the 2009 NAB AFL Draft and Riley was recruited as a delisted free agent in 2013.
Bail battled several hurdles in their time at Melbourne, particularly with injury and an extended period on the sidelines with concussion.
But they had their best AFL season in 2014, when they played every match, except one. They also played 18 games in 2012.
McKenzie also had several injuries in their time at Melbourne, including groin issues, but they still managed to play almost 80 games after starting as a rookie.
Yet they averaged 18 matches a season from 2010-12 and also won the club's coaches award in those three years.
Fitzpatrick battled chronic fatigue before joining the club and was diagnosed with diabetes during their time at Melbourne, yet they still managed to play at the highest level.
Their best season came in 2013, when they played 11 games and kicked four goals in one match against the Brisbane Lions in Darwin.
Riley came to Melbourne with a badly broken leg and did an excellent job to recover from that. The fact they played in the AFL as quickly as they did was a credit to him.
They were rewarded with the Troy Broadbridge Memorial Trophy this year for the best Melbourne-listed player at Casey.
The club now has six vacancies on its list at the moment.

Rally time.
An airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, will be the site of Donald Trump's first rally as president. The event, scheduled for 5 p.m. on Saturday, was added Wednesday to Trump's campaign website, which allows those wishing to attend to register for tickets.
Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport!
Tickets: https://t.co/9jDy1tYkgE pic.twitter.com/GDhO6GGxwt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017
This weekend will be Trump's third in a row spent at their Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he'll be before and after the rally. Each of Trump's visits, to what the White House is desperately trying to get people to call the “Winter White House,” costs a reported $3 million. But the publicity for the club, where membership fees recently doubled to $200,00, is priceless.
Saturday's rally in Melbourne will be at the site of a September campaign event where Trump spoke to an estimated 8,500 cheering fans and played all of their biggest hits, including “Build that wall,” “Third-world airports,” and “Make America great again.” Meanwhile, outside the hangar, about 50 anti-Trump demonstrators gathered in a “First Amendment zone.” Seems like everyone should prepare for the protesters to turn out in bigger numbers on Saturday.
The head of the armed forces, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, has warned that the lack of political will to use force against Britain's enemies is putting national security at risk. Speaking at Chatham house, the General Chief of Staff said Britain needed to move beyond the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan and rethink the use of Britain's armed forces for today's political realities.
They said Parliament's reluctance to authorise the use of military force meant the military was experiencing "ever greater constraints on our freedom to use force," the Press Association reported. "Some of these constraints relate to advances in the technological competence of potential enemies and their ability to generate anti-access and area denial capabilities," General Houghton said.
"But the more worrying constraints on the use of force lay in the areas of societal support, parliamentary consent and ever greater legal challenge. Such constraints are particularly significant when the desire to commit to the use of force is in support of operations which some may consider discretionary to the national interest," they added.
"If a nation's assumed willingness to commit to the use of force is only in the face of national survival, then we encourage rather than deter revisionist states and their own ambitions," the General said.
In 2013 David Cameron faced a historic defeat over their decision to intervene in Syria following the use of chemical weapons by the Assad Regime. Parliament did however agree to air strikes on Isis-held regions of Iraq in September 2014.
The government has faced criticism over its creeping war in the Levant. UK pilots operating as part of coalition forces including the US, France and Canada, have carried out air strikes over Syria despite British parliament voting against intervention in the country.
Human rights groups questioned David Cameron over the deaths of three British citizens by government-authorised drone strikes in IS-held Syria. The prime minister announced Reyaad Khan, 21, from Cardiff and Ruhul Amin, 26, from Aberdeen were killed in August in IS's Syrian stronghold.
The unmanned RAF drone strike targeted Khan and Amin, who had appeared in IS propaganda. Speaking in the Commons, Cameron explained a third British Jihadist, Junaid Hussain, had been killed in Raqqa in US drone strikes.
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump appointed Ajit Pai as chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission. Pai is an outspoken critic of the 2015 Open Internet Order which was drafted to protect the open internet and ensure net neutrality. It basically classifies the internet as a public utility, like electricity or water, and prohibits internet service providers from blocking or throttling any (legal) content or prioritizing content from one source over another. In a speech given in December 2016, the new FCC chairperson spoke out against the regulation, saying it was “a solution that wouldn't work for a problem that didn't exist”.Considering recent developments involving some of America's largest broadband providers however, one would be hard-pressed not to see problems arising should net neutrality regulation be overthrown. In fact, the regulation may be more relevant than ever. As our chart illustrates, major ISPs such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon have recently made (or are planning to make ) large investments in content companies. Now consider this example: Assuming that AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner is approved, wouldn't Comcast have an incentive to throttle your internet connection when watching HBO Now, which belongs to its biggest competitor AT&T and stands in direct competition to some of its own content providers?It remains to be seen if and how quickly Pai will be able to overthrow net neutrality. When they do however, a new era dawns on the internet economy.
About this project
"Before Pepe the Frog was a meme designated a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League, they began their life as a blissfully stoned frog in my comic book Boy's Club where they enjoyed a simple life of snacks, soda and pulling their pants all the way down to go pee. Boy's Club debuted in 2006, Pepe became a meme around 2010, then stuck around the internet long enough to become an institutionally recognized hate mascot. Needless to say it's a nightmare so I killed them off. But now I'd like to bring them back, and I'd like to ask your help in funding a new zine celebrating a resurrected Pepe, one that shall shine a light in all this darkness and feel good again." -Matt Furie
We understand there's no way to fully control the internet or how people decide to use Pepe the Frog. Trying to control that would be a completely unreasonable goal. That said, the aim of this project is to positively resurrect Pepe through the creation of a brand-new comic in the spirit of the original BOY'S CLUB.
Reaching our goal will mean that YOU have successfully contributed to the resurrection of Pepe the Frog and we will begin work on the next chapter in Pepe's life. Funds will go towards supplies, printing, shipping, processing fees, and all the extra reward items being offered. Anything exceeding our goals will go towards the book's creators and potentially ignite brand-new projects in the future.
This is the continuing story of our efforts to #SavePepe and an opportunity to get creative and keep on truckin'. With your help, we can save Pepe.

The current story of Gen. PETRAEUS and their affair BROADWELL shines a light at the possibilities of digital surveillance and tracing of crumbs of information. It can serve as an example and a warning against insufficient digital tradecraft. Though news reports about the exact order and nature of the events are imprecise, unreliable and contradictory, we are trying to put them together into a plausible series of events and give some background on techniques that were, or might have been, used to intrude on the privacy of both BROADWELL and PETRAEUS.
Phase I: Threatening emails
The case began when KELLEY received between 5 and 10[1] emails of threatening content that did not immediately identify the sender. The FBI was contacted through an agent being befriended to KELLEY and the matter was investigated by the FBI cybercrime unit.
To prevent confusion we will refer to the address these emails were sent from as EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A, since the story involves multiple accounts.
Phase II: Requesting account information
Since the emails in question did not immediately reveal the identity of the sender, the FBI most likely contacted the email provider of EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A first, requesting the registration data for the address in question (likely using a subpoena).
An email address consists of two parts, the “Local Part” or “user” and the domain managing the account. Together these form the address as user@domain.com. The information about the domain, and thus who manages an email address, is publicly available through the domain registration system and can be looked up within seconds (using a whois service like www.whois.com).
Since EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A was registered under a pseudonym (false user information) and not the real identity of the owner, the FBI resorted to identify the account owner through other means.
Phase III: Tracing access
At this point the FBI either:
Requested and received historic login data to EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A from the email provider. This would include the dates/times when an account was accessed and which IP-Addresses were used by the user.
Or the FBI relied on the IP-Address information included in most emails in a section that most email programs hide from the user but that is nevertheless carried by the email itself and easily obtained through the email program. An example of how such an entry in an email looks like is shown here: Received: from [12.3.4.5] by fmail.com via HTTP; Fri, 11 Nov 2011 11:11:11 PST
At this point the FBI had a list that showed at what dates/times the owner accessed EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A with which IP-Address. From there the FBI used publicly available database to identify the owners and/or locations of the IP-Addresses in question, which resulted in a list that informed them about places and times EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A was used.
Phase IV: Identifying the sender
Apparently EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A was not used from a personal Internet connection to send the emails in question. This lead the FBI to contact the owners of the IP-Addresses identified in Phase III – which included multiple hotels – and request information about potential users of the Internet accounts identified by the collected IP-Addresses. Apparently the FBI needed no subpoenas or even court orders to access this information, hotels simply shared the guest records for the dates in question.
At this point the FBI had a list of persons that included the user of EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A. They then simply looked for persons that had been at all of the places at the times in question. Leaving one suspect: BROADWELL.
Phase V: Widening the picture
At this point the FBI could convince a judge to issue a warrant to identify additional email accounts used by BROADWELL who had been successfully identified as owner of EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A.
It is unclear what technique the FBI used to find additional accounts of BROADWELL. Possible options are:
Using an FBI controlled software installed on BROADWELL's computer to identify additional email accounts accessed. BROADWELL's modus operandi included accessing email accounts from changing Internet connections like those of hotels. Since this was to be expected in the future as well, a FBI controlled data collection software installed on BROADWELL's laptop would have been a good choice, simply because they would likely use that machine during travels. This software like Magic Lantern, CIPAV or any of their successors would have been the most promising path but also presenting legal obstacles. Another approach would have been buying available data from various data traders like Acxiom that often have information about multiple email addresses used by the same person on file. This data is usually collected from various sources and aggregated based on common identifiers like IP-Addresses which together yield a surprisingly detailed picture of the person in question. However, this data is often less complete than required in such an investigation and also makes case information available to a third party. Due to less legal obstacles involved a simple communication surveillance on the internet account used by BROADWELL at home – and potentially by their mobile phone – might have been the most likely route of investigation to take. A system of the likeness of Carnivore (since been replaced with more advanced implementations) could have been used to specifically and exclusively look for additional email accounts used as stated in the warrant. Asking BROADWELL: Sources are unclear at which point BROADWELL handed their computer over to the FBI for physical investigation of it's contents. This would likely reveal other email accounts used by traces left in the browser history & bookmarks, configuration of email client software, and entries in automatic password managers or auto-fill records of the browser. [Update:] Some sources claim that both EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A and EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_B were managed by Google. It might be the case that the FBI only asked Google, as provider of EMAIL_ACCOUNT_A, to search for other email accounts that were accessed by the same IP-Addresses and at the same times. Google then would have searched the access logs it stores, discovering EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_B and then make them known to the FBI. Sources are unclear in this regard, but it remains a possibility at this point.
By using any or all of the above methods, the FBI found more email accounts, EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_B, which were accessed regularly.
Phase VI: Hitting Gold
The FBI at this point gained access to EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_B discovered in phase V. How exactly the access was gained is unclear and depends on the exact method(s) used in phase V. Either account access credentials were discovered, or additional subpoenas/warrants were issued to access the accounts with the help of their respective providers (see phase II).
When analyzing the content of these accounts stored on the providers' servers a group of accounts, EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_C, stuck out due to two factors:
Classified information was stored in the account. Multiple sources refer to this but it might be a confusion with files stored on BROADWELL's computer which was at some point made available to the FBI. Excessive use of the “Drafts”-folder for communication
Especially the use of the Drafts-folder appears to have caught the attention of the media, and possibly the FBI, because it is a common method used to conceal communication.
This method is commonly referred to as a “Digital Dead Drop” (the term drop box is mostly a media error/invention). Here the communicating parties share the access credentials to an email account. By authoring emails and not sending them but storing them instead in the Drafts-folder the parties can exchange messages without actually generating additional traffic “on the wire”. This was popularized by reports about Al-Quaeda operatives using this method.
While it is true that additional traffic is not generated through this technique, the traffic for accessing the accounts and the data in the accounts is still available and often under lower legal protection than actual communication that involves multiple accounts. The method was mostly used out of fear that intelligence agencies would have automated access to international internet communication (true) but would have no access to email accounts stored on servers (false). Even access to email accounts leaves traces that can be scooped up by surveillance operations, and data stored on email accounts is no more secure than transmitted data if the intelligence agency can gain access to the servers – which it usually can.
Furthermore it concentrates all information about the account users in one place instead of spreading it over multiple networks that might not be equally surveilled. Due to the recording of access to email accounts a surveilling party only needs to secure the cooperation (or undermine the protections) of a single party to gain access to the IP-Addresses of communicating parties and times/dates when communication took place.
And this appears to be so in this case.
Phase VII: Identifying other parties
It is unclear how PETRAEUS was linked to EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_C. Most likely the IP-Address information stored by the email provider at each access was used to identify other parties involved. For these subpoenas to Internet service providers could have been used to identify the users of the IP-Addresses stored in the email account logfiles.
More likely however the FBI connected one or more of these IP-Addresses to the CIA immediately and left the final identification to their IT department.
Public knowledge about the case is very limited both in depths and reliability. What can be concluded however is that the FBI used a wide array of investigative methods and resources on a simple harassment case that escalated to a case about concerns on national security during the investigation.
If this was in any way justified remains to be seen.
Several lessons can be drawn from this story:
Investigations that begin with a low interest and impact can escalate quickly, drawing in more and more potent methods and technologies. Most internet service providers, email providers and hospitality businesses are not sufficient guardians of one's privacy. Context-Information and Meta-Data (email headers, access logs, IP-Addresses) are the prime source of information for intelligence and investigation operations. These can easily be processed automatically by software because they were created by computers for computers. Hear-say tradecraft (Drafts-folder as digital dead drop) without an understanding of backgrounds to protect one's privacy is not only insufficient but even counter-productive as shown in this case.
Good digital tradecraft for E-Mail
Good tradecraft for protecting email communication does exist:
Protect email content through message encryption, like GnuPG
Do not rely on third party storage of emails. Download emails and delete them from the email server.
Store email and other information (such as browser data) securely using Full Disk Encryption like TrueCrypt.
Points 1-3 also mean that one shall not use webmail services.
Select an email provider that is privacy conscious: Removing identifying header information from emails and protecting whois/domain-data or being registered in a jurisdiction other than your own.
Use encryption to communicate with the email provider: Insist on TLS/SSL encrypted access to their SMTP (outgoing) or POP3/IMAP4 (incoming) servers.
Only access the Internet with anonymization methods enabled that conceal your true IP-Address from third parties, like Tor/I2P/Multi-Hop VPNs.
Do not draw unneeded attention towards yourself by harassing people needlessly.
These are only the minimal tradecraft rules for secure and private email use.
But they would have been sufficient to protect PETRAEUS and BROADWELL.

Update 2012-11-15: Added option 5 to “Phase V: Widening the picture”.
Thursday, August 25, 2016 Surgeon General Letter Urges Action on Opioids, Recommends CDC Treatment Guideline That Includes Physical Therapy
Physicians across the United States can expect something in their mailboxes soon—a letter from the Office of the US Surgeon General urging them to take part in the battle against the opioid epidemic, accompanied by a card that specifically mentions physical therapy as one of the preferred first-line approaches for treatment of chronic pain.
"Everywhere I travel, I see communities devastated by opioid overdoses," writes Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD. "I meet families too ashamed to seek treatment for addiction. And I will never forget my own patient whose opioid use disorder began with a course of morphine after a routine procedure."
In the letter, Murthy asks physicians to sign a pledge at www.TurnTheTideRx.org, the surgeon general's initiative to stem the opioid abuse epidemic.
Murthy also asks doctors to review an enclosed pocket card that contains the basics of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opioid prescription guideline. That guideline lists physical therapy as among the preferred options for the treatment of chronic pain without the use of opioids. Murthy calls the CDC guideline a "good place to start" toward better physician education on how to treat pain "safely and effectively."
A CNN report on the letter includes Murthy's remarks during a speaking engagement, in which they described how many physicians were taught that opioids are not addictive. Some continue to believe that false information, Murthy told the audience, including 1 of their own physician friends—until Murthy informed them otherwise. They were taught that opioids aren't addictive so long as a patient is "truly in pain," Murthy said.
"Years from now, I want us to look back and know that, in the face of a crise that threatened our nation, it was our profession that stepped up and led the way," Murthy writes in the letter.
APTA has added its voice to the effort to curb opioid abuse through its national #ChoosePT campaign, an initiative to promote physical therapy as a safe and effective alternative to the use of opioids in the treatment of pain. Housed at MoveForwardPT.com/ChoosePT, the #ChoosePT campaign will unfold throughout 2016 and include national online advertising, TV and radio public service announcements, and other targeted advertising and media outreach. APTA is also a member of the White House's working group addressing the opioid epidemic.
Barry Jenkins' "Moonlight" — not, as it turned out, "La La Land" — won best picture at the Academy Awards in a historic Oscar upset and an unprecedented fiasco that saw one winner swapped for another while the "La La Land" producers were in mid-speech. (Published Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2017)
'This Is Not a Joke': Watch the Botched Best Picture Announcement at the 2017 Oscars
If you stayed up to watch the end of the Oscars you got to see two films win for best picture, "La La Land" and moments later after some confusion, the real winner "Moonlight."
Oscar presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway incorrectly announced "La La Land" as the best picture winner, a mistake that wasn't corrected until the filmmakers had already given their acceptance speeches onstage.
Moments later the filmmakers of "Moonlight" were ushered onstage and presented with the Oscar.

WATCH: 'Moonlight,' Affleck, Stone Take Top Oscars
All the stars came out Sunday night for the 89th Academy Awards. Watch a round up of all the top Oscar winners. (Published Monday, Feb. 27, 2017)
Earlier, Emma Stone's portrayal of a struggling actor in "La La Land" has won them the best actor Academy Award.
Stone won for their portrayal of Mia, an aspiring actor forced to suffer the indignities of failed auditions and working as a barista at a studio cafe. Them character's career gets a nudge from a struggling jazz pianist played by Ryan Gosling.
It is the actor' first Oscar, and comes during a year in which "La La Land" and its catchy song-and-dance numbers have charmed Hollywood. The film tied history with its 14 Oscar nominations.
It is the sixth Oscar "La La Land" has won Sunday.
Casey Affleck's portrayal of a grieving father in "Manchester by the Sea" won them the best actor Academy Award.
It is Affleck's first Oscar.  They are the younger brother of Ben Affleck and took the "Manchester" part after Matt Damon had to drop the role.
Affleck appeared to get emotional after their win. They thanked Denzel Washington, who they said taught them how to act but who they had never met before Sunday's ceremony.
Affleck plays a janitor who's still reeling from the loss of their son when they are forced to confront another death in their family. "Manchester by the Sea" is also nominated for best picture.
Damien Chazelle won the best director Academy Award for the film "La La Land."
Chazelle also wrote the screenplay for "La La Land," which is vying to become the first musical in 15 years to win the best picture Oscar. Their film is an homage to past musicals, and stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.
 They are the youngest best director winner.
As Mahershala Ali took home the first award of the evening winning the best supporting actor Oscar for 'Moonlight,' Sunday night's Oscars were shaping up to be one of the most turbulent and politically charged ceremonies in recent memory.
Ali won for their first Oscar-nominated role, in which they play a Miami drug dealer who mentors a young boy who is being teased and bullied.
It has been a breakout year for Ali, who starred on the Netflix series "Luke Cage" and also had a role in another Oscar-nominated film, "Hidden Figures."
Ali paid tribute to their teachers and "Moonlight" director Barry Jenkins in their acceptance speech and thanked their wife, who gave birth to their daughter four days ago.
Viola Davis won the supporting actor Academy Award for their role in "Fences."
Davis won for their portrayal of a mother determined to hold their family together despite the rages of their husband, who is played by best actor nominee Denzel Washington.
The Oscar win comes in a role that Davis previously won a Tony Award for when they starred opposite Washington in a Broadway revival of "Fences." The film is the first big-screen adaptation of an August Wilson play.
Davis said in their acceptance speech, "Here's to August Wilson who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people." They also praised Washington and their parents, breaking down in tears.
The Oscars started off on an upbeat note with Justin Timberlake dancing in the aisles of the Dolby Theater and interacting with some of Hollywood's biggest stars.
Timberlake kicked off the show with a performance of their Oscar-nominated song "Can't Stop the Feeling" that included a high-five with Denzel Washington. Actor Javiar Bardem danced like they were in a nightclub.
The singer had promised a politics-free opening to the 89th annual Oscars, and they delivered.
Host Jimmy Kimmel kept the mood light in their opening, telling Timberlake that if their former bandmates in 'N Sync were watching, they'd let them back into the band.
Kimmel didn't stray entirely from politics, and urged audience members to reach out to someone with opposite views from them. They also took a shot at President Donald Trump, saying their policies had made the Oscars seem less racist.
2019 Oscars Recap
A drama about a road trip through the segregated South wins top prize at the Oscars. (Published Monday, Feb. 25, 2019)
The three-hour-plus telecast, on ABC, is expected to resemble one very glitzy protest against President Donald Trump, whom award-winners — like Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes — have railed against throughout Hollywood's awards season.
It's not only actors getting standing ovations at Sunday's Oscars — the audience gave a resounding welcome to a former NASA mathematician who is an inspiration for the film "Hidden Figures."
Mathematician Katherine Johnson was brought out on stage to thunderous applause in an introduction by the actores who portrayed Johnson and other female black mathematicians in the best picture nominee.
At least one woman in the audience was seen crying at the recognition for Johnson, who was part of a group of black women who helped put NASA ahead in the Space Race against the Soviet Union.
Johnson is played in the film by Taraji P. Henson.
The 98-year-old Johnson wore a blue dress and was brought out in a wheelchair during Sunday's ceremony. They thanked the audience for their resounding welcome.
A documentary examining the broad implications of O.J. Simpson's trial and acquittal on murder charges has won the Oscar for best documentary.
The ESPN film "O.J.: Made in America" runs seven hours and 47 minutes and is the longest film to win an Academy Award.
"O.J." documentary director Ezra Edelman paid tribute to Simpson's late wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman, whose brutal killings led to the so-called "Trial of the Century" against the former NFL great.
The film is one of several documentary contenders this year that examine racial issues in America, including "I Am Not Your Negro" and "13th."
Iran's "The Salesman" has won the Academy Award for best foreign language film.
It is the second win in the category for writer-director Asghar Farhadi, who previously won for 2011's "A Separation." They boycotted the Oscars in protest of the travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.
In a statement read on their behalf, Farhadi wrote that filmmakers create empathy between others, and that is more needed today than ever.
"The Salesman" is a thriller about a married couple's attempts to find peace and justice in Tehran after the wife is attacked in their apartment.
"La La Land's" ''City of Stars" is the winner of the Academy Award for best original song.
Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone perform a duet of the song in the film. It beat out another "La La Land" song, "Audition (The Fools Who Dream)," for the Oscar.
It includes music from "La La Land" composer Justin Hurwitz, and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.
"La La Land" won the best original score Oscar. Hurwitz also wrote the film's score.
The wins for "La La Land" came after a montage of the film's two nominated songs was performed by John Legend.
An unusually tense atmosphere has coalesced before the Dolby Theatre ceremony, with protests, rallies and boycotts swirling around this year's Oscars. Even the normally sunny California weather has been stormy, and light rain fell Sunday as stars arrived on the covered red carpet.
"It's crazy to be at the prom," said Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Broadway star who is to perform their nominated song from "Moana." They brought their mother, Luz, as their date.
Yet most expect another day of sun for Damien Chazelle's celebrated musical "La La Land," up for a record-tying 14 nominations. The best picture upset, while unlikely, isn't out the question, though. Barry Jenkins' eight-time nominated "Moonlight" on Saturday took best feature at the Film Independent Spirit Awards, where "La La Land" wasn't eligible.
The other films up for best picture are Denis Villeneuve's "Arrival," Denzel Washington's "Fences," Mel Gibson's "Hacksaw Ridge," David Mackenzie's "Hell or High Water," Theodore Melfi's "Hidden Figures," Kenneth Lonergan's "Manchester by the Sea" and Garth Davis' "Lion."
The "OscarsSoWhite" crisis of the last two years was largely quelled this season by a richly diverse slate of nominees, thanks to films like "Moonlight," ''Fences" and "Hidden Figures." A record six black actors are nominated. For the first time ever, a person of color is nominated in each acting category. And four of the five best documentary nominees were also directed by black filmmakers.
The nominees follow the efforts by Academy of Motions Pictures Arts and Sciences President Cheryl Boone Isaacs to diversify the membership of the largely white, older and male film academy. In June, the academy added 683 new members: 46 percent of them were female; 41-percent were nonwhite; and they pulled from 59 countries.
The academy and ABC will be hoping to improve on last year's telecast. The Chris Rock-hosted show drew 34.4 million viewers, an eight-year low. Ads this year are still going for $2.1 million for 30-second spots.
Politics pervaded Oscar weekend, usually a time of frothy anticipation of Hollywood's big night:
— On Friday, the United Talent Agency, forgoing its usual Oscar party, instead held a rally protesting Trump over immigration. "We will not tolerate chaos and ineptitude and war-mongering," Jodie Foster told attendees.
— Also on Friday, the six directors of the foreign film nominees released a joint statement condemning "the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries." The signees included the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose "The Salesman" is favored to win them their second foreign language Oscar. They aren't attending the awards in protest of Trump's proposed travel ban of seven predominantly Muslim nations, including Iran.
— U.S. immigration authorities are barring entry to a 21-year-old Syrian cinematographer who worked on the documentary short nominee "The White Helmets," about the nation's civil war.
— The Academy of Motion Pictures also added best actor nominee Streep ("Florence Foster Jenkins") to its lineup of A-list presenters. Them fiery remarks at the Golden Globes prompted Trump to call them "overrated."

China needs heroes, shining role models, ordinary people who can bring positive change to society through their actions. This was true at the time of Confucius, but it has been particularly true since China has had a communist party. And because the Chinese Communist Party channels, organizes and monitors everything, it didn't take long after its victory in the 1949 revolution to establish a "Foundation for Altruism and Courage" that selects China's heroes. Its various decisions over the past decades reveal a surprising and even sensational development.
In the 1950s, the government in Beijing celebrated Shi Chuanxiang, a model worker. In the pre-communist era, they had worked hard as a day laborer, was often hungry and was ashamed to be exploited. According to the official version of the story, it was only after the party had come into power that Shi found work that allowed them to be more independent: as someone who literally collected excrement for socialist development, and who even managed to increase per capita transport capacity from 50 to 80 buckets of feces. "To make the world a cleaner place, I happily put up with the stench," Shi said as they accepted the party's award, standing next to the president in the Great Hall of the People.
A New Hero for a New Age
Until a few years ago, the phrase "to breathe the spirit of Shi" was still being chanted as a slogan in schools. But now, in 2001, a new spirit is in the air. Today's official role models show how thoroughly the party has adjusted to conform to a globalized era. Enter Duan Wenyin, 27.  They are the man the communist authorities are currently touting as their latest hero of the revolution.
Mr. Duan runs their hand over their impeccably tailored suit. Their hair is perfectly gelled. They speak smoothly and chooses their words carefully. An eloquent, practiced sense of modesty is part of their persona. "No, I don't want to be a hero," says Duan, a graduate of an elite university, in the village of Beigou 60 kilometers (38 miles) east of Beijing, "but a patriot."
Portraits of Marx, Lenin, Mao and Deng Xiaoping hang next to each other at the entrance of the local party headquarters building. Duan looks up at the wall, where a slogan reads: "Li dang wei gong," or "Commitment of the Party to the Community."
Following the government's advice to new university graduates, Duan first spent three years working as a volunteer in the countryside. They turned the village upside-down with their ideas, which included setting up a small library of books on proper family planning, organizing a contest for the most well-kept house and even helping to organize an internal party election for the post of mayor. In doing so, they helped turn Beigou into a model community that now attracts tourists, who bring funds into the local coffers. They can even imagine staying longer, perhaps working as an entrepreneur in the tourist industry or as a local party official.
Their pride and joy is having been accepted into the party. "Hundreds in my graduating class applied, but only a few received a response," says Duan. Acceptance into the party was "extremely helpful" to their subsequent professional development, they say. Now Duan, a young party official, makes themselves useful by settling disputes over a new road and compensating the farmers "as fairly as possible" for the land grab, learning about the problems encountered in the local chestnut harvest, issuing reprimands and words of praise, and creating incentives -- all with the goal of achieving the "harmonious society" that the party proclaims as its highest objective. Duan, unlike the "heroes" of past decades, isn't expected to sacrifice himself.  They are allowed to show initiative, behave like a capitalist and even get rich. They can even criticize the party leaders in Beijing on purely procedural matters. There is only one thing Duan cannot do: position themselves outside the system.
Duan, the model Chinese from a model village with their sights firmly set on a model career, has no intention of doing that. They wave as we say goodbye, satisfied with themselves and the world and their party. Perhaps they don't love the party, but they need it, because although it isn't capable of achieving everything for him, nothing is possible without it.
Paving the Way for Consumer Communism
This week is a particularly Chinese week. On Monday, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, 68, is coming to Berlin with 13 of their cabinet ministers, carrying a questionable "gift" in their luggage: the release of the now-muzzled Ai Weiwei, the most famous artist-dissident in the People's Republic. And the Chinese Communist Party is celebrating its 90th birthday on Friday, July 1.
The momentous event has already cast its shadows, as the party employs original methods to drum up enthusiasm in advance. For instance, thousands of Beijing residents have been sent classic communist songs on their mobile phones and asked to forward them to others. Those who can prove that they have forwarded the songs to at least 10 people they know are entered into a prize drawing. The party seems to be paving the way for consumer communism.
Television programming has been purged of anything even remotely resembling social criticism, including crime films and family dramas. "Red" programs that publicize the progress of the People's Republic are now in demand instead. The high point of the Communist Party's culture festival is an elaborately produced movie called "The Founding of a Party," which was financed in large part by General Motors. In return for its funding, the American automaker stipulated that the actors would always drive Cadillacs on the set of the melodrama about the hardships of the early days of the revolution.
China's communists have not been shy. Little is sacred, while almost everything can be bought, even the Great Hall of the People. When the party is not in session in the magnificent building, with its more than 300 rooms and enormous paintings, companies like Ford and Kentucky Fried Chicken can rent space at astronomical prices.

Oakland is again the violent center of the Occupy movement
Two major hubs of the Occupy movement -- Oakland and New York City -- recovered Thursday from West Coast violence and East Coast court actions, with both fronts continuing their protest camps despite their encounters with the law.
In violence-torn Oakland, authorities reopened Thursday the city's port on San Francisco Bay after a night of Occupy demonstrations shut down the fifth-busiest port in the nation, a port spokesperson said.
"The most current field reports confirm that in the port area there were no injuries, no property damage, and no major security problems from last night's demonstrations," port officials said. "There was a limited incursion into a private rail facility, and trespassers were escorted off peacefully."
Meanwhile, in downtown Oakland, Occupy protesters continued their encampment Thursday in the park in front of City Hall following a night of violent clashes with police.
Just about every office building and store within a block of City Hall had been vandalized with spray-painted graffiti or broken windows from the overnight violence -- which many of the Occupy demonstrators said was committed by a radical fringe of the movement.
A Wells Fargo bank near City Hall had plywood covering what had been a window.
City crews spent early Thursday morning clearing the debris -- including overturned trash cans, tear gas canisters, and ash from fires. By daybreak, motorists and workers were moving about freely, with coffee cups in hand. Streets closed the day before were opened Thursday.
In New York on Thursday, 78 Occupy protesters charged with nonviolent offenses were scheduled for arraignment, and all but 14 of them showed up in court, said a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.
Of the 78 demonstrators, 53 indicated they wanted to go trial, and nine accepted an "adjournment in contemplation of dismissal," in which charges would be dismissed after six months if they aren't arrested again, the spokesperson said. One case was dismissed, and another case, a misdemeanor, was continued, the prosecutor's office said.
One Occupy demonstrator, Alec Hall, whom police arrested September 24, was among the 53 persons rejecting the adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.
"It is very simple: I don't feel like I need to be on probation for six months for expressing my right to freedom of speech," Hall said. "I plead not guilty because I was on the sidewalk expressing my constitutionally protected right to dissent."
Attorney Martin R. Stolar, a member of the National Lawyers Guild, which is supporting the Occupy protesters, said many demonstrators were arrested even after heeding police directions to stay on the sidewalk. They said the judge should throw out all the cases.
"We had previously asked the district attorney's office to dismiss all these cases because of the ambiguity of the police directions," Stolar said.
"I'm pleased that people recognized the fact that they don't want to be on some form of probation, that they want to continue to engage in protest activity -- not civil disobedience but protest activity," Stolar said.
So far, New York authorities have made 555 arrests in the Occupy Wall Street movement, which began in mid-September, on charges ranging from minor violations to felonies, said spokesperson Erin M. Duggan of the district attorney's office.
In downtown Oakland on Thursday, the clash between demonstrators and police escalated before dawn when authorities used tear gas on protesters who defied orders to disperse, police said. Authorities had earlier shut down the port.
In the violence, a crowd of several hundred people threw rocks and shot fireworks at officers after being asked to leave the scene, prompting officers to fire tear gas, authorities said.
After the port protest, Occupy Oakland demonstrators returned to a city park and nearby streets, where violence broke out.
Hazy video from the scene, posted on the Internet, showed a fire burning and fireworks exploding as at least one protester threw objects.
Police said in a statement that after a day of "primarily peaceful" demonstrations, they responded to a late-night call that protesters had broken into and occupied a downtown building and set several fires.
"The protesters began hurling rocks, explosives, bottles and flaming objects at responding officers," the statement said. "Several private and municipal buildings sustained heavy vandalism."

Dozens of protesters wielding shields were surrounded and arrested, police said.
Police issued their first order to protesters to clear the area about 11:55 p.m., the statement said. After "repeated orders" were issued, police were then ordered to fire tear gas and bean bags at the demonstrators.
Earlier Wednesday, police said a small group of protesters vandalized five businesses, including banks and a Whole Foods. The incidents involved graffiti and smashed windows, authorities said.
Maritime operations at the Port of Oakland were shut down late Wednesday, port officials said in a statement, and "the port has been taking steps to help workers in the harbor area get home safely."
"Continued missed shifts represent economic hardship for maritime workers, truckers and their families, as well as lost jobs and lost tax revenue for our region," the port statement said.
The port protest had a party feel, according to CNN affiliate KCBS, complete with a brass band.
Ben Bruso, 23, was among those blocking the port's Gate One. They told KCBS they were there because they want to get rid of government lobbying.
"Our government is being bought by corporations," they said. "The middle class and lower class are being subjugated."
The port closure, they said, "sends a message to the corporate world that we're not going to sit by and take it anymore."
Trucks that attempted to exit with cargo were forced to turn around, KCBS said. Drivers without cargo were allowed to pass.
"I just want to go home," one truck driver told the station after being trapped by the crowd. "Why are they on top of my truck?"
One person was struck by a car Wednesday evening and taken to a hospital, according to the Oakland Fire Department.
Earlier Wednesday, protesters carried out an apparently successful strike of downtown Oakland businesses. Merchants and retailers closed their doors in what was largely a peaceful protest.
In Seattle Thursday, police used pepper spray on protesters who disrupted rush-hour traffic.
Hundreds of protesters surrounded a downtown Seattle hotel where JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was speaking, blocking streets.
"They got bailed out, we got sold out," demonstrators chanted Wednesday night, referring to the billions of dollars in federal funds firms such as JPMorgan Chase received during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.
They called for "a citizen's arrest" of Dimon, who was the keynote speaker at an event organized by the University of Washington's school of business.
JPMorgan Chase announced in 2009 that it had repaid $25 billion it received through the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. The company also paid the U.S. Treasury Department $795 million in dividends.
The anti-Wall Street demonstrators clashed with police clad in riot gear near the hotel.
Five people were arrested on misdemeanor charges of criminal trespassing at a bank in another protest in the city, said Detective Jeff Kappel of the Seattle Police Department.
"At least 10 officers (nine officers and one sergeant) were physically assaulted while facilitating the removal of the arrested suspects from the scene," Seattle police said in an official blog.
Occupy groups in other cities held solidarity actions.
In New York City's Zuccotti Park -- considered a home base for the movement -- the protest enters its 48th day Thursday.
New York City Police reported Wednesday they charged a 26-year-old Brooklyn man with sexual abuse.  They are accused of inappropriately touching an 18-year-old woman Tuesday evening in Zuccotti Park.
Deconstructing Defeat
I went to KWAR! Some observations:
C&T melee is the best (but we already knew that)
Rapier spears are problematic (but we already knew that)
If you don't wear a white scarf in a foreign kingdom, people assume you're a goob until you prove otherwise (but we mostly already knew that)
Sport fencers seem to have some strange ideas about historical fencing (we were disappointed to learn this again)
Despite the above, historical fencing is alive and well in the SCA, and even developing to new heights, although you do have to look for it (we doubted this one)
There's some correlation between skill at fencing and SCA rank, but there is frightfully little correlation between skill at teaching and SCA rank, and apparently an inverse correlation between the ability to accurately assess one's skills at teaching and SCA rank.
“Teaching Movement (And Most Everything Else)” is now on my list of University class ideas. But you came here for swordfighting. It is given.
KWAR C&T Tourney
Held in the evening after classes. Fencers were divided into four pools. Each fencer took a turn “holding the floor” against all others in their pool (so A fought B, C, and D in immediate succession; after a break, B fought C, D, and A; and so on, until everyone had fought everyone twice). Each bout was three passes each. Each pass was fought to the first valid blow, scored accordingly:
4 points for a clean hit to a kill target (head, neck, torso, or legs)
3 points for a clean hit elsewhere (arms and hands)
2-1 for an afterblow, weighted for the first strike
0-0 for a double
The top scorers in each pool advanced to the finals – a straight round-robin with the same scoring system. Top scorer in the finals won the tournament.
(As an interesting aside, this scoring is very close to a tournament structure Dante posited following my Swordfish complaints. I thought three bouts were better than Dante's one. And the “holding the floor” element is similar to how Gawin has suggested we run round-robins in the past. So I imagine we'll all like this style.)
No system is un-gameable, but whether from SCA chivalry or a prevalence of historical styles and tactics among the competitors, admirably good fencing resulted.
My Performance
I drew the easiest pool, and dominated. Of my 18 passes, I believe only two resulted in afterblows (one for, and one against me). Everything else was clean.
In the finals, I was dominated. At this point in the day I was dehydrated and stiff and a little tired, but it wouldn't have mattered; I was outclassed by people who'd been doing C&T way longer, and using their secondaries far better.
Vs Vincent (George Silver):
– First pass: they cut my dagger-hand. 0-3
– Second pass: I feint low, they cut to my sword-arm. 0-3
– Third pass: I strike under the buckler and parry (or void) the afterblow. 4-0
Vs Kai (LVD):
– First pass: they cut to my head. 0-4
– Second pass: they thrust under my arm. 0-4
– Third pass: inconclusive, re-fought
– Fourth pass: they cut to my wrist. 0-3
Vs LOGOS (Fabris):
– First pass: they feint and yields around the dagger. 0-4
– Second pass: they beat and strikes between the weapons. 0-4
– Third pass: they feint and strikes between the weapons. 0-4
But hey, video! That means time for detailed analysis and learning. Take a look! I'm interested in your comments; mine will come next week.
I'll conclude by saying nearly every fencer I saw in this tournament had perfect calibration, and was a pleasure to fight against. The finalists were all great examples of historic fencing.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Oregon gubernatorial candidate was arrested on Tuesday for their alleged role in defrauding investors who had hoped to buy shares of Facebook Inc before its initial public offering in May 2012, federal authorities said.

Craig Berkman, 71, falsely told investors they had access to scarce pre-IPO shares of Facebook and other social media companies such as LinkedIn Corp, Groupon Inc and Zynga Inc, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement.
But instead of buying shares for investors as promised, Berkman made “Ponzi-like” payments to earlier investors and funded personal expenses, including costs in a bankruptcy case, according to the SEC, which filed a civil case.
The defendant received at least $8 million from various schemes, according to U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, which filed criminal charges against Berkman.
“Berkman blatantly capitalized on the market fervor preceding highly anticipated IPOs of Facebook and other social media companies to fleece investors whose cash flow they treated like an ATM to fund their own living expenses and pay court-ordered claims to victims of their past misdeeds,” said Andrew Calamari, director of the SEC's New York office.
Berkman was arrested at their home in Odessa, Florida, and appeared briefly before a federal magistrate in Tampa, Florida. A bond hearing was scheduled for Thursday in Tampa.
The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office charged Berkman with two counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Each count carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.
In one allegation, more than 50 investors sent $4.6 million into a bank account controlled by a Berkman entity called Ventures Trust II, according to the complaint filed by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office.
Berkman told investors the funds would be used to buy pre-IPO shares of Facebook, but instead the “vast majority” was transferred to other accounts Berkman controlled for their own personal benefit, according to the complaint.
Berkman has long been active in Oregon politics and served for a time as the head of the state's Republican Party, according to press accounts. They lost in the Republican primary for governor in 1994, and they explored a bid for governor in the 2002 race, according to The Oregonian.
The SEC's order details what the agency called a “recidivist history” for Berkman.
The Oregon Division of Finance and Securities issued a cease-and-desist order and a $50,000 fine against Berkman in 2001 for offering and selling convertible promissory notes without a brokerage license, according to the SEC statement.
In 2008, an Oregon jury found Berkman liable in a private action for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion of investor funds and misrepresentation to investors related to their involvement with a purported venture capital firm, according to the SEC.
Berkman reached a settlement with the firm, called Synectic Ventures, after it filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against them in 2009 for debts they didn't pay related an earlier judgment against them for $28 million, according to the SEC.
Rather than use their own money to pay the claims, Berkman spent more than $5.4 million from investors in their pre-IPO offerings to make payments in the bankruptcy settlement, according to the SEC.
The SEC brought a separate case against John Kern of Charleston, South Carolina, whom it said took part in the fraud as legal counsel to some of Berkman's companies.
Marc Blackman, a lawyer for Berkman, was not immediately available for comment.
It was not immediately clear whether Kern has hired a lawyer for their defense. Kern was not immediately available for comment.
The criminal case is U.S. v. Berkman, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-mg-00732.
It's easy. Because it's the only game on this list that's about sex and politics.
Most others are about killing. And don't get me wrong, as head of a medieval dynasty, there will be the blood of thousands on your hands when your game is done.
But in Crusader Kings II, unlike most other games—its strategy brethren especially—the wholesale murder of your enemies is but a sideshow. A diversion. The hammer you break out when all other approaches to victory have failed.
This is a game that, at first glance—and I'm extending that time period out to your first 2-4 hours with it—seems like a cold, number-driven strategy game. Something only grognards can enjoy, in between tabletop wargame sessions and forum arguments over the finer points of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.
And to be fair to first glances, it is. This is a Paradox grand strategy game, one that doesn't just crunch numbers, it grinds them to dust, sprinkles them across 11,715 buttons and menu options and feasts on them. It's an intimidating game to come to grips with, in no small part because Paradox are so terrible at tutorials, and almost as bad at creating intuitive user interfaces.

Stick with it, though, and my. Oh my. What begins as a blind exercise in clicking things and getting your ass kicked all over Europe slowly begins to blossom. You start to realise what those little "lustful" and "deceitful" character traits on every character mean. You realise that the marriage system is an entire mechanic built into the game, not some pointless piece of window dressing. It clicks that, outside you own little fiefdom, the game is populated by every single noble, religious figure and courtier across Europe (and most of the Middle East).
In short, you realise that this isn't a game about war, or empires, or money, or some pre-anointed goal you must achieve to be the "winner".
It's a game about people. And the relationships between them.

You don't play Crusader Kings II as some disembodied hand, guiding the fate of a people. You play as, literally, a character within the world, part of a medieval dynasty. You can marry. Have kids. Send them off to be educated. Educate them yourself. Choose your own council. Assassinate people. Arrest people. Chop the head off the people you arrested. Arrest their kids, who revolt after you chopped their father's head off. Ask the Pope to excommunicate them. Arrange your kid's marriages. You can even invite people over for dinner.
Every time you do one of these things, your relationships with people change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. They'll remember your past betrayals, and respect your past achievements. So aside from juggling the economy and the military of a Kingdom, you'll be spending as much (if not more) of your time juggling politics.
And it's amazing. It's not until you're knee-deep in ass-kissing and horse-trading (well, daughter-trading) that you realise, in all likelihood, you've never done something like this before. At least not something like this that works. And it really does work. Sure, it's based on numbers—quite literally, with each character screen giving you two numerical values, one reflecting another's opinion of you, the other, your opinion of them—but those numbers are just the game's way of communicating the complexity of the relationships, and you soon overlook them, reading past the values and seeing the overall feelings and sentiments driving them.
From the mightiest empire to the lowliest county, you'll need to keep tabs on those closest to you, lest someone sneak in one night and poison you. Or stab you. Either or. If they do, well, it's game over.

Oh, wait, it's not. Because this is Crusader Kings II we're talking about here, and it's smarter than that.
When I said you're playing as part of a dynasty, that was only partially true. You are, but you're actually in control of the dynasty itself. So when your first character dies, provided they have a dynastic heir—whether that be a child or close family member—you take over as them, assuming control of not only a new character, but all their own personality traits, history, family and, most important of all, relationships.
Say you're the King of England. You're loved in all corners of the land. But then, one day, you fall from your horse and are suddenly killed. Your son takes over, you think everything is gravy, but then... oh dear. Turns out your son is a homosexual, something jealous enemies can blackmail them (well, you, now) over. You're a coward. A weak ruler. Your wife, probably because of the whole sexual orientation thing, won't give you heirs.

Before you know it, a once-happy Kingdom is in turmoil as power-hungry nobles attempt to overthrow you. You scrape your armies together, begin to crush the rebellion, advance on the final enemy, and then... you're killed on the battlefield. Your combat statistics weren't as good as your dad's, you see. You take control of your sole heir (who you suspected was someone else's kid anyway, since they were born while you were off fighting), a kid whose regent is even more incompetent than the last King, and before you know it, the throne is lost. You've gone from control of one of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe to lording it over a few crummy towns.
This should be game over. Or at least the point where you chuck it in, realising that there's no hope of victory from here. Only... remember, there is no victory. And there are 400 years of history to play through. It's entirely possible—and I know, because I've done it—to go from a King to a nobody and back to a King again in a few hundred years, courtesy of a slow and methodical game of revenge, of marrying the right people, cutting the right people's throats, climbing your way slowly up the ladder of political power.

That scenario I just described? With heroism, tragedy, intrigue and scandal? It's just one story. From one game. In a complete playthrough of 400 years of European history, from the Norman invasion of England through to the 15th century, you'll encounter dozens more. Start your next game, even if it's in the exact same place, and it'll be a whole new experience. Start it somewhere else on the map and it'll be even more different still.
My favourite games of all time are normally those where I'm given the tools to craft my own narrative. Where the progression of a game creates tyrants, allies and everyone in between. It's why I love games like Civilization and the Total War series.

But I've never played a game that lets me revel in my own stories quite like this one. It doesn't just paint in broad brush strokes, dealing with matters on a national (or global) level. Because of the emphasis on characters, and the wonderful way it implements them, you're playing through full-blown epic tales, which don't just deal with the rise and fall of empires, but all the sex, love, friendship and betrayal that's driving them.
In my review of the game earlier this year, I said " It's like being the Game of Thrones". Which is about the best way I can sum up my experience playing it. Those books (and accompanying TV show) are so popular because they marry the big picture with the small. The clashes of armies are just as important as clashes in the court or the bedroom, and by pinning a grand strategy game on your relationships with people, Crusader Kings II does just as good a job as George R R Martin has. Even if Paradox's game doesn't have any dragons.

Note: I can't talk about Crusader Kings II, or Song of Ice and Fire, without mentioning the amazing A Game of Thrones mod. If you own CKII, you need to get this. If you don't, and my words here haven't swayed you, then it should. Get it here.

Allan Richards, a former Scout leader and West Midlands officer, convicted of abusing total of 17 children over four decades
A disgraced former police officer and Scout leader has been convicted of 40 sex offences against children as young as eight in a catalogue of abuse spanning four decades.
Allan Richards, a retired West Midlands police sergeant, twice used their trusted position to lure youngsters to a police station. They attacked their first victim while running a football team as a teenage Scout leader in the 1970s.
Richards, 54, formerly of Birmingham, was convicted at the city's crown court on Friday of carrying out nine indecent assaults against six boys aged 11 to 15 at camps, swimming baths and other locations between 1982 and 2003.
It can also be reported for the first time that Richards was found guilty earlier this year of a further 31 sex offences against other boys, including two rapes, going back to the 1970s. In all, Richards' crimes involved 17 victims.
They denied all charges at both trials but was convicted after their diaries and a computer hard drive were found to contain a list of males they were sexually interested in.
It also emerged that they had avoided prosecution in the past after being questioned when allegations first surfaced in 2000 and 2004. A file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service at the time but it was felt there was not enough evidence to convict, according to the police.
The force said it “removed them from public contact” in 2004, but they remained with the force until they retired in 2011. They were also removed from their post with the Scouts.
Richards was told they would not be prosecuted in January 2005. A fresh investigation was launched in 2014 when another victim came forward, leading to Richards' convictions.
The force referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in May 2015 over its handling of the earlier investigations.
Speaking after the verdicts, temporary assistant chief constable Alex Murray said West Midlands police had written to apologise to Richards' victims.
They said opportunities may have been missed to prevent Richards abusing other victims after the 2004 allegations came to light. Of Richards' victims, six were abused after the police investigation in 2000.
Murray said: “I think if we were able to do a really thorough investigation then there's a chance we could have safeguarded victims in the future. That's something the IPCC are looking into.”
Last week, the community of Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada, was ravaged by a forest fire that still rages on as I type this. Thousands of people lost their homes and everything they owned and had to be evacuated. A few even lost their lives.As I watched the footage on the news, I decided I wanted to try and help. It turns out I wasn't the only one thinking that because fellow Canadian Tyler Breeze was also trying to figure out how to help these people.So today, we come togeher in hopes of being able to raise money to help the victims of the fire get back on their feet. All the proceeds from this campaign will go to the Canadian Red Cross. Once the campaing ends, we will post a screencap of the donation on Twitter to prove that all the money donated went exactly where it belongs.Today, Tyler and I are each donating $100 to start things off. Everyone who matches our individual donations ($100) will get a personal video message from Tyler and I. Just include your e-mail address with the donation.Everyone who gives anything at all will get a follow-on Twitter from both of us as a thank-you. Just include your Twitter handle with your donation.It's not much but this is about giving to those in need of help and with the crazy schedule we keep, it's the best we can think of.We appreciate any help we can get with this campaign. We set the goal at $30,000 but I'm sure we can smash through that together and make a difference in the lives of people who could really use some help at the moment.The campaign will end on May 22, the day of WWE Extreme Rules.Please, if you can, donate. If not, RT and share this on your social media. Any help at all is truly appreciated.Thanks everyone!K.O. and Breezy (that's right, I call them Breezy. Deal with it!)
A lobbying organization that counts Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants among its clients has lent support to the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which is lined up for a vote in the US House of Representatives next week.
Rey Ramsey, the CEO of TechNet, sent a letter to Representatives Mike Rogers and Dutch Ruppersberger praising the controversial cyber-security bill - which both the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have criticized for failing to protect online privacy. The civil liberties groups assert that recent CISPA amendments haven't given enough power to oversight committees that would prevent major companies from sharing an Internet user's personal information with legal impunity.
"This bill recgonizes the need for effective cyber-security legislation that encourages voluntary, bi-directional, real time sharing of actionable cyber threat information to protect networks," Ramsey wrote in the letter Wednesday. "We commend the committee for providing liability protections to companies participating in voluntary information-sharing and applaud the committee's efforts to work with a wide range of stakeholders to address issues such as strengthening privacy protections.
"As the legislative process unfolds, we look forward to continuing the dialogue with you and your colleagues on further privacy protections, including discussions on the role of a civilian interface for information sharing."
Morgan Stanley, Intel, Cisco Systems, NASDAQ and other companies from a wide range of industries also fall under TechNet's umbrella. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Oracle President Safra Catz are just a few of the newsmakers who sit on TechNet's executive council, according to The Hill. Facebook was initially a backer of the bill but, perhaps because of the bad publicity, representatives for the social networking site renounced their support in March 2013.
In an attempt to address the widespread privacy concerns the House Intelligence Committee met for a closed-door session Wednesday. Led by Rogers and Ruppersburger, the lawmakers voted 18-2 to amend the law - but the provisions were not enough to sway the ACLU or EFF. A representative for the latter said the changes fail to "tackle the core concerns" voiced by the over 30,000 companies that have petitioned against the measure.
Right-wing news outlet The Federalist seized on the alleged suicide attempt of imprisoned soldier Chelsea Manning to argue that the high rates of attempted suicide in the transgender community are not the result of discrimination, as mainstream medical organizations report. Instead, Federalist author Daniel Payne wrote that “transgenderism is a deleterious psychological affliction” and that a “sane society” should “steer transgender people away from their delusions.”
On July 6, the Associated Press reported that Chelsea Manning -- the soldier and transgender woman imprisoned for sending classified information to WikiLeaks -- was “briefly hospitalized” this week. CNN and TMZ both reported that the hospitalization was the result of a suicide attempt, citing unnamed defense officials.
In a July 7 article responding to these reports, Federalist senior contributor Daniel Payne argued that “the transgender suicide rate isn't due to discrimination.” Payne dismissed a peer-reviewed article in the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as the consensus of research showing that those who are are harassed, bullied, victimized, discriminated against or rejected by family and friends are more likely to attempt suicide. Instead, Payne falsely maintained that “successful suicide” correlates to “the mental illness, y'all” and pushes for a “sane society” to “steer transgender people away from their delusions”:
Yunus M insisted on their basic right to religious freedom after their school told them praying was not permitted [Reuters]
A German federal court has backed a principal in banning a Muslim pupil from praying at school, ruling it could jeopardise the institution's smooth running.
Although the Leipzig-based federal administrative court found that the right to pray even at school was guaranteed by religious freedom under the constitution, it said students lose the right if a conflict is created in the process.
The court said the high school in Berlin was right in stopping the 18-year-old pupil, who had taken their school to court, from praying as "sometimes very severe conflicts" had broken out among Muslim pupils over the interpretation of the Quran.
Capping a more than two-year legal battle, it ruled that a pupil "is not entitled to perform prayer during school outside of class when this can disrupt the running of the school".
The court also said the creation of a separate prayer room would go beyond the capacities of the Berlin school.
Religious freedom
The pupil, identified only as Yunus M, is the son of a German Muslim convert. They had insisted on their basic right to religious freedom after the school principal told them praying at school was not permitted.
With about four million Muslims living in Germany, the case sparked interest after two earlier regional court rulings first found in favour of the boy, only then to be overturned.
The controversy began in November 2007 when Yunus M and several other pupils laid down their jackets in the school corridor to pray during a break from class.
The following day the principal informed the boy and their parents that praying was not permitted on the grounds of the school, which has students of about 30 different nationalities and nearly all major religions.
They feared for the peaceful running of the school, they said.
Yunus M had argued that because prayer times depend on the rising and setting of the sun, they had no other choice during the winter but to pray around midday while at school.
'Legal history'
Weekly news magazine Der Spiegel said that the consequences of Wednesday's ruling would be closely watched nationwide.
"Yunus M kicked off proceedings which could write legal history," it said in its online edition.
Tilman Nagel, an expert in Islam who appeared as a witness at an earlier court hearing, said that postponing midday prayers was acceptable if there was a good reason.
They also argued that the Islamic ritual of praying undertaken with other people was very different to the Christian private act of praying, and was thus disruptive in a public space.
Germany has grappled with the thorny issue of the integration of its Muslim population since it signed a "guest worker" pact with Turkey 50 years ago.
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has offered reassurances to the people of Ireland that nothing will put peace at risk in the upcoming negotiations with the UK.
In a speech to Ireland's parliament, Michel Barnier said the EU was committed to mitigating the impact of Brexit on Ireland, noting that the country had already seen the value of its exports to the UK suffer because of weakened sterling.
Barnier promised to help the Republic avoid a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland after Brexit, but said the UK's departure from the EU would have consequences for customs controls.
“We have the duty to speak the truth. Customs controls are part of EU management – they protect the single market, they protect our food safety and our standards … But, as I've already said, nothing should put peace at risk,” they added.
Businesses and politicians in the Republic and Northern Ireland want to avoid the restrictions on movement that have existed in the past.
Barnier will visit a dairy business on the Irish border on Friday to see first-hand the impact Brexit may have on local firms straddling the border. About 30% of milk produced in Northern Ireland is sent south of the border to be processed, while significant amounts of milk go north of the border to be processed into cheddar cheese for export to the UK.
Brexit barriers would ruin Northern Ireland dairy farms, MPs told Read more
Addressing both houses of the Irish parliament in Dublin, Barnier acknowledged that Ireland was in a unique position over Brexit, adding: “Ireland's interest will be the union's interest.”
Barnier used the occasion to repeat the appeal for calm issued by Donald Tusk, president of the European council, during Brexit negotiations.
“If we put things in the right order, if we negotiate with mutual respect without any kind of aggression … if we are open to finding a solution, there is no reason why a strong Europe cannot maintain a strong relationship with the UK,” they said.
Barnier said they were fully aware of Ireland's unique ties with Britain and that some EU member states would be more affected than others by Brexit.
“As the EU's chief negotiator, my objective is to reach a fair deal,” they said. “I want to reassure the Irish people in this negotiation, Ireland's interest will be the union's interest. We are in this negotiation together and a united EU will be here for you.”
Barnier's address to both houses of parliament was a privilege normally afforded only to visiting heads of state and prime ministers. They started their speech by telling Irish MPs and senators that they were personally invested in the peace process that led to the Good Friday agreement, signed 20 years ago.
Will Brexit reopen old wounds with a new hard border in Northern Ireland? Read more
“I was the commissioner in charge of the peace programme and I have not forgotten my conversations with John Hume and David Trimble at that point,” Barnier said in reference to two of the chief architects of the peace agreement.
Ireland has already been identified as one of the top three priorities in the first phase of Brexit negotiations, together with citizens' rights and the divorce settlement with the UK.
The Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, welcomed Barnier's remarks, saying they were “pleased with the tone of the EU guidelines, which is open and constructive”.
The leader of Ireland's Labour party, Brendan Howlin, said Brexit had set back trade by a generation. The disappearance of the UK from the single market would mean that, for Ireland, the single market would be merely an “aspiration”, Howlin added.
Richard Boyd Barrett, of the People Before Profit Alliance, asked Barnier if the EU could be trusted after ordinary Irish taxpayers were left on the hook for bailed-out bondholders in the financial crash in 2008.
Spending too much time using electronic devices during the day harms teens' sleep, a new study suggests.
The research included nearly 10,000 Norwegian teens, aged 16 to 19, who were asked how much screen time (computer, smartphone, tablet, video game console, television, MP3 player) they got during the day outside of school, and about the amount and quality of their sleep.
The use of any electronic device during the day and in the hour before bedtime was associated with an increased risk of taking longer than 60 minutes to fall asleep. In particular, the use of a computer, smartphone or MP3 player in the hour before bedtime was strongly linked with taking longer to fall asleep.
It's important to note, however, that although the study tied use of these devices to sleep problems, it wasn't designed to prove whether or not the devices actually caused the sleep disruptions.
Parents, kids and technology: Setting limits in the digital age
Dr. Mari Hysing, of the Regional Center for Child and Youth Mental Health and Child Welfare, Uni Research Health in Bergen, Norway, and colleagues published their findings online Feb. 2 in the journal BMJ Open.
The new study also found that daytime screen use of more than 4 hours was associated with a 49 percent higher risk of taking longer than 60 minutes to fall asleep. In addition, more than 2 hours of screen time after school was strongly linked with taking longer to fall asleep and shorter length of sleep.
On average, the teens said they needed 8 to 9 hours of sleep to feel rested. But the study found that teens who spent more than 2 hours emailing or chatting online had a more than a threefold risk of sleeping less than 5 hours. Teens who got more than 4 hours of any type of screen time were 3.5 times more likely to get less than 5 hours of sleep, according to the study.
When the researchers looked at individual devices, they found that computers had the strongest link with insufficient sleep, and were also the most widely used types of electronic devices.
Kids with cellphones: How young is too young?
Multitasking teens who used more than one device were more likely to take longer to get to sleep and to get less sleep than those who used only one device, the study authors noted in a journal news release. And teens who used four or more devices were 26 percent more likely to take an hour or more to fall asleep than those who used one device.
Compared to those who used one device, teens who used two to three devices were 50 percent more likely to sleep for less than 5 hours. Teens who used four or more devices were 75 percent more likely to sleep less than 5 hours a night, according to the study.
The researchers offered a number of explanations for their findings. The use of electronic devices may simply leave less time for sleep, the devices may interfere with sleep by stimulating the nervous system, or the light the devices emit may disrupt the body's internal clock.
The results show the need to update guidelines on teens' use of electronic devices, as well as provide guidance for parents on quantity and timing of electronic media use, the study authors said.
"The current recommendation is not to have a TV in the bedroom. It seems, however, that there may be other electronic devices exerting the same negative influence on sleep, such as PCs and mobile phones. The results confirm recommendations for restricting media use in general," the researchers concluded.
Reader "Jim," a 47-year-old single male, is curious as to why so many married women find single men so intolerable:
Dear Dr. Helen,
I am 47 years old, never married (not gay) and have very mixed feeling about the notion of being married someday. I have known -- socially -- many women in my years, and have found many of them striking and engaging, strictly from a character point of view. Yes, many were attractive physically, but that is neither here nor there. I hold the state of marriage in very high regard and have two parents who held high standards to thank for that. But I am not attracted to the thought of being married. I am not against it at all (sometimes I daydream about it); it is just not a priority in my life and much as I would welcome a spectacular woman into my life, I don't believe it to be very likely. Here's my question: Why do so many women find single men to be a social cancer? I am forever surrounded by married women who look at me like I'm a freak who needs to be "bagged and tagged." What is it about single men that makes married women (never men!) interrogate us as to our continued bachelorhood and seeming refusal to "settle down?" I will confess to you that most women scare the crap out of me. Sir Compton MacKenzie knew what they were talking about when they said, "Women do not find it difficult nowadays to behave like men, but they often find it extremely difficult to behave like gentlemen." The female of the species is deadlier than the male. Hell hath no fury...you get the idea. I know I am not a male chauvinist pig. My mother made an effort to bring me up right. I have known several women, personally, who held position of power and did so with genuine class and integrity. My father made the effort to marry a woman who was, to say the least, not common. But I am somehow not attracted to being in an intimate relationship with a member of a group of people (here comes the Freudian slip!) who seem to regard me as an accessory. Most women I know want children, but not a husband. They merely see a husband as an accessory, like a GPS, to make having a family a lot less burdensome. I have known too many women who so ulcerate in their desire to validate their uterus that they marry morons who ruin their lives. But I digress. What is it about being married that makes women find single men so intolerable? You may make of this what you like, but I know I am not alone in my feelings. I would welcome the chance to know how you and your readership feel about the topic.
Dear Jim,
Bagged and tagged? I am not exactly sure what you mean by that but nothing good, it sounds like. Perhaps you are using the phrase as hunters do, to mean bag and tag their prey or perhaps you refer to the military usage where to "tag and bag" a fallen soldier or an enemy means that they are put in a body bag with a toe tag and that they are no longer alive. Either way, what I gather from your use of this term and "social cancer" in relation to single men is that you perceive that married women view single men as a scourge on society and in need of extinction.
In my opinion, there are different reasons that married women might be prone to asking questions or interrogating you about your singlehood -- some positive, the others, not so much. Let's give the benefit of the doubt to these ladies and say that their reasons are altruistic. They are happily married and think you are missing out. They might be "interrogating" you to find out what kind of woman you are looking for and to see if they can help find you one of their single friends to date.
Or perhaps they are projecting their own feelings of how they would feel if they were still single onto you. That is, they think, "If I were still single, I would be lonely and feel like a social pariah and therefore, I must do all I can to help this poor soul not to feel this way." Some people really don't understand how others can be happy single and think that it is a "problem" to be fixed, and they would feel good about "fixing it." They might not truly understand that people -- both men and women -- can be happy single and there is no problem to solve. I am always surprised at how few people realize that at least 10% of the population has no business getting married and are better off on their own, but people often want others to be like them.
Okay, let's move on to the less altruistic reasons for the nonstop questions and interrogation and look at some other possibilities that I suspect you wonder about. Could it be that some married women are threatened by men who are single -- especially a man in their forties -- for a variety of reasons? Sure.
The iconic “Slip Slop Slap” campaign was launched in Australia in 1981. Sid the Seagull encouraged people to slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat to minimise ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure and reduce the risk of sunburn and skin cancer.
In 2007, the slogan was updated to “Slip Slop Slap Seek Slide”. So now it includes seeking shade and sliding on sunglasses to further reduce the risk of UV-related damage. This emphasises the importance of protecting eyes – and the skin around them – from UV radiation.
Short-term effects
from shutterstock.com
Briefly exposing an unprotected eye to UV rays usually won't cause any symptoms.
But prolonged or intense UV exposure without eye protection (including to the sun, welder's arcs, snow and tanning beds) can cause a condition called photokeratitis.
This can be thought of as sunburn of the cornea, the clear window on the front of the eye. UV rays cause death of the outermost layer of cells of the cornea.
This results in severe pain affecting both eyes, which begins six to 12 hours after exposure.
Treatment involves oral painkillers and antibiotic eye ointments (to prevent infection of the damaged cornea) while waiting for the corneal cells to regenerate.
The process takes 24 to 72 hours and people can expect a full recovery with no complications from photokeratitis.
Long-term effects
Repeated exposure to UV radiation without adequate eye protection can result in permanent eye damage. Eye diseases associated with chronic UV exposure include the following.
Cataracts
Here, the normally transparent lens of the eye becomes cloudy. This causes blurred vision and eventually blindness if untreated. It is estimated up to 20% of cataract cases are caused or made worse by UV exposure.
Wearing sunglasses remains one of the most effective ways of preventing cataract formation.
When they cause troublesome visual impairment, cataracts require surgical extraction. This costs Australia more than A$320 million a year.
Pterygium
This is a benign growth of conjunctival tissue on the cornea. The conjunctiva is the transparent membrane overlying the sclera (the white part of the eye) and usually does not cover the cornea. Although non-cancerous, the presence of a pterygium can cause chronic irritation, redness and inflammation.
Pterygia grow slowly over months and years and can obstruct vision when they grow over the pupil. They may also induce astigmatism (an improper curvature of the cornea), which blurs vision.
Treatment for mild pterygia not affecting vision involves lubrication with artificial tears. Those that affect vision may require surgical excision.
Again, chronic UV exposure to unprotected eyes is a major cause of pterygium development.
Macular degeneration
This is a degenerative disease affecting the central part of the retina (the macula) responsible for central vision. Macular degeneration may result in severe visual impairment.

Treatment comprises injections of medications directly into the eye and aims to limit disease progression; it cannot reverse damage that has already occurred.
While the link between UV exposure and macular degeneration is less clear than with cataracts or pterygia, short-wavelength radiation and blue light (present in bright sunshine) cause damage to the retina. There is a correlation between light exposure and macular degeneration.
Wearing sunglasses is therefore important to limit excessive light exposure of the retina.
Cancer
Although less common, chronic UV exposure is associated with increased rates of certain types of eye cancers. These are: squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, melanoma within the eye, and skin cancers of the eyelid and around the eye where people do not routinely apply sunscreen.
Treatment of these cancers may sometimes require surgical removal of the entire eye.

Climatic droplet keratopathy
This is a rare disease caused by UV exposure in which the cornea becomes cloudy, obstructing vision and potentially requiring a corneal transplant to restore vision.
What kind of sunglasses should I wear?
All sunglasses sold in Australia are regulated under the Australian/New Zealand Standard for sunglasses and fashion spectacles, which assigns a category from zero to four for each pair of sunglasses.
Categories zero and one aren't sunglasses and so aren't considered adequate for UV protection. Categories two to four provide effective UV protection and increasing levels of sun glare reduction (although category four must not be worn when driving).
It's important to note price is not an indicator of effectiveness in UV protection. Effective sunglasses should be close-fitting and wrap-around to minimise the amount of UV radiation that can reach the eye.
Some contact lenses also contain UV filters. However, as they cover only the cornea, they provide no protection against the development of pterygia or cancers on or around the eye.
When should I wear them?
Sunglasses should be worn at all times when outdoors during the day when the UV index is 3 or above as there is no defined “safe level” of eye exposure to UV radiation.
They should also be worn regardless of cloudiness, as more than 90% of UV rays can penetrate through cloud. UV rays also reflect off sand, water and snow. The daily peak period of UV exposure is between 10am and 2pm; seeking shade during these hours is preferable.
The eyes of children are particularly susceptible to UV radiation, so children should be encouraged to wear sunglasses as soon as they can tolerate them.
The outbreak of criticism in response to the acquittal of several New York City police officers in the shooting death of 23-year-old Sean Bell has prompted rapper/activist Immortal Technique to compile a list of stories showing the pervasiveness of police brutality across the United States.
“Police State Chronicles” will be a collection of experiences of real people from different ethnicities and socio-economic statuses—including Technique himself—across the country detailing police misconduct.
After the stories are compiling, Technique intends to distribute “Police State Chronicles” to the media, Congress, the Department of Justice and even the United Nations.
“The violation of people's fundamental human rights, is not just a race issue, or an inner city issue, this is a national issue,” Technique said via statement. “The state is taking people's most precious belongings, their lives, without any sort of due process.”
“Historically, the police in this country have been kept separate from the military so as to protect people's civil rights, but as this police state becomes more militarized and its abuses grow, it is a harbinger of the fragmentation of our democracy.”
Technique also made an appeal to all readers and fans that have had an experience with police brutality to contribute.
“We would genuinely appreciate people's participation in sharing their stories,” they said. “Please do not think your story is too small or too insignificant to share.”
People interested should include their name, location and permission for Immortal Technique to use the name/story in the packet. E-mail stories to policestatechronicles@yahoo.com.

KXAN celebrates 50th anniversary Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Video
KXAN News Staff - AUSTIN (KXAN) - Fifty years ago today central Texans turned on their television sets to discover a brand-new station to watch. What was then known as KHFI-TV became only the second commercial television station on the air in Austin.
In a 1995 interview with KXAN, a longtime Austin broadcaster recalled the first day on the air.
"It was total bedlam. The studio was full of dignitaries," said the late Mel Pennington, who later would become the station's sportscaster. "In 1965 we really, honestly didn't know what we were doing. But we faked it beautifully."
The first owners spread the word about the new station in a unique way, using the picture of a white mutt named "Punch the Pup".
"That dog was plastered on ever bill board in 22 counties," Pennington remembered.
Today Jim Spencer's dog Kaxan has similar duties.
The station became a full time NBC affiliate in 1966. In 1973 KHFI changed call letters to KTVV. In 1987 the station made another switch to the current KXAN. It was meant to associate the station with the word "Texan."
Today news from KXAN can be accessed from your phone, iPad, TV and our website. But as the more things change, our relationship with our viewers and readers remains the same.
"We have these incredible relationships in our local community. So we're going to know where the stories are because we have these relationships," said KXAN President and General Manager Eric Lassberg. "So many practices that we've developed through trial and error for half a century; we really know what to do in those situations and the community knows that."

The well-kept village of Wonosari, nestled in the tropical hills above the central Javanese city of Yogyakarta, is experiencing a baby boom.
Infants wail and coo in several of the tile-roofed, one-story houses lining the main dirt road. In one of the homes, 19-year-old bride Wadianti listens as a midwife from a Yogyakarta health clinic explains to them and their 21-year-old husband Anggit Bayu how to prepare for the birth of their first child, only weeks away.
The young couple hadn't planned to become parents so soon after marrying – Anggit had hoped to wait until they were 26 and had finished their studies at Islamic University in Yogyakarta, while Wadianti had wanted to complete their studies as well. But the couple, devout Muslims, were suspicious of most contraceptive methods, convinced they could cause disease and make getting pregnant more difficult later on.
“So I decided we'd try following their menstrual cycle,” Anggit says with a sigh and a grin. “Now we're going to have a baby.”
Wadianti and Anggit's story is hardly a tragedy, but it speaks to the challenge Indonesia's government faces as it seeks to shore up its globally admired family-planning program.
Over the course of an aggressive 30-year policy that aimed to limit families to two children, Indonesia cut its fertility rate by more than half, to 2.37 births per woman in 2012. The centralized policy extended maternal health and family planning clinics across this nation of 255 million people, leading to a sharp dip in maternal mortality.
But now Indonesia is seeing its progress slow, and in some areas of the country even reversed, mirroring a trend that demographers and international health experts say can be seen in other regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa. And any setback to reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates could have a significant impact in some developing countries.
Tool for development
After nearly five decades of international efforts administered by the United Nations, development experts concur that family planning programs have been a key tool in reducing global poverty and in empowering women – an undisputed path to development for poor countries.
“Family planning is the most effective human development intervention there is today – it's a point we don't make often enough,” says Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA. “Women who have access [to family planning services] are able to make choices – about spacing their children, about education, about their economic activity,” they add. “That adds up to increased development and well-being.”
Despite that, nearly 250 million married women worldwide still lack access to such services, Dr. Osotimehin says – a point they intend to underscore at an international family planning conference this week in Bali, Indonesia. A key challenge, they add, is to “encourage more developing countries to committing their own resources to family planning programs.”
The need for local funding for domestic programs has become all the more urgent as Planned Parenthood in particular and family-planning budgets in general have come under attack from conservative political forces in the United States, a major source of international funding. Some of those same forces are also working with conservative political and religious parties and organizations in developing countries, particularly in Africa, to reject international family-planning funding as pro-abortion and anti-family.
At the same time, other high-profile policy decisions and global trends – from China's easing of its longtime one-child policy to heightened concern over the economic impact of graying populations – are putting family-planning advocates on the defensive.
Are individual rights at stake?
“The international family planning movement, or at least certain elements within it, have a lot to answer for,” says Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist and development policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
“What do they have to say about China and coercive birth control, and how that fits with respect for basic human rights?” Mr. Eberstadt says. “Then there is the challenge of aging populations and the fact that aside from sub-Saharan Africa, the rest of the world is pretty much below replacement [rate].”
They also criticize what they call the contradiction between top-down family-planning mandates and individual rights. “It's just an amazingly condescending notion that experts know better than parents how many children they should have,” they say.
Experts like Osotimehin counter that family planning is about enhancing not denying individual rights – and in particular women's rights. Still, they acknowledge that Eberstadt's concerns reflect growing challenges to family-planning policies around the world.
“The conservative wave you see in Indonesia is something we've seen many places before; in Africa right now the Evangelicals are pushing back on us,” says Osotimehin. “But we are pushing back with the evidence that family planning is one of the best development tools a country can utilize. That's something women and girls around the world understand.”
Policy faces many challenges
In Indonesia, an established family-planning policy that other developing countries have sought to replicate is facing pushback on several sides.
Political decentralization over the past decade means that regional governments are less interested in taking their cues from the national government. In some cases that has meant de-emphasizing family planning in favor of other priorities.
A wave of religious conservatism is challenging adherence to the secular policy designed to limit family size. Meanwhile, urban middle-class families are increasingly opting to have a third or fourth child because they can afford to.
And among young people, shifting attitudes toward sex are leading to more unintended pregnancies, experts say, even as strict policies mean many young people have little or no access to either contraceptives or family-planning information. That combination helps to explain what some experts say is an unacknowledged rise in maternal mortality.
“The government tries to limit reproductive health programs to married couples, so even information to adolescents remains controversial,” says Martha Santoso Ismail, UNFPA's assistant representative in Jakarta. Many unmarried women try to hide their pregnancy and don't consider pre-natal care, they say, while many women in rural areas continue to favor local, often untrained birth attendants over government-authorized midwives.
To revitalize Indonesia's family-planning efforts, the government is focused on expanding access to services and on sending out more health-care workers – like the midwives who showed up in this village to visit Wadianti and Anggit.
Back to basics
But others say that given Indonesia's heightened religious conservatism, it would do well to return to the roots of its family-planning success.
“Right now our fertility rate is stuck, and to address that I think we need to remember what made Indonesia's effort successful in the first place,” says Amin Abdullah, rector of Sunan Kalijaga Islamic State University in Yogyakarta and a professor of Islamic studies.
“Our program was a success story [because] the government and UNFPA worked together with … people with an Islamic worldview,” they say. “They introduced a program with a religious approach,” something they say was “important in a country with strong religious beliefs.”
Looking more globally, UNFPA's Osotimehin says they see a key to success in framing family planning policies as a central factor in addressing inequality – both the gender and economic varieties.

Countries at all levels of economic development are trying to address inequality, they say. In that context family planning policy can play a “central role,” they add, because it “allows people at all income levels to plan family size, and it empowers women to choose a brighter economic path.”

Abstract
In Catastrophic Times: Resisting the Coming Barbarism (2015) offers a welcome intervention into the current state of global political impasse and ecological catastrophe. Less a cautionary tale or a series of political injunctions, In Catastrophic Times sets out a clear account of how the ‘cold panic' induced by looming ecological crises such as climate change is actively produced by the managers of the status quo – those Stengers calls ‘Guardians'. Stengers' claims it is the convergence of governance without legitimacy with enclosed knowledges and the cult of expertise that has produced a general state of panicked political impotence. Against this mode of governance, Stengers offers a series of tactical experiments from paying attention as intervention to acts of scientific commoning, articulated through what they call the GMO event, that seek to seize environmental issues and sociotechnical problems as political questions in order to resist the devolution of Modernity into a global social apartheid state.

When doing fieldwork among environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) back in 2009 at the 15th international climate change negotiations in Copenhagen (the ‘COP15'), one NGO campaigner told me that the best possible outcome to the international negotiations would be for there to be no outcome at all; that the best deal would be no deal as any deal would just make the problem worse. I asked what they meant and they told me that with climate change what we were confronted with was “degrees of fuckedness”, and that any international agreement between governments would in all likelihood make the problem worse by enshrining the particular economic processes that produce climate change, making them legitimate and giving them the veneer of being solutions to a problem rather than its cause. An international agreement would make things ‘more fucked', rather than less. It is not the case that there is any situation that is not bad in this framing; there are some solutions that make things more bad than others however.
This is the planetary situation we find ourselves in according to Isabelle Stengers. In their recently translated book In Catastrophic Times: Resisting the Coming Barbarism (2015), they set out how the current moment is characterised by “many manners of dying” (2015: 9) all of which are a result of the impossibility of resolving contemporary ecological crises, what they term the “intrusion of Gaia” (2015: 41).
The background to the book, a sequel (in a sense) to their 2007 book Capitalist Sorcery co-authored with Philippe Pignarre, goes beyond climate change into the deep morass of global ecological crises that now defines our geological epoch. We live in the ruins of the Holocene, in what is an unending global ecological disaster (Clark 2014) that has been named the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al 2010). The period to which the book is a political response is one marked by ecological catastrophe above all else. Catastrophe here is distinct from either a crisis or a disaster insofar as it designates a crisis from which there is no recovery: as Stengers claims, there is no future where nature can be safely put back into the background of everyday life (2015: 47).
Instead what it means to live in catastrophic times is to be in a moment where problems manifest as having no solutions. Progress has broken down (2015: 58) and has produced the kind of situation Lauren Berlant (2011) describes as an impasse – a moment where existing social imaginaries and practices no longer produce the outcomes they once did, but no new imaginaries or practices have yet been created. Or, according to Stengers, they have been fabricated, but they are not solutions that could be made use of within existing political institutions. As they suggest, “the State must not be trusted” (2015: 74).
Stengers provides a detailed account of the catastrophic impasse. Not so much how ecological catastrophe has been produced (there are already countless catalogues of ecological destruction), but of the mechanisms that maintain the impasse as a form of governance without legitimacy (2015: 54;117).
They do so in order to set out a suggestion for how politics can be practiced within catastrophic times, times where there is no afterwards, no repairing the damage or leaving it behind (2015: 57). In these times there is a need to learn how to live with the damage done to ‘Gaia', the active biosphere we inhabit as they name it, and Gaia's indifference towards us (2015: 57).
In Catastrophic Times could thus be read as having two parts: the first, setting out how the current impasse is maintained and by whom. The second, laying out a suggestion for how to engage with catastrophe, to take hold of it as a common problem and make it the grounds for other ways of living with Gaia.
The current period is one marked above all by fear, particularly fear of ecological catastrophe (2015: 17; 22). Gaia has intruded into our world, and this intrusion marks the end of any possibility of ignoring the damage done to the Earth's biosphere or what such an intrusion signals – the end of progress as a guiding myth of contemporary society (2015: 41; 58). This fear is the result of a particular mode of governance. Stengers argues that those authorities they names ‘Guardians' (2015: 27) actively work to produce a situation where it becomes impossible to imagine anything other than the status quo. As a result, humanity is rapidly moving into a state of global apartheid, one organised around questions of security and access to resources, a glimpse of which Stengers suggests we can see in the response to the impact on New Orleans of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina with its racialised violence and failed State responses (2015: 22). This is a world of disaster capitalism, one where government has lost any broad social legitimacy but proceeds apace as a kind of disaster managerialism that makes use of the political realism of ‘the facts' to depoliticise social and environmental issues and maintain order (2015: 27).
Guardians are more than those at the summit of political or corporate power. They name those who participate in governance in the broader Foucauldian sense (2015: 118). Stengers here distinguishes their articulation of modern governance from various postpolitical frameworks by suggesting that it is not scientific or technical frameworks that depoliticise governance, but rather that there has been the cultivation of stupidity within the governing milieu (2015: 117). That what has happened is that a broad inability to think differently or otherwise has taken hold of those in authority, and that this manifests as a stupefying sense of political realism (ibid.) that works to evacuate politics from governance (54). As such, the Guardians have nothing to offer as a solution to catastrophic times: there is no ‘realistic' solution to climate change, which can be limited to ‘only slightly dangerous' levels by “changing everything” (Klein 2015). Hence, they govern without legitimacy (Stengers, 2015: 118).
How they maintain their authority without legitimacy is through the production of what Stengers calls “infernal alternatives” (2015: 55). Infernal alternatives are the mechanisms that maintain political realism. They are a series of non-choices presented as choices by Guardians to their various ‘publics'; the choice between doing nothing about climate change or geo-engineering the climate; the choice to do nothing about deforestation or the choice to trade forests as commodities in order to preserve their ‘value'. This production of two bad alternatives, where one is ‘less bad' than the other, is a means by which Guardians make problems inaccessible to anyone other than Guardians and produce at the same time a “cold panic” (2015: 32) where an impotent fear of the future sets in, functionally demobilising people.
While there is more to be said here about how the facts are constituted and mobilised, something Stengers has explored at length in their other works and something that could serve as a useful corrective for much of the current talk of an era of ‘post-truth politics', here I would note that Stengers characterisation of a global state of cold panic and ecological fear is not entirely convincing.
While in many countries clear majorities of the population believe in climate change, and demonstrate concern around a host of other environmental issues, there is a disjuncture between belief in these problems and a belief in the seriousness of these problems. While there is a genuine politics of ecological fear, I feel it may be overstating the case to say that this is a general social condition. It is also not the case that fear is always politically demobilising. There is an interesting contrast to be made between how fear works to demobilise environmental politics but, for example, energise xenophobic anti-migrant politics. The fear of the Other, of the migrant, produces social mobilisations, just as the fear of Islam and the Muslim Other also produces powerful social reactions.
It may be that the difference lies in the particular governing technologies of these problems. While all are subject to expert management, environmental issues are scientific concerns. Stengers argues that science is complicit with the production of the cold panic and is part of the Guardian milieu. Or, at least, those scientists and scientific institutions that are allied and integrated into the State and Capital (2015: 91). Against this complicity, Stengers calls for a reclamation of science as a series of open plural practices against what we could call Royal Science, science as complicit in State-making and profit-taking, a science synoptic in its perspective an intolerant of ‘outsiders' and ‘non-experts'.
This is the starting point for Stengers' solution to the current state of impasse. In many ways what they call for is a kind of radical amateur scientific engagement, a reclamation of science as a common practice, one that is experimental and open, and one that seeks to work with the intrusion of Gaia against the continuation of the present and political (capitalist) realism.
Stengers uses what they term the ‘GMO event' (2015: 35) as a means of articulating this alternate political vision. The GMO event names a period of political activism around the proposed introduction of genetically modified food crops into Europe (particularly France and the UK). In response to this proposal there was a wide social revolt, comprising a range of campaigns from public demonstrations to direct action where GMO crops were destroyed, the result being the banning of many GMO crops across much of Europe and the delegitimization of GMO crop science.
For Stengers this event demonstrates how a seemingly expert or scientific issue – crop science and genetics – can be reclaimed from expertise and become a ‘common' question, and thus a basis for political action and collectivity. The first step involved in this reclamation is what Stengers calls “paying attention” (2015: 100). Paying attention means not only looking closely at how governance functions and the problems it produces. It means asking questions of and intervening into those things non-Guardians are not meant to “meddle with” (2015: 88). Paying attention is a political act as it claims a technical question as a political problem. Paying attention in this way is an act of commoning knowledge and resisting the on-going enclosures of science and knowledge (on this point Stengers makes the link to open source programs and the struggles of computer programmers against corporate enclosures and copyright).
Commoning is a means of avoiding stupidity, as it works to produce a different context for problems. It socialises technical issues, and asks that they respond to broader concerns, concerns beyond those of ‘political realism', concerns that attend to life in a boarder everyday sense. It brings these problems into contact with non-experts, and in doing so creates new relationships and collectivities. By contesting what ‘the facts' can mean, and who can interpret them, commoning refuses the depoliticisation of problems by articulating a community of the problem, refusing its relegation to governance.
Such an approach is not without its risks. But as suggested by Stengers there are no experiments that are risk-free (2015: 104). There is no position of innocence. Nor have facts ever been neutral. But we cannot avoid the intrusions of Gaia – we are already living amongst the ruins in the Anthropocene and with the legacy of climate change. Hence all political practice is already catastrophic, and all politics takes place after progress. The question is how to make the future less bad than it would be otherwise, to resist and refuse a coming barbaric global apartheid.

My fiance and I got home from Applebee's (can't go wrong with half-off apps and $3 margaritas) and they pointed out that I had a package sitting on the porch. I swung down to grab it, and was surprised by its weight. Upon opening it (and being covered in packing peanuts...), I discovered a shirt with a fun graphic of Edgar Allen Poe that says "Edgar Allen BOH", from the Natural Bohemian brewery in Baltimore. There is also beer (their IPA) in the box, from a Philadelphia brewery called Yards Brewing. I just enjoyed one, and it's got the sweetest aftertaste of any IPA I've ever had. I'm from Wisconsin and live in Minnesota, so I've had my fair share of local beers (New Glarus, Sprecher, Surly, and Schell's, for example). Yards definitely holds its own against the famed Surly Furious that I'm so fond of.

John Reusing will tell you that selling sausages and pierogi at the National Security Agency's farmers market is no different than vending at other markets: Customers order, customers pay, they make dirty sausage jokes.
Though there was that incident on their first day. After passing through the NSA's security gates in their car, they pulled up a map on their cellphone to figure out where to drive. “Lots of security guards with guns yelled at me,” says the owner of Baltimore-based Ostrowski's Famous Polish Sausage. “They did not appreciate having a camera phone pointed at them.”
The NSA farmers market, dreamed up by community-minded employees of the agency, began last year as an alternative to the cafeteria. The market, which launched with a handful of local food producers, was held every Friday in the spring and ran through November. It proved so successful that organizers brought it back this year — this time closer to the main building (a towering black cube on Fort Meade, Md., known simply as “OPS 2A”) and with almost double the number of food stands, which rotate weekly.
“Walk outside and bang, it's right there,” says Dan Thomas, NSA's chief of logistics for installations and logistics directorate, who estimates that more than 1,000 of the NSA's 10,000-plus on-site employees visit the market every Friday.
Caitlin Icart, a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and a former employee of the NSA, frequented the market before they left the agency in September to pursue something more creative. Today, they and their husband roast organic beans through their company, Epic Bean Coffee, and Icart serves them at the market to former colleagues.
“A lot of friends come by,” Icart says. “They're very supportive. I'm like, ‘OK, well have fun not seeing sunlight!' ” as they return to their desks.
Becoming a vendor at the NSA farmers market is not quite as simple as filling out an application. Most participants are selected based on recommendations by employees and receive an email out of the blue asking them to apply.
“My original reaction was, ‘I don't know about this,'” says Evan Siple, owner of Mobtown Meat Snacks, who was contacted by the NSA last year about selling jerky. “The NSA has ‘security' in its name, and I'm like, OK, what am I going to have to do to get in?”
The process, according to vendors, is relatively painless: The initial screening requires them to share their birthplace, birthday, Social Security number and vehicle details. Once cleared, vendors pass through two security checkpoints on the day of the market, which takes about 30 minutes. Security K-9s smell coolers for anything suspicious, and are trained well enough that they don't gobble slices of pizza or gyros.
Tucked behind the gates and closed to the public, the NSA farmers market has a captive audience ­­­— which leads to steady revenue, vendors say. “It's kind of like fish in a barrel because the employees can't really go out to lunch, and there's no food delivery coming in,” says Ostrowski's Reusing.
Of the vendors, Flavor Cupcakery and Bake Shop is particularly popular, consistently selling out its 750-cupcake allotments. On a recent Friday, as soon as the food truck opened its door, a line was stacked with men and women in civilian clothing and in camo, some of whom were holding bundles of sunflowers from the produce supplier.
The farmers market also gives NSA employees a chance to mingle across departments. “It gives you the opportunity to bump into someone else,” Thomas says. “It's an opportunity to interact with someone and say, ‘What's going on with your day? I really like this pizza, or I really like these pickles.' ”
Vendors, too, have struck up friendships with their customers — though they have to be cautious about how they interact beyond the confines of the market.
“We see them outside and it's always a big secret,” says Ashwini Paraquad, the owner of Sexy Vegie, which sells vegan and vegetarian food. “It's like, ‘Great seeing you on Friday!,' but we don't mention where we've seen each other on Friday.”

SAN PEDRO, Paraguay (Reuters) - Oil-producing Venezuela promised to provide fuel-deficient Paraguay with all the oil it needs, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Saturday.

Chavez, who has used their country's oil wealth to spread their influence in Latin America, was visiting San Pedro in the poorest area of Paraguay to sign agreements with Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who took office on Friday.
“We've signed the first agreement to supply Paraguay with all the oil it needs, right to the last drop... for the development of Paraguay's people, industry and agriculture,” Chavez said at a public event.
One of several agreements signed by the two presidents raised the amount of oil Venezuela supplies Paraguay to 25,000 barrels a day from the current level of 18,600 barrels a day.
Paraguay is a big generator of hydro-power but produces no fossil fuels and consumes about 28,000 barrels a day of oil.
Chavez and Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop whose election broke with 61 years of one-party rule in Paraguay, did not mention any price agreement for the oil imports.
Lugo has insisted that they are more moderate than Chavez and their socialist allies in Latin America. But in their first two days in office the Paraguayan leader showed interest in tightening ties with the region's leftist.
On Friday evening they and Chavez held a news conference with Ecuador President Rafael Correa, who celebrated the socialist revolution they said they all belonged to.
Chavez, Correa and Bolivian President Evo Morales have turned back the free-market reforms that swept Latin America in the 1990s and have increased state control of their economies.
“People say, ‘Don't trust Chavez, be careful with Chavez, be careful with Evo.' I'm not scared of Chavez. I'm not scared of Evo. I'm not scared of anybody ... We are going to be true Paraguayans and have respectful relations with all countries,” Lugo said on Friday.
And in San Pedro on Saturday Lugo said again that ties with Venezuela did not mean Venezuela was imposing anything on Paraguay.
Chavez has helped their closest allies — Ecuador and Bolivia — with energy investments, sent cheap oil to the Caribbean and fertilizer to Nicaragua and made direct purchases of billions of dollars of bonds from Argentina, which has not been able to access international debt markets since a massive default.

(CBS) Blackhawks President John McDonough understands the difference between history and trivia.
It was a subtle undercurrent last night amid the manufactured gravitas of the Marian Hossa 1000-game ceremony, but the team's top executive used the opportunity to continue to do what they have done since getting the job: keep everything focused on winning championships.
I'm not sure how many fans appreciated their casual reference to Hossa still having more important aspirations this year, but the painting of them hoisting the Stanley Cup – given to him, per McDonough, to commemorate the greatest moment of their career — was a stark reminder of what all this is ultimately about.
The trumped-up pregame party was signature McDonough on display. Even while maximizing a relatively mundane statistical accomplishment (280 players have done it) for the purposes of mawkish stagecraft, they were still able to use it to keep the NHL title top of mind for anyone caring to pay attention.
Some fans are uncomfortable trying to reconcile this reality with their currently giddy euphoria over the record-setting start. Anybody daring to point out that larger accomplishments loom is derided for trying to spoil the fun, quickly getting the “No Pare La Fiesta” message. It's a peculiar thing, this apparent emotional fragility, especially considering that the franchise is not far removed from its own parade, and that “One Goal” has been a marketing mantra, with its message obvious.
The last Chicago team with an unprecedented start to the season went out of their way to embrace the higher expectations brought on by their success, not worried for a second that any fleeting happiness could be undermined by confronting the truth.
The 1996 Bulls began the season 41-3, en route to 72 wins. Along the way, and amid the Beatles-in-America kind of attention they attracted, both Scottie Pippen and Ron Harper were fond of saying “It doesn't mean a thing without the ring.” They were smart enough to copyright the slogan, even, monetizing it on hats and t-shirts as the playoffs were set to begin. No fear, their excitement over less meaningful games tempered by context, and full awareness of how disappointing anything less than ultimate victory would be after setting a record. Their own version of “One Goal.”
Blackhawks fans should revel similarly in the higher stakes created by their team's explosion out of the lockout. There is no reason for any current thrills to be lessened one iota by the focus on the championship, when that singularity of purpose is what validates and galvanizes everything else. It is the principle of existence for professional sports teams at the highest levels, and particularly in the largest markets.
The players know this. The coach knows it. The subtext of last night's brief speech by McDonough was that they know it, too.
Just as they knew it in 2009, when the two of us talked during a game at the United Center. The arena thrummed with energy that night, and it was something palpable well beyond just that of long-starved fans relishing the ‘Hawks' restoration. In voices raised to be audible above the din, we discussed how far the franchise had come so fast. I marveled, while they demurred.
“Look at all this,” I told him, making a sweeping gesture to indicate the whole tableau of filled seats, intensely-shared emotion and riveting on-ice action that had been dormant for so long. “You should be very proud of yourself.”
The always-affable McDonough turned serious, their eyes narrowing as they responded.
“We haven't done anything yet.”

Now that we are beginning to acknowledge the fact that we are human even when we're at work, we can be honest with one another. Why don't employers put their salary ranges into their job ads? We know why: they want to see whether they can hire someone at the rock bottom price.
They may have $65-$80K budgeted, but if someone walks in who can do the job at $58K, they are likely to be hired at that very salary.
Why else would employers keep their salary ranges secret? I cannot think of a good reason, and I've been an HR person for over thirty years.
It is unethical and tacky to ask job-seekers for their current salary level, but internal and external recruiters around the world do it every day. When they are honest, they say "Why pay more than we have to?"
When you ask a job-seeker for their or their current salary or salary history, you're saying "We value you based on what another organization paid you. That's the only way we know how to value your talents." That is exactly the same as saying "I have no business being a recruiter, or a manager. I'm clueless."
As businesspeople we have to make judgment calls every day. If I meet you and spend an hour with you, I will be able to tell you at the end of that hour what I think you can command dollars-and-cents-wise in the talent market where you live.
I don't need to know your past or current salaries to make that determination.
Any competent HR leader could do the same thing. Any competent recruiter could do it, too. When someone asks you "What did they pay you at your last job?" you know that the question has everything to do with keeping as much information behind the veil as possible. That gives an employer a negotiating advantage.
The sensible and ethical thing to do is to include a salary range in every job ad. That way, people who don't want the job at the salary you're willing to pay won't waste their time and your time applying for the position.
If every employer or a lot of them starting posting their salary ranges, employers would save a lot of time and money. Job-seekers would save time and aggravation. Anybody who took the time to read job ads as a market research practice would soon learn what various jobs pay at particular organizations. As an employer, wouldn't it be helpful for the local talent community to understand your pay levels?
If you talk to a recruiter and you ask them or them "What's the salary range for this job?" you should get a definite answer. If you don't, you are dealing with someone who wants you to spill the beans on your own salary information so they or they don't have to give up any information.
Just to blow your mind with an astounding display of hypocrisy, the recruiter may ask for your salary history, and react to your hesitation to give it up by saying "Look, if we're going to work together, you have to trust me."
Anybody who wants your trust has to earn it first. That is how trust works. You can't demand that people trust you, and if you start a new relationship withholding vital information from someone, you have already made it clear that you're not trustworthy.
Forget that recruiter! They or they have tons of competitors.
You don't have time to deal with shady people. Anyone who calls you on the phone, emails you or sends you a LinkedIn message and then wants to use up your time asking you questions owes you something in return.
What do they owe you? They owe you the salary range for the position you're discussing. Until you hear that number or set of number, clamp your lips together. Don't say a word about your current or past salary. That's nobody's business but yours. Demand a salary range from the recruiter and if you don't get one, hang up the phone and look for a place to get a nice gelato.
It's a new day. Your belief in your power as a job-seeker is the biggest determinant of your job-search success: not your past titles or your degrees, not your certifications or your lovely LinkedIn recommendations.
Your belief in what you bring to employers will allow you to say "No thanks!" to the wrong opportunities and the wrong people in your job search, and invest your limited time and energy going after the people who deserve your talents.
Hunter Biden (left) and Hallie Biden (right).
Hunter Biden, the 47-year-old son of former Vice-President Joe Biden, is now dating Hallie Biden, the widow of their brother, Beau.
Beau, the former attorney general of Delaware, passed away at age 46 in May 2015 after a battle with brain cancer. Five months later, their brother Hunter separated from their wife, Kathleen, with whom they have three children — Finnegan, Maisy and Naomi — according to “Page Six.” Hunter is now dating Beau's widow, Hallie, with whom Beau shared two children, a daughter named Natalie and a son also named Hunter.
Hunter Biden told “Page Six” in an exclusive statement:
“Hallie and I are incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time, and that's been obvious to the people who love us most. We've been so lucky to have family and friends who have supported us every step of the way.”
The former vice-president also gave a statement to “Page Six” saying that both they and their wife, Dr. Jill Biden, support the relationship. They said, “We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have mine and Jill's full and complete support and we are happy for them.”
I'll post a picture probably tomorrow of what *might* be an infection. My camera crappped out and I need to get a new memory card.
I'm brewing a weizen though, and it's exhibiting interesting behavior. The SG is at .014, which is right at the top of the range according to beersmith. It's been a week in the fermenter, and it has a krausen ring (almost 2.5 inches of ring!) like it's raised and fallen already.
The kicker is that there's about 3/4 of an inch of foamy stuff on top. It's not foam per se, and doesn't look like anything here on the thread, which reassures me. It's pretty thick stuff, and when I did a beer thief sampling to test the SG, it formed a hole that didn't go away (the foam is pretty "solid" for lack of a better term). The residue on the foam looks creamy, almost like yeast. The foam itself looks like a sponge starter for something like ciabatta bread that's been fermenting for 2 days.
I'll have pics up tomorrow, and I'm leaning towards RDWHAHB. I'm interested to see what people thought though, specifically because I have never seen the ring fall (4 days maybe?) and then another layer of krausen-like foam.
The taste isn't much like a weizen though. No real wheat flavor and there's something... off... about it. I can detect hints of clove and banana, but not nearly as much as I'd expect in a weizen. Plus, it's a darker orange than I would have expected.
All in all, a weird first weizen. It makes me mildly concerned for the irish red I racked to secondary the same day. I hope it wasn't something I did to every batch I touched. That would suck.
So to keep this closer to on topic, what do you do with an infection like that? Rack it anyway and leave an inch or two of beer to protect yourself from sucking foam?

Spencer Haywood should have been a perfect fit for the Lakers at the dawn of the "Showtime" era. Once a hot-shot young player who sued the NBA (and won) over its age eligibility rules, the veteran power forward was a basketball star who enjoyed the celebrity lifestyle that came with it.
Their stint with the 1979-80 NBA championship team also could have been the highlight of a basketball career that already included an Olympic gold medal, an MVP award from their only season in the ABA and four NBA All-Star appearances.
But it didn't turn out that way. Things started off well with the Lakers, but Haywood's contributions to the team decreased as a cocaine problem took control of their life.
"I went from 25 points and 10 rebounds at the start of the season to 17 points and five rebounds in the middle to three points and no rebounds at the end," Haywood told The Times' Jim Murray in 1990.
By the time the Lakers hoisted the championship trophy, Haywood was not part of the celebration. They had been kicked off the team after passing out on the gym floor during stretching exercises before Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers (Haywood has said that they initially hired a hitman to kill Coach Paul Westhead after the incident but their mother talked them out of it).
Haywood told The Times in 1987 that they cleaned up after leaving L.A. and, after spending another season and a half in the NBA, went into real estate and the auto industry. The NBA's 55th all-time leading rebounder (8,675) also formed a youth foundation with an anti-drug message.
Explore who wins and who loses as a result of Scott Morrison's 2017 budget.
Loser: Taxpayers
Share
Most taxpayers will soon be paying more tax.
The Medicare Levy is set to increase by 0.5 percentage points — from 2 to 2.5 per cent of taxable income — to help fund the $22 billion National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and avoid future budget black holes.
If it's passed by Parliament, the change will kick in on July 1, 2019.
The Treasurer says all Australians have a role to play in supporting the disability scheme, even if they aren't directly affected.
Loser: Big banks
Share
The big banks aren't going to be happy. They're getting whacked on a number of fronts as the Treasurer works to level the playing field.
The biggest is a 0.06 per cent levy — essentially a new tax — that will kick in on July 1.
It'll only affect the five biggest banks — the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, ANZ and Macquarie — and will boost the budget bottom line by $6.2 billion over the forward estimates.
Economists warn some of these costs could be passed on to customers, who may then turn to their smaller competitors.
The big banks are also facing new rules on providing credit cards and there'll be a new authority to help consumers with complaints.
Winner: School students
Share
There'll be more Commonwealth funding per student for most schools. The Federal Government will give schools an extra $18.6 billion over 10 years.
The Government says it will standardise school funding, but as part of that about two dozen schools will lose Commonwealth funding and about 300 more won't receive as much as they expected.
Loser: University students
Share
University fees are on the rise. Students will have to pay an extra $2,000 to $3,600 for a four-year course. That's a fee increase of 1.8 per cent next year, and 7.5 per cent by 2022.
The income level at which you will have to start repaying your HECS debt will also be reduced. Currently, you only have to repay your debt when you earn over $55,000. From July next year, you'll have to repay it once you hit $42,000.
Universities are also facing a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend.
The only win for university students is the introduction of Commonwealth Supported Places in sub-bachelor programs like diplomas.
Loser: Foreigners
Share
Foreigners are losing out when it comes to visa, employment, property and education.
Under the new Temporary Skills Shortage visa employers will have to pay a levy of up to $5,000 for each foreign worker they employ. The levy will be put towards a fund to train Australian apprentices and trainees.
Foreign investors are being slugged with an extra charge for properties left vacant — and there'll be an increase in their application fees.
Foreign property owners are also being stung on their main residence; they'll now have to pay the capital gains tax when they sell it. And foreign ownership of new developments will be capped at 50 per cent.
Australian permanent residents and most New Zealand citizens will no longer be able to apply for Commonwealth supported university places.
The only win for foreigners is the establishment of a temporary sponsored parent visa which will allow relatives to stay in Australia for up to 10 years.
Winner: NDIS
Share
The National Disability Insurance Scheme has been fully funded.
The fund to pay for it will be topped up with additional money generated from the increase in the Medicare Levy.
Over the forward estimates, $9.1 billion will be paid into the special account.
Loser: Welfare recipients
Share
Welfare payments are being consolidated and some new welfare recipients will be subject to random drug testing.
People deemed to be at risk of substance abuse will be required to undertake random saliva, urine or hair follicle tests for drugs in three locations from next year.
Jobseekers who test positive to drugs will have their payments quarantined. About 450 people each year will be blocked from claiming the Disability Support Pension on the basis of drug and alcohol abuse alone.
Newstart and Sickness Allowance recipients will be moved to the new JobSeeker Payment, which pays the same. Jobseekers aged up to 49 will now have to undertake 50 hours of approved activity a fortnight. There will also be longer waiting periods for those with liquid assets.
The Cashless debit card will be introduced in two new locations.
Economists say this may make welfare recipients' lives more difficult, but ultimately very few will be forced off welfare.
Winner: Older people
Share
Older people can claim a few small wins in the budget.
If you lost your pensioner concession card as a result of the assets test change earlier this year, you'll now have the benefit restored.
Older Australians will get a one-off $75 power rebate.
And those over the age of 65 who downsize their home can pour up to $300,000 of the proceeds into their super fund. This is only expected to help up to 10,000 people a year.
Older people on welfare will lose out — the over-60s will now have to complete 10 hours of approved activity a fortnight, which can include volunteering.
Winner: Sydney
Share
Sydney is getting a second airport at Badgerys Creek in the city's west. The Federal Government will build and potentially operate it, which will ease pressure on the existing airport as it quickly runs out of capacity.
The Federal Government will pour $5.3 billion into the project over the next 10 years.
The airport remains controversial for some locals, who are fighting forced evictions in the High Court.
Winner: Patients
Share
Patients' out-of-pocket expenses should be lowed, with the Government lifting the freeze on Medicare rebates and improving the incentives for GPs to bulk bill.
The rebate is the amount of money the Government contributes towards the cost of particular medical services, like GP and specialist consultations and health tests like pap smears and blood tests.
The freeze will be lifted over the next three years, depending on the service.
Loser: Smokers
Share
People who use roll-your-own tobacco or smoke cigars might feel some pain after the budget.
Those products are set to be taxed more, bringing them into line with the tax rates on cigarettes.
The change will be phased in over the next four years, and will contribute $360 million to the budget over the same period.
Winner: Farmers
Share
After decades of lobbying, farmers are finally getting an inland rail network to move their goods faster and cheaper.
The Government will invest more than $8 billion to build the line linking Brisbane to Melbourne. Construction could start this year.
There's also ongoing funding for the Landcare program. The Government has allocated it $1 billion over five years.
Despite the wins, there's no money in the budget to improve mobile reception. Blackspots plague regional and remote parts of the country and are a major safety concern for some.
Winner: Western Australia
Share
Western Australia will get new roads and rail, as part of a state-Commonwealth funding package. The Federal Government has agreed funding previously earmarked for the Perth Freight Link can be used on the Metronet rail project and upgrades to roads around the state.
Neutral: Defence
Share
Defence will get $34.6 billion in 2017-18 and $150.6 billion over the forward estimates.
That's in line with expectations, and maintains what the Government calls a "stable and sustainable" funding growth path.
Defence spending is on track to hit 2 per cent of GDP by 2020-21 — three years earlier than the Government promised back in 2013.
But Defence consultants and contractors actually lose out — their numbers are set to be cut. Overseas and business travel will also be limited.
Operation Sovereign Borders will continue to get the funding it needs to "stop the boats".
Neutral: Small business
Share
The owners of small businesses will enjoy instant tax offsets for another year; a measure the Treasurer says will improve cash flow. Businesses that turn over less than $10 million each year will be able to immediately write off expenditure up to $20,000.
That's flagged to revert back to $1,000 from July 1, 2018, but there's a possibility it could be extended again.
However, some small businesses may also be hit with a new foreign worker levy.
Every employee on a temporary work visa will cost a business up to $1,800 each year, while businesses will pay a one-off levy for workers on a permanent skilled visa.
Winner: Traditional broadcasters
Share
Free-to-air networks will have their annual licence fee abolished and replaced with a much smaller yearly payment. It'll save them about $90 million a year. It's aimed at levelling the playing field with new media competitors like Facebook, Netflix and Google.
Pay TV operators will also have a better chance to bid for major sports, and there'll be additional funding for the screening of women's sport.
The package also bans gambling advertising during live sport broadcasts.
Winner: First home buyers
Share
First home buyers are modest winners in this budget.
They'll be able to use voluntary contributions to their superannuation to save for a house deposit. Withdrawals will be taxed at a lower rate, but the amount you can contribute is capped at $15,000 a year and $30,000 all up. Both members of a couple can take advantage of the scheme.
The new restrictions on foreign property owners (see Losers: foreigners) could take a little heat out of property prices in the east coast capitals, which would benefit first home buyers.
Winner: Pharmaceutical consumers
Share
The Government has struck a deal with Medicines Australia to reduce the price of certain pharmaceuticals.
This means your out-of-pocket expenses for certain medicines will be lowed.
Extra medicines to treat heart conditions and schizophrenia have been added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
Loser: Anti-vaxxers
Share
Parents who don't vaccinate their children will lose about $28 per child per fortnight.
The money will be withheld from the Family Tax Benefit Part A. In total, the Federal Government expects to withhold about $66 million worth of payments.
Loser: Superannuants
Share
Superannuants, as the major shareholders in banks, could bear the brunt of the new levy faced by the five biggest financial institutions.
Economists say any reduction in the banks' profits will ultimately impact the share price and therefore the banks' shareholders.
Loser: Foreign aid
Share
Australia's foreign aid budget will be frozen for two years from 2018.
The amount spent on aid and development had been expected to increase in line with the consumer price index.
The freezing of the budget means Australia will spend $303 million less on foreign aid during that time.
Winner: National security
Share
The Australian Federal Police will get an extra 300 staff, including negotiators, tactical response officers, bomb squad technicians and forensic specialists. It's part of a $321 million boost to its budget.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will also get more money, but appropriately for spooks, the exact amount of the increase is being kept secret.

On 26 January 2016, Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) presided over a brief administrative session to postpone U.S. Senate business an additional day due to the onset of Winter Storm Jonas. While making their comments, Murkowski noted:
“As we convene this morning, you look around the chamber, the presiding officer is female. All of our parliamentarians are female. Our floor managers are female. All of our pages are female. This was not orchestrated in any way, shape, or form. We came in this morning, looked around and thought ‘something is different this morning.' Different in a good way, I might add. But something is genuinely different and I think it's genuinely fabulous. Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women who put on your boots and your hat on and slug through the mess that is out there.”
While Murkowski's above-quoted comment is accurate, it led to two misconceptions about the Senate session on 26 January 2016:
All male senators decided to stay home from work while all female senators decided to show up for work. Only females were present in the Senate chamber.
These misconceptions were illustrated in a viral Facebook video from Now This:
Only Female Senators Showed Up To Work After The Snowstorm Only female Senators showed up to work during the giant blizzard of 2016 Posted by NowThis on Wednesday, January 27, 2016
The Washington Post reported that Senate votes scheduled for Monday were postponed until Wednesday due to the snowstorm, and while the floor was open on Tuesday for senators who wanted to speak, there were no roll call votes that day:
The Senate will reconvene Tuesday afternoon and will be open so that senators may speak if they want, but there will be no roll call votes, leadership aides said.
While Sen. Murkowski's observations were true, it isn't completely accurate to say that male senators didn't show up for work, as the primary focus of Tuesday's session was to postpone business until Wednesday.
Murkowski even noted that it was “understandable that we would allow a period of time for our colleagues to return to the Senate” due to the severe weather:
“What we have just done is move consideration for the energy bill from today to tomorrow. A little bit unusual. But given what we have seen here, not only in Washington DC but all around the East Coast. With the weather, the blizzard of 2016. It is understandable that we would allow for a period of time for our colleagues to return to the United State Senate.”
The full video of Murkowski's comments also shows that several men were present in the chamber, although there were no male senators. While Murkowski and Collins were the only senators in the chamber, there were males present, including Senate Chaplain Rear Adm. Barry Black. Several other men can be seen in the chamber, although their names and positions are not known:
While female senators presided over a brief session on 26 January 2016 and no male senators were present for the session, there were some men present in the Senate chamber.
March is known for at least one thing every year, NCAA March Madness and it is right around the corner. And with that is the continuation of the BSC Book Tournament. In case you were curious, yes the two events ARE similar! Our tournament is set up in the style of March Madness where we will eventually crown the Best Dystopian Novel of 2011 (as voted by our readership).
This is the first year Optionated will be participating in the BSC Book Tournament. Because of the world wide phenomenon caused by The Hunger Games over the last year, our tournament will give you a taste of The Hunger Games with 32 dystopian novels fighting to be crowned the winner.
The rules are these: eligibility is determined by a book being published for the first time in 2011, in the science fiction or fantasy genre, YA inclusive (anthologies are only considered if they are not reprints). The selected contestants are bracketed out into four groups; within each bracket the seeds are matched highest to lowest, and a voting poll is put up on our website. The poll will remain open the designated length of time (schedule TBA), and winners are determined strictly by the highest number of votes. The winners of each round of voting will be matched to their next opponent on a pre-designated schedule (to be announced at the end of this week, in advance of any match-ups). Repeat the steps until we have four bracket champions, who will then play against one another to determine which books proceed to the consolation round, and which to the championship.
Because, as with Highlander, in the end there can be only one.
You can see our list of 32 contestants in their four brackets below:
Future Apocalypse Bracket
Incarceron – Catherine Fisher Ship Breaker – Paolo Bacigalupi Birthmarked – Caragh M. O'Brien Fever Crumb – Philip Reeve Legend – Marie Lu The Death Cure – James Dashner Across The Universe – Beth Revis All These Things I've done – Gabrielle Zevin

Fishermen catch 20 of the mammals on the first day of the controversial six-month hunting season featured in anti-dolphin killing film The Cove
Japanese fishermen on Friday killed the first dolphins of the season in a controversial annual hunt that attracted global attention after it was featured in the Oscar-winning 2009 documentary The Cove.
Fishermen at the western town of Taiji caught 20 dolphins, according to the local Kii Mimpo newspaper.
“We finally caught them. I'm relieved,” Yoshifumi Kai, a senior official of the local fisheries association, told Kyodo News agency.
Dolphin Project (@Dolphin_Project) Taiji: UPDATE, Approximately 12 to 15 Rissos dolphins were slaughtered in the cove.2016.09.09-2:00pm #DolphinProject pic.twitter.com/WJWIpOy8f4
During the six-month hunting season, people from the southwestern town corral hundreds of the mammals into a secluded bay and butcher them, turning the water crimson red.
The scene was featured in the documentary, drawing unwanted attention to the little coastal community.
Environmental campaigners visit the town every year during the gruesome event and authorities have boosted their presence to prevent any clashes between locals and activists.
There were no clashes between anti-whaling activists and fishermen on Friday, Kyodo News added.
Officials and fishermen at Taiji could not be reached for immediate comment.
Defenders of the hunt say it is a tradition and point out that the animals are not endangered, a position echoed by the Japanese government.
Ric O'Barry, the star of The Cove, was detained earlier this year for nearly three weeks after being denied entry to Japan, and was deported from the country.
WHEN DOES THE EXTRAORDINARY BECOME ORDINARY? At what point does the vanguard become the establishment? How can froth go flat? If you're a diligent surf mag reader (or surf flick fiend), you've probably seen enough idyllic Mentawai Island boat trips to fill a memory card - somebody else's memories, of course, but memories nonetheless. But after, say, 20 years of being fed the same data, the audience is ready to move on. Beachbreaks. Wetsuits. Chop. Anything but perfect Sumatra by yacht.
UNLESS... Unless the vessel is extraordinary - like the Ratu Motu, alpha ship of the Mentawai fleet, helmed by a veteran captain and supported by Surfline's forecasting tools. Unless the cast is respectively vanguard: two Australians, one South African and four Californians who represent their sport in seven distinct, postmodern fringes. Unless the most frothing thing in the story is the surf itself, relentlessly pumping for this 12-day expedition during one of Indonesia's most active late seasons in recent history.
NO. WE'RE NOT DONE HERE YET.
Donald Trump (Photo: Joe Raedle)
Once again, the more disciplined Donald Trump is giving way to the Twitter-wielding Donald Trump.
After a stretch of more low-key campaigning, Trump is spending the weekend under fire for comments about Hillary Clinton that seem to invite violence against her, fighting with the media, and engaged in a dispute with a former Republican defense secretary — all on top of a revival of the "birther" issue involving President Obama.
The Republican presidential nominee is also virtually tied with Clinton in recent election polls, and says voters are responding to their message about striking back at economic decline, foreign policy turmoil and specific issues like illegal immigration.
"A lot of people agree with me" on immigration, Trump said during a speech Saturday in Houston. "It seems everybody agrees. ... You almost say, what's not to agree with?"
Eric Schiffer, an independent political consultant, said Trump seems to revert to more aggressive form whenever they are doing well and their polls are up: "Something happens, and they seem to lose the discipline that has helped him."
Trump engaged in more traditional campaigning Saturday, devoted in part to immigration. Speaking in Houston to The Remembrance Project, a non-profit that according to its website "advocates for families whose loved ones were killed by illegal aliens," Trump said that "not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders."
The Houston trip came a day after Trump sought to put the birther issue behind him, reading a brief statement saying they finally believe Obama "was born in the United States, period." After more that five years of claims that Obama may have been born in another country, Trump did not explain their change of position.
Hours later on Friday, Trump again raised the specter of violence against Clinton. Claiming that their Democratic opponent opposes gun ownership rights, Trump suggested that their "bodyguards" drop their weapons and disarm: "Take their guns away, they don't want guns — take them, let's see what happens to her."
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called the comment "out of bounds," and said "we've seen again and again that no amount of failed resets can change who Donald Trump is."
The Secret Service protects both presidential nominees.
The Clinton campaign and allies said this isn't the first time Trump has linked potential violence to the Democratic nominee. Last month, while discussing Clinton, gun rights and the Supreme Court, Trump said: "If they get to pick them judges, nothing you can do folks. ... Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know."
Taking on Twitter early Saturday, Trump explained their latest comment in terms of the right to bear arms: "Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from their heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!"
Trump continued to stay busy on Twitter Saturday, striking back at former Defense Secretary Robert Gates for pointed criticism.
Gates, appointed to the Pentagon by President George W. Bush and retained by Obama, criticized both Trump and Clinton in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on challenges facing the next commander-in-chief. But while Clinton has "credibility issues," Gates wrote that Trump is in a "league of their own" and is unqualified for the job.
“He has no clue about the difference between negotiating a business deal and negotiating with sovereign nations,” Gates wrote. “A thin-skinned, temperamental, shoot-from-the-hip and lip, uninformed commander-in-chief is too great a risk for America.”
Trump counter-attacked by tweeting that "I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. They know nothing about me. But look at the results under their guidance — a total disaster!"
The Republican nominee also expressed displeasure with the media in a string of Saturday tweets.
For example: "@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low — and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!"
For another: "Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends they know me well--wrong!"
In recent weeks, the lower-key Trump has engaged in outreach to African-American voters and to women voters, two groups that give them low ratings in part because of involvement with "birther" attacks on Obama.
While Trump and aides may be seeking to bury the issue, it is likely to surface during the series of three debates with Clinton that start on Sept. 26.
Clinton "should be able to score points on this with suburban women who will decide this election," said Schiffer, the political strategist and chairperson of ReputationManagementConsultants.com.
Less than two months before the Nov. 8 election, some analysts see two Trumps: one who appeals to nationalist conservatives, another seeking to reach more moderate Republican suburbanites, particularly women. Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said it seems like he's "telling people what they want to hear."
Hemmer added: "I would guess we're going to see these two Trumps throughout the rest of the campaign."

Controversial footage from the film set of A Dog's Purpose that sparked outrage and a boycott was manipulated and "mischaracterized events on the set," according to a statement released by American Humane Association.
The animal welfare organization, which was in charge of supervising animals on set of the comedy-drama about a canine searching for the meaning of life, said the results come from an "independent, third-party investigation" following the release last month to TMZ of video showing a dog appearing to be distressed and forced to jump into rushing water for a stunt.
"The video was deliberately edited for the purpose of misleading the public and stoking outrage," the statement reads. "In fact, the two scenes shown in the edited video were filmed at different times."
According to American Humane, the dog was chosen because of its love for the water and was conditioned for the water scenes over a six-week period. American Humane trained the animals used on the set of the Manitoba-shot film.
CBC News has contacted American Humane for a full copy of the report and the name of the investigating entity but has not yet heard back. The company did not reveal the names of the people behind the investigation.
American Humane said on its website the report's conclusions were made from a combination of investigative findings and eyewitness reports. It also recognized that handlers could have been more cautious, given the dog in the video appeared "momentarily stressed."
"American Humane believes that the handling of the dog in the first scene in the video should have been gentler and signs of stress recognized earlier."
A Dog's Purpose, which stars Dennis Quaid and was shot in Manitoba, had a disappointing opening following the animal treatment controversy. (Credit: Joe Lederer/Universal Pictures, Via: The Associated Press)
After the video became public, animal rights organizations including PETA called for a boycott of the film. Cast and crew spoke out against the treatment, sparking further questions. It also led to a lacklustre opening when the movie, which stars Dennis Quaid, came out.
"The decisions by the individual or individuals who captured and deliberately edited the footage, and then waited longer than 15 months to release the manipulated video only days before the movie's premiere, raise serious questions about their motives and ethics," the statement read.
Nearly seven months have passed since the Buffalo Bills decided to part ways with Rex Ryan.
The breakup between the Bills and Ryan was a rocky one at the start. Rex is a coach who takes great pride in what they do and felt as if they didn't get a fair chance.
After a tumultuous stretch consisting of publicly ridiculing the decision to fire them as well as lingering in the headlines after a bar fight went viral, Ryan is ready to put the past behind them and create a more amicable relationship with their former employer.
Rex sat down for a 30-minute phone interview prior to a Los Angeles news conference today and seemed like a different and changed man since last speaking with the media.
Ryan was asked a wide-range of questions by Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News, but predominantly was asked about their thoughts on their former team and where they are headed.
“I was still bleeding at the time. It was still very raw to me. As a competitor, I wanted to succeed. I don't have any regrets. The Pegulas are awesome. But Terry made a decision to go a different way and they have that right, they are the owner of the team.”
Raw. Something Buffalo fans can identify with. 17 seasons and not a day goes by where Bills fans aren't reminded of their unfortunate past and prior regimes who promised to get back to playoffs but crumbled too fast.
Rex Ryan sold Buffalo on getting back to the playoffs. In their introductory press conference, they made promises to the fans and to the community that they would get the Bills back to being a successful franchise and keep them there. Those promises crumbled too as another coach and hope fell apart, this one after only two seasons.
Although Ryan can't influence whether or not Buffalo can return, they can, however, be a supporter. Rex still hasn't lost love for the Bills and talked about what it'll be like for Sean McDermott, especially after the USA Today predicted the team would go 4-12 in their first year at the helm, finishing with the likes of the Cleveland Browns and the Los Angeles Rams.
“That's a coach's dream, to have that kind of prediction because there is no pressure on you but I think that is total bull. If that is the case, why was I fired when I was fired if that's how bad this team was? So I don't get that. To saddle them with four wins, I totally disagree with that.”
Understandably, Rex Ryan set the bar very high for themselves in Buffalo and created the type of pressure Sean McDermott has not. McDermott has come in swift and has instilled a new norm. Players are now chosen for character and fit rather than noise or name. Rex added on to the fact that McDermott has no pressure, going as far as saying the Bills could be a playoff team.
“They are kind of trying to float this under the radar stuff, which I get. That's probably the way to go, that's the way everybody goes. Undersell and overproduce. I get it. I believe they will have a lot better year than the experts. Could they be a playoff team? They might very well be.”
Ryan went on to explain why they believe they have a shot. They point to injury and bad breaks to explain the record Buffalo finished with in 2016 and why Bills fans should expect success now, rather than in a few seasons with McDermott.
“Our record may have showed that we were mediocre but I thought the team was better than that. We had some substantial injuries. The only games that (receiver) Sammy Watkins played they had a broken foot in. Reggie Ragland might have been the best player we had on our entire football team and they get hurt in training camp.”
When asked what they miss about Buffalo, Rex reminsiced about the city they called home for a short time. The beauty of it and the resilience that is prevelant throughout it.
“There are tons of things I miss. I miss the people there. They were great. The fans there. When I took the job, I said I wanted a team that was built on that image, loyal. Loyal is a big thing. And committed to their team. I wasn't successful in that but the fans always were. The fans were always there for me, that team, that city. And that's the beauty of Buffalo and the resolve of their people. It ain't easy all those years not going (to the playoffs). But you know what, we are going to roll up our sleeves and go at it again. And that's the way that community is. And I think that's what they appreciated about me because they know I tried. They know damn well, I tried.”
If anything can be taken from the time Rex Ryan was coach of the Bills, it can be that they gave it their all.
Buffalo was second chance for Ryan, a chance that many including Ryan thought could be theirs last.
Rex Ryan taught themselves something that Bills fans who have endured the playoff drought may already know. Change and success doesn't just happen overnight. It takes finding the right people at the right time to put it all together and make a successful product.
Welcome to the 2016 Awards Profiles series, where we talk about high and low-profile films coming to a theater near you at some point this year. We will analyze the potential for these films to be players for the Academy Awards, and while many of these have the potential to be recognized, many will not either by quality or being pushed back to the following year. For the next eight weeks, we will bring you a film every weekday to talk about their potential. If you have a suggestion, please include it in the comments below.

Directed By: Scott Derrickson
Written By: Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Gargill (based on Doctor Strange by Steve Ditko)
Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benedict Wong, Amy Landecker and Scott Adkins
Synopsis (From IMDB): After their career is destroyed, a brilliant but arrogant and conceited surgeon gets a new lease on life when a sorcerer takes them under their wing and trains them to defend the world against evil.
Why It Could Succeed:
Besides its attachment to juggernauts Marvel and Disney, Doctor Strange has the most ideal release date of any new film this year that's tied to a preexisting franchise. Think about it: 20th Century Fox pushed Gambit to 2017, the one movie thought to potentially overshadow Doctor Strange given how close in proximity their scheduled release dates were. Gambit would have been even more threatening now since it's coming off the heels of both X-Men: Apocalypse and reigning domestic box office champion of 2016, Deadpool. The power of that trifecta alone would have made it nearly impossible for fans to divide their comic book loyalties, particularly since Doctor Strange is one of the few Marvel characters in existence nobody really knows about except the most die-hard of comic-consuming enthusiasts. Doctor Strange also has the good fortune of not competing with a Hunger Games or Bond film – which normally drop in November – and will reap the benefits of the holiday movie-going season, launching just before Thanksgiving.
The studio's casting department could not have picked a better actor to pin their financial hopes on. You have Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, someone who became an international mega-star before ever stepping foot into the MCU. Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth, for instance, did not come into this multi-layered franchise with a massive following – they earned worldwide fame because of their respective superhero films. Benedict Cumberbatch is already a superhero, demigod, what-have-you, to everyone across the globe pre-Doctor Strange origin story. Thanks to the BBC's Sherlock, Benedict's iconic speaking voice and singular facial expressions gave rise to the “Cumberbitches,” a fan group numbering in the millions that has dedicated themselves to being the wind to Cumberbatch's sailboat of a career. Yes, the enigmatic and supremely watchable Tilda Swinton will of course find ways to whip us into revering them as the greatest actor the species will ever know. And yes, Rachel McAdams is going to be as emotionally solid, involving and magnetic as always…but the film is essentially a one-person army so let's not kid ourselves into believing Cumberbatch isn't the primary draw here.
What Doctor Strange also has going for it is fresh accessibility – its story and characters are such a mystery to many that all we have to look forward to is, well, everything! Clearly Marvel is attempting to recycle the success of 2014's shockingly popular Guardians of the Galaxy, a film that also features second-tier Marvel heroes the mainstream didn't fall in love with until that glorious, magical, unforgettable opening weekend (yes, sorry haters, I am still as crazy in love with Guardians of the Galaxy as I was two years ago). Finally, being in the position of taking the Marvel baton from Captain America: Civil War means Doctor Strange is already going to burn right through our wallets even if it does – god forbid – wind up burning our hearts. You think audiences are going to care who directs the movie (I'll bet you, more than three-fourths of the country don't even know who the Russo brothers are!) or be reluctant to seek a film with such a clinical title?! Not a chance! Marvel, Cumberbatch and superhero shenanigans? You might as well seal the vault and forget the combination because there's no way anyone will ever break in to spoil those riches.
Why It Could Fail:
I would love to entertain this notion…but Doctor Strange has almost no shot at being viewed a disappointment on any level. Okay, I'll flirt with the idea that critics might find it indulgent, predictably Cumberbatch-ish (no explanation necessary) and could take up arms against Marvel for hiring a director whose horror films aren't exactly rolling in the deep. As long as Scott Derrickson doesn't give us Hollow Man 2.0 – and believe me, I scoured that IMDB cast list in search of Kevin Bacon just in case – we have no reason to believe this movie will be an unintentionally awful freak show. Sure, Ang Lee's The Hulk is proof that some doctor/scientist transformation narratives don't translate well from comic page to big screen, but after ten years I imagine trial and error are a thing of the ancient past for Marvel.
I guess the biggest concern we should have is whether or not Derrickson and Cumberbatch will uphold the integrity of the comic book hero. Is this film simply going to be Benedict Cumberbatch playing themselves in costume for 120 minutes as if that's entertainment enough? For the audience's sake, please let this not be so. Deadpool's success is largely due to Ryan Reynold's knack for using “celebrity” to exaggerate their character's screen presence, not confine them to a few key mannerisms. Benedict Cumberbatch is classically trained but commercially packaged, so he'll need to find an appropriate balance of the two styles to believably unearth the Doctor within.
Awards Speculation:
This might sound like a broken record or a paraphrase from one of our podcast episodes, but let me say this once more just so it sticks for good: if Disney couldn't even get The Avengers in the ballpark of “Best Picture,” let alone any sort of major Oscar accolade that wasn't tech-related, then no MCU film will ever be much a player at the Academy Awards. These movies are geared solely towards comic book fans, period. They are often silly in nature, and rely so heavily on backstory and intertextuality that you'd probably discover Atlantis before finding one non-Disney affiliated Academy member who's seen every single MCU film, let alone cares about them when it comes to anointing the year's best in cinema. Sure, Tilda Swinton is an Oscar winner and Cumberbatch is a freshly minted “Best Actor” nominee for their performance in The Imitation Game, but the two would have to give the defining performance of their respective careers to even be remotely in play for some awards recognition. Then again, Matt Damon did receive a nomination for playing up their star persona in The Martian, a science fiction movie nobody saw as a threat until critics and box office receipts began writing a brand-new awards narrative. Who's to say Cumberbatch can't mirror such a journey? Honestly, the best this movie could hope for is a hefty collection of tech nods, but even that might be wishful thinking.

A number of characteristics were examined - in particular age at first offence, abuse history, socio-economic status, education, substance abuse and degree of violence used. Information on the age of the offender at the time of their first sexual offence was obtained for all cases and averaged 33 years and a standard deviation of 9.7. One offender began offending at 17. It would appear that none of the offenders began offending as a child. These results must be interpreted with caution since file data are based on self-report of early abusive behaviour. The average age of the sample appears to be somewhat older than the norms described in the literature (Brown et al., 1984).
Information on abusive history was available in 11 of 19 cases. Of these 11, 55% (6) had a history of past sexual victimisation while an additional 36% (4) had a history of verbal, physical and/or mental abuse. In other words, 91% (10 of 11) had experienced a history of abuse. In 4 of the 6 cases of past sexual victimisation, further physical, verbal or mental abuse was described. In 4 cases, the offender became sexually active in their early teens. Although it has been stated, that past sexual victimisation is common in the history of female sex offenders (Mathews, et al., 1989, Atkinson, 1995), only half of the offenders in this study indicated past sexual victimisation. However, over 90% indicated some form of abuse in their history.
Low socio-economic status is considered to be characteristic of female sex offenders (Mathews, et al., 1989). In this study, a rating of a low socio-economic status was based on principal support by social assistance and sporadic or lack of employment history. Information on socio-economic status was available for 9 of the 19 offenders. Of these 9, almost 90% (8) were rated as low in socio-economic status which is in accordance with data presented by Mathews, et al., 1989.
Mathews et al. (1989) have found that female sex offenders are often poorly educated. Information available on 9 of the female sex offenders indicated that the level of education obtained ranged from grade 5-6 to grade 11. None had pursued studies beyond high school and some had obtained further education while incarcerated.
Female sex offenders commonly have substance abuse problems (Mathews et al, 1989). In support of these findings, 12 of 13 women in this sample were found to have substance abuse problems. In 6 cases, no information on substance abuse was provided.
Offences committed by female sex offenders do not generally include violent force (Marvasti, 1986; Johnson & Shrier, 1987). In this sample, violence or its absence was noted in only 10 cases. In 7 cases, violence consisted of: hitting or beating the victim, handling the victim roughly, beating a victim with bottles and a piece of wood, holding the victim down forcibly during intercourse, threatening the victim at knife point, and killing a victim. In 3 cases, no extraneous violent force was used in the sexual assault. Information was either unclear or not available as to whether violence was part of the assault in the 9 remaining cases. Therefore, in 7 of the 10 cases, where case information was available, offenders used violence during their offences. This finding suggests that in a federally incarcerated sample of female sex offenders, violence is a common feature, contradictory to data obtained in other settings.
TYPOLOGIES
This study investigated the extent to which the profiles of these offenders fit Mathews et al. (1989) typology of female sex offenders: male-coerced, teacher/lover or predisposed. It was hypothesised that most women would fit the male-coerced category (Mathews, et al., 1989; Knopp & Lackey, 1987). Information on whether the women had co-offenders, was available in 18 of the 19 cases. Of these 18 women, 90% (16) had co-offenders and 10% (2) did not. Each offender's case will be examined independently in order to fully illustrate the extent to which these offenders fit a particular typology.
Teacher/Lover
Of the two women who committed offences on their own, one, Offender 9, fits the typology of teacher/lover. A teacher/lover seeks a loving sexual interaction with the victim who is usually an adolescent male. They do not know they are harming
the victim in any way as the relationship appears mutually satisfactory. The offender's history includes a distant relationship with their father (Mathews et al., 1989). Offender 9's case possesses all these characteristics.
Anger as Motivation
Offender 5, the other woman who offended alone, does not seem to fit any of the typologies presented by Mathews, et al. (1989). The offender violently assaulted an adult male. The typologies neglect the occurrence of this type of offence which would appear more similar in typology to sexually assaultive men who are motivated by anger.
Male-Coerced or Male-Accompanied
Fourteen of the 16 women who had a co-offender, committed their offence(s) with a male. The other two women were co-accused for the same incidents, although inadequate information makes this unclear. Of the 14 women co-offending with males, 11 committed offences only with their husband or common-law spouse. Of the remaining three women who had male co-offenders, one woman committed offences with both their ex-husband (father of their children) and their current, common-law husband. Both an adult male friend and the offender's husband were co-accused in another woman (Offender 13)'s case. Finally, one woman committed very violent offences against their victims while accompanied by four males. This type of case is rarely presented in the literature.
Male-coerced offenders by definition commit a sexual offence with a male, primarily due to their fear of the co-offender (Mathews, et al., 1989). It is tempting to categorize all the female offenders who were involved in offences with males as male-coerced. However, a closer look at their cases reveals that such a categorization does not accurately reflect their motives or behaviour. Of the 14 women who co-offended with males, adequate information was not available to classify 5 of them into Mathews, et al's. (1989) typologies. According to file information, only 4 of the remaining 9 women can be classified as male-coerced. The first, offender was in an abusive relationship with their common-law husband at the time of the offences. They also seemed to be very dependent on their husband and was described as shy and underassertive. In addition to this, the victim of the sexual abuse was a young female. There is no evidence that this offender participated in the abuse on their own at any time. Therefore, it seems likely that they participated in the sexual as a result of force and pressure from him.
The second offender can also be classified as male-coerced. They were a victim of spousal abuse at the time of the offences, had low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy, abused drugs and alcohol and victimized their own daughter. This appears to be characteristic of a male-coerced offender.
The third offender can be classified as male-coerced as they offended with their husband against 2 children. They were also described as passive and easily manipulated and controlled.
Finally, the fourth offender also seems to fit the category of male-coerced. Them victim was their daughter, they abused alcohol and had very low self-esteem. It is quite possible that their offences involved feelings of powerlessness in the relationship with their husband.
However, the five remaining women who co-offended with males do not fit the category of male-coerced for various reasons. Although one offender sexually assaulted their son and daughter with their husband, they do not seem to have the characteristics of a male-coerced offender. There is no evidence that they were victimized by the co-accused. Therefore, there is no evidence that they participated in the abuse because they were forced into it by their husband. In addition to this, violent force was used on their victims. This is also uncharacteristic of a male-coerced offender. They could more easily be classified as male-accompanied.
The second offender in this group, committed sexual offences with their ex-husband and current common-law husband against their three children. They were a victim of severe physical and emotional and sexual abuse as a child. Although information on this case is sparse, there is no clear indication that this offender was forced into sexually assaulting their children by a male.
Despite the fact that they offended with two males, the third offender in this group cannot be categorised as male-coerced for various reasons. First, they were described as a primary aggressor. In fact, this offender initiated the sexual assault on the victim. They also threatened the victim, mutilated and physically assaulted the victim. This offender was not only in control of the offence, but appears to have taken charge. Mathews et al.'s (1989) typologies do not include female sex offenders who violently offend against a non-familial female and who take a role equal to and, at times, greater than, their male co-offenders.
Similar to the third offender, the fourth offender in this group was very much in control of their choice to sexually offend. They committed very violent offences on two female victims while accompanied by four males. Instead of being victimized or helping the female victims, this offender was quite active by leading and participating in the assaults. The degree of violence described in this incident is rarely reported in the literature. Again, Mathews et al. (1989) do not adequately classify this type of female sex offender.
Finally, although the fifth offender offended with their husband at times, they more closely fits the category of a predisposed offender for several reasons. This offender initiated the abuse of their children on their own and carried out this very violent sexual abuse for a lengthy period of time. They later incorporated their husband as a co-offender in the sexual assaults. The victims were also physically abused and neglected by the offender, in addition to being sexually abused. The fifth offender was a victim of very severe abuse as a child. These conditions are characteristic of a predisposed offender.
In summary, of the 11 women for whom enough information was available, only one fits the classification of teacher/lover and one could be classified as angry/impulsive. Four were found to fit the male-coerced typology. However, 5 of the offenders fit into an older classification scheme developed by Mathews (1987): male accompanied. One of the five was both "predisposed" and male-accompanied. Male-accompanied offenders co-offend with a male and are more active participants in the abuse against their victims than male-coerced. It seems the distinction Mathews (1987) made between male-coerced and male-accompanied is important to maintain.
In summary, for this federally sentenced group of women, the two largest categories were male-coerced (4) and male-accompanied (5). The other two could be individually categorised as teacher/lover (1) and angry/impulsive (1).
George Sokoloff, founder and CIO of Carmot Capital, recently explained why typical asset allocation strategies, including those employed by most "sophisticated" hedge fund managers, end up getting slaughtered during market shocks despite perceptions of being "well hedged". One has to look no further than the last "great recession" to get a glimpse of just how well the typical "hedged" portfolios fared during the last "Black Swan" event.
Unfortunately, large pools of institutional capital have grown increasingly accustomed to making allocation decisions based on short-term returns and relative performance rather than absolute returns over extended periods of time. Therefore, massive losses are ok as long as everyone is losing money at the same time, right? Absolute returns only matter to the suckers that are actually planning to use those pension assets to retire at some point. And, as for the hedge fund manager, don't worry if your relative returns suffer as that's not such a big deal either...simply shut your fund down...go on a really long vacation then come back and raise even more assets than before. But we digress.
In an interview with International Business Times, Sokoloff points out that most investment strategies follow a Taleb distribution that provide the appearance of low risk and steady returns but in reality offer investors a high probability of a small gain and a small probability of a devastating loss. Unfortunately, as Sokoloff points out, the majority of institutional capital across the globe is levered to such strategies. Just like in the "great recession," funds that rely on "diversification" as a hedging strategy have a rude awakening during Black Swan events as correlations converge to 1 and the benefits of such diversification are erased.
"You could be making 5% per year but then there could come a year that you lose 30% or maybe more, and that's kind of the big nature of the Taleb distribution," said Sokoloff. "Unfortunately most investment strategies actually follow that, including very sophisticated hedge funds, risk parity funds etc. Essentially the whole endowment model, big endowments, family offices and institutions, all of them have investments and their portfolios unfortunately follow the Taleb distribution and they do have a fat left tail. "They try to hedge it as much as they can just by purely diversifying. But liquidity events are so insidious that your benefits are gone simply because your correlations start converging to one."
Sokoloff uses a very simple analogy to illustrate the risks of typical portfolio allocation strategies by looking at what would have happened to a prudent money manager, based in 1912 Geneva, who constructed a diversified portfolio of developed and emerging market stocks and bonds:
Imagine being a wealth manager out of Geneva in 1912, trying to create a nice diversified portfolio of developed market bonds, and emerging market bonds, says Sokoloff. Say 39% of client assets would be split between stocks of Great Britain, France, German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Italy: truly mature, developed markets. Some 21% of assets would go into stocks of the two fastest growing economies: Russian Empire and North American United States. The wealth manager might also put a smidge into emerging economies like Argentina, Brazil or Japan. In bonds, allocation would be somewhat similar. Gilts with sub-3% yield would be the benchmark, with the rest of developed and emerging bonds trading at a spread. Alternatives investment could be in anything ranging from arable land in central Russia or the Great Plains, to shares of new automotive or aeroplane startups in Europe and America, to Japanese manufacturing ventures.
As Sokoloff points out, this "prudent" portfolio would have faced drawdowns of as much as 80% over the next decade. People tend to rely on historically stable relationships between bonds and stocks, and when that relationship breaks down – as often happens in a liquidity event – even complicated strategies involving some arbitrage, essentially blow up.
The typical problem with strategies designed to profit during Black Swan events is that funds that are genuinely hedged against systemic risk tend to under-perform during periods of relative market stability due to the costs of hedging. And given the focus on short-term performance in today's market, most institutional capital does not have the patience to stick with fund managers that consistently under-perform during stable markets even if the payoff could be huge during a down cycle. But, Sokoloff notes there are strategies that provide minimal returns during "normal" market periods and stellar returns during "Black Swan" events, strategies which they refer to at the "Holy Grail."
There are a number of types of strategies which make good candidates for the Holy Grail. Many derivatives like conditions when volatility jumps. During a stockmarket crisis credit spreads between different quality bonds start increasing as people see higher chance of default on lesser quality bonds. This is where you can play on the derivatives space that hinges on the credit spreads; so credit default swaps for instance. Commodity trading advisors (CTA), or people looking into the movement of futures of different kinds and taking bets on either side, would be another candidate class of assets for this type of hedging. Another interesting hedge would be the sub-class of macro managers, the much maligned macro investors that are really contrarians. They believe there will be some economic shocks going forward, especially with emerging markets like China and others; or that Japan's unusual policy will backfire. The best-known in this camp are the likes of Hugh Hendry at Eclectic and Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital. Sokoloff said: "Those are the managers that use a lot of macro instruments that are convex in nature and they are just trying to time when things start going south. They have not really been good performers; they have been hated in last seven years and have lost assets as well. But still, they are a very good hedge." The last candidate would be algorithmic traders that benefit from prevalence of fear in the market. When fear strikes markets people start acting in very chaotic fashion. Sokoloff points out that the human psyche is really tuned in a certain way, which makes humans very predictable when they panic. That makes a ripe field to harvest with algorithmics. "There are algorithmic traders that also provide convex returns, tail risk hedging returns and that allows you to also benefit very strongly from any sort of collapse, slide or risk situation. And that is the camp we are in."
Finally, Sokoloff points out that our current environment is ripe for a Black Swan event while the only thing missing is the proper catalyst.

As per RTI data compiled by an NGO, Praja Foundation, in the last one year itself 7,650 people across Mumbai succumbed to various diseases ranging from malaria, tuberculosis to typhoid.
As per RTI data compiled by an NGO, Praja Foundation, in the last one year itself 7,650 people across Mumbai succumbed to various diseases ranging from malaria, tuberculosis to typhoid. From this, the highest number of people (7075) succumbed to TB as per cause of death certificates issued by the BMC's public health department. Furthermore, through this data, it was found that 46,606 people died due to TB in the last six years itself.
In Maharashtra, every month reports are received at the state office of the deputy chief registrar or birth and death at Pune where in the case of deaths that take place in various hospitals, the head of the institution is responsible for the submission of form no.4 to the local registrar. “Through this data that is being maintained since September 2004 under the Registration of Birth and Death (RBD) Act 1969, we have found major discrepancies in the reporting system of deaths caused by diseases like TB, malaria, dengue, among others,” said Milind Mhaske, project director at Praja Foundation.
The data was collected from civic-run hospitals/dispensaries, state-runs hospitals as well as privately-run ones across Mumbai. “According to data released by BMC in 2014, only 1393 people died due to TB and 30 due to malaria. While RTI data for the same period from cause of death certificates issued by the BMC themselves under RBD Act reveals that this year, 7127 already succumbed to TB and another 199 due to malaria. This is mainly because the BMC only compiles data from their own hospitals and not private or state-run hospitals,” they added.
Other than that, as per BMC records, only 30 patients succumbed to malaria while deaths due to the disease from death certificates stated that 199 citizens lost their lives because of it.
Diarrhoea was another cause of concern as a staggering 1,2 lakh residents were diagnosed with the water borne disease out of which 255 died between 2013-14. Other water borne diseases like cholera and typhoid resulted in seven and 10 deaths respectively. Dengue deaths have also risen from 52 to 74 in the last three years and in 2013, to 108.
The Other Side
When contacted, Dr Mangala Gomare, epidemiologist of the BMC said, “Basically the cause of death (COD) given in death certificates is based on the clinical impression of treating physician or general practitioner available at the time. At times, these doctors aren't even qualified and the confirmation of the COD can be given only after a diagnostic test like ELISA for dengue. For malaria cases, the death review committee confirms whether the patient died due to the disease or not.”
“Other than that, many patients are shifted to Mumbai and aren't residents here so their deaths aren't included in our records,” they added.
We are being invaded and we are disappearing.

Those of us on the right who are demanding common sense immigration policies need to unite behind the very daunting and rapidly occurring issue of population replacement that is currently happening across Europe.
The Great Hunger in Ireland (1845–1852) occured under British occupation where around 1 million Irish people died (from starvation and disease) and thousands emigrated. The population went from 8.2 million to 6.5 million meaning between 20% — 25% of the Irish population disappeared in just under a decade. 100 years on (1933–1945) under German-occupied Europe around 11 Million people were butchered by Nazis including 6 million Jews. 75% of European Jewry disappearing in just over a decade.
Now we are witnessing the worst ever recorded refugee crises of our time and with world leaders panicking across the globe Europe has agreed to take in as many people as possible. Inevitably chaos erupted. Criminality, rape, disease, and poverty has increased significantly across mainland Europe.
Almost every week we hear news of another truck tearing people apart, a nightclub getting shot up or a suicide bomber destroying the lives of people at events where they seek entertainment. But another threat has been overlooked and it may be too far gone to turn back.
In an article for The Irish Times entitled “Let's Talk about the Link between Immigration and Low Reproduction Rates” by former Professor of Biochemistry William Reville, they discuss the issues surrounding voluntary low birth-rates among native Europeans that are being “topped up” by immigrants. And these very same immigrants have much higher birth rates than the native populations.
If this continues at this current rate “elementary demographic calculations show that indigenous populations and cultures will vanish”, and “Longer-term UN projections predict that, if European fertility rates remain at current low levels, half the European countries would lose at least 95% of their population by 2300” .
The question remains, why are we voluntarily replacing ourselves? Twice in the last 100 years Europe has gone to war and twice Europe rebuilt itself. Our various cultures and values were hard earned and we have all gone through lengths to get to where we are today.
Due to population replacement, these very same values and cultures (the foundations of our identity) we went through so much to keep will disappear. Throughout history we know and understand that when populations begin to disappear the reasons and consequences are horrifying, so why is that any different when we do it to ourselves?

I've missed a lot of fantastic runs over the past weeks due to being on vacation, and now that I'm back what better way to catch up than to write some news! Lets start things off with dtea's no gold run: they completed a run with a time of 2:00.887, about .5 seconds off from the world record held by Kinnijup. An incredible run missed out on sub-2 due to a scumbag scorpion unstunning at the worst time possible on olmec, tea kept their cool throughout the run and on olmec especially, and low-scored their way to 2nd place on the no gold leaderboard. GG Tea! It's been a good week for Grooomp for sure, improving their low% time and moving even closer to the illustrious sub-3 low%, getting an amazing 3:02.801. It's only a matter of time before Grooomp breaks that 3 minute barrier. Speaking of Grooomp breaking things, they broke the record for fastest haunted max hell run, beating bootsthatshoot's time by nearly 3 minutes, and getting a 9:17.704 run. Congrats Grooomp! A few days ago Curticus2 came within 30 seconds of the Shortcuts + Olmec world record, getting a crazy good time of 17:11.000! This puts them at 4th place on the AS+O leaderboard! Now onto two guys that have been very busy the last few days: ix and Falafel_Raptor: ix has completed, in the past five days, two daily challenges with a score of 1+ million, a 6:42.833 max any% which is no easy feat, and a 3:53.992 low% run that also counts as their any% pb and as a no teleporter any% pb. Sub 4 low% is no joke, ix! All these incredible runs recently make me so happy, keep up the phenominal work, ix! :D Falafel_Raptor doesn't play around, getting a 4:14.853 low% no gold run that also counted for regular no gold, and a 3:23.131 low% run, where they had only 1 hp entering 2-4, that also counted for their any% pb! It's great to see you in the discord now, Raptor! ShinGraywords has made some great improvements lately, getting an 8:11.400 hell run that also counts for no teleporter hell%, and a 3:16.532 any% run that also counted for no teleporter any%, as well as getting a 1+ mil daily! Sub 8 hell is coming your way soon, Shin! Bigsalad got a big score as well as second place on a recent daily, getting a score of $1,581,475, which also is their highest score! Congrats dude! Two more fantastic daily challenges were completed by TheMFC06 and Blimith! TheMFC06, on the same daily as Bigsalad, achieved a score of $806,525! Blimith, on the July 9th daily, achieved a score of $609,625! Both of these dailies are also their highest scores, keep up the great work you two! :) meowmixmix and CamoNinjazz both submitted max any% runs, getting 6:55.250 and 10:17.641 respectively. Again, max any% isn't an easy category, maximum being harder than no gold in my opinion, so these runs are extremely impressive! Usernamecantbe25 completed a crazy fast hell run with a time of 6:29.962, beating out me by less than 4 seconds and claiming 23rd on the hell% leaderboard. A lot of people talk about sub 5 and stuff for hell, but in my opinion, sub 6:30 is where it's at! Huge congrats to 25!!! Saibot completed a Drainmec run with a time of 4:54.938! Good job Sai, killing Olmec is a lot more satisfying when he's falling into the abyss rather than chilling in some lava! / I'd also like to welcome MbraY to Mossranking, who's just registered and began doing dailies. Looking forward to seeing you around (and don't forget to join the discord )! Finally, we'll end this news with a summary of Saturnin55 and their weekly accomplishments, since they were the one that asked if I wanted to write this article in the first place . First off, Sat completed a Draining Olmec run, or Drainmec for short, hitting a sweet 8:46.162! They then went on to get a 3:21.142 low% pb, which is also their any% pb and also counted as a no teleporter any% run! Nice runs, Sat, and writing this article was a blast! Peace yo ~Patdog56
About this Episode:
If you pay any attention to the number at the top of the strip, then you'll realize that this is our fiftieth comic. While that might not sound like too much, it's a pretty big deal to me. I've had a lot of fun with the comic so far, and I've got a lot of ideas for the future.
Thank you all for you interest in and support of Bricks of the Dead. I hope you'll continue to stick around to see what I've got planned for my next fifty strips..
To celebrate this milestone I've created a (very) little game, which you can play here. Enjoy!

Willful ignorance and denial are powerful coping mechanisms. You don't have to face the untold horror in the next room if you just completely ignore it or somehow convince yourself it doesn't exist. Simply tell yourself that it's childish to be afraid and ignore the fact that fear is a well-honed survival instinct that animals developed to help them avoid danger. Suppressing all that dread can help you get through trauma, but it can also bite you in the ass when you fail to prepare for a problem you've convinced yourself doesn't exist.
Who said Rob Ford isn't smooth? A buttery bust of the Toronto mayor reading a Margaret Atwood novel while resting on a steering wheel made its debut at the Canadian National Exhibition earlier this week as part of the fair's annual butter sculpting exhibit.
A roughly 230-kilogram butter sculpture of Rob Ford reading a Margaret Atwood book, while leaning on a steering wheel, is on display at this year's Canadian National Exhibition. ( NIAMH SCALLAN / TORONTO STAR )
“Rob Ford is such a character,” said Olenka Kleban, 24, a Toronto-based sculptor and the artistic hand behind the creation. “He's our mayor and he's a political figure, but he's more than that. They make a very good subject ... they attract attention to himself.” The sculpture, made out of nearly 230 kg of butter and currently on display inside a glass-walled box in the fair's Better Living Building, is part of a CNE tradition that involves a group of artists spending several days inside a box chilled to about 8 degrees Celsius, sculpting creations according to an agreed-upon theme.

Although the guys of Fall Out Boy were suited-up during the Movie Awards red carpet, they shed their spiffy outfits when it came time for their performance during the show. Hell, drummer Andy Hurley shed their shirt altogether!
But that's what rockstars do -- wear leather jackets and jam out while smoke billows around them. FOB played a short -- yet intense -- bit of "Centuries," before moving on to Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen." And they'd be damned if they didn't give Fetty the rockstar treatment as well.
Like a true badass, the rapper came out of a trap door as the opening beats of "Trap Queen" were laid out, reaching out to fans with outstretched hands as they made their way across the Movie Awards stage. "I'm like 'Hey, wassup, hello,'" they sang, introducing themselves to the world for their TV debut. Fetty, whom MTV News talked to just a day earlier, said that they never would've believed they would be performing at an awards show.
“If you would've told me I was performing at any award shows a year or six months ago, I would've laughed at them,” they said. “I would've said, ‘Thank you for believing in me.' I wouldn't have believed it, though.”
Pete Wentz followed Fetty to the side stage with their bass, while Joe Trohman busted out a killer guitar solo. Like I said, rockstars.
When I became pregnant with my daughter, I had no idea that I was autistic. In some ways, missing that key information about myself simplified my path toward motherhood. I wasn't faced with making the decision to become an autistic parent. I didn't have to try to guess at how my sensory sensitivities might be worsened by pregnancy or a colicky infant. I had no idea that my executive function might not be up to the task of cleaning up after a toddler and making three healthy meals a day for a growing family.
Essentially, I went into motherhood thinking I would be just like all the other moms I'd read about in What to Expect When You're Expecting and Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Once my daughter was born, it quickly became obvious that I wasn't like the other young moms I encountered in play groups and neighborhood parks. I had no idea why, but I knew that I was facing some practical challenges that few of the other moms around me were.
So I wasn't surprised when so many of the women I talked to for this article mentioned those same day-to-day challenges as being among the most difficult parts of motherhood or the primary reason for choosing not to become a parent. Carolyn, who is 30, cites their executive function impairments and difficulty sharing their home with other people as the primary reasons for their choice not to have children thus far. Though they love working with children, they say, “I'm terrible at setting goals or making plans or schedules, and most days even preparing three square meals is a challenge. I'm too afraid my deficits would lead me to be a neglectful parent, and I'm not about to bring a child into the world as an experiment to find out for sure.”
Talking honestly about our choices like this can be hard. Going into parenthood undiagnosed creates one set of issues; facing the choice to become a parent when you know that your disability might limit your parenting abilities creates an entirely different dilemma. For many of us, our parenting experience is a mix of the two.
We enter motherhood with little knowledge of our differences and soon discover that having a child stretches our coping ability to the limit. The decision to have additional children then becomes a very difficult one. Patricia, who has two young children, would love to have another child, but says, “I am reluctant to further limit my ability to cope by having another child . . . it doesn't seem fair to my children, who have emotional difficulties of their own, to have a mother who is so stretched and volatile. I struggle as it is, without a third child.”
As a young mother, I felt the same way. Although my husband wanted a big family, even without knowing that I was autistic, I instinctively knew that one child was all I could reasonably manage. While one child felt right to me from the start, many autistic women give up on dreams of a big family after discovering how difficult parenting is. Kezza, who has a two-year-old, dreamt of being a fantastic mother to a large family. After the birth of their son, they struggled with anxiety and sensory issues, leading to a decision to not have additional children. “I grieved this for awhile,” they say, “Before I realized I was on the spectrum I had this dream. Now I know how unrealistic this is for me. My diagnosis saved me from taking on more than I was able.”
For those women who know that they're autistic, the sensory challenges and physical changes of pregnancy are a common source of apprehension. Kerrigan, who has three children, remembers that they were “anxious and very scared of the birthing process. I probably read fifty books on pregnancy.” Two of the women who shared their stories for this article said they planned to adopt because, while they wanted to be parents, the idea of being pregnant sounded too difficult.
Finally, among women who are formally diagnosed, there is the concern that an autism diagnosis could be a liability when it comes to maintaining our rights as parents. Ine, who would like to have children but doesn't think it's likely, worries that “my diagnosis might be used to declare me unfit as a parent in some way, for example in a custody case.” This is a very real possibility. There is a long history of women with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities having their rights to bear or raise a child interfered with.
Autism Raising Autism
What about the possibility of having an autistic child? The big name autism “awareness” organizations would have you think this is a disaster to be avoided at all costs. But actually autistic parents? Their views are more nuanced.
A few women spoke of the difficulties they themselves have experienced as a result of being autistic in a primarily neurotypical world. Petra, for example, put it bluntly: “I consider life a struggle and don't want to inflict that on others.” I think we can all understand this sentiment. It can be hard to cope at times and the idea of bringing a child into the world to face the struggles we face is daunting.
However, as an autistic parent, we have a secret weapon–one that can make our autistic children's lives less challenging than our own have been. Kim echoed the sentiments of many autistic moms, explaining how they and their autistic son have a special bond: “We love and accept each other enough to be ourselves. I am able to help them put words to things they don't yet understand. I am able to help them figure out sensory issues that bother them and help them find solutions that work for him. I'm a problem solver and I work at something 'til all the kinks are worked out.”
Acceptance and understanding were common themes when autistic mothers talked about their parenting strengths. “It has been a huge benefit to have a shared neurology with my son,” says Puddy. Not only is they able to read their stress signals and coping levels, helping them to prevent escalations in their behavior, they say that “he finds great comfort in the fact that I can understand their need for routines and stimming that others see as odd.”
Again and again, autistic moms with children on the spectrum echoed Kim's and Puddy's sentiments. Many spoke of feeling fortunate that they can be there for their children, able to understand their experiences and needs thanks to firsthand experience. In mixed neurology families, autistic parents can help nonautistic family members understand an autistic sibling or child better. Puddy says they act as a translator, helping smooth out the differences in communication styles between their autistic son and neurotypical husband.
Of course, not every aspect of being an autistic parent to an autistic child is a benefit. Mazaria, mom to three sons on the spectrum, feels that they can “relate to and support them better than a mom who didn't have the same experience or mind processing. I don't find my kids weird or tell them that they are ‘babies' when they exhibit behaviors that are not age appropriate. However, if we are all escalated, it is hell for us.” Some of their sons' sensory seeking activities are triggers for their own sensory sensitivities, making it challenging at times to balance everyone's needs. They also worry that their meltdowns might be scary to their sons and relies on their husband to help them cope.
Looking Back
My own house is quiet these days. My daughter is grown and living on their own. Somehow, I made it through the difficult early years, finally breathing a deep sigh of relief when the school bus pulled away every day, leaving me with a few precious hours of alone time once again. We navigated the tricky waters of adolescence, and made it across that imaginary parenting finish line that is college. Of course I'm still a parent, but being the mom to an independent young woman is very different from being the mom to a toddler or a grade schooler.
I'm in a place now where I can look back on the journey and say that, without a doubt, all of those hard times were worth it. Being a mom changed me in ways that I could never have predicted, and all for the better. It's tempting to say that if I'd known I was autistic I would have done things differently, been a better parent, but that's a game that never ends well. Instead, I remind myself that I did what I always told my daughter I expected of her–I did my best.
Beginning on page 95, the bill has a provision that exempts low-density states whose block grants either decrease or stay flat between 2020 and 2026 from the Medicaid per capita cap. Under that scenario, Alaska and Montana would be exempted from the funding cap that applies to all other states during that period.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has been negotiating behind closed doors with Senate GOP leaders on the measure, and neither they nor the state's junior senator, Dan Sullivan (R), have said how they would vote if the legislation came to the floor next week. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I) joined nine other governors Tuesday in sending a letter to Senate leaders indicating opposition to Cassidy-Graham in its current form.
In an interview Thursday, Walker said they were still looking for the kind of assurances that would allow them to support the bill but had not yet received them.
“I'm concerned about protecting Alaskans, and my comfort level is just not there yet,” they said, adding that the bill has to be written “in such a way that Alaska does not get hurt in the process.”
Constraining federal health-care dollars through a fixed block grant, Walker said, poses particular problems because Alaska has so many remote communities and that, in turn, drives up the cost of health-care delivery.
“You can't drive to 82 percent of our communities. That's a concern,” they said. “When it comes to our health-care costs, they're clearly the highest in the nation.”
At the moment, neither Murkowski nor Sullivan are discussing any possible changes to the health care bill. Murkowski's office did not respond to a request for comment, while Sullivan spokesperson Mike Anderson said in an email, “The senator doesn't comment on rumors.”
“Throughout this process, they have been very focused on doing what's best for all Alaskans and will comment when the final draft is released and he's had time to review the language and the data,” Sullivan said.

If you've seen footage of a Donald Trump campaign event over the past month or so, you've probably seen the signage floating behind him: “Blacks for Trump.”
The Republican presidential nominee has expressed delight at the displays, and has gone out of their way to draw the attention of their predominantly white crowds and the media to their message.
“I love the signs behind me. Blacks for Trump. I like those signs,” they said at a rally last week in Sanford, Florida. “Blacks for Trump. You watch. You watch,” they added.
Trump notices signs behind him: "Blacks for Trump -- you watch. You watch." pic.twitter.com/UrQO6wPXMe — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 25, 2016
The same Trump who claimed as far back as January in a Fox News interview that “the African Americans love me” is now polling at about 5.6 percent of the black vote (and in some places like Pennsylvania, it's as low as 1 percent). So visual representation of black supporters is understandably welcome from the Trump campaign.
The accompanying declarations that Trump is “not racist” by the same people holding the signs are no doubt especially appreciated, given the criticism he's faced for their explicitly racist statements, a decades-long string of discrimination accusations, and racist controversies.
So who are these supporters?
The ringleader of the group hoisting Blacks for Trump signs is a former cult member who goes by both Michael Symonette and “Michael the Black Man.” Pictured in the sunglasses in the video above, Symonette isn't your typical Trump supporter, your typical conservative, your typical black Republican — or really your typical anything.
He's the creator of the Gods2.com website that's advertised on many of the Blacks for Trump signs, and a conspiracy theorist at a level that makes Trump's claims of “vote rigging” look harmless. Their political worldview centers on what he's convinced is an upcoming battle in which black and white Americans will have to fight together against “Arabs” — and a belief that Hillary Clinton is a white supremacist determined to destroy black women in particular.
Although Trump welcomes the displays of support, it seems unlikely that the GOP nominee has much familiarity with the ideological basis for this enthusiastic support, or the agenda of the individuals behind it.
No, these signs aren't the work of white supporters trying to fake diversity
Much of the social media buzz about the Blacks for Trump's signs has centered on a few pictures that show people who appear to be white holding them. This attention and amusement makes sense.
After all, white people holding Blacks for Trump signs would seem to be the perfect comedic embodiment of Trump's struggle to attract minority voters while insisting against all the available evidence that they adore him. It's tempting to assume that this is evidence of a racially monolithic campaign displaying clumsy desperation for the appearance of diversity.
Trump to white woman holding "Blacks for Trump" sign at rally: "I love the signs behind me... blacks for Trump." https://t.co/n4NClWnjKA pic.twitter.com/z57ZkLlRSX — Complex (@ComplexMag) October 26, 2016
Reporting on those images, Slate's Jeremy Stahl pointed out diplomatically, and with generous deference to the idea that a person's racial identity can't always be detected by a glance at their skin color, “It's possibly that Trump has a lot of very old, very light-skinned supporters.”
But what seems more likely is that a white woman at the rally either intentionally or unintentionally ended up with a sign brought by Symonette, who, as it turns out, was standing next to them in a spot they often occupy at Trump events: right at the front.
“Blacks for Trump” is not representative of most black people who happen to support the candidate — it's something else entirely
So who are the people holding Blacks for Trump signs? Are they just typical Trump supporters who happen to be black and like to make it known? No.
Your average Trump supporters (of all races) are driven primarily by racial anxiety, anti-immigrant views, Trump's ability to “say it like it is,” and confidence that their experience in business will let them bring America back to some previous “great” status that existed at some point in the past. Blacks for Trump members are ideological outliers — in a big way.
Assuming Symonette and the others who hold the signs embrace the content of the website those signs often advertise (Gods2.com), they are adherents to a political philosophy and worldview so bizarre and laden with conspiracy theories that it makes even the most controversial statements of Trump and their more typical supporters look conventional by comparison.
The Miami New Times reported that Symonette is a former member of a violent cult, named after its leader, “Yahweh ben Yahweh”:
Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; their brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man's eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. In the years that followed, they changed their last name to Symonette, made a career as a musician, started a radio station in Miami and then re-invented themselves as Michael the Black Man, an anti-gay, anti-liberal preacher with a golden instinct for getting on TV at GOP events. He's planned events with Rick Santorum and gotten cable news play for bashing Obama.
But what's just as eye-popping as their storied past are their current views. When it comes to this election, Symonette's support for Trump seems to be driven mostly by the fact that he's vehemently anti-Clinton — but for reasons totally separate from the ones you'll hear from the Trump campaign and most supporters.
No, Symonette doesn't think she's a “crook.” He's convinced she's a secret longtime white supremacist — with a specific goal to wipe out African-American women.
“Hillary's last name is Rodham, and their family members are Rothschilds, who enslaved 13,000 slaves as collateral.” they told the Miami New Times, explaining their support for Trump. “I completely despise Hillary.” Gods2.com proclaims that Clinton, along with Obama, is a member of the Illuminati, and that they are in fact “in the KKK.” (It goes without saying that there is no evidence that Clinton is a member of or a friend to white supremacist groups, and that the Illuminati are not real.)
This is the type of content you can find on Symonette's site. He's of the view that Clinton plans to start a war in order to kill black women (no word on how everyone else is going to survive the conflict).
The more I read about Symonette's views, the more familiar they sounded, and I realized that I'd heard them before — in person. In April 2015, I was working on a story about then-presidential hopeful Ben Carson's transition from African-American folk hero to right wing candidate. I ended up attending the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention to hear Carson speak and talk to their supporters. Symonette was there, standing out in the crowd, as they do at Trump rallies, because of their skin color.
I interviewed him, hoping to include their perspective as a black Tea Party member in my story. They didn't answer my questions directly or stay on topic, so I didn't come away with anything I could use. Still, I took notes as they spoke for close to an hour.
At the time, Symonette expressed no interest in Trump (who spoke at that convention but hadn't yet announced their candidacy).
Instead, they emphasized another aspect of the convoluted religious/political/racial theories that, according to their website, still influence their activism. A thread that ran through our conversation that day (which was, in honesty, more of a monologue) was their belief that black and white Americans would need to unite against “Arabs” (who are technically white based on the census, but clearly not in their mind) and Muslims. On their website, where they repeatedly state “Latin, Black, and White must unite,” they use Arab and Muslim interchangeably with “East Indian” in describing the people they believe represent a threat to these three groups.
One of the primary things that seemed to drive them was their perception of a specific threat of violence against black women — an idea that they tried to drive home by connecting it to me personally. It's difficult to characterize what they said without directly quoting him, because much of it was not based in fact and intertwined vague biblical references with current events and conspiracy theories. Here are a few direct quotes:
“I know that I have to get with the white European brother because that's my actual brother. You know what the Bible said about when the brothers come back together. I've listened to Africans talk and Arabs talk; the Arabs are coming to kill the black women in America. I heard a Muslim say this on Hannity. Well, I'm not going to allow them to kill my sister, so the only way to stop that is for the black man and the white man to get back together. What they want us to do is separate, which is why they are trying to separate us from the police right now, so they can come and kill you.”
“You see that? Boko Haram? They're coming to kill all the black women in the streets of America — they bragged on it three days ago. The only way they can accomplish that is to separate the gentiles from me. Do you see any Arabs on the football field? I guarantee you you're gonna see these type of black men like me, and white men. We're the only ones who can do it. You look like you're mixed with both of us, so you're the epitome of what should be but you're also the most in danger because they're trying to get you. I just felt like telling you that before you wrote anything horrible, so at least you know what you're destroying.”
“You know why I'm helping the Tea Party? Because they are the fathers of the young white men who we will need to defend ourselves and you. Sarah. You're Sarah. I can guarantee you. Is your mother white or your daddy white? Go talk to them It is not in their heart to take a gun and shoot a black kid for no reason. You have ever been to Europe? The Germans keep the rules. They're righteous. But they're trying to convince you, ‘Man, them crackers evil.'”
Remember that black guy who shut down four whole states with a sniper gun? Think of what black Navy SEALs can do. They don't have to wear camouflage. You can't see them.”
“Are you gonna ask me about Ben Carson now? If they win the nomination, whoever wins the nomination, the point is I can't let Hillary get in because Hillary Clinton was married to Bill Clinton, whose daddy was in the KKK, and Bill Clinton also made a speech about Robert Byrd being their best friend, who was in the KKK.”
Even Trump would probably be taken aback by some of this stuff. To be fair, no campaign can or should possibly vet all its supporters, and prominent placement of a voter and their sign at rally doesn't in any way constitute an endorsement of their views. Still, before Trump gets too excited about the rare visual support for their claim that “the African Americans” love him, and before they proclaim again that they “loves” their support, they might at least want to check out their website.
About
There are plenty of travel guides covering Tokyo, however these guides all fall short of a vital part of travelling the world - what do locals do? Sure, landmarks are nice, but let's face it, British people don't regularly go to Buckingham Palace, New Yorkers don't have a weekly trip to the Empire States building, these are all one off experiences. So, what then, do people local to Tokyo do?
A Tourist's Guide to Non-tourist Tokyo aims to explore this world, so that when you decide to take the plunge and visit yourself, you can have a truly authentic Japanese experience, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese.
There is a good reason most guides do this, and that is many traditional Japanese businesses, unless tailored for a western market, don't know much English, and so as a tourist it is extremely hard to get across what you'd like. Yet it is in these places that the best experiences are to be had, rather than the English speaking English themed pubs et cetera.
So, tell me about the book
The book will be structured into several sections, such as eateries, accomodation, transport, nightlife, and daytime entertainment, with each one having subsections, formal and informal phrases and sentences that you'll find useful, and customs, traditions, and etiquette for each one.
Throughout the book, full colour pictures, maps, and other useful inserts will all aid in pointing you the right way without ever getting you lost or confused.
Planned book structure:
1. Introduction to the book, introduction to Tokyo
2. Basics of life in Japan - general etiquette, language and pronunciation, useful phrases for daily life, vending machines, atm's and banks, what to do in an emergency or if lost
3. Travel - trains, taxis, travel cards
4. Shopping - convenience stores, 100yen stores, shopping centres
5. Eating out - cafe's, restaurants, ramen bars
6. Drinking out - pubs, clubs, hostess bars
7. Sports - local teams, local sports, where to watch
8. Other entertainment - cinema, sports centers, arcades
Why kickstarter, and why the goal?
Kickstarter is a great platform for gauging reception to a new product, and especially due to the costs associated with self publishing, means that those costs, if successful, are minimised, which goes on to you, the backers. The goal, whilst higher than other books, is due to the need to travel to Tokyo and gather the information whilst writing the book, arranging interviews with locals and business owners, and making sure the book is of the highest quality possible.
When 35-year-old Eric Zhu deliberated to which car their family should buy, Tesla Motors didn't stay long in the race.
Zhu, who works as a senior manager at a Western industrial firm in Beijing, is drawn by Tesla's 100% electric power and zero emissions promise. As a father of a two-year-old boy, Zhu is willing to compromise a lot for the sake of clean air.
"But owning a Tesla right now in China is just too impractical," they sigh. "We need a car that can take us back to our hometown on muddy roads, or go on a road trip to Tibet. This is Beijing. It's not like we can own two cars."
To win over Chinese consumers like the Zhu family, the Palo Alto, California-based Tesla Motors needs to succeed where other innovative American tech companies have failed.
Google Inc., for example, exited the Chinese market after four years' of operation. Facebook and Twitter are blocked from entering the market. Apple Inc. is still waiting for China sales to meet hefty expectations after it struck a deal with China Mobile last December.
There is little evidence that Tesla will be the exception.
Tesla is scheduled to deliver its ultra-modern electric vehicles to Chinese consumers next month. But there is practically no recharge infrastructure, and no policy support for Tesla in China. Both will take time to tackle. Not to mention the fierce competition in the world's largest automobile market.
The company's stock has doubled in the past four months, largely due to projected demand from China. But billionaire co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk, as well as investors, may soon realize that the Chinese market is much harder to navigate than they think.
"They are assuming the Chinese consumers behave the same way American consumers do. Chinese consumers are environmentally conscious, but they are also very pragmatic," says Jack Perkowski, founder and managing partner at JFP Holdings.
Perkowski previously founded ASIMCO, one of the largest auto components companies in China.
Beijing To Shijiazhuang: Mission Impossible?
Musk has projected that sales of its electric Model S cars in the Chinese markets should match U.S. levels, which totaled 22,450 in 2013, as early as 2015.
It is an ambitious projection. Porsche, for example, sold 37,425 cars in China last year. But that is 10 years after it sold its first Porsche Cayenne in the country.
The more mind-blowing aspect of that projection is how little infrastructure and services Tesla provides in China.
Currently, Tesla drivers in the U.S. have three ways to recharge their EVs. One is a high power wall connector that can be installed inside owners' garages. This adds electricity to drive 58 miles per hour of charge with a twin charger installed.
The second method is a mobile connector, which can be plugged into any electricity outlet. This adds 28 miles of drive per hour.
The last option is at one of Tesla's supercharger stations, where 30 minutes will add enough electricity to drive around 170 miles. All for free.
There are currently 79 Tesla supercharger stations in North America. The company has plans to build a lot more to cover 80% of the U.S. population by 2014, and 98% by 2015.
For Chinese consumers, there is only one way to recharge: the high power wall connector.
This means Tesla drivers in China are limited to a circle of less than 150 miles in radius with their home as the center. For someone who lives in Beijing and needs to drive to Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province that is 170 miles away, Tesla will fail the task. Not to mention if the car runs at a higher speed, its distance per charge will drop further.
Moreover, it is extremely difficult for Chinese consumers to install Tesla's high power wall connector in their garages. Except a tiny portion who can afford to live in luxury villas with their own garages, almost all of the Chinese urban population live in apartment buildings, where cars are parked in a large parking lot.
To install a recharge pole requires months of negotiations, obtaining numerous permissions and dealing with bureaucracies. One EV owner, who asked to remain anonymous, was able to install a recharging pole (not for a Tesla) next to their parking spot in a large residential community in Eastern Beijing. But it took over six months of painstaking time.
Tesla currently does not provide any support or assistance for customers to install recharging poles. Tesla's China press office did not respond to requests for comments.
"The initial fad factor will be very high, but over time the expense and inconvenience will be a challenge," says Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Ventures, a Shanghai-based venture capital firm with $1.1 billion under management, with clean tech one of its key focuses.
Services and repair will be another headache. At present, Tesla's Beijing store is the only service center in China. All Chinese buyers have to go there to pick up their vehicles. And, there is only one place for repair, at the Jin Gang Auto City in a northern suburb of Beijing.
As a comparison, Porsche has 63 service centers in China built over the past 10 years.
Tesla has plans to build a national network of supercharge stations and more service centers in China, but it will be years before it can be realized.
"Every EV company has a different battery, different charging stations. Trying to standardize the infrastructure sounds to me like a challenge," says JPF Holdings' Jack Perkowski.
Moreover, electricity supply in China is monopolized by state-owned electricity company State Grid. Tesla must make an agreement with that company if it is going to provide free electricity to its car owners, according to a State Grid executive quoted by Chinese media.
"The 'green' irony is that EV's in China would almost entirely be coal electricity fueled, which on balance can be questioned in terms of fossil emissions," says Chris Rynning, CEO of Origo Partners PLC, a Beijing-based private equity firm focused on the natural resources and clean tech sectors.
No China Subsidies For Tesla
A constant point of debate in the green tech sector is: Will the sector, whether it's solar power, wind, or EVs, stand on its own without government subsidies or policy support?
Tesla in China will provide an interesting experiment on the question, because Chinese consumers currently do not receive any subsidies or preferential treatment if they purchase a Tesla.
Beijing recently announced a list of EVs that will receive subsidies ranging from RMB63,000 to RMB108,000. The six EV models on the list are DENZA and E6 made by BYD; Roewe E50 made by SAIC Motor; ZINORO made by Brilliance Auto; E150 EV and C70GB made by Beijing Automotive Group; and iEV4 made by JAC Motor.
According to the Beijing Demonstration and Application of New Energy Passenger Car Manufacturer and Product Administration Rules released by the Beijing municipal government, only EVs that are domestically manufactured, or manufactured by a Sino-foreign joint venture, will be considered to be on the list to receive subsidies.
China's central government has also announced subsidies for EVs, which include RMB60,000 for a pure EV and RMB35,000 for hybrid models.
But these vehicles are selected from the Vehicle Production Enterprises and Products Announcement released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which also only include models manufactured by domestic or joint ventures car-makers.
In Shanghai, eight EV models manufactured by six companies are included in its subsidy list. Shanghai government offers EV purchasers RMB40,000 for a pure EV and RMB30,000 for a hybrid plug-in. On top of that, buyers can get free license plates, which cost around RMB70,000 in Shanghai.
All the subsidized EVs in Shanghai are also selected from the list made by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. They include Qin and E6 made by BYD...

Climate change impacts countered by stricter fisheries management

A new study has found that implementing stricter fisheries management overcame the expected detrimental effects of climate change disturbances in coral reef fisheries badly impacted by the 1997/98 El Niño, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. The 17-year study led by WCS fisheries scientists found that rapid implementation of fisheries restrictions countered adverse climate effects and actually increased fisheries catches, counter to predictions and findings in other studies without stricter management. This is good news for the millions of people who depend on coral reefs fisheries, as it provides a management solution for fisheries predicted to decline with global warming.
The authors examined the environment and fisheries catches before and after the severe El Niño event of 1997−1998, an unprecedented climate disturbance that killed half of the corals in the Indian Ocean. A comparison of catch rates in southern Kenya found a preliminary decline in catches that was followed by an increase of catches. This increase was closely associated with improved fisheries restrictions that were implemented shortly after the disturbance.
The study titled appears in the current edition of the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. The study's authors are Tim McClanahan and Caroline Abunge of the Wildlife Conservation Society.
The authors concluded that reducing fishing intensity and restricting fishing gear known to be destructive to corals and fish populations were the likely causes for the rise in catch rates and fishers' revenues. The authors note that this positive response may not occur in all coral reef fisheries but, because the fishery was composed of fast-growing, generalist species with broad diet and habitat needs, they may be less sensitive to reef conditions than to direct fishing mortality. These findings indicate that coral reefs management restrictions can override the detrimental effects of climate disturbances in heavily fished reefs.
"The response suggests we can do something about countering lost fisheries production even in poor countries," said lead author Tim McClanahan of WCS. "Common sense fisheries restrictions can increase the capacity to adapt to climate change and should be accelerated to mitigate losses arising from inaction."
This WCS coral reef fisheries study was made possible through the generous support of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and The Tiffany & Co. Foundation.
Dream Theater
Mike Portnoy
The Neal Morse Band
"A very special NO THANKS to the staff at the Whittington Hospital for NOT seeing me regardless of telling them that there is an audience waiting for our show to begin...I finally left withOUT seeing a doctor in order to make tonight's show...I have no idea how the hell I'm going to make it through this show...I can't even stand up or lift my arms..."
Formerdrummer, currently on tour in Europe with, visited the Whittington Hospital in London, England today, hoping to receive treatment for an illness. Unfortunately for Portnoy, hospital staff did not care that they were hours away from playing a show and did not see them in time, forcing Portnoy to leave without being treated. Portnoy had the following to say:While I feel sorry for Portnoy on a certain level -- hospitals are annoying and unless you're dying, you aren't being seen in a timely matter -- there's no way you can issue that statement without sounding like a jerk. And the reaction to Portnoy's Facebook post was predictable.Quite simply, Portnoy is not a big enough star to receive special treatment. While not an obscure musician, he's no James Hetfield, Lemmy, Dave Mustaine, or Rob Halford. Those guys wouldn't be waiting around for treatment; they'd either have a private doctor attend to them, or be whisked right through the hospital line.Look on the bright side, Mike, I don't think John Petrucci or James LaBrie would be getting special treatment either.
Saying “I'd rather not live in a democracy” is one of those Opinions You're Not Allowed To Have, and if you do have it, you had better not ever mention it in civilised company. However, it seems to me that a lot of people don't really believe in democracy, and they're getting worse and worse at hiding it. I am a member of the Labour party, and to me it appears that both sides of the current divide have a growing lack of respect for democracy.
On the one hand, you have Team Corbyn, who believe that following the democratic consensus on anything at all, rather than your own belief, makes you a sell-out and a ‘weather vane'. The general public believe the current system of benefits is too generous to those who do not wish to work. Instead of accepting this basic premise, and coming at it with a Labour solution and Labour spin, they reject it outright. To tackle the problem as I suggested, is now known as ‘trying to out-Tory the Tories'. The same is true of immigration. The majority of the electorate believe that immigration has been too high in the recent past. Instead of accepting the general principle, and thinking how we can slowly shift the opinion towards a more left wing attitude through a compromise and left wing solutions to the problem, we must insist that there are not problems with immigration, and to say otherwise is ‘to out-UKIP UKIP'.
On the other hand, you have Team Smith. Owen Smith has said that we need to have a second referendum on whether to accept the final deal on brexit or to remain in the EU. The fundamental idea is that the largest democratic mandate that was ever given in UK history did not give ‘an opinion with which I disagree', it gave ‘the wrong opinion'.
Now, you may think, ‘wait a second, are you saying we should just take the average opinion on every issue and run with it? That's just populism, not politics”. I am not advocating this. The difference between populism and my opinion, and what I see other people doing is respect for the democratic opinion. If the public says ‘we think X on immigration', your starting point must not be that they only think this because they are morons who just believe that because the corrupt Mainstream Media (who we all know are both simultaneously filled entirely with lefty PC types who hate the right and have a right wing bias against anyone left-wing) told them so, and the real problem is that they aren't an enlightened visionary like you, who is immune to such media spin.
I have repeatedly read articles and comments complaining that the public just didn't understand the EU vote and so we shouldn't listen to it. In fact, some of the more honest people will write that the public was always going to be too stupid to vote on such issues, so we shouldn't have had the vote. Others will point to a poll that said that the general public thinks that immigrants make up 20% of the population, but it's really 10% (both figures invented), and therefore anyone who has any problem with immigration must be ignorant and their complaints can be swept under the rug.
As I see it, there are two approaches to the public when they disagree with you: the first is to accept that people may have come to that decision because they have experienced things you haven't, and maybe they're not an idiot. You can treat them with respect and try and come to a compromise, or make an honest attempt to convert them to your opinion. The other is to treat their opinion as one of bad faith.
It reminds me of a psychology talk I once attended. The speaker pointed out that when we first meet someone with a different opinion, we assume that they haven't got access to the information we have. No reasonable person who knew what we knew could disagree with us. If we find out that they, in fact, do have access to the same information, the second assumption is of their stupidity. The only way someone with access to the same information as you could come to a different conclusion is surely if they're just too thick to process the information. Finally, when we realise that our ‘opponent' is both well informed and intelligent, we go to option three: they're a bad person.
Unfortunately, this seems to be the exact process that too many remain voters have towards leave voters. I voted remain, but I appreciated many of the leave arguments. That's my bias announced. My experience is only anecdotal, but in conversations with friends and family, with people on the doorstep as I canvassed, and with people online, never, not once, did I hear a leave voter say “there are literally no reasons to remain”, yet I heard the opposite argument more often that I can count. Oh, this person wants to curb immigration? Oh, they mustn't be informed, I'll just tell them some stats. Hmmm, they're still in favour of it, maybe they're thick. Nope, they're actually quite articulate in their opinions. Racist it is then.
There is too often this flat-out refusal on the behalf of many people from all along the political spectrum on all issues to accept that a smart, informed, and well-meaning person can come to a different opinion, and that you should respect it.
Now perhaps you genuinely think that it simply is the truth that people are uninformed on economics, immigration, benefits, etc, and that the general public will never be informed enough to make decisions on them. However, there is really no difference between the EU referendum and a GE on this matter, as I see it. Those who argue that the public shouldn't have been given a say on the EU, like Richard Dawkins did publicly, should be fully honest that they don't believe in democracy for GEs either. Let's be honest, in 2010, the argument largely boiled down to “the economy crashed because Labour spent too much” vs “no it didn't”. The public was arguably much less informed as to the causes of the crash than they were about the EU. If democracy isn't a good method for decisions regarding the EU, it shouldn't be a good method for deciding public economic policy.
So I would ask that people diverge from this faux-position of simultaneously saying that they believe in democracy but that the public are idiots and you shouldn't take them seriously. Either treat people with differing beliefs with respect, or honestly admit that you do not believe that democracy is the best system.
Some might argue that democracy can be awful and still be the least awful system there is, but I would argue that democracy only seems so terrible because they don't see the wisdom in other people's opinions, and refuse to treat their opponents with respect. If people can learn to respect that other people's opinions might be well formed, they will find themselves angry at democracy a lot less frequently, and simultaneously find that they are suddenly convincing people of their own opinions much more effectively.

With peak submission season for machine learning conferences just behind us, many in our community have peer-reviewed on the mind. One especially hot topic is the arXiv preprint service. Computer scientists often post papers to arXiv in advance of formal publication to share their ideas and hasten their impact.
Despite the arXiv's popularity, many authors are peeved, pricked, piqued, and provoked by requests from reviewers that they cite papers which are only published on the arXiv preprint.
“Do I really have to cite arXiv papers?”, they whine.
“Come on, they're not even published!,” they exclaim.
The conversation is especially testy owing to the increased use (read misuse) of the arXiv by naifs. The preprint, like the conferences proper is awash in low-quality papers submitted by band-wagoners. Now that the tooling for deep learning has become so strong, it's especially easy to clone a repo, run it on a new dataset, molest a few hyper-parameters, and start writing up a draft.
Of particular worry is the practice of flag-planting. That's when researchers anticipate that an area will get hot. To avoid getting scooped / to be the first scoopers, authors might hastily throw an unfinished work on the arXiv to stake their territory: we were the first to work on X. All that follow must cite us. In a sublimely cantankerous rant on Medium, NLP/ML researcher Yoav Goldberg blasted the rising use of the (mal)practice.
In particular, they excoriated a paper from the prominent MILA research group which purported to have adapted the methods of generative adversarial networks to language. Their gripe was that the language generation was laughable and actually far worse than any current technique. The authors, they surmised (and many I've spoken with agree), were staking their territory so that regardless of who first succeeds, they would need to be cited as the originators of the idea.
Amid this tumult, some have questioned the very enterprise of citing preprinted articles. So, if the arXiv may be subject to abuse, do I have to cite papers that have only appeared on the arXiv?
Yes, of course. Any time that our work follows, copies, or borrows ideas from other people, and when we can reasonably be expected to be aware of this, we ought to cite the related work.
A large number of seminal works have never been published. The greatest mathematics paper of our lifetimes remains unpublished. Not every paper on the arXiv warrants a bibliographic entry, but many do. The idea that unpublished status would categorically exclude the responsibility of citation is a bit preposterous. It puts far too much faith in the deeply flawed fraternity of conference organizers and the overworked cohort of peer reviewers, roughly 30% of whom typically fail to even comprehend the basic outline of the paper.
If similar work comes to our attention during a proper literature review, we ought to cite it. If we knowingly build on someone else's work we should cite it. If someone shares a non-obvious idea with us that develops into a paper, we should find some way to credit them. If someone writes a theory down on a napkin shortly before dying and it turns out to open a new subfield of machine learning to scientific inquiry, we should convert the napkin to a pdf, upload it to arXiv, and then cite it.
We should not have to cite nonsense. Many reviewers are abusing the system and asking for ridiculous comparison to recently-posted preprint papers. Bald-faced flag-planting should not be rewarded. And we should not be faulted by reviewers for failing to compare against 2-week old algorithms that may or may not work. But the very idea that arXiv papers would in general not need to be cited puts far too much faith in the fraught process of scientific publication and far too little importance on ideas themselves.

Hot on the heels of the excellent Goya/Wounded Giant split comes another slab of music which proves that this format is fast becoming a favourite of the underground and also one that allows a certain amount of artistic freedom as well as providing a great starting point for someone interested in the genre. This time it is Keeper and Sea Bastard providing the requisite thrills and you better be ready for an intense ride as this highlights the more crushing side of doom. These two songs will grind you down and exhaust you with their sheer colossal weight.
California sludge-merchants Keeper invite us into their world with the bone crushing ‘777', a track which, over the duration of 14 minutes repeatedly pours on the depression, but in a way that is strangely invigorating. Having come on to the scene in early 2014, their first demo release MMXIV showed a band unwilling to compromise. ‘777' continues in that vein, but with much more style and substance. Production values lift this above demo level and demonstrate a band who are starting to find their feet.
With a hefty dose of black metal style vocals, none of the ideology behind this genre is intact and instead we get something akin to Electric Wizard being put through the grinder as EyeHateGod watch on reproachfully. This is a track which elevates Keeper up into the pantheon of doom bands that are unwilling to compromise and are all the better for it. Let's hope that they continue in this vein.
Brighton's Sea Bastard in the meantime need no necessary introduction. Here is a band who have evolved from the more death metal orientated roots through to the tremendous Scabrous album, which introduced a more long form approach to doom. They continue in this vein with the excellent ‘Astral Rebirth', which veers closer to funeral doom than they have gone before and as such is the heaviest thing they have released to date.
It's impressive to see how Sea Bastard have evolved over their short period of existence and on the basis of this we can expect much more from them in the future. A dark, forbidding and crunchy sound, Sea Bastard take no prisoners with their sludge sound and may hold the mantle for being one of the heaviest bands around at the moment.
You'd be a fool to miss out on this split as it shows a genre of music which is unstoppable at the moment and also provides glimpses of what we can expect in the future. Their is no happiness here, just pure desolation and grind, but that's how we like our doom to roll and in Keeper and Sea Bastard we have two bands unafraid to approach the future on their own terms. Another great split to start the new year off.

Sessions questioned the validity of the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion during their Senate confirmation hearing, which stated that the 1961 Wire Act only applied to sports betting.
Sessions told lawmakers they were “shocked” by what they called the “unusual” memo and pledged to take a look at it as attorney general.

“I would revisit it or make a decision about it based on careful study,” they said during their confirmation hearing.
Lawmakers are ramping up pressure on Sessions in hopes the department will reverse the 2011 opinion, which has opened the door to legalized online gambling in various states.
“The OLC opinion appears to be based on legal interpretation alone and does not provide background on the extent to which consideration was given to social, economic and law enforcement implications,” Warner wrote.

For all the stories about your elected officials taking bribes, scoring free World Series tickets and getting convicted for assaulting a photographer, here's a tale of a lame-duck lawmaker who waited in line, with the masses, for an hour to get an autograph.
Recall the minor dustup in June when state Sen. Craig Johnson (D-Port Washington) replied to a Tweet from ESPN.com columnist Bill Simmons's suggestion of who would make the worst theoretical sex tape combo. Johnson proposed Susan Boyle and Abe Vigoda. Their GOP opponent, Mineola Mayor Jack Martins, pounced on Johnson for the comment in a longwinded huff-and-puff of a press release.
Simmons artfully responded to the situation by calling Johnson "my new favorite senator." Johnson, whose defeat to Martins was certified Saturday, probably now wishes Simmons campaigned with them at a couple of LIRR stops.
Anyway, Simmons was at the Madison Square Garden Borders bookstore Tuesday night to sign copies of the newly-released paperback version of their bestseller, The Book of Basketball. Johnson came down after the day's OTB-killing session in Albany and waited in line, for an hour, to get their copy signed.
"When I introduced myself to him, they totally remembered the sex tape tweet and then said they were impressed that I waited in line for over hour to meet him," Johnson told us. "I think they thought that I would have somehow told folks at Borders that I was a senator to get moved up in line. Thus the thanks for waiting in line comment."

SAN BRUNO, CA - FEBRUARY 28: A statue of the racehorse Seabuiscut is displayed in front of a Barnes and Noble bookstore on February 28, 2013 in San Bruno, California. Bookseller Barnes & Noble reported a weak quarter and a 26 percent drop in sales of its Nook e-reader to post a 8.8 percent decline in revenue and a net loss of $6.1 million, or 18 cents a share, compared to a profit of $52 million, or 71 cents a share one year ago. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
(Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc said on Friday it would give away a free Nook Simple Touch e-reader to any customer who buys its high-definition Nook HD+ tablet next week, a sign it may still be grappling with excess inventory of the unpopular e-reader.
The top U.S. bookstore chain last month reported poor holiday quarter results for its Nook business. Overall revenue fell 26 percent as it sold fewer devices, losing ground to products like Apple Inc's iPad and Amazon.com Inc's Kindle, and the Nook business' loss doubled.
The offer is available from March 24 to March 30.
The Simple Touch e-reader, while well reviewed, failed to catch on with customers since its launch in 2011, as digital bookbuyers have migrated toward tablets, which now offer better reading functions. Returns of unsold Simple Touch devices have repeatedly pinched Barnes & Noble's results.
Last year, Barnes & Noble carved out Nook and its college bookstore business into a new unit called Nook Media. That has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp and Pearson LLC, but Barnes & Noble still owns 78 percent.
Barnes & Noble shares fell 2 percent to $16.54 in mid-afternoon trading.
Alphabet's Project Loon has officially deployed its LTE balloons to Puerto Rico, the team announced this afternoon. In a blog penned by Project Loon head Alastair Westgarth, the company says it's working with the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Authority, FEMA, and other cellular spectrum and aviation authorities to bring connectivity to parts of the island still suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Loon's official LTE partner for the initiative is AT&T, which is helping Loon use its fleet of stratospheric helium balloons to bring functions like text messaging and minor web browsing access to Puerto Rico residents who have LTE-equipped smartphones.
“We've never deployed Project Loon connectivity from scratch at such a rapid pace, and we're grateful for the support of AT&T and the many other partners and organizations that have made this possible,” Westgarth writes. “Thanks to the Pan-American and Puerto Rican governments' aviation authorities and air traffic controllers, who enabled us to send small teams of balloons from our launch site in Nevada to Puerto Rico. Thanks also to SES Networks and Liberty Cablevision who helped quickly set up essential ground infrastructure so that the balloons could get internet connectivity.”
Loon's balloons have been used in a number of regions across the globe since 2013, including one other high-profile disaster relief effort in Peru after the country was struck with massive rains and extreme flooding back in May of last year. Yet the effort in Puerto Rico marks the fastest deployment, and its aimed at helping nearly 3.5 million residents of the island regain connectivity. As of early October, when the FCC first gave Loon the green light to operate in Puerto Rico, nearly 83 percent of cell towers were still down.
June 27th marks the anniversary of the 1844 assassinations of Joseph Smith Jr., the Mormon founding prophet, and their brother Hyrum Smith at the Carthage Jail in Hancock County, Illinois. It is usually a day of remembrance for those claiming the legacy of Smith and the religious group they founded. The murders occurred late in the afternoon of the 27th, when conspirators engineered an attack on the jail. Although they killed only the Smith brothers, Mormon Apostle John Taylor was also seriously wounded while Willard Richards survived essentially unscathed.
This event set in motion a series of tumultuous changes, leading to the succession of Brigham Young as the head of the majority group of Mormons. He, of course, led them to Utah where they became a powerful force religiously, economically, and politically. Other groups also emerged; there occurred a splintering of the church as constituted in the era of Joseph Smith into at least ten identifiable groups. The fights were over theology and doctrine, polity and personality, pettiness and provocation. My own religious home among this panoply of groups, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (which changed its name to Community of Christ in 2000), coalesced around the leadership of the prophet's son, Joseph Smith III, a bit later.
How the Smiths came to be in the Carthage Jail, for me, is the most interesting part of the story. Perhap the greatest mistake of Joseph Smith Jr.'s, life—certainly it was the most costly—was the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper, published by Mormon dissidents in June 1844. They exposed Smith as an authoritarian leader who controlled everything in Nauvoo. They challenged their leadership, their practices—especially plural marriage—and their militarism. Smith pushed the Nauvoo city council to declare this newspaper a “nuisance” and ordered it destroyed.
In another time, in another circumstance, Smith might have gotten away with the destruction of the Expositor. Not this time. The dissenters Smith sought to destroy this time had been a part of Mormonism's middle class, persons who had known both power and influence—especially William Law, a successful business person and a counselor to Joseph Smith in the First Presidency for a time in the early 1840s—who immediately filed charges for Smith's arrest. They were ensconced in the Carthage Jail, along with brother Hyrum and other lieutenants, on the afternoon of the 27th when armed conspirators assassinated the Smith brothers.
A murder conspiracy developed only on the afternoon of the 27th as men called together by the local militia leadership near Carthage were dismissed without any official mission. As they returned to Carthage, they gradually dwindled to no more than 75, but some began to assert that since they were gathered together that they should, according to John Hay, who grew up in the area, “finish the matter totally. The unavowed design of the leaders communicated itself magnetically to the men, until the entire company became fused into one mass of bloodthirsty energy.” George Rockwell placed the best possible light on the conspiracy by telling their father soon after the event that those involved were “unwilling to be trifled with any longer, [and] they determined to take the matter into their own hands, and execute justice before they [the Smith brothers] should succeed in making their escape.”
Thomas Halman was present in Carthage at the time of the mobbing. A little more than a month after the murders they wrote to a friend, George Weston, about the episode. Their account provides an interesting perspective on the conspiracy: “About four o'clock on the 27th of June the jail was surrounded by a mob disguised, who demanded the prisoners. The guard told them to desist—fired and wounded some, but before they had time to do more, they were being held down by the mob (taking good care not to hurt them) whilst others of the mob were making quick but thorough work of the object they had in view. They reached upstairs, Hyrum closed the door upon them and received their death wounds thro the door. Jo fired upon them, from some unknown cause raised the window on the cast and jumped from it. But received a number of balls before they reached the ground. They both expired immediately!”
William R. Hamilton was one of the youngest members of the militia at the time of the Smiths' murders in 1844. Later a judge in the county, they were the son of Artois Hamilton, who owned the hotel in Carthage. Hamilton described their experiences of the murders in a letter to Foster Walker, a resident of Pontoosac, in Hancock County. Hamilton noted that the mob approached the jail from the north, streaming on either side to completely surround the building. “The guards were quietly sitting in front and in the hall below,” they commented, “all of whom were captured without much trouble or danger. Just a little suspicion might be attached to the officer in command. Yet it might be presumed they thought their only duty was to keep the Smiths from coming downstairs.”
Hamilton wrote that they sprinted to the site of the murders ahead of their company. “When about fifty yards away I saw Joseph Smith come to the window and fall out.” Then they added:
One of the men went to them and partially straightened their body out beside the well curb. Just at this time I got up amongst the men and heard them say, “he's dead,” when all the mob immediately left. I went to where Smith was lying and found that they were dead without doubt. I then went up to the room where they had been quartered, where I found Hyram Smith lying upon the floor on their back, dead. No person was in the room, or came while I was there. They were stretched out on the floor, just as they had fallen after being shot. The shot that killed them was fired through the door panel by one of the mob, while in the hall, and struck them in the left breast; they're falling backward. There were in the room at that time four persons the two Smiths and Elders Taylor and Richards. Taylor was wounded, being hit several times—all flesh wounds—and was the same night taken to Nauvoo. Richards was not hurt and immediately after the mob left the hall, carried Taylor into the cell department of the jail, which was done just before I went upstairs.
Hamilton also described how the Mormons had tried to secure the door when the mob came upstairs and how Smith had fired an old English pepper-box revolver through the doorway. They then commented that “After I had satisfied my curiosity, seen and been among the mob, seen the prophet shot, and seen the dead men, it occurred to me I ought to go home and tell the news. When about 200 yards from the jail I met the company coming ready for business. Nothing was to be done but to “about face,” return to camp and be disbanded; which was promptly done in good order, as their prisoners were dead and not likely to run away.”
As soon as the murders were done the mob disappeared. John Hay remarked of this: “They went home at a killing pace over the wide dusty prairie. Warsaw is eighteen miles from Carthage; the Smiths were killed at half-past five; at a quarter before eight the returning crowd began to drag their weary limbs through the main street of Warsaw,—at such an astounding rate of speed had the lash of their own thoughts driven them.”
They were concerned that the Nauvoo Legion would march but it did not. While the women and children were ferried across the river to Missouri, the “men kept guard night and day in the hazel thickets around the town.” But nothing happened. The Mormon leaders called for patience and mourning but not revenge. They sent a delegation to Carthage to retrieve their dead. The bodies of Joseph and Hyrum Smith were returned to Nauvoo the next day and buried on June 29.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- How can the Cleveland Browns play a "home game" in London next season when they have a city lease that makes FirstEnergy Stadium their home?
The possibility for such a move was envisioned as far back as the mid-1990s, when the city and the NFL were working out a deal for the return of the Browns to a stadium yet to be built.
An agreement dated April 26, 1996 -- just after the original franchise left for Baltimore and three years ahead of the Browns' return -- stipulated that the Browns would play half their regular season games in the new stadium.
One caveat, however, was included: one game could be played elsewhere every two years.
The Browns' game in London, scheduled for Week 7 or 8 next seasons against the Minnesota Vikings, will mark the first time the clause has been used.
Next season's NFL schedule of four games in London will bring to 27 the number of teams to play an international game since 2007. All 32 NFL teams eventually will be assigned an international game.
The Browns played an exhibition game in London in 1989, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, 17-13. The Browns also played exhibition games in Montreal in 1988 (losing to the New York Jets) and Toronto in 1993 (beating the New England Patriots).
Peter John-Baptiste, vice president of communications for the Browns, said the franchise wants to support the league's initiative to showcase the NFL overseas, yet being compelled to play in London does not come without concern.
"You're concerned because you want to give your home fans the opportunity to see their team as much as possible," John-Baptiste said.
There will be an impact on Cleveland and local fans, though it is difficult to quantify.
The city collects an 8 percent admissions tax. The tax generated $14.8 million last year citywide, according to budget documents. However, the amount for any one venue, or game, is not specified. The actual cost of all Browns tickets sold was not available.
Some season ticket holders view paying for two exhibition games as an unwanted requirement to secure their seats for eight regular season games. Now, they will receive tickets to just seven games that count in the standings. But the Browns said the average price of tickets will be the same next year for season ticket members, and the total bill will be less with just nine games in all.
Studies on the impact of sports teams often are fuzzy. In 2007, the region's tourism organization attempted to come up with a specific number for Browns games. Its report said actual spending by fans averaged $6.3 million per home game for tickets, souvenirs, food, and beverages at games, and, for tourists, lodging, transportation and other meals.
Numerous bars, restaurants and parking lots in downtown Cleveland receive extra business on game days.
Tax dollars were used to build the stadium.
"Every time there is an event downtown, it generates income for the city," Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley said in an interview Wednesday. "So I will be curious to see a cost estimate for what revenue would be lost on account of the decision to play a game overseas."

The paradox of hedonism, also called the pleasure paradox, refers to the practical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of pleasure. Unfortunately for the hedonist, constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or happiness in the long run—or even in the short run, when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.
The utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick was first to note in The Methods of Ethics that the paradox of hedonism is that pleasure cannot be acquired directly.[1] Variations on this theme appear in the realms of ethics, philosophy, psychology, and economics.
Overview [ edit ]
It is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:
John Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in their autobiography:
But I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.[2]
Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.
The more a man tries to demonstrate their sexual potency or a woman their ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.[3]
What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.
What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.
What is happiness? The feeling that power increases—that a resistance is overcome.[4]
[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)[5]
Psychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):
Nietzsche's "will to power" and "will to seem" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of Féré and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.[6]
Poet and satirist Edward Young:
The love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,
Reigns more or less supreme in every heart;
The Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;
The modest shun it, but to make it sure![7]
Politician William Bennett:
Happiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.[8][9]
Novelist João Guimarães Rosa:
Happiness is found only in little moments of inattention.[10]
Example [ edit ]
Suppose Paul likes to collect stamps. According to most models of behavior, including not only utilitarianism, but most economic, psychological and social conceptions of behavior, it is believed that Paul collects stamps because they get pleasure from it. Stamp collecting is an avenue towards acquiring pleasure. However, if you tell Paul this, they will likely disagree. They do get pleasure from collecting stamps, but this is not the process that explains why they collect stamps. It is not as if they said, "I must collect stamps so I, Paul, can obtain pleasure". Collecting stamps is not just a means toward pleasure. They simply like collecting stamps, therefore (indirectly) acquiring pleasure.
This paradox is often reversed to illustrate that pleasure and happiness cannot be reverse-engineered. If for example you heard that collecting stamps was very pleasurable, and began a stamp collection as a means towards this happiness, it would inevitably be in vain. To achieve happiness, you must not seek happiness directly, you must strangely motivate yourself towards things unrelated to happiness, like the collection of stamps.[1]
Suggested explanations [ edit ]
Happiness is often imprecisely equated with pleasure. If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. When one aims solely towards pleasure itself, one's aim is frustrated. Henry Sidgwick comments on such frustration after a discussion of self-love in the above-mentioned work:
I should not, however, infer from this that the pursuit of pleasure is necessarily self-defeating and futile; but merely that the principle of Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human nature, is practically self-limiting; i.e., that a rational method of attaining the end at which it aims requires that we should to some extent put it out of sight and not directly aim at it.[11]
While not addressing the paradox directly, Aristotle commented on the futility of pursuing pleasure. Human beings are actors whose endeavors bring about consequences, and among This is pleasure. Aristotle then argues as follows:
How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we grow weary? Certainly all human things are incapable of continuous activity. Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies activity.[12]
Sooner or later, finite beings will be unable to acquire and expend the resources necessary to maintain their sole goal of pleasure; thus, they find themselves in the company of misery. Evolutionary theory explains that humans evolved through natural selection and follow genetic imperatives that seek to maximize reproduction,[13] not happiness. As a result of these selection pressures, the extent of human happiness is limited biologically. David Pearce argues in their treatise The Hedonistic Imperative makes the point that humans might be able to use genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and neuroscience to eliminate suffering in all human life and allow for peak levels of happiness and pleasure that are currently unimaginable.

Reuters/Dan Kitwood The ocean is deep. In fact, most of it is deep.
Officially anything deeper than just 200 meters is considered the "deep sea", but the average depth of the entire ocean is about 3.5km and the deepest point - the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, in the western Pacific - is a little short of 11km down.
That means that most of the living space on Earth is in the deep sea.
We scientists like to categorize things and the ocean depths are no exception.
Depths from the surface to 0.2km is known as the "littoral zone", from 0.2km to 3km, the "bathyal zone", and from 3km to 6km, the "abyssal zone".
Anything deeper than that is the "hadal zone".
The hadal zone is largely comprised of deep trenches caused by tectonic plate subduction that drive the vast abyssal plains steeply down to depths of 11,000 meters in places.
But even here, animals thrive, blissfully unaware of how little attention they receive. Here's an insight into their incredible world.
1. The kingdom of Hades
The term "hadal" comes from "Hades," which refers both to the Greek kingdom of the Underworld and the god of the Underworld himself, Hades (brother of Zeus and Poseidon). The term can also mean the "abode of the dead".
In modern times, Hades is seen as evil, but in mythology they were often portrayed as unreasonably "stringent" rather than actively malicious. Interestingly, they strictly prohibited the inhabitants of their dominion to leave, which is a rather apt analogy for hadal fauna, as these species are often confined to trenches and are rarely capable of going elsewhere.

2. Exactly how deep is the ocean?
The extreme depths of the hadal trenches were discovered using "bomb sounding", whereby someone threw a half-pound block of TNT off a ship and the echo was recorded on board the ship. This method was used to sound the depths of many trenches, but the exact depth of the deepest point, currently in the Mariana Trench, is still difficult to compute. Four other trenches, all in the Western Pacific, also exceed 10km: the Tonga, Kuril-Kamchatka, Philippine, and Kermadec trenches.
3. Who has explored it?
The HMS Challenger expedition (1873 to 1876) was the first to sample hadal depths - having collected sediment from about 8km - although it could not confirm whether or not the sediment was merely the remnants of shallower animals. The 1901 Princess Alice expedition successfully trawled specimens from over 6km. However, it was a 1948 Swedish expedition, which successfully trawled a variety of species from 7km to 8km in the Puerto Rico Trench, that finally proved that life existed at depths greater than 6km. In 1956, the first photographs of the hadal zone were taken by none other than Jacques Cousteau in the Romanche Trough in the Atlantic.
4. How big is the hadal zone?
NOAA The hadal zone comprises a series of disjointed trenches and other deep spots. There are 33 trenches and 13 troughs around the world - 46 individual hadal habitats in total. The mean depth of the trenches is 8.216km. The total area of the hadal zone is less than 0.2% of the entire seafloor but accounts for 45% of the total depth range. It is therefore surprising that the deepest 45% of the sea is rarely mentioned in deep sea literature.
Of the 33 hadal trenches, 26 (84%) are located in the Pacific, three are found in the Atlantic (8%), two (4%) in the Indian Ocean, and two (4%) in the Southern Ocean. The majority run up the western Pacific. Most of the hadal trenches in their modern form are believed to have formed 65.5m years ago during the Cenozoic period.
5. The secret behind our existence
Earth appears to be the only terrestrial planet with subduction zones and plate tectonics. Both Mercury and the Earth's moon are tectonically dead. Mars appears to have tectonically ceased, and Venus is dominated by thick lithosphere with mantle plumes. On Earth, subduction zones produce continental crust, which can protrude from the ocean (the continents). It has been speculated that without subduction, the land would still be underwater and terrestrial life, including humans, would never have evolved.
6. What's it like down there?
Bottom water temperatures are cold and vary between 1°C and 4°C. However, hydrostatic pressure increases linearly by 1 atmosphere (atm) for every ten meters of depth. The pressure at hadal depths therefore ranges from 600 to 1,100 atmospheres. The pressure at the deepest point is, therefore, equal to a one tonne weight being placed on the end of your finger.

7. What lives there?
Many marine organisms are found at hadal depths and the most common groups are the polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods, amphipods and holothurians. All of these groups are found at full-ocean depth and often in large aggregations. Contrary to popular media, the hadal zone is not a mysterious realm inhabited by aliens or "monsters of the deep". Instead, it is a poorly understood region largely inhabited by hoppers, snails, worms, and sea cucumbers. In fact, the upper trenches are inhabited by little pink fish and bright red prawns.
8. But there are some horrors …
In the 1970s, the Puerto Rico Trench was a pharmaceutical waste disposal site. The figures are astonishing: in just five years, more than 387,000 tons of waste material was discarded in the trench, an amount equivalent to 880 Boeing 747s. In addition, the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission to the moon in 1970 carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) that was supposed to remain on the moon with the lunar lander. The RTG contained 3.9kg of plutonium-238, and in the end was jettisoned over the south-west Pacific, where it reportedly survived re-entry and settled in the Tonga Trench at a depth of 6km to 9km where it should now remain radioactive for several thousand years.
9. Time-shifting earthquakes
The 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake off Japan was caused by a fault rupture in the Japan Trench. The event and subsequent tsunami left about 20,000 dead or missing and affected more than 35 coastal cities. The quake was followed by 666 aftershocks that exceeded magnitude 5.0. The energy involved in high-magnitude earthquakes originating in trenches is immense. The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in the Java Trench caused a sufficiently massive release of energy to alter the Earth's rotation, shortening the day by 2.68 microseconds. Similarly, the Tōhoku-Oki earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by between 10cm and 25cm, shortening the day by another 1.8 microseconds.
10. How deep is deep?
One of the most common analogies used in trench science is "Mount Everest would fit into the Mariana Trench with a mile or so to spare". This is true, and from an evolution and physiology perspective it is immense. Likewise, exploring these extreme depths is highly problematic.

But how far is 11km really? The Mississippi River is 11km at its widest point, Manhattan Island is twice as long as the Mariana Trench is deep, and assuming the average running speed of Mo Farah at the 2012 Olympics, they could run 11km in 30 minutes. Given how easily we can affect our planet over far larger distances, our effective proximity to these "extreme" locations means even the deepest places on Earth are no longer pristine - and remain hugely vulnerable.

Refreshed Ivy-E boards go head to head
Intel's ultra-high-end desktop platform got a shot in the arm from Ivy Bridge-E in September. This refresh delivered updated CPU cores, but it didn't bring any changes to the two-year-old LGA2011 platform. Intel didn't update the accompanying X79 Express chipset, which is why we didn't see a wave of new motherboards rolled out with Ivy-E. Asus' X79-Deluxe was the only fresh face at the time, and neither Gigabyte nor MSI has released anything since.
Part of Ivy-E's appeal is the fact that the chip is a drop-in replacement for its Sandy Bridge-based predecessor. Existing X79 boards should require no more than a firmware update to work with the latest processors. Gigabyte and MSI both have newish X79 models that we haven't tested, so we decided to have a little throwdown to see how they compare. In the black and grey trunks, we have the $220 Gigabyte X79-UP4. And, uh, also in black and grey trunks, we have the $250 MSI X79A-GD45 Plus.
These boards have been in the lab for a while now, and I still have trouble telling them apart at a glance. Closer inspection reveals plenty of differences, though.
Gigabyte's X79-UP4
We begin with Gigabyte's X79-UP4, which delivers a lot more extras than one might expect from an affordable X79 model.
The UP4 wears its black-and-grey aesthetic well. The circuit board's matte surface is especially sinister, and I really like the look of the heatsinks. At the very least, the monochrome motif shouldn't clash with other system components.
Zooming in on the socket gives us a better angle on the seven-phase power circuitry feeding the CPU. Each phase is powered by fancy electrical components from International Rectifier. The board has ferrite-core chokes and extra-beefy copper layers, too. We'd expect nothing less from an enthusiast-oriented motherboard.
As you can see, the socket area is a little crowded. The VRM heatsink and top PCIe x16 slot encroach from the north and south, respectively, while dual banks of DDR3 memory slots flank from the east and west. We can't check clearances for every hardware combination, but we can convey a few key measurements.
Like on most modern motherboards, the DIMM slots come closest to the socket. Beware of combining taller memory modules with oversized air coolers. Watch out for the PCIe slot, too; it's all up in the socket's business. At least the VRM cooler is short enough to stay out of the way.
The socket area is crowded in part because the board's ATX footprint has limited room for eight DIMM slots. (There are two slots for each of the processor's quad memory channels.) Gigabyte's decision to add a seventh expansion slot—one more than on the MSI board—also results in tighter clearances around the socket.
All four of the x16 slots get PCI Express 3.0 connectivity directly from the CPU. The first and last slots have x16 and x8 links, respectively. The middle two share an x16 link that can be split evenly between them or devoted solely to the third slot. Props to Gigabyte for putting enough space between the full-fat x16 slots to provide breathing room for dual-card configs. I'm even more impressed that the X79-UP4 can host four double-wide graphics cards, each one connected to the CPU. This board is officially approved for quad CrossFire and SLI configurations.
The rest of the PCIe slots stem from the X79 platform hub. Although the chip is limited to Gen2 connectivity, the older spec should provide sufficient bandwidth for the x1 slots and auxiliary peripheral controllers.
The X79's own peripheral payload is relatively weak. There's no built-in USB 3.0 connectivity, and 6Gbps SATA support is restricted to two of the six ports. Gigabyte provides some relief with a collection of Marvell controllers that adds four internal 6Gbps ports and two external ones. A pair of Fresco Logic controllers handles USB 3.0, providing two ports at the rear plus an internal header for two more.
Four USB 3.0 ports doesn't sound like a lot in the context of modern Haswell boards, but it's enough to handle more high-speed peripherals than most folks need to run simultaneously. The X79-UP4 is loaded with USB 2.0 ports for older devices with lower bandwidth requirements. It even sports a combo PS/2 port for the old-school clicky keyboard crowd.
Gigabyte earns two gold stars for populating the cluster with both common connector types for digital S/PDIF audio output. Bypassing the onboard DAC is the best way to get good sound out of integrated motherboard audio. Unfortunately, digital audio output is limited to stereo playback and surround-sound content with pre-encoded tracks. Music and movies should work great, but multi-channel game audio can't be encoded in real time. The drivers for the Realtek audio codec at least offer some virtual surround mojo that fakes multi-channel output for stereo devices.
The cushioned I/O shield pictured above is pretty awesome—there are no tiny slivers of metal to slice your fingers or get caught up in the ports. Little touches like this can make the building process much easier. Too bad Gigabyte made the front-panel connectors unnecessarily difficult to use.
The front-panel pins are nicely walled off, but there's no external block to simplify the wiring process. Each connector must be attached individually, which can be difficult to do inside a fully-loaded system. MSI and others employ an elegant solution that adds just pennies to the cost of the motherboard. Speaking of which, let's see what MSI's X79A-GD45 Plus has in store...
Use of pornography by political and religious conservatives is intriguing because most are so strongly opposed to it. Recent research concludes that Christian college students are somewhat less likely to use online pornography than the general college population but still found that the "majority of males had some involvement in Internet pornography".
It is hard for religious people to admit to behavior of which they so strongly disapprove and this introduces unreliability into such self-reported data. A Harvard study provided objective evidence about actual consumption of online pornography by paying customers. This study found a consistent pattern of more conservative, and more religious, states spending more on pornography.
The biggest consumer of Internet pornography was Utah with 5.47 subscriptions per thousand home broadband users compared to Montana the lowest state with 1.92 subscribers per thousand. Study author, Benjamin Edelman of Harvard Business School focused on broadband users because pornography is a bandwidth hog. Edelman was also careful to rule out the age distribution of the population, income, education, population density, marriage rates and other characteristics that might make state comparisons unfair. Utah still wound up at the top of the heap.
Utah's top ranking surprises many. One can think of different adjectives to describe the state, religious, conservative, family-oriented, outdoorsy, clean-living, but few would have guessed top-pornography-consuming. Many would find it easier to attribute such interests to western neighbor Nevada, a center for bricks-and-mortar gambling and prostitution. Nevada didn't even make it to the top ten.
States that banned gay marriage (implying conservative political views) had 11 percent more porn subscribers. The level of agreement in a state with the statement that "Even today miracles are performed by the power of God" predicted higher pornography consumption. States claiming to have old-fashioned values about family and marriage purchased substantially more adult-content subscriptions. Eight of the top ten pornography consumers were red states in the last Presidential election (Utah, Alaska, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, North Dakota, Louisiana, and West Virginia) with blue states, Hawaii (#4) and Florida (#9) bucking the trend.
In addition to the conservative states' avid consumption of Internet pornography, there have been numerous examples of prominent conservative politicians and public figures whose lofty statement of values in sexual matters was cruelly undercut by their own actions: Anthony Wiener, Larry Craig; Newt Gingrich; Mark Foley, Bob Livingston, Henry Hyde, and Bob Packwood, among scores of less recognizable names. It is not just conservative politicians who fail their own moral tests. The parade of prominent evangelical preachers similarly disgraced, including Jim Baker, Jimmy Swaggart, and Ted Haggard is equally striking. Episcopal minister Marshall Brown was recently fired for accessing online pornography at work.
Many words have been used to explain the apparent contradiction between ideals and practices. Hypocrisy is the obvious one. Accessibility is another issue and the illusion of anonymity that the Internet offers. Edelman cites repression, pointing out that if people are told they can't have something they want it more.
Although their findings might appear new and shocking, not much is genuinely new under the sun. Many decades ago, sociologist Laud Humphreys, author of the book Tearoom Trade, wondered what kind of men would stop off in a public restroom for a few minutes of casual sex with other men, on the way home from work. They jotted down their car license numbers and tricked the local motor vehicles department into divulging the men's addresses. Without mentioning the true intent of their study, Humphreys interviewed the men in their homes. Most seemed happily married. Their homes often had the U.S. flag on the wall and a Bible on the mantelpiece.
Humphreys had the impression that their aura of respectability was overdone. They referred to this as the "breastplate of righteousness," or a defense against accusations of sexual impropriety by seeming very righteous.
The bottom line, then, is that however many conservatives trumpet their sexual morality, they are not better than the rest of us. Indeed, the evidence suggests they are slightly worse.
In a move that's prompting questions about the stockpiling of weapons by the federal government's nonmilitary agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation wants to buy 52,000 rounds of ammunition for use in law enforcement at Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.
After learning about the purchase request, Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei vowed to inquire with the bureau about its operations, number of officers carrying firearms and how much ammunition it uses, according Brian Baluta, a spokesperson for Amodei.
Department officials declined to provide specific information to the Sun regarding details of the ammunition purchase request. “We want to limit the amount of information any bad guys might have about our protection capabilities,” said Rose Davis, a Bureau of Reclamation spokesperson.
A review of federal procurement records by the Sun shows that the Bureau of Reclamation, best known for its management of Western waterways and dams, solicited bids in June for 41,600 rounds of hollow-point ammunition along with 10,400 rounds of shotgun ammunition.
The agency declined to say how many armed officers work at Hoover Dam and how many security threats it faces each year, but according to a 2008 review of federal law enforcement, the bureau had 21 officers patrolling Hoover Dam.
The bureau's Boulder City office oversees the agency's operations at Hoover Dam and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, a vacation destination that sees more visitors than Yellowstone National Park every year.
The bureau works in conjunction on Hoover Dam security with the Department of Homeland Security, Metro Police and other law enforcement officials. The bureau's armed officers are “there for the protection of employees, visitors and the dam,” Davis said.
According to Davis, funds for the ammunition are drawn from revenues generated by utility companies that buy electricity from Hoover Dam, rather than from tax dollars.
The department's request is likely to stir debate over the stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by nonmilitary federal agencies. The BLM faced questions last year over its role in an armed standoff with militia members supporting Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's refusal to pay more than a million dollars in back taxes and grazing fees.
Two months later, Amodei was one of 17 GOP members of congress to sponsor a bill that would have prevented certain agencies, like the Bureau of Reclamation, from using or purchasing weapons. That bill failed to pass.
The Bureau of Reclamation is not the only federal agency to have amassed weapons and ammunition — or to have faced controversy. In 2013, the Department of Homeland Security put out a bid to purchase more than 1 billion rounds of ammunition for its more than 100,000 law enforcement officials. That same year, agents from the Environmental Protection Agency inspected the offices of a mining company in Alaska while wearing body armor and carrying M16 rifles and shotguns, leading to an investigation by House lawmakers.
The most recent order is not the first time the Bureau of Reclamation has purchased large quantities of ammunition. Its last requisition was in 2013, according to federal purchasing records. Since 2008, the agency made at least 19 requests for ammunition at offices nationwide.
Hoover Dam's most recent publicized threat was in 2012, when a man drove their truck past a security checkpoint, prompting an hourlong standoff with officials. They were later found to be unarmed.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded $34 million in funding to projects aimed at securing the smart grid.
In total, 12 projects have been accepted as part of the Obama Administration's focus on energy-based infrastructure and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability's Cybersecurity of Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) program.
The DOE says the projects will aim to enhance the "reliability and resilience" of US smart grids through "innovative, scalable, and cost-effective research." The main focus, however, is on security -- and how to keep core infrastructure and electrical grids as safe as possible from outside intrusion.
In 2015, Ukraine's power grid was compromised by malware, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. Over in South Korea, nuclear power plants have become targets for what is likely to be state-sponsored attacks, and Stuxnet -- the 2009 worm which caused Iran nuclear facilities to become out of control highlights the danger digital weapons now possess.
As cyberattacks are now commonplace, country infrastructure and electrical grids may become high-priority targets for attackers -- and it is up to governments and vendors to invest in security now.
According to the DOE (.PDF), there are five main areas of interest through the security projects, listed blow:
The ability to detect and respond to cyberattacks designed to avoid detection.
Ways to integrate of renewables onto the power grid at the generation, transmission and/or distribution levels and make them more secure from cyberattacks.
Reducing exposures of energy delivery systems to cyberattacks, thereby making the systems more secure.
Detecting hostile hardware, firmware, and/or software introduced at some point during the manufacture of energy delivery systems.
Identifying gaps in the Roadmap to Achieve Energy Delivery Systems Cybersecurity and proposing innovative technical solutions to the identified risk.
General Electrics, one of the companies awarded research funding, will develop and create an automatic cyberattack anomaly detection and accommodation (ADA) system for power plants. The DOE wants the system to be able to localize where cyberattacks occur -- but maintain normal operation in both standard and "degraded" conditions.
Intel is also participating in the scheme. The tech giant will develop an architecture solution to "securely connect energy infrastructure devices to the cloud to allow the devices to interact with each other," according to the DOE.
In addition, universities and other companies will be working on projects related to secure domain layer systems, educational programs, secure communications, and data analytics platforms which can detect the manipulation of energy delivery control systems.
The US department has not revealed when the funds will be released or whether there are deadlines for the research projects to be completed.
A man who claims they witnessed a “dry run” by Muslim hijackers on a plane at Atlanta's airport last month told TPMmuckraker this morning they are standing by their story, despite several holes in the tale and the carrier's claim they were not even on the plane.
In an email account of their experience that went national on right-wing blogs last week, Tedd Petruna describes a group of 11 Muslim men “in full attire” who created a disturbance on a Nov. 17 AirTran flight on the runway at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.In Petruna's telling, the men fanned out through the plane, and one of the men called a companion in the back of the plane, “talking in Arabic very loudly and very aggressively.” They ignored a flight attendant's request to put away their phone before takeoff.
Petruna, who works as a diver at a NASA lab in Houston, says two of the Muslim men began “to show footage of a porno they had taped the night before, and were very loud about it.” It's unclear what they mean by “taped the night before,” and how Petruna would know what the men had been doing the previous night. But they describe porn viewing as an activity Muslims would be permitted to engage in only before Jihad. When a flight attendant objected to their use of an electronic device, they were told to “shut up infidel dog!”
It's at this point that Petruna emerges as the self-styled Todd Beamer figure of AirTran Flight 297. They write:
This is where I had had enough! I got up and started to the back where I heard a voice behind me from another Texan twice my size say “I got your back.” I grabbed the man who had been on the phone by the arm and said “you WILL go sit down or you Will be thrown from this plane!” As I “led” them around me to take their seat, the fellow Texan grabbed them by the back of their neck and their waist and headed out with him. I then grabbed the 2nd man and said, “You WILL do the same!”
Three TSA officers and four cops burst into the plane, and the 11 men were escorted away, according to Petrunua. But a little while later, to Petruna's disbelief, the 11 were let back aboard, and the entire crew and Petruna walked off the plane in protest, they say.
But after outlets like WorldNetDaily, a blog at Glenn Beck's Project 9.12 site, and columnist Debbie Schlussel picked up the story and declared Petruna an American hero, a few flaws began to emerge.
Most significantly, AirTran says its flight manifests show Petruna had missed a connection and that they were never actually on board Flight 297.
And according to KHOU in Houston, Petruna admitted to the TV station that “his description of the men's attire was wrong, and [that] they didn't personally see anyone watching porn.” TSA told the station its officers never boarded the plane, and they consider the matter an airline customer service issue.
So what actually happened? All the details aren't known, but it appears that the captain of Flight 297 returned the plane to the gate after a passenger didn't end a cell phone conversation, according to an AP story that ran the day after the flight. AirTran, in a thorough debunking of Petruna's tale, says there were never any threatening behavior, and that no law enforcement was on the plane. Another passenger on the flight told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the man was talking in Spanish, not Arabic, and the episode seemed to be the result of a language barrier.
Reached at the Johnson Space Center's Neutral Buoyancy Lab this morning, Petruna told TPMmuckraker that despite AirTran's assertion, they were on the flight. They wouldn't say much, though, because “I'm in the middle of a lawsuit about this right now.” We're not sure whether a lawsuit has actually been filed or what it would be about, though Petruna told Schlussel, the right-wing columnist, that they were mulling a defamation suit.
“The whole e-mail went out accidentally; it was not supposed to go nationwide,” Petruna told TPMmuckraker. “It was supposed to go out to family and friends, and the next thing I know it's a firestorm.”
Gene Hackemack, one of the friends who have apparently been distributing the email, introduced it with their opinion that “the muslims are all getting very brave now, since they have one of their own in the White House……read Tedd's story below.”
There's one other wrinkle to the story: Petruna sent the e-mail out from an account marked “Petruna, Tedd J. (JSC-DX12)[RAYTHEON TECHNICAL SERVICES COMPANY].” Raytheon partners with NASA on the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, where Petruna is a diver. And Petruna told us they work for Raytheon as well as NASA.
But Raytheon spokesperson Jon Kasle tells TPMmuckraker, “This individual is not a Raytheon employee.” Kasle says he's not sure why Raytheon's name is on Petruna's e-mail account, and declined to comment on whether the company is looking into the matter.
NASA and AirTran did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Late Update: The FAA tells us its probe of the Nov. 17 incident found no violations of safety rules. And AirTran says it hasn't heard of any lawsuit.
Late 12/8/09 Update: Flight 297 passenger says Tedd Petruna is “living in a fantasy world.”
Fugitive Nathan Jacobson, whose ties to the federal Conservatives made them the subject of recent question period queries from opposition benches, was arrested at their home in Toronto Thursday afternoon.
The Winnipeg-born business person had their bail denied in Toronto court Friday and remains in the Toronto West Detention Centre awaiting another appearance Oct. 31.
U.S. Justice authorities in San Diego had told CBC they were upset that no Canadian law enforcement agencies had responded to their July 30 warrant for their arrest when Jacobson failed to attend court after pleading guilty to money laundering.
With others, Jacobson had set up an online pharmacy known as Affpower, based in Costa Rica, that sold drugs to Americans without prescriptions from 2004 to 2006. The 57-year-old was originally charged with several counts of fraud, money laundering and the distribution and dispensing of controlled substances, but they co-operated with authorities and pleaded guilty in 2008 to laundering $46 million in drug payments.
They were expected to serve a four-year sentence, but failed to show up at pre-sentencing.
An international red notice — a warrant issued for a flight risk — was certified this week by a Canadian judge for the sometime philanthropist who made millions selling GM products and setting up gas stations in post-Soviet Russia.
U.S. District Attorney Philip Halpern of San Diego would not comment on the arrest because the matter is before "judicial processes."
Claimed they were friends with Baird, Kenney
Calls by CBC on Friday to their three lawyers, their wife and business partner were not returned.
In recent years, Jacobson had spent much time in the corridors of power, both in Israel and Canada, and in March a smiling Jacobson was photographed between both Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu at a reception in Ottawa. Jacobson claimed to have worked on the 2008 campaign for the Tories and was also considered a friend of cabinet ministers Jason Kenney and John Baird.
But when challenged earlier this year on their relationship to Jacobson, both ministers said they were oblivious to Jacobson's legal problems.
Jacobson themselves had initiated a lawsuit against Conservative MP Mark Adler last fall for what they claim was a $265,000 loan. Adler, in court documents, denies that amount changed hands, and said what was given to them was a gift from Jacobson to expand their Economic Club of Canada to the United States.
Besides donating more than $10,000 to the Conservative Party in recent years, Jacobson was prominent in their philanthropy within the Jewish community.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday defended their criticism of a Hawaii-based federal judge's injunction blocking President Trump's travel ban, saying that they wouldn't have wanted to phrase it any differently.
"I don't know that I said anything I'd want to phrase differently," Sessions said during an appearance on CNN. "No, we're going to defend the president's order. We believe it's constitutional. We believe there's specific statutory authority for everything in that order."
Sessions asserted that the president's executive order barring citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. was completely constitutional and permitted by law.

"I got to tell you it is a point worth making that single sitting district judge out of 600, 700 district judges can issue an order stopping a presidential executive order that I believe is fully constitutional designed to protect the United States of America from terrorist attack."
In an interview with conservative radio host Mark Levin aired Wednesday, Sessions expressed frustration with the Hawaii-based federal judge's order blocking the order.
"I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly their statutory and Constitutional power," Sessions said.
The comment quickly drew backlash, with critics accusing the attorney general of speaking as if Hawaii wasn't a U.S. state or was less important because of its location.

Forget for a moment whether President Donald Trump truly believes the White House to be “a real dump,” as they denied ever saying.
Related Articles Trump reportedly calls White House ‘a dump' to justify their many golf weekends
White House to become less ‘dump'-like in Trump's absence
Trump denies they called White House a ‘dump' This much we know: Work orders for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reveal the building to be, if not dumplike, well … a little bit worn, like so many other old houses around the country.
There are the usual ceiling leaks.
The occasional overflowing toilet.
Chipped paint in need of a touch up or two.
And rodents and bugs, too.
According to the dozens of documents, which were obtained by NBC Washington, mice infiltrations were reported in the White House's Navy mess food service area and Situation Room.

There were at least four reports of cockroaches on the White House grounds, and ants in the chief of staff's office.
The work orders cover much of 2017, including the last few weeks of the Obama presidency. The requests were fielded by the federal Public Buildings Service, which owns, leases and manages some 8,700 government facilities around the country, including various federal agencies and courthouses, in addition to the White House.
The old building — the cornerstone was laid in 1792 — consists of 55,000 square feet of floor area spread out over 132 rooms.
It is not the easiest structure to keep up.
“It's an enormous job. GSA is assigned to manage that job,” Brian Miller, former inspector general of the General Services Administration, which includes the Public Buildings Service, told the NBC affiliate. “GSA hires contractors and subcontractors for the [maintenance] work. Then the agency must watch over the contractors.”
Using the GSA's own figures, NBC Washington estimated that the building costs the agency at least $100,000 to maintain each year.
Miller said the GSA has staff at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House.
“Any of us who have old houses know old houses need a lot of work,” they said.
Earlier this year, the West Wing was the focus of a long-needed renovation that took place during one of Trump's stints at the golf course and property they own in Bedminster, New Jersey.
It was at that same property where, according to Golf magazine, Trump said to fellow golfers that the “White House is a real dump.”
Trump denied making the remark.
The president lashed out at the report, calling it “Fake News” and “TOTALLY UNTRUE.”
“I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen,” they wrote on Twitter in August.
The mansion, built in the neoclassical Federal style, is relatively ancient by American building standards and is unlike the other high-profile homes the president occupied before they were elected.
Trump Tower, their home in Manhattan, is a glimmering tower of glass and steel divided into condos that was built in 1983. The main clubhouse at the Bedminster was built in 1939. Construction on Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club began in the 1920s; the estate was built for heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.
Most of the maintenance issues at the White House would be familiar to anyone who's lived in a home with old features: Creaky doors; dust buildups; busted air conditioners; the occasional tile in need of replacement.
A log on one of the maintenance sheets, which are undated, notes that a door to a West Wing suite used by the National Security Council was getting stuck.
“The end users have had to force the door open on more than one occasion,” the entry notes.
While most of the requests are unnamed — at times attributed only to a “tenant” — the logs note a few made by Sean Spicer, when they were still press secretary.
They requested a safe be removed from their office and a small, “skinny” banquet table be brought in its place.
They asked for a printer and a table.
And they wanted a coin display case to showcase their challenge coins, the ceremonial coins that are kept by some members of the military.
A CNN en Español host compared President Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler in a speech given to the 2016 International Center for Journalists awards dinner.
The Daily Caller recently dug up video of the November speech, which took place a week after Trump's win. Fellow CNN journalists Wolf Blitzer and Clarissa Ward gave largely apolitical speeches, but Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui delivered a fiery denouncement of Trump in Spanish.
“Trump has unleashed the worst hatred and has given force to racism and xenophobia,” they said, according to subtitles provided by the ICFJ. “He has opened the door to the worst demons. That is why the world is so frightened, and why we must use the tools of democracy and human rights to face the time that is approaching.”
“In this time of efforts to hide the truth, of authoritarian backsliding, of intolerance and incitement to hate — in this time of Donald Trump — be careful America,” Aristegui said. When mentioning Trump's name, Aristegui put their fingers above their lip in an imitation of Hitler's iconic mustache, garnering laughter for the crowd.
The Daily Caller also reports that CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker was present at the event. Their reaction to the impassioned speech is unknown, although Hitler mustaches and “Donald Trump” tend to translate universally (and strongly).

Microsoft has been making a massive push to get companies onto its Office 365 productivity service offering, including moving functions it traditionally handled on-premises like Active Directory and email to the cloud. Doing the work required to make that happen can be a real pain, especially for IT departments that already have their hands full.
That's where Microsoft's FastTrack service comes in. It's a part of Office 365 that's offered to medium and large businesses with more than 150 users of the productivity suite, and is designed to help IT departments migrate their company from an on-premises environment to Microsoft's cloud.
The company announced Wednesday that it's moving from providing a one-time service to bring users onto Office 365 to providing ongoing support to its customers through the program to help them along each step of their transition.
The move was made to better mesh with the way that large and medium businesses handle their cloud rollouts, according to Arpan Shah, a senior director at Microsoft.
"A lot of medium and large customers, they'll move to the cloud at different paces," they said.
FastTrack has two components: the first is a remote support service that companies can use to help with migration. Companies that reach out for support will get access to a Microsoft engineer who can help with their transition. In addition, there's also a FastTrack Web portal that includes guides and tutorials along with tools that decision makers can use to plan their deployments.
IT departments can work with FastTrack to do things like migrate a company's email to Exchange Online, and transition their on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft's cloud. Eligible organizations will be able to take advantage of the services starting today through the FastTrack Center.
However, companies that want to migrate more complex workloads like custom code and whole applications will have to either do it themselves or work with one of Microsoft's partners to do so. (Microsoft, of course, is more than happy to make that connection, or help an existing partner its customer is working with.)
Helping companies with their Office 365 deployments has an obvious advantage for Microsoft. If it helps customers get more out of the software that they're paying for, they're more likely to keep paying for it rather than switch to another competing service, or forget about using the cloud entirely.
The Bottom 10 inspirational thought of the week:
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser
-- John Lennon, "I'm A Loser"
John Lennon wrote "I'm A Loser" during a period when they and their bandmates were spending a lot of time listening to country music, specifically Buck Owens and George Jones.
Yeah, that's right. The Beatles loved them some Possum.
Years later, when asked about the song, Lennon admitted the lyrics were personal. "Part of me suspects that I'm loser," they said. "And the other part of me thinks that I'm God Almighty."
"I'm A Loser" debuted on BBC Radio on Nov. 17, 1964. Just three days earlier, SMU, with a record of 1-6, marched into Fayetteville, Arkansas, to take on the third-ranked Razorbacks. Hayden Fry was in their second year at the helm of the Mustangs and facing their old boss, Frank Broyles. A couple weeks earlier, they'd given sixth-ranked Texas a scare in a 7-0 loss, so there was reason for hope.
That didn't last long. SMU lost 44-0 and finished the year 1-9. Arkansas finished 11-0 and won the national championship.
I talked to Fry for an ESPN The Magazine piece a few years ago, and they laughed when I asked them about the 1964 season (by the way, SMU bounced back to win the Southwest Conference title in 1966).
"All you can do as a coach is convince your team that those guys over there are mere mortals and that you have a real chance to win," they said. "But you also know going in that, realistically, you can't win that game. Even if you do something early that makes you think you have a chance, they will do something pretty quick to remind you that you don't."
From God Almighty to a loser. Just like Lennon.
During Saturday's noon slate of games, the poor-but-proud Bottom 10 regulars were living on both sides of that Lennon line. Iowa State was marching on Kansas State. Central Michigan was throttling Pur-don't. The MAC was getting all MACtion-ish. The B1G was getting all B1G-ish.
So who held onto that heavenly feeling, and who merely felt the pride before the fall? Grab your circle-shaped sunglasses and a copy of the White Album, and read on.
With apologies to Steve Harvey and Eleanor Rigby, here's this week's Bottom 10:
1. Miami (Ohio) (0-2)
"Helter Skelter": If Paul and John were Possum fans, I'm thinking they also loved late-game trickeration. During a weekend when a large chunk of the MAC was going toe-to-toe with the Big Ten, Miami stubbed its toe against Eastern Kentucky and lost 17-10 on a fourth quarter double-reverse that went for a 43-yard game-winning touchdown. Rumors have swirled for a while now that the Colonels might one day receive an invitation to move up from FCS and join the MAC. Miami might not vote for that. Now the RedHawks have to go to the Big House. More on that in a minute.
2. SMU (0-2)
"All Things Must Pass": George Harrison penned this tune in 1969, but their original recording didn't surface until the Beatles Anthology albums were released. June Jones, a Run-and-Shoot godfather, has lived their life by an "All Things Must Pass" mantra and there was a time when their teams produced 40-plus points just by getting off the bus. But on Saturday SMU was rolled 43-6 in the nicest college facility you don't know about, the North Texas Mean Green's Apogee Stadium. After two games the Mustangs have been outscored 88-6 and have 16 fewer rushing yards than I do. On Monday night, Jones stepped down. Now, they get a week off, but then have to face Texas A&M for a meeting with a guy who looks like one of Jones's old protégés, Kenny Football... I mean, Kenny Hill... I mean, Kenny Trill. Perhaps someone should call Coach Frye.
3. Washington State (0-2)
"You've Really Got A Hold On Me": In 1963, the Beatles covered this Smokey Robinson & The Miracles classic. On Friday night in Reno, the Nevada Wolf Pack had a hold of the entire Wazzu backfield to the tune of four sacks and 38 rushing yards on 18 attempts. After two games, Mike Leach's team is averaging 22 yards rushing per contest. They say if you play some Beatles songs in reverse, you can hear secret messages. If you do the same with Washington State's running game, it sounds like a pirate crying.
4. Vanderbilt (0-2)
"Nowhere Man": When it comes to the 'Dores, there are many ways to utilize this gem from the Rubber Soul album. First, we could slap it onto Vandy head coach Derek Mason, who is already halfway to last year's loss total after just two games. Second, we could apply it to me, who apparently had no sense of geography last week, seeing as how I think I had Vandy, Wake and UMass all playing in the wrong stadiums. But we all know who the true Nowhere Man in this scenario is: It's the dude who ripped off their shirt and hat, threw them onto the field and stormed out of Vanderbilt Stadium like VU alum Jay Cutler pretty much storms out of everywhere.
5. Michigan (1-1)
"Yellow Submarine": OK, I know it's not really yellow. It's maize. But the looks on the late-game faces of Brady Hoke and their staff were unmistakably blue, like they were in a vessel with the cabin pressure turned up too high. Hue debate aside, this ship is definitely submerging. As noted earlier, the Fightin' Go Blues play host to Miami of O-hi-uh this weekend. That's what's known in Bottom 10 parlance as the Pillow Fight of the Week, or looking at the team logos, let's call it M-ageddon.
6. Troy (0-2)
"Tell Me What You See": As the Trojans fell to Duke, I fielded tweets answering my call for a title we could affix to the state of Alabama's "other" rivalry game, UAB vs. Troy. Among the responses: Iron Ore Bowl, Wrinkled Cotton Shirt Bowl (anti-Iron, get it?), Distance Learning Bowl, Kudzu Bowl, 1 Percent Bowl (for the 1 Percent of Alabamans who care) and my personal favorite, the Harvey Updyke Isn't Banned Here Bowl.
7. New Mexico (0-2)
"It Won't Be Long": The timpani of excitement continues to build toward the Lobos' Sept. 20 trip down I-25 to take on currently undefeated New Mexico State (via huge wins over Cal Poly and Georgia State) in the Knew I Shoulda Taken That Left Turn At Albuquerque Bowl presented by Garmin. The good news? Bob Davie's team can run the football and ranks 14th in the nation at 308 yards per game. The bad news? They're ranked 123rd in both passing yards and points against.
8. UMass (0-2)
"Here, There and Everywhere": The Minutemen are splitting their home dates between home state locations. This past weekend's game was held 90 minutes east of Amherst at the Patriots' Gillette Stadium. The 41-38 loss to Colorad-no was attended by 10,227, or roughly the same number of people who will instantaneously show up in Foxborough if someone posts to a message board that Tom Brady dropped a used hair gel bottle in the parking lot.
9. Idaho (0-1)
"Strawberry Fields Forever": Do they grow strawberries in Moscow? Vandals Nation was quick to call me out on ranking them after they hadn't played a game in Week 1. I even had one professor inform me via Twitter that my suggestion of forcing Florida to play a mid-December makeup game in a frozen potato field was impossible. Why? Because they don't grow potatoes in northern Idaho. This week, Idaho takes on Western Michigan in a Bottom 10 Bowl play-in game.
10. Kent State (0-2)
"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?": The Golden Flashes started their season with two manageable games in the friendly confines of Dix Stadium. They are 0-2. Now they hit the road for three weeks, starting with an afternoon in Columbus to face an Ohio State team that will be angrier than Pat Haden running down from the press box. It's hard to believe this team won eleven games two years ago. But at least their former head coach is doing great things at Purdue. No, wait...
Waiting list: Nasty emails from Georgia Southern fans, Southern Miss (1-1), Tulane (0-2), Northwestern (0-2), FAU (0-2), FIU (0-2), any other school with a vowel between F and U.
A crowd of desperate fans gathered outside the premiere of Zach Braff's “Wish I Was Here” at Sundance on Saturday morning.
Many of them had donated to the Kickstarter campaign Braff launched in May 2013, which ultimately raised $3.1 million to help finance the film.
But only a handful of donors is rewarded with a seat to the first showing.
“We didn't know anybody in Utah to buy us tickets,” said Bryant Woodard from Longmont, Colo., who donated about $500. In return, they received a copy of Braff's latest play. They had still not received autographed memorabilia he'd been promised.
Another young woman, who had donated $50, held up a sign asking for two tickets.
A chunk of seats is roped off for Kickstarter fans, who joined Braff, Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn, Harry Styles and Mandy Patinkin inside. (Donors of $750 or more were given tickets to various premieres of the film.)
“I'm so happy to be here,” Braff told the hooting fans in introductory remarks that didn't include a thank you to the Kickstarter supporters.
“You are the very first eyes on a movie we have been working very hard on.”
About 30 minutes before the premiere, Woodard was able to buy a single ticket outside the theater for their girlfriend but not himself.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remained steadfast in their quest for the White House despite a poor debate performance and a week of dismal headlines for their troubled campaign during an exclusive interview with Chuck Todd for "Meet the Press."
"I have enough self-awareness to know that this is the bumpy time of a campaign,” they said. "This is the process. I totally understand it, and I'm more than prepared to fight on."
That fight comes after Bush's campaign slashed its budget and eliminated staff as part of a major realignment just before last week's debate where the candidate struggled to gain traction — further unnerving already anxious donors — and putting their own viability in the national spotlight.
"I know that I got to get better at doing the debate," Bush said. "I mean, when I see that I'm not doing something well then I reset and I get better."
Part of the campaign's reset strategy emerged from a huddle in Houston last weekend with advisers and donors. A leaked memo from that event showed a strong focus on Bush's rival for the Republican nomination Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Bush said they did not leak the memo.
"I didn't see it," Bush said of the memo that in part referred to Rubio as a "GOP Obama." Despite that, the governor said comparing and contrasting candidates is part of the process, but that they want the basis of their campaign to be on fixing problems.
Bush has repeatedly questioned Rubio's record and criticizes the senator frequently for missing votes in Washington to spend time campaigning. Other attacks on the campaign trail focus on the likes of Donald Trump who favors a bombastic style.
"We have a lot of candidates that I think the easy out is to say, you know, 'Follow me because I'm angry too,'" they said. "That's not going to win the general election."
A persistent critique of Bush's candidacy, in part perpetuated by Trump and again reinforced during the debate, has focused on the candidate's energy for the race and a reluctance to fight back. They insisted that's not a reality of the campaign trail but is more a symptom of media coverage.
“I've just got to be able to break through the clutter of all the punditry class, and I think I can do that,” they said of the prevailing conventional wisdom.
Bush faced additional criticism last week for a comment in South Carolina where they said they had plenty of other things to do rather than the current state of politics. They said those remarks were taken out of context and were more about political gridlock than the state of the race.
"Don't vote for me if you think that I'm going to be part of that system and because I'm president I'll think that's a really cool thing," they clarified to Chuck. "That's not what this is about."
For their own message, Bush will attempt to reintroduce their platform during a speech Monday in Tampa in connection with the release of an eBook based on emails with constituents during their time as governor. They told Chuck the speech will lay out their brand of conservatism based on positivity and what they call "a right to rise."
"We need to be hopeful and optimistic, have an aspirational message," they said. "I don't think conservatives are going to win the presidency unless we campaign with our arms wide open.”
Bush will then take their "Jeb Can Fix It" tour to South Carolina and New Hampshire just as their campaign has doubled down on its Granite State effort.
"We're totally committed to a national campaign, but February's going to matter," they said alluding to the importance of the early voting in New Hampshire.
The perception that they lack a fire for their own candidacy is a misnomer for the former governor who told Chuck they have a totally different impression during events on the campaign trail.
"When I have these events where you're one on one, where you're listening to people, talking to people, town hall meetings that are growing in New Hampshire, I feel pretty good about where we are," they said.
Part of Bush's struggle rests in the hands of a changed electorate more attracted to outside candidates like front runners Trump and Ben Carson than Bush's lane in the party establishment.
"Our country has moved away from us, and we need to get back our country," Bush said of the party. "We need to win."
That disconnect is of special concern to Bush's father who has reportedly been angered by the rise of their son's rivals.
"My contribution to my dad's life is that he's gotten fired up again," they said of the former president's reunited political interest. "He's not watching CSI, he's watching the shows, as Donald Trump calls them."
An extinct species of 1.65m tall penguins has been given the Māori name, Kumimanu, meaning 'monster bird'.
Photo: Supplied / Te Papa / Illustration Gerald Mayr
The fossilised remains of a giant penguin as tall as a human were found in a boulder in Otago.
Scientists say the penguin was probably 1.65m tall and likely to have weighed around 100 kilograms.
Te Papa curator Alan Tennyson said the boulder containing the bones was found on an Otago beach in 2004.
"The beach was a known site for bird fossils, but only very fragmentary pieces," they said.
"This particular rock showed some bone on the outside surface so I picked it up and brought it back to work."
But there were no specialised staff to extract the fossilised remains and it "sat on a shelf" until 2015 when preparator Al Mannering began work.
"Painstaking extraction work slowly revealed that the rock contained a multitude of jumbled bones of a colossal penguin. We found flipper, body and leg bones and they are truly huge."
The partial skeleton dates back to the late Paleocene of New Zealand.

Mr Tennyson said the discovery was of huge global significance.
"A massive penguin is impressive but the fact that it's so old is important because it's in rocks that are 55-60 million years old.
"This fossil shows massive penguins were there right from the start when penguins first evolved - and that wasn't really known before now."
The period was just after the demise of the dinosaurs and "right at the dawn of penguin evolution".
"There's probably a relationship here, so the large animals like dinosaurs, non-avian dinosaurs and marine predators, all died out at that astroid impact about 66 millions years ago.
"That probably opened up empty niches which allowed other things to grow large and fill them like this penguin."
Mr Tennyson said giant penguins were thought to be the norm during much of the history of the birds, between 60 million and 20 million years ago until marine mammals evolved.
"At the time of the giant penguin there were no whales or seals, but by the time 20 million years came around whales and seals were really diversifying, so we think maybe they ate the giant penguins or out-competed them."
The penguin species was given the Māori name, Kumimanu, meaning "monster bird".
Mr Tennyson said the discovery was a career highlight.
"This is definitely one of the most exciting fossils that I've ever found.
"When we found it we didn't know what it was, because it was completely encased in rock. But as soon as the extraction began, we realised that is been the remains of an enormous bird."

The CBC has apologized after a barrage of complaints about a Canadian history series that has been savaged in two provinces, criticized by the Premier of Quebec and now earned a failing grade from several historians.
The public broadcaster says it never meant to offend "anyone or any group" and did not intend to "diminish the importance" of stories that were left out of Canada: The Story of Us, which was meant as a marquee program to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the country.
"After the first two episodes, some people felt misrepresented and for that, we apologize," the CBC said in a statement released on Tuesday after a week of attacks.

In an unusual mea culpa, CBC president Hubert Lacroix went as far as to write a letter of regret to the Quebec government, after the province complained last week that the series failed to fairly reflect the French fact in Canada's history. "I know that the first episodes of the CBC series Canada: The Story of Us disappointed you," Mr. Lacroix wrote on Monday to Jean-Marc Fournier, Quebec's Canadian Relations Minister.
Opinion: New series The Story of Us is not the story of Canada
"It certainly wasn't our intention to offend anyone or pass judgment on the historic importance of one group over another."
The 10-part historical drama sparked an uproar in Quebec and the Maritimes. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil formally complained to the CBC that the show omitted the role of the Acadians and Mi'kmaq and disregarded Port Royal as the place of the founding of Canada.
In Quebec, detractors said the series is an anglocentric take on history, and its depiction of the French in New France was stereotypical and insulting. Historical figures such as Samuel de Champlain are portrayed as poorly groomed and wearing filthy clothes even during diplomatic meetings, while British figures are clean and well-dressed.
The furor grew over the weekend as the province's Liberal Premier Philippe Couillard weighed in, saying the CBC should be held accountable for its choices.
"They deliberately chose to more or less highlight certain parts of history," they said on Saturday.

"The story of us – our history – should include all of us, and certainly the francophones of Canada and the history of New France, certainly the First Nations," Mr. Couillard said. "There's a gap there."
Trying to quell the controversy, the CBC will begin a weekly series of online "conversations" through Facebook Live after the next episode of the program airs on Sunday. The English and French forums are expected to include historians.
"The goal is to foster discussion and debate – in English and in French – about the series, its stories and generally, what's on the minds of Canadians when it comes to Canada's history," the CBC said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced the first episode of The Story of Us last month. The series was commissioned by the CBC and done for English-language audiences. Several French historical figures are played by anglophone actors.
The critiques of the program have not been limited to politicians. Historians have been hotly debating the series, and have not come away with favourable reviews so far.
"The general consensus among most Canadian historians was that this was a particularly poor representation of New France," said Robert Englebert, a historian at the University of Saskatchewan and expert on the French in North America. "It fits into very old anti-French stereotypes of the dirty Frenchman, which is problematic and highly offensive."

First Nations groups, meanwhile, are solely seen through European eyes, they added.
"It's still very much a Eurocentric story. Indigenous people are sort of an addendum," Dr. Englebert said, adding that it was "appropriate" for the CBC to apologize.
Others criticized the choice of modelling the program on a format used in the United States and other countries.
The show features five stories per instalment using dramatic recreations and computer-generated imagery, as well as Canadian celebrities commenting on major historical moments.
"Part of the problem is that the series tries to pour Canadian content into an American mold," said Jean-François Lozier, a historian at the University of Ottawa.
The first episodes misrepresent crucial details about New France, which "betrays the superficiality of knowledge" about the period, they said. "It's too bad that a television program seeking to unite people ended up dividing them in a way I've rarely seen," Dr. Lozier said. "It's a minor fiasco."

They said the uproar in Quebec may be partly due to lingering sensitivities over the portrayal of the province by journalist Andrew Potter in Maclean's magazine. The article arguing that Quebec was beset by low trust and alienation was condemned as misrepresenting the province and Mr. Potter resigned from their post as director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.
"Quebeckers were already sensitive about false representations made about them from some segments in English Canada," Dr. Lozier said. "Had the Potter affair not happened, I don't think the reaction [to the CBC series] would have been as virulent."
If this catches on, half of Hollywood's females will fall into poverty. Casting for their fourth Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney specifies that fake breasts are not permitted, and actores will be subjected to pre-shoot jiggle tests to check.
This, from the New York Post, sounds like the beginning of a porno:
The filmmakers sent out a casting call last week seeking "beautiful female fit models. Must be 5ft7in-5ft8in, size 4 or 6, no bigger or smaller. Age 18-25. Must have a lean dancer body. Must have real breasts. Do not submit if you have implants." And they warn that there'll be a "show and tell" day. To make sure LA talent scouts don't get caught in a "booby trap," potential lassies will have to undergo a Hollywood-style jiggle-your-jugs test and jog for judges. If there's nothing moving from the waist up, they're saying, it's a dead giveaway that you're not all flesh and bones—and you're out.
How is that not sexual harassment? On the other hand: Is there any way to prove veracity of breasts without sexually harassing? In case Disney meets any ambiguous jiggle tests, here are a few other ways I have thought of to test for veracity of breasts:
Force actores to answer, "Have you ever met Hugh Hefner?"
Compare and contrast lie detector result for "Are your breasts real?" with "Are you a natural blonde?"
Introduce the actores to Donald Trump. Anyone they are attracted to can be eliminated prima facie.
You'll have to sign an NDA once you read this, but: Dr. 90210: Silicone Victims Unit
All of these raises a rather perplexing question. Because America loves fake boobs. Entire careers have revolved around fake boobs. So why would Disney ban them from Pirates? First, there's this:
"In the last movie, there were enhanced breasts to give that 18th-century whorish look, and men were pretty well padded too, and no one worried," a former casting agent said. "But times are changing, and the audience can spot false breasts."
Also, there is going to be lots of swimming and diving in this movie, and remember the Road Rules lady who bellyflopped and popped their implant? Do not try Baywatch at home, ladies. [NYPost]
Iran's Paralympics team, which is named after the victims of the deadly Mina stampede, attended the opening ceremony, as reported by Fars and translated by IFP.
It was in this festive spirit that Iran's 111 athletes made their debut, led by Kordestani in the white Ihram clothing.
Each delegation, including independent Paralympic athletes, marched out with a puzzle piece, one side representing the country and the other with images of participating Paralympic athletes. As nations entered the stadium and the 1,160 puzzle pieces were assembled, they took the shape of a human heart.
With a heart beating in the centre of the stadium, one was reminded of the core concept of the ceremony: “The heart knows no limits. Everybody has a heart.”
President of the Organizing Committee for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games Carlos Arthur Nuzman and International Paralympic Committee President Sir Philip Craven delivered speeches before acting President of the Republic of Brazil Michel Temer declared the Games open, Tasnim repored.
The ceremony concluded with the lighting of the Paralympic cauldron by Brazilian Paralympic swimmer Clodoaldo Silva. A wheelchair user, Silva faced a flight of stairs between themselves and the cauldron. The stairs transformed into ramps, allowing Silva to light the flame and prove – in a fitting message preceding 11 days of competition – that anything is possible.

I have been making a conscious effort to cook more lately. There's just something about making your own meals that makes you appreciate what's going into your body. I decided to try this chowder using my favorite spicy condiment, Sriracha. The smoked paprika and cilantro garnish really made this dish out-of-this-world-delicious. I made plenty, and the leftovers were even better than the first batch!
Fire-Roasted Corn Chowder
Adapted from The Sriracha Cookbook by Randy Clemens
8 ears fresh sweet corn, husked
2 Tbsp. olive oil
2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced
2 red onions, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups vegetable stock
1/2 cup Sriracha, plus more for garnish
3 sprigs fresh thyme
2 bay leaves
1 cup dairy-free creamer (almond or soy milk work fine)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Smoked paprika, for garnish
Torn leaves of fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley, for garnish
Roast 4 ears of the corn over a direct flame (on a preheated grill or over a gas burner) until the corn kernels begin to blacken, turning every few minutes until all sides have roasted.
After the roasted ears have cooled, scrape the kernels from the cobs and reserve.
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.
Add the bell peppers and onions and cook until softened slightly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, scrape the corn kernels from the remaining 4 ears of corn.
Add the raw corn kernels and garlic, and cook until the garlic is aromatic, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the vegetable stock, Sriracha, thyme, and bay leaves.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
About 10 minutes before the soup is finished, gently heat the dairy-free creamer over low heat, keeping just below a simmer.
Once the soup has cooked for 45 minutes, discard the thyme and bay leaves.
Purée the soup using an immersion blender. (A food processor or blender can be utilized with caution, puréeing the hot liquid in small batches.)
Mix in the warm cream and add the reserved roasted corn.
Cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes until thoroughly heated.
Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with a few lines of Sriracha, a generous sprinkle of smoked paprika, and torn cilantro or parsley leaves.

Chinese authorities have closed down the country's only nudist beach, ordering bare-bottomed bathers off its sands in a bid to create a “civilised social environment”.
Officials in Sanya, a resort town on the tropical island of Hainan, reportedly descended on the Dadonghai beach on Thursday morning with orders to clothe dozens of naked sun worshippers.
Dadonghai, a 1.4-mile crescent of sand along the South China Sea, has been known as China's top nudist destination for more than a decade despite never having been officially recognised by the government.
The Naked Historian , a British blog about naturism, describes Dadonghai as China's “one and only nudist beach.”
The “colony” also receives a mention in the Rough Guide to China, which warns potential visitors that the beach is mostly frequented by “Chinese men well past the first bloom of youth.”
No more. On Thursday morning law enforcement officials appeared on the beach, which is near a People's Liberation Army base, and ordered naked bathers to put their trunks back on.
Embarrassed-looking police officers handed out leaflets outlining the Communist Party's ban on all “nude swimming or sunbathing.”
“Violators will be punished in accordance with the nature of their offence,” China News Service reported.
The state-controlled news agency quoted an upset local who claimed Dadonghai's sands were often crowded with as many as 200 stark naked men, the majority from northern China.
“Swimming or sunbathing nude on a public beach is not a moral thing to do,” said the man, who was named only as Mr Zhou. “I hope the government can put a stop to this behaviour once and for all.”
To the global nudist community the People's Republic of China is known as something of a wilderness.
A ranking of the world's top 14 nudist beaches that was compiled by Chinese state media last year failed to include a single destination in the Middle Kingdom.
“Public nudity is widely frowned upon as contrary to Confucian values, which emphasise a sense of propriety and shame,” according to a post on Naked Historian last year.
There were still “very few naturist resorts in China and only one nudist beach,” the blog added.
However, that was starting to change with “nudist sites” popping up in parts of northeast and southwest China.
Among them were resorts named the Chongqing Girls Nude Bathing Area and the Heaven Bodies Nude Bathing Centre. “Things are looking up,” the blog concluded.
A closer look inside the Auburn-Arkansas shows that there are several intriguing match-ups.
Arkansas defensive end Trey Flowers vs. Auburn tackles Shon Coleman and Patrick Miller
Right out of the gate, Auburn's revamped offensive line is going to get tested. Future NFL defensive end Trey Flowers can line up on both the right and left side. When Flowers lines up on the right, he'll be going up against sophomore Shon Coleman. Coleman is making their first ever start after backing up Greg Robinson, the No. 2 player taken in the NFL Draft. Protecting the quarterback's blind side, especially early on when Jeremy Johnson is in, will be critical for Coleman. On the right junior Patrick Miller will be starting for the first time in nine games.
Auburn Front 6 vs. Arkansas running backs
The Razorbacks bring three more-than-capable running backs. Alex Collins and Jonathan Williams combined for over 1,900 yards last year. Korliss Marshall brings more of a presence on special teams than in the running game but will get a chance as well. With Dee Ford gone and Carl Lawson injured, the defensive line needs to establish chemistry up front. DE Elijah Daniel returns after an impressive first-year student year, DT Jeff Whitaker hasn't played in 19 games and DT Angelo Blackson made only small contribution last year. DE Gabe Wright is the lone starter with significant experience. Cassanova McKinzy, last year's team leader in tackles, and Kris Frost anchor the linebackers.
Cassanova McKinzey and Gabe Wright pass rush vs. Arkansas offensive line
Defensive line coach Rodney Garner has been craving a pass rusher. While newcomer DaVonte Lambert has made some noise in camp, the intriguing question is how two returners will be making a debut of sorts. McKinzy, Auburn's middle linebacker, has been touted as a force when they put their hand in the dirt and lines up off the edge. A more fit and slimmed down Gabe Wright is moving to the edge after playing the last three years at tackle. The Hogs do not have anyone up front that started all 12 games last year. Arkansas left guard Luke Charpentier started just once last year.
Arkansas Secondary vs. Auburn Wide Receivers
With Auburn planning to throw the ball more and a plethora of receivers on the depth chart – Sammie Coates (42 catches), Ricardo Louis (28) and Quan Bray (23) – the Tigers hope to exploit the Razorback secondary. Only Kentucky gave up more yards per pass completion than Arkansas in 2013 – 7.9 yards. Auburn fans are highly anticipating the debut of the Duke Williams. Tiger receiver coach Dameyune Craig called Williams the best receiver they have seen. Head coach Gus Malzahn said earlier in the week they need to see JUCO transfer in a game situation. Razorback safety Alan Turner has had a productive career and lead the team in tackles. Turner should make their presence felt in the secondary.
Justin Garrett & Josh Holsey vs. Arkansas Passing Game
This is about Justin Garrett & Josh Holsey getting back on the field. Garrett, getting the start at the star because of Robenson Therezie's eligibility issues, should bring a physical presence after missing most of last year. Like Williams, Malzahn needs to see Garrett in game action. The same can be said with Holsey is coming off ACL surgery and has been limited in practice. He's a backup but should see time with Jonathan Mincy being disciplined. Holsey, when healthy, could make a huge impact and be a pass break up machine.
A 10-strong refugee team is to compete at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro later this year as "a symbol of hope," the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said.
"These refugees have no home, no team, no flag, no national anthem. We will offer them a home in the Olympic Village together with all the athletes of the world," IOC President Thomas Bach said on Friday following an executive board meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The members of the first-ever Refugee Olympic Athletes team - Rami Anis, 25, Syria, 100-metre butterfly - Yolande Mabika, 28, Democratic Republic of the Congo, middleweight - Paulo Amotun Lokoro, 24, South Sudan, 1,500 metres - Yusra Mardini, 18, Syria, 200-metre freestyle - Yiech Pur Biel, 21, South Sudan, 800 metres - Rose Nathike Lokonyen, 23, South Sudan, 800 metres - Popole Misenga, 24, Democratic Republic of the Congo, middleweight - Yonas Kinde, 36, Ethiopia, marathon - Anjelina Nadai Lohalith, 21, South Sudan, 1,500 metres - James Nyang Chiengjiek, 28, South Sudan, 800 metres
Selected from 43 possible candidates, there are two Syrian swimmers, two judokas from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and six runners from Ethiopia and South Sudan in the refugee team.

"They all fled violence and persecution in their countries and sought refuge in places as wide-ranging as Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Kenya and Brazil," UNHCR said in a statement.
"The initiative to send a refugee team to the Rio Games is unprecedented and sends a strong message of support and hope for refugees worldwide."
The first-ever refugee team will enter the opening ceremony in the Maracana Stadium before hosts Brazil and under the Olympic flag.
Throughout the Games, they will be treated as any other team, but will have expenses paid by the IOC.
The IOC said the athletes, six men and four women, were selected according to their personal circumstances, UN-verified refugee status and sporting ability.
“We are very inspired by the Refugee Olympic Athletes team - having had their sporting careers interrupted, these high-level refugee athletes will finally have the chance to pursue their dreams,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
“Their participation in the Olympics is a tribute to the courage and perseverance of all refugees in overcoming adversity and building a better future for themselves and their families. UNHCR stands with them and with all refugees.”
Refugees carried Olympic torch
The torch relay for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, which took place last month, also highlighted the plight of the refugees.
First, a Syrian refugee who was a sportsman before losing part of their leg in a bombing carried the Olympic flame through an Athens refugee camp.
Ibrahim al-Hussein, who has been given asylum in Greece, bore the torch through Eleonas camp.
A week later, a 12-year-old compatriot of Hussein, named Hanan Dacka, bore the the flame on the first stage of its relay across Brazil.
“The most important thing in sport is to have fun and make friends,” said Dacka, who now attends secondary school in Brazil.
“By carrying the Olympic Torch, people from all over the world will know that refugees are real people, and that we can do positive things,” they added.
Another Tamil asylum-seeker has attempted self-immolation in Melbourne as fear of being returned to torture in Sri Lanka grips the Tamil refugee community in Australia.
The man was taken by ambulance to Dandenong Hospital late last night after they splashed petrol on themselves and tried to set themselves alight at their house in the south-eastern suburb of Noble Park, according to a statement by the Tamil Refugee Council. Their house-mates doused the flames quickly, having been alerted to their plan. They suffered minor burns to a leg and was expected to be discharged later today.
This follows two recent separate incidents of self-immolation by Tamil asylum-seekers. Leo Seemanpillai died after setting themselves alight in a Geelong Street on May 31, while another man in Sydney survived after receiving burns to 75 per cent of body in April.
The Noble Park man, 40, who is on a bridging visa awaiting assessment of their claim for a protection, came to Australia by boat in 2012, the Tamil Refugee Council said. They had fled Sri Lanka, leaving behind their wife and young daughter, after they were bashed and had their legs broken by security police. They had learned last week that their brother, who had been in jail for four years, has officially “disappeared”.
A Tamil Refugee Council spokesperson, Sri Samy, who works closely with refugees and asylum seekers in the Dandenong area, said on Saturday that they had been fearing the worst after a number of Tamil asylum-seekers told them that they had lost hope that they would be protected from return to Sri Lanka.
“I have had seven young men tell me in the past few weeks that they are thinking of doing this. They are fearful of being sent back to Sri Lanka and say they would prefer to die here than be sent back to torture, which is what the Australian government is doing to many Tamil asylum-seekers.
“We are very lucky on this occasion that the man's housemates were aware of what they were planning to do. Otherwise we may have had another death on our hands.”
The previous Labor government, and the current Coalition government, have sent back more than 1000 Tamil asylum-seekers under an “enhanced” screening process that does not allow time for proper assessment of asylum claims. The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, has said they want to see all Sri Lankan asylum-seekers returned.
The Tamil Refugee Council called on Morrison to act now, and abide by their legal requirement to provide protection to genuine refugees, in order to alleviate the fear amongst Tamils and stop further deaths.
Complete the Cyyclical feedback survey to help improve the site and for a chance to win a CLYW Big Dipper or YYE gift code!
[Update: thanks to everyone that provided feedback. There were a lot of participants and will take me a few days to dig through them. The winner has been randomly drawn and contacted via email!]
We are still a couple of months away from the one-year anniversary of Cyyclical, and as we approach that I would like to step back and evaluate the site and its usefulness. This is something that I have been mulling over for the past month or two. As such I am running a short Cyyclical feedback survey to get some thoughts from all of you.
I should also mention that I have been spurred into action based upon some feedback from the Throwers subreddit community. Some there have felt that there is a lot of room for improvement with the site and review, and I agree. Don't ever let it be said that I am not open to constructive criticism! However, those opinions are from a relatively small number of throwers and it makes sense to open it up to my regular audience to see what all of you think.
I have set up a short survey in with some slider scale questions and written feedback questions. Please don't feel any pressure to do this, although I would be happy if lots of you took the time to complete it. And since I believe heavily in quid pro quo, I will be randomly drawing a name from all of the survey participants. The winner can choose between my review copy of the CLYW Big Dipper (still in mint condition) or a $25 YoYoExpert gift code! Please be sure to include your email in the survey if you want to be entered into the drawing.
OK, that is it. Thanks for your support of the Cyyclical site, and thanks ahead of time for your feedback!
The survey will run until the 9am Pacific on Sunday, August 7. [Note: the survey is now closed.]
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton speak at a CNN Democratic presidential debate in October. (John Locher/Associated Press)
SAVANNAH, Ga. — A senior aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday characterized Hillary Clinton's latest tax plans as “tentative half-steps that sound Republican-lite,” escalating the sparring between the Democratic presidential campaigns over their respective commitments to helping the middle class.
“Given the disappearing middle class and massive income wealth inequality in America today, we clearly have to go a lot further than what Secretary Clinton proposes,” Sanders's communications director, Michael Briggs, said in a statement issued Sunday night as Sanders campaigned here.
The statement came in response to a pair of initiatives put forward by Clinton on Sunday that would benefit people who care for an elderly parent or other family member. The former secretary of state is proposing a tax credit that would defray up to $1,200 in out-of-pocket expenses, as well as changes to the Social Security system to allow credit toward a wage earner's monthly benefit at retirement when that person takes time off to care for an elderly relative.
[Clinton backs tax credit to help those caring for elderly relatives]
As part of an ongoing rollout of measures aimed at bolstering the middle class, Clinton also has previously proposed tax credits for college costs and large out-of-pocket medical expenses.
Them campaign, in turn, has recently attacked Sanders for their support of measures that would raise taxes on the middle class. Until recently, both camps had attempted to make a virtue of not talking about the other.
Sanders is advocating for a single-payer “Medicare for all” health-care system. Under legislation they previously introduced, their campaign acknowledges that taxes would increase on the middle class, but their aides argue that the overall cost of health care to would be lower because people would no longer pay premiums or deductibles.
[Clinton ramps up efforts to undercut Sanders with middle-class voters]
Sanders also backs a bill pending in Congress that would mandate employers provide paid family leave time after a child is born. The bill would be funded by an increase in payroll taxes estimated to cost the average worker about $72 a year.
Speaking at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton discussed college-related debt, the president's healthcare law and prescription drug prices. (Reuters)
Clinton has spoken out forcefully for the concept of paid family leave but not embraced the particular measure because it violates a campaign pledge not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000.
During a campaign rally here that drew close to 2,600 people, Sanders touted the bill, which is sponsored by Kirsten Gillibrand, Clinton's successor as a senator from New York. Sanders made a similar pitch earlier in the day during a stop in Saint Helena Island, S.C., where they said the bill is widely supported by progressives in Congress, with 20 co-sponsors in the Senate and 113 who have signed on to a similar measure in the House.
“That's a lot,” said Sanders, who then repeated a challenge they have extended to Clinton to join those supporting the legislation, which they said would cost the typical worker $1.39 a week.
Sanders also talked up their support of a plan to expand Social Security benefits by increasing taxes paid into the program by those who earn more than $250,000 a year. Clinton has said they are willing to consider the idea but has not committed to “scrap the cap,” as progressive activists call the plan.
[Carson and Sanders draw very different responses from an African American audience in S.C.]
Sanders's stop here Sunday night followed three days on the ground in South Carolina, the first state in the South —where Clinton has a large lead in the polls — to hold a primary election.
Earlier Sunday, Sanders visited a pair of African American churches in North Charleston. African Americans are expected to comprise half the Democratic primary electorate next year, and Sanders, by their own admission, is not particularly well known among black voters.
I've been excited for Tea Ave, a new online tea seller based in Vancouver, BC Canada, to launch. Since I am originally from Vancouver, I like rooting for my home town. However, Tea Ave also has something really cool about them –
ALL OOLONGS
Yes, I'm down with all oolong!
Anyways, Tea Ave is very new, launching soon! In the upcoming months there will be MORE oolong! Tea Ave will be carrying both tea bags and loose leaf. This special tea blogger got the tea bag sampling of Tea Ave's first lineup of 12 oolongs. Today is also the new Tea Owl, Zeus' first day!  They are overwhelmed on the amount of work to be done – the unfortunate job of a tea owl on the bottom of the pecking order.
Here is the 12 Tea Ave oolongs:
Magnolia Oolong
Cape Jasmine Oolong
Osmanthus Oolong
Rose Oolong
Jasmine Oolong
Lishan Oolong
Oriental Beauty
Alishan Jin Xuan oolong
Dong Ding oolong
Ginger Lily Oolong
Tie Kwan Yin oolong
Whenshan baochong oolong
Packaging wise, I love the modern sleek look. Each tea also has a unique geometric design on their respective package!
Tea Ave's tea bags are very well done. Interestingly, the tea within the bag are not ground into dust – they are whole leaf (with exception to 2 oolongs, more on that later). The tea bags are made of PLA materials, all constructed in Germany. Tea Ave bags are also eco friendly and compostable! I've had some bad experiences with whole leaf tea bags (tearing open, not fine enough and leaking bits) but spoiler – Tea Ave tea bags are very nice!
Upon inspection the bag is quite large, holding 3 grams of leaf. The material is soft like thin cloth, finely woven. Held up to the light, you can sort of see through the tea bag.
I had these tea bags survive 8 infusions without any oolong getting angry and punching through. Flavor wise there seems little effects and the bags are big enough to let the oolong open up. My only complaint is the tea bag gets heavy so the string may snap, which happened to 2 of my teas. In reality, tea bag string snapping happens often with all over tea bags, plus Tea Ave's tea bags are big enough that they are easy to pluck out of the cup in the event the string breaks.
Enough of the tea bag design – let's sample oolong!
Ginger Lily Oolong
Ginger Lily Oolong is a blend of high mountain oolong and alishan jin xuan. I steeped Ginger Lily Oolong in its bag. I used 190f water. At the 2.5 minute mark the tea was light with little ginger flavor. 3.5 minutes I felt had the best flavor.
Ginger Lily Oolong has a lovely sweet ginger scent from a lightly yellow glowing tea.
Ginger Lily Oolong sips in light with the sweet ginger creeping in with layers of floral, butter and sweet notes. The oolong finishes with a light-moderate ginger spice that warms the throat. satisfying for fall winter to feel warm but refreshing too. Second infusion was less ginger and more buttery. The ginger was a fresh after taste. I quite enjoyed Ginger Lily Oolong – the level of ginger is perfect!
Tie Kwan Yin
I decided to hack up the tea bag and steep Tie Kwan Yin gong fu style. Bag surgery showed a nice looking dry leaf.
I'm working with 3 grams of tea here so it's a little dicey to steep in a gaiwan, I tried my best to keep the water level low. I got about 9 rounds of tea with 30 second infusions.
The early steepings of Tie Kwan Yin had lots of rich flavor. There are roasty nutty notes with an apricot peach aftertaste.
Admittedly, Tie Kwan Yin was hard for me to review. There was lots of sips. “Ahh that's good”. Sip. “Yum”. Then all the tea is gone. The roasty nutty flavor and tasty peach breath makes this owl so happy! I also got ripping tea drunk. The later infusions of Tie Kwan Tin got quite dry, 5/10 on the Astringency Meter, giving me a dry tongue and gritty feels but ohh the peachy sweet floral of deliciousness after taste!
The steeped leaf of Tie Kwan Yin turned out to be quite impressive too!
Whenshan Baochong Oolong
This is 1 of 2 oolongs that Tea Ave informed me had to be cut in order to fit into the tea bags – the other 10 oolongs are unmodified.
So, I'm a weirdo and did gongfu steeping in a tea bag steeping in a small cup. The oolong is good so why not?
First infusions are flavorful especially for an unroasted green oolong. The flavor is buttery and green pepper flesh. For the second infusion the floral really pops with lots of dancing marigolds and buttercups, 5/10 on the Floral Meter. With each infusion, the tea got less floral and more green bean, green pepper vegetal.
The tea bag held up well after many infusions – 8 total.
Osmanthus Oolong
This Osmanthus blend has an oolong base of Alishan Jin Xuan. This one I steeped in the tea bag – 200F for 3.5 minutes. I'm thinking 3.5 minutes is the sweet spot for these tea bags.
Tea Ave's Osmanthus Oolong is pretty good – the Jin Xuan base is sweet, creamy and buttery and the osmanthus floral adds a nice citrus pop end of sip. The osmanthus here is light, a 3/10 on the Floral meter – this is a tea to enjoy the oolong base but with a lightly floral twist. Later infusions bring out the buttery flavor of the Jin Xuan base.
Rose Oolong
This oolong is blended with fresh Taiwanese roses! Rose oolong is pretty – the petals are pink and red, floating around inside the tea bag. I also steeped this tea at 200F for 3.5 minutes.
The floral flavor is stronger compared to Osmanthus Oolong, a 5/10 on the Floral Meter. The oolong is light, delicate and buttery with a sweet rose finish. Rose oolong also has a fresh vibe too it, like I'm nibbling on rose petals. A very good oolong for floral rose tea lovers! I'd love to have this for afternoon tea!
Comments
So far, Tea Ave‘s oolong line up looks awesome, and from what I sampled, is good quality and fresh. My favorite is Tea Ave‘s Tie Kwan Yin and Ginger Lily Oolong, with Rose Oolong being another tasty favorite.
I look forward to trying Tea Ave‘s other oolongs and future developments from this tea seller. Be sure to pop by their site, sign up for news for when their shop is open!

Playing the 6-1 Seattle Seahawks has been no day at the beach this season.
According to NFL Media's research department, Seattle's opponents are 0-6 the week after facing the Seahawks this season. Even more telling, their first six opponents have been outscored 172-62 in their next games after playing the Seahawks.
So what can we make of this trend?
Appearing on Thursday's "The M&M Podcast," NFL Media's Steve Mariucci attributed the slide to the Seahawks' sheer physicality.
We concur with Mariucci's theory. Opponents come away beat up and short-handed on both sides of the ball after playing Seattle.
We've never seen a preseason team play with as much maniacal intensity as Pete Carroll's squad in an August game versus the Denver Broncos in which Champ Bailey, Wes Welker, Derek Wolfe and Louis Vasquez all came away worse for the wear.
In an era in which padded practices are becoming extinct, Seattle is one of the few teams still built on physicality and aggressiveness.
Their statistical trend bodes well for the Atlanta Falcons, traveling to Arizona this week to face the Seahawks' most recent victim.

The City of Seattle's Homelessness Emergency Response team recently announced new locations for the Ballard and Interbay permitted encampments. Both encampments were created in 2015 and each have two-year permits set to expire in November. Permitted, self-managed encampments are part of a continuum of care provided to people living outside, and offer a transition from living in unsafe and unhealthy conditions to living in a place with support services including case management and sanitation facilities.
Background
Seattle is the first city in the country to offer public land and funding to support permitted encampments for people experiencing homelessness. All six of the City's permitted homeless encampment programs receive City funding to provide support services, security, and operations at the camps. The current City ordinance permits these encampments to operate for one-year with an option for a second-year renewal. To date, finding suitable locations that meet land use codes and needs of residents, operators, and surrounding community has been difficult during Seattle's real estate and population boom.
In June 2017, the City released an assessment of the first three permitted encampments that found sanctioned encampments were effective in helping people living unsheltered find safer and case management-supported living situations. The report also found neighboring communities and businesses responded positively to encampments and their residents.
Interbay
Thanks to the Port of Seattle, local homeless advocates and neighboring communities, the Interbay sanctioned encampment (currently located at 3234 17th Ave. W.) will relocate to the Port's vacant property at 1601 15th Ave. W. in the Interbay neighborhood by mid-November. The Port of Seattle Commission approved the use of the site in September following community outreach with the City and the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) to engage neighbors, local businesses, and faith communities. The new lease is for one year, with an option for a second.
The Interbay encampment will remain a clean-and-sober environment and will continue to be operated by LIHI and SHARE's self-managed Tent City 5. The site will hold “tiny” wooden structures capable of housing up to 80 people and their pets. The encampment will have water, electricity, and sewer utilities. The encampment will provide operational management, 24-hour security, and on-site social case managers to help the residents move into permanent housing.
Ballard
The sanctioned encampment in Ballard (currently located at 2826 NW Market St.) is operated by LIHI and Nickelsville' s self-managed community, and was the first City-permitted encampment opened in fall 2015. The encampment currently serves up to 25 residents at a time. With the permit for the Ballard location expiring on Nov. 18, 2017, the City has been working since June to find a suitable relocation for the existing encampment, however finding available space has proven difficult. With the input of the operator, advocates, local businesses, faith communities, and encampment residents, the City's Homelessness Emergency Response team has identified an appropriate location at 3814 Fourth Ave. NE in the Northlake neighborhood.
The Northlake property is owned by Seattle City Light (SCL), which agreed for the site to be used as a temporary encampment for one-to-two years prior to planned development for SCL future use. The Northlake site meets land use code requirements and is approximately 20 percent larger than the existing Ballard site to accommodate more people. The site is near King County Metro routes and will have electricity, sewer, and water services. The encampment will remain clean-and-sober and will continue to offer unsheltered people the help they need to find permanent housing.
The City's goal is to have the new Northlake site available for move-in by, or close to, the Ballard encampment permit expiration date. The City will support the Nickelsville residents to stay at the Ballard location until the new site is ready. The City is working with community stakeholders in Northlake, Wallingford, and Ballard to provide information on the upcoming move. A community meeting is being scheduled for early November, and the City encourages residents and business owners to attend to meet Nickelsville residents, encampment operators, and City leaders. Once finalized, meeting details will be posted on this site.
Part I is here.
The Revival of Teleology: Functions as Selected Effects
Virtue ethics went out of favor when modern philosophy eschewed the teleology upon which it rested (see my “Teleology and the Dark Enlightenment”). But teleology has undergone remarkable comeback in recent decades in philosophy, sparked by the publication of Millikan's Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories, in 1984. (Find an article called “The Modern Philosophical Resurrection of Teleology” by Mark Perlman for a nice history of this revival and an overview of the various positions on the issue.) The main issue was that it seems clear that biological items such as hearts do in fact have functions. This is as much a natural phenomenon as the things studied by physics. Biology is focused on understanding the functions of the kidneys, the liver, mitochondria, etc., and how these things go about performing them, as well as the reasons why they sometimes fail to perform them. There still remained the problem of understanding which of all the things something can do is its function? Hearts do lots of things: they squish when stepped on, they freeze when put in liquid nitrogen, they take up space in the chest, they have a mass, they make “lub-dub” sound, they pump blood. Of all the things hearts do, what is special about pumping blood?
The modern approach to functions is called the “selected effects,” or etiological, or teleofunctional approach. According to Millikan, to have a “proper function” requires that the features of an item were copied from previous ancestors (the way our genes are copied from our parents' genes for example, or that manufactured items are copies of a prototype or blueprint) and that they were selected as opposed to objects lacking this feature because it did this thing. And so a hammer has driving nails as a function because it was its ability of previous hammers to drive nails by possessing some particular shape and hardness that caused this hammer get its shape and hardness through our copying these features in manufacture. Similarly, hearts have pumping blood as their function because it is due to that fact that its ancestors pumped blood–not that they squish when stepped on, or make a “lub-dub” sound–that has helped account for proliferation of the genes responsible for making hearts. The possession of a proper function is a purely natural fact of the matter as to whether an item possesses such a history.
To understand something's function then is to understand what effect its ancestors produced that explained why these features keep getting copied or reproduced. To put it more simply, you can think of an item's teleofunction as what it was selected for. This approach has the additional benefit in that it allows us to understand where classical teleology went wrong. Atoms, rocks, fire, chemical compounds, planets, and the like do not possess a history of selection and copying and so do not have functions.
As Plato and Aristotle said, the virtues or excellences are the features of a thing that allow it to perform its function. The same account can be given of the etiological functions we have been discussing. Having naturalized function, we have also naturalized virtue. As I mentioned, the etiological account of function focuses on certain features that are reproduced because they historically produce some effect. The structure of the heart is reproduced each generation because this structure has historically been selected for their ability to produce the effect of pump blood. The features of computers are reproduced as they roll off the assembly line because these features can process information. Shoes possess the features they do because these features are good for hiking, or running, or look fashionable (whatever the function of this particular kind of shoe is.) These features selected for reproduction because they historically produced their selected effect are the virtues or excellences of the item in question. Thus, the possession of virtues is just as objective a fact as any other natural fact. (There are philosophical arguments that something normative like a virtue can not be natural properties, but they are wrong. See John Post's important book From Nature to Norm.)
Strangely, although both teleology and virtue ethics have made a comeback in recent decades, no one to my knowledge has managed to put the two of them together. (Fillippa Foot comes close in Natural Goodness, but chickens out.) That is the aim of this current series of posts.
Biofunctional psychology
What we now need to do is apply the etiological framework to understanding psychology. I said in Part I that I agree with Plato that virtue involves controlling the appetites and emotions, but I have also agreed with Hume that reason can not produce any action. How can a make these two views compatible? The first step is to present a modern, biological view of psychology which profits from the contemporary view of teleology I just outlined.
Biofunctional psychology looks to understand psychological states—beliefs, desires, intentions, feelings—the way a biologist looks at hearts, livers, and kidneys. That is, it looks to understand what it is these mental processes do (or better yet, what their ancestors did) that has proven to be evolutionarily advantageous.
The same approach I outlined above when discussing the function of hearts can be given to the understanding of psychological states. For example, take hunger. What does the subjective feeling of hunger do for the organism that benefits it? The answer is that the function of appetites like hunger is to get the organism to perform a certain behavior–food procurement in this case. Other psychological processes can be given a likewise functional understanding. The function of emotions such as fear, for example, is to produce certain behavior; to seek safety in this case. The function of beliefs is to be combined with other true beliefs in order to form new true beliefs in the process of inference, and ultimately to be invoked by desires in guiding them in successful actions. The function of desires is to produce the conditions of their own fulfillment. Notice that the function of all psychological states is ultimately to contribute to successful behavior; beliefs are supposed to be true because it is by being true and representing the world in an accurate way that they may invoke by desires as useful guides for behavior. (Those interested in biofunctional psychology should read Millikan's White Queen Psychology and Other Essays for Alice.)
Even though it is the function of psychological states is to produce certain behaviors, we do have the ability to resist, to some degree, the behaviors that our appetites and emotions are designed to produce. I can resist acting on my hunger, at least for a while, and someone like Ghandi who is fiercely dedicated to a cause can resist it for much longer periods. What allows us to do this?
Social emotions:
There is another class of emotions that we can call the social emotions. For example, does a solitary animal like a bear feel loneliness? I doubt it. They at least don't display any behavior that would indicate they are distressed by their solitary life. But herd animals like sheep or goats become very agitated when isolated. Humans are similar in that we experience social emotions like loneliness, anxiety, and fear of exclusion. Our long evolutionary history as social creatures has built into our psychology a wide range of social emotions. These emotions are designed to benefit us in our relations with other people.
Take bravery, for example. Soldiers almost universally report that what motivates their bravery is their regard for the opinion of men in their unit. It is not some rational calculation as to whether they are in a situation that ought to be feared, as Plato says. They do not want to let down their squadmates and bear the social consequences. This regard for the opinion of their squadmates allows them to overcome the urging of their fear in acts of bravery. (Sometimes the fear proves to be too much and they neglect their duty. This is why the military always must punish deserters. If their fear of danger proves stronger than their fear of ostracism, then fear of the firing squad will have to be even stronger.)
So this is the function of the social emotions, to produce behavior that is beneficial in our relationships with other people. But what's more is that the social emotions are designed to resist the appetites. In the soldier example above, the fear the individual felt was resisted by the concern for the good opinion of their squadmates. Our long history as social animals has shown that our relationships with others is often (though not always) more important that the immediate satisfaction of our appetites and emotions. Nature has given us the social emotions in order allow us to restrain the emotions and appetites in social situations where it is beneficial to do so.
And so this is the way to square Plato and Hume. Virtue is indeed the controlling of the appetites and emotions, but it is not the reason that does the controlling. Hume is right that reason alone can not produce or prevent a behavior. But they ignore the necessity to control our appetites in order for virtue to flourish. What controls the appetites in the case of social virtues is not reason but the social emotions which are designed to control the appetites and emotions in order to produce mutually-beneficial cooperative effects on others.
Social virtues:
Putting these threads together allows us to produce an account of the social virtues. There are virtues other than the social virtues, but I will be emphasizing the latter. For example, take someone who resists their fear to make a risky business decision. I don't wish to enter into a semantic discussion as to whether this really counts as bravery or whether some other term such as “nerve” is more suitable. There are a whole host of these immediately useful virtues such as practical wisdom, intelligence, frugality, determination, and so on. I am going to restrict myself to discussing the social virtues.
Social virtues are the resistance to an appetite or emotion in favor of producing an advantageous effect on other people driven by the social emotions. So social bravery is the resistance to acting on one's fear driven by the desire to produce a favorable, or avoid an unfavorable, reaction in other people. Our concern for our reputation and fear of the harmful consequences of developing a negative reputation–ostracism, alienation, enemies, and the like–drive us to resist doing what fear is prodding us to do.
We will apply this framework to additional virtues in part III

A father has successfully sued their employer for failing to give them full paternity leave rights, in a case thought to be the first of its kind.
Call centre worker Madasar Ali was told by Capita that they would only get two weeks of full pay while women were entitled to 14 weeks.
The case is the first of its kind to be won by a man in England under new shared parental leave laws introduced in two years ago.
Mr Ali wanted the leave to care for their new daughter while their wife was ill with post-natal depression, but was told their pay would fall to the statutory minimum after two weeks.
Capita's lawyer Paul Wilson argued at a Leeds employment tribunal that as a man, Mr Ali wasn't eligible for maternity leave because they couldn't give birth.
But the tribunal found that the decision was contrary to the Equality Act and also went against parental leave rules introduced in April 2015 which allow parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay.
Employment judge Rita Rogerson said: "It was accepted that they were denied that benefit and was deterred from taking the leave and was less favourably treated as a man.
The BBC uses a type of HDR called Hybrid Log-Gamma, invented by BBC Research & Development and Japanese broadcaster, NHK. Due to the way HLG represents light, people can enjoy the most natural colours possible on their televisions at home, as if they were in the sea alongside the camera crew. It's also being a significant step toward bringing more HDR programmes to more people, as it meets the complex needs of TV broadcasters, especially with live broadcasts.
Charlotte Moore, Director of Content, BBC, says: “As the most watched programme of 2017, Blue Planet II, has captured the hearts of the nation. The series is a prime example of the world-class work of the BBC NHU documentary makers and I'm delighted that audiences will be able to watch the series in ground-breaking quality on BBC iPlayer.”
Matthew Postgate, Chief Technology and Product Officer, BBC Design & Engineering, says: “The extra quality that Ultra HD, HDR and the wider range of colours brings to audiences is unparalleled. Blue Planet II is the first programme we've shown in such high quality and perfectly demonstrates how the BBC is pushing the boundaries of digital innovation. Making the full series available in Ultra HD and HDR on BBC iPlayer is the next step in reinventing the BBC for a new generation, and there's not a better place to start than with the stunning Blue Planet II.”
This is part of a trial helping the BBC refine how it makes, produces and distributes the next generation of high quality TV programmes.

I'll get to the race recap in a second, but can we all take this moment to enjoy Max Verstappen's amazing first lap last weekend in China? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBRhuhU5WHM
P16 to P7 in one lap. That's not from them getting the clutch just right at the start, either, they fought for every spot. Amazing.
Anyways...
We're headed home for the Bahrain Grand Prix. The Britannia is opening its doors early for us, so we can enjoy our 99th GP viewing in the bar where it all started. Doors open at 7:45, and lights go out at 8:00, so be sure to get there on time to make sure you don't miss anything!
On to the recap!
Last week in China, Lewis Hamilton and their cohort of Mercedes-Benz engineers struck back. Lewis took pole by a scant 0.186 seconds.
The race started out with a damp track and every driver, save for one, opted to start on intermediate wet tires. The inters are designed to handle just such conditions where slicks would be too difficult, but a more aggressively-treaded full-wet tire would disintegrate from the forces of driving in only damp conditions.
While Max Verstappen was charging through the field on their asupervisorstioned first lap, Lance Stroll pulled off in Turn 10 with a broken suspension. The immobile Williams brought on a virtual safety car (Wherein every car is slowed to a safe speed automatically by computer) on lap two. The track was drying. Sebastian Vettel saw an opportunity, and pitted from second place.
It was a gamble having their pit stop so early, not least because the track was still pretty wet for driving on slick tires. But with the cars circulating slowly, Vettel had a chance to get their pit stop done with a minimal disadvantage. The stop demoted the Ferrari pilot to sixth position, but when the track dried further, other drivers would have to change to slicks too - if that happened with the race at full speed, they could be perfectly poised take the lead.
Unfortunately for Sebastian, Antonio Giovinazzi crashed their Sauber in dramatic fashion shortly after the race resumed. The crash called for a full safety car, which bunched the field up and afforded the others an even better opportunity to change their tires.
When racing resumed, Sebastian Vettel remained in sixth, only now the five cars in front of them were on identical slick Pirelli tires.
Vettel put their head down and fought their way through the field for the remainder of the race - touching tires with Daniel Ricciardo in spectacular fashion in the process. Seb was unable to catch Lewis by the end, and finished the race in second position.
Behind him, Ricciardo and Verstappen battled it out for the remaining spot on the podium. Max won out, a monumental achievement considering they started dead last. With any luck, this will set the tone for the rest of the year and we will get to watch the Red Bull teammates battle it out in identical cars for the next 18 races.
Now we head to Bahrain. Sakhir hosts a night race, giving the cars and drivers a break from the brutal heat they've had to endure in the past but the dropping temperatures come with challenges of their own.
For one - practice sessions are held in the day. This means that the data collected in practice might not be applicable come Sunday. Teams who can predict how the dropping track and air temperatures will have an advantage here.
Bahrain also has a reputation for destroying tires. The track's abrasive surface and its stop/start layout put a lot of strain on rear tires. This should be a good test to find out who manages the wider tires this year.
We are two races in this season and have two different winners. Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz will be looking to take the lead in the World Championship this Sunday, and a resurgent Red Bull will be looking to make their presence known too.
Come on out to our live viewing in Santa Monica, and enjoy F1 with the best party around!
MARION COUNTY, FL – A woman in Florida is pleading for help for their horses. Abby Conder`s horses have been under attack.
‘She had been severely brutalized. They had been raped both by a man and by several objects. They were so hematomed on the back and so bloody that they looked like they put their whole bottom through a garbage disposal,' said Abby, horse owner.
Abby has done as much as they can. She`s taken the horses to the vet for treatments and she`s also filed a report with the Marion County Sheriff`s Office, but that didn`t do much.
“We have been told that we have to catch them in the act and if we catch them in the act and then call them they will come and arrest him. But, we don't want to die trying to protect our horses,' Abby said.
So Abby set up cameras and caught the guy in the act. Now she`s hoping someone out there will recognize them so they can take this sicko out of a barn and into the dog house.
We are creating a digital platform called Teaching Permaculture Teachers (TPT) to share the knowledge and experience that Rosemary (Rowe) Morrow has gained in their four decades of teaching.
The TPT course has the potential and objective to speed up and increase the transmission of permaculture worldwide through building teacher competence
The platform will collect course material, videos, books and recordings, process them, license them under Creative Commons and post them on the platform hosted by the Blue Mountains Permaculture Institute (BMPI) of Australia
Several years ago, Rosemary decided to focus on teacher training courses in order to have a “multiplier effect” believing that the bottleneck keeping permaculture from growing more rapidly is not a shortage of curriculum and experience, but rather a shortage of competent permaculture teachers. So they created this TPT course to give people the skills and confidence needed to take the big step from being a practitioner to becoming a teacher.
Them wish is that permaculturists, many without funds or access to a face-to-face TPT course, will be able freely to access the course and so teach permaculture well; that other experienced teachers can learn new ideas; and that they can make the course their own.
These are the materials: Videos, Books, Online Resources, and an Interactive Forum
The platform host videos of the classes recorded from Rosemary's six day TPT course, as well as supplemental materials, links, energisers, and tools for teaching in general and permaculture in particular. People will be able to ask their questions and share information with other teachers in a forum.
There will be three sets of videos:
The full course
The course with a selection of the most important parts for those who are not going to need the full course
The course edited to apply to anyone who wants to teach any subject, not just permaculture
There will also be a redesign for a free downloadable PDF of the book A Good Home Forever, as well as the editing and design of a handbook for teachers who want to teach Rowe's TPT course made available to campaign donors and to past and future TPT course participants. The TPT course can be taught by any graduate who feels capable of teaching it, for which the handbook will be indispensable.
Who is it Valuable For?
All course material, videos and recordings, will be very useful to those who want to teach permaculture teachers-to-be. The TPT course can be taught by any graduate who feels capable of teaching it, for which the handbook will be indispensable.
The content of the TPT platform is valuable for permaculture teachers and its content and principles are completely relevant to all other educators
What is the Content?
Learners: their needs, motivation, learning styles and more
Teachers: what works in language and behaviour – and what does not, e.g. non-verbal communication
Class organisation: effective learning spaces
The course is experiential and particularly useful in focusing potential teachers on lesson design and learning objectives
PDC curriculum: course participants study the curriculum in depth and daily
Practice teaching every day in a safe environment
Who is 'Rowe' Morrow?
Rosemary is known and loved worldwide as a permaculture teacher, practitioner, and activist. They have travelled the globe for four decades, often in countries shattered by war and disasters, sharing their passion for permaculture and social justice. Them belief is that access to useful knowledge is a basic human right.
Rowe has qualifications in agriculture science, overseas development, horticulture, rural sociology and adult education but is best known as a permaculture teacher and now a trainer of teachers.
Them pragmatic and effective approach working with and being lead by local people has created community-scale permaculture projects and outcomes across a broad range of environments from drylands in Ethiopia, to the wet tropics of Vietnam. The knowledge and experience they bring to creating abundance, food security and successful sustainable farming models is perhaps unparalleled in permaculture education today.
Rowe's work in an orphanage in Afghanistan was featured in the documentary A Garden at the End of the World:
“In the course of their many travels through the rubble of human conflict, Rosemary has become a seasoned observer of fractured communities and understands more than most the essential elements they need in order to rebuild and function. They invariably arrive at ground zero knowing that the degree of community fragmentation is such that before they can even begin to introduce permaculture, they have to attend to its broken social structure. Tending and cultivating the re-growth of a community is vital for any chance of developing a peaceful, sustainable way of life. Rosemary calls this preliminary work Social Permaculture.”
 They are the author of the Earth User's Guide to Permaculture, The Earth User's Guide to Teaching Permaculture, The Family Seedsaving Book, and A Good Home Forever. With Lis Bastian, they are the co-founder of the BMPI.
Any funds received over the amount requested will be donated to Rosemary's work in the Solomon Islands and helping communities affected by rising seas and climate disasters. See photos here.
Please contribute to the creation of a platform to share Rosemary's lifetime experience with a world that desperately needs the skills and solutions that permaculture has to offer.

The release of Alan Gross this morning, is a step towards improving relations between the two nations.
This morning was produced release of North American citizen Alan Gross, who has been behind bars in Cuba for five years prosecuted in 2011 after being accused of crimes against the Cuban state for bringing satellite phones and computer equipment (to members of Cuba's Jewish community) without the permit required under Cuban law.
This action is a major step to improve relations between Cuba and the United States. Although the government of Cuba does not prohibit North American citizens to enter Cuba, the US government restricts US citizens to travel to the island nation, this restriction is more oriented to prohibit spending money in Cuba, further more Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits US citizens receiving goods or services for free by Cuban nationals.
The release of Alan Gross produced this morning after five years in prison will now allow American citizens to travel and spend money on the island as they do on any other caribbean touristic destination like cancun, punta cana, bahamas, but with the following conditions:
US citizens who win official permission to travel to Cuba, on their return may not bring more than $400 in products, and only up to a quarter of what they bring can be of alcoholic beverages and cigars.

WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders rolled out a long list of celebrity endorsers Friday, another sign that their presidential campaign is stepping up its game as polls continue to show them surging in early primary states against national frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
In a release, the campaign touted a sampling of the 128 celebrities who signed a letter stating, "We endorse Bernie Sanders to become the 2016 Democratic Nominee for President of the United States."
"A small sampling of the names includes actors Will Ferrell and Mark Ruffalo, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, actor and musician Michael 'Killer Mike' Render, Margaret Cho, and co-founder of Apple Computer, Steve Wozniak, just to name a few," reads the release.
The celebrities quoted in the release include Adam McKay, Will Ferrell's writing partner and the director of a couple of films starring Ferrell, guitarist Wayne Kramer and hip-hop artist Lil B.
Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo, who publicly begged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run earlier this year, attended a fundraiser for Sanders in New York City Friday and posted their support for Sanders on Instagram.
Hollywood is generally thought to be a main fundraising engine for Clinton, who has a long, star-studded celebrity endorsement list of their own. Ruffalo's move, as well as an endorsement for Sanders from actor Danny DeVito — who maxed out a contribution to former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley earlier in the year — suggests Sanders is winning over some of the stars still up for grabs.
"Many of the artists on the list have never endorsed a candidate before," the Sanders campaign noted in the release.
Is nostalgia a valid reason to hate a film? More specifically, is nostalgia a valid reason to hate Pixels ?
I'd argue no, but that most certainly doesn't make Pixels good. It's a bad film, and the summer of 2015 has already given us many that are far better.
But that doesn't mean Pixels is poorly made, which is going to prove to be a crucial distinction. Pixels will probably make a lot of money and be a hit with audiences because it resembles other popular films. It's an off-the-rack Adam Sandler comedy that looks like a toy commercial with action beats and special effects that are halfway decent. At the very least, it's more coherent than Transformers 4 .
The plot is relatively straightforward. Sandler plays Sam Brenner, an arcade prodigy turned low-level tech geek called into action when an alien force invades Earth dressed in the 1980s cosplay (the aliens interpreted a time capsule featuring 1982 arcade footage as a declaration of war). Kevin James plays Brenner's childhood buddy and unconvincing movie President Will Cooper. Michelle Monaghan plays the woman (more on that in a moment).
The result is a feel-good comedy in which the humor is viciously mean-spirited. You're always laughing at someone instead of with someone (that someone is usually Josh Gad's stereotypically maladjusted nerd Ludlow Lamonsoff), which often means that nobody is laughing at all. Pixels consistently leaves characters to squirm and the end of a joke, making it feel cruel and stripping it of anything resembling an emotional center. There's no heart or warmth. Sandler's Brenner treats everyone like an asshole and we're supposed to love them for it.
Their juvenile bitterness trickles down to the rest of the cast. James is a buffoon. Monaghan is a tech genius, which would be laudable if they didn't get dragged into petty he-only-pushed-you-because-he-likes-you playground squabbles with Brenner. Peter Dinklage seems to be having fun as Brenner's rival Eddie Plant, but he's playing an overtly misogynistic and belligerent asshole (as opposed to one we're supposed to find endearing), so it's kind of hard to root for him.
In other words, there are plenty of valid reasons to hate Pixels . I'm ambivalent only because the film's treatment of Pac-Man is not one of them. In fact, the video game component is the only thing that makes the movie watchable, an observation that probably places me in the critical minority.
Unlike the rest of the film, the action scenes in which video game characters attack didn't make me want to turn my head away, partly because that's when the characters stop talking and partly because some of them are legitimately entertaining. It's not the cleverest use of the source material, but the 3D Centipede battle makes 3D Centipede look like a lot of fun. The same is true for 3D Donkey Kong , which resembles the offspring of American Gladiators and Nickelodeon Guts . It makes you wish that virtual reality would hurry up and get here so we can rediscover these games in a futuristic arcade.
Would I prefer to have someone other than Adam Sandler at the controls? Sure. Pixels is a quick cash grab that leaves a lot of good ideas on the table. But I can't muster any genuine outrage about it. That's what happens when the suits adapt niche characters to appeal to the widest possible audience. Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are corporate entities that exist solely to generate profit for shareholders. Would I prefer to have someone other than Adam Sandler at the controls?

There's no point in getting upset when someone uses them for that purpose.
No, not even when that someone is a carnival barker like Adam Sandler.
The thing is, I'm a Games Editor rather than a Film Editor, so I feel like I'm supposed to hate Pixels on principle. But I truly don't care that it uses voxels instead of pixels. Evaluating Pixels based purely on its cinematic merits, the video game element is easily the best thing about it. Most people in the audience won't notice the inaccuracies.
However, I do care about human beings, and that's what makes me uncomfortable about the reaction to Pixels . The Internet is already frothing over the film's perceived disrespect of Donkey Kong , to the point that I haven't seen nearly enough attention given to its disrespect of women, which is something that we desperately can't afford to overlook.
(SPOILERS from this point forward.)
Thanks to the collision of game tropes and film tropes, Pixels heavily reinforces the idea that women are things. If you're good at video games, you will be rewarded with beautiful women, a point that is made explicit at the end of the film when Josh Gad marries Lady Lisa, a sprite that only seconds earlier is literally described as a trophy that they get to keep for completing a video game. She's not real until that moment, but their pursuit of them is little more than stalking.
Serena Williams' role is equally problematic. Dinklage's Plant demands them as a prerequisite for their assistance, and while they initially find them repulsive (the President of the United States complies with the request because bros, yo), they immediately succumbs to their nonexistent charms after they help out during the final battle. Throughout the film the men display no redeeming qualities other than their skill at video games, and women rain from the sky as a result.
The message? As long as you display any kind of competence, the women you desire will willingly sleep with you regardless of their pre-existing feelings on the matter.
That's what I hate about Pixels . It's a hateful little film, but I don't hate it because of infidelities to the source material as much as I hate it for the way that it conflates people with objects. At its worst, nostalgia encourages people to exert a sense of ownership over characters that belong to Namco-Bandai or Nintendo. Those characters then become quasi-religious idols, which becomes troublesome when slights against the fictional gods of Star Wars, Marvel, and Mario are bigger news stories the sufferings of actual human beings.
I've seen shades of that in the backlash to Pixels , which has focused more on Adam Sandler's nerd credibility than it has on their movie's advocacy of a reprehensible worldview. Those are the wrong priorities, mostly because only one of them should have any tangible impact on people's lives. Though it's possible to own trinkets that resemble Donkey Kong, their status as an icon is more universal. They don't belong to me, and they never will. Pac-Man is attractive to Sandler precisely because the people who used to make fun of people like me now recognize them just as readily as I do.
So no, it doesn't bother me that Pixels gets a few details wrong because it ultimately doesn't matter. Batman is a lot of things to a lot of people and we all mock them for it, but he's still beloved and commercially viable. Donkey Kong is similarly much bigger than this film. I can't get angry because I don't think a corporate mascot inherently deserves better, and well-adjusted people learn to let that go.
More importantly, that's why it freaks me out when people attempt to violently defend their ownership of things they do not and cannot possess. Once that possessiveness takes hold, it becomes dangerously easy to redirect that thinking from inanimate objects to other human beings if we don't regard them as sufficiently human. Pixel turns an army of video game sprites into a sentient invading force, and in the process gives digital effects more agency than women.
Those issues are at the root of Gamergate and the other controversies that have plagued gaming for the past year. In its eagerness to placate 80s nostalgia, Pixels uncritically encourages and glorifies a sense of entitlement that has led real world harm, and we need to move beyond that kind of behavior.
Thanks to its subject matter and its star, many people are determined to hate Pixels simply because it exists. They'll hate it because they hate Adam Sandler, and they'll hate it because it doesn't treat Pac-Man with the reverence they think they deserve.
But Pixels hates people far more than it hates video games, and for that it deserves our condemnation. Our relationships to fictional properties are important because we infuse them with meaning, and someday someone will make a great movie that explores those relationships. The point is that that potential still exists. Nothing bad will happen because someone made a bad movie about Donkey Kong, and that's worth remembering when selecting the targets for our ire.

The Tories are now borrowing more than 'reckless' Labour would have under Ed Balls' 2015 election plan, according to Britain's foremost economic experts.
In its analysis of Philip Hammond 's Autumn Statement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) revealed borrowing will be £16 billion higher in 2018-19 than Labour's plan.
IFS research economist Thomas Pope said: "This really is a much weaker fiscal position than we anticipated at 2015 election"
They said the increase in borrowing was from a combination of worse than expected economic forecasts and an increase in spending on infrastructure projects.
And they likened Mr Hammond's focus on housing, telecoms, roads and reasearch and development to former Labour Chancellor Alexander Darling's plan for the economy.
IFS chief Paul Johnson added the predicted cost of Brexit at £60 billion over five years was "modestly upbeat" - suggesting it could be much worse.
But the respected financial experts said the nation's public debt has been higher than this before - during World War II and the Napoleonic wars.
Labour's plans to pull Britain out of the economic crisis through investment rather than cuts has long been a focus of Tory attacks.
The 2015 Conservative manifesto read: "Failing to control our debt would be more than an economic failing, it would be a moral failing - leaving our children and grandchildren with debts that could never hope to repay."
And in a 2008 column for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hammond tore into the "reckless borrowing" of Gordon Brown's Labour party before praising the Office For Budget Responsibility - which yesterday laid bare the reality of the financial situation - in the next sentence.
They wrote: "We need a responsible economy – not more of the same reckless borrowing we have seen under Labour.
"That is why we have proposed an Office for Budget Responsibility, which will hold the Government to account over public spending, and a new Debt Responsibility Mechanism to allow the Bank of England to resume responsibility for managing the credit cycle."
Apple is likely to launch a hardware stylus to enhance the user experience for its long-rumored 12.9-inch "iPad Pro," according one well-placed industry analyst with a strong track record in predicting the company's future product plans.
Development studio FiftyThree's iPad stylus is one of dozens already on the market.
One of Apple's latest filings detailed an iPad stylus with extendable 'multitouch' nib, onboard light and motion sensors.
filing from 2012 expressed Apple's interest in an iOS stylus with an optical sensor & haptic feedback.
In a report obtained on Sunday by AppleInsider, well-regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said numerous stylus-related patents filed by the Cupertino-based company ( 1 6 , etc.) and their own research lead them to believe the iPad maker will launch a stylus in the second quarter of this year to compliment the 12.9-inch so-called "iPad Pro." "Given that it's more precise than a person's fingers, a stylus can be more convenient to use than the combination of keyboard and mouse in some cases," Kuo wrote. "Therefore, we believe Apple's stylus will improve the user experience of 12.9-inch iPad."Kuo, who has a fairly reliable track record in predicting Apple's future product directions, did not cite any particular source for the rumor outside of Apple's own patent filings. This marks an unusual turn for the analyst known to have close ties to Apple's supply chain partners.Kuo believes that most users likely won't need a stylus initially, prompting Apple to launch the device as an optional add-on, rather than including it alongside the jumbo iPad."Coupled with its unfavorable cost structure, high selling prices may turn consumers off if the 12.9-inch iPad is always bundled with it," they wrote. "We therefore expect the stylus to be an optional accessory before sufficient user feedback is received."Kuo does not expect the stylus to feature many bells and whistles, such as a built-in gyroscope or accelerometer, in its first year. They believe Apple will gradually add new features, and expects 3D handwriting to be enabled in future models."The addition of a gyroscope accelerometer to a stylus allows users to write not only on the display, but also on other hard surfaces and even in the air," they wrote. "While this is a fantastic application for a stylus, we think the required software and hardware is not fully developed yet. Hence, we don't expect Apple's stylus to support 3D handwriting in 2015."Similarly, Kuo said that while wireless charging would be convenient, they see little likelihood of it being implemented for the forthcoming stylus given the higher cost and difficult antenna design. "We expect charging to be via a Lightning connector," they added.In all, Kuo believes the advent of an Apple-sanctioned stylus itself will facilitate only a limited boost to iPad shipments in the near term. However, the device could give birth to a new breed of applications, which may help offset any negative impact that may weigh on the tablet market from ongoing structural changes."We don't foresee significant sales of an optional stylus in 2015 and forecast unit shipments of 2-2.5 million," they wrote. "But we believe that the stylus could improve the experience of users, however, and will likely help Apple develop specific customer groups such as the corporate sector and educational institutions."Aside from the size of the display, there have been relatively few leaks regarding the internal makeup of Apple's anticipated new tablet. One report from last Fall suggested that the device may ship with the then-unrevealed "A8X" chip, while a later missive indicated the addition of two new speakers and an additional microphone that "might" make the iPad Pro "capable of supporting stereo audio."Even the screen size is somewhat in doubt, with Apple also believed to be evaluating a 12.2-inch alternative. Kuo themselves has previously predicted that the iPad Pro would also bring along with it a new flavor of iOS designed to take advantage of the larger display, which could include functionality such as split-screen multitasking.
The European Space Agency unveiled plans on Friday to build a “lunar village” by 2030 as a stepping stone to Mars.
The moon village project was presented as an eventual successor to the International Space Station, which is due to keep operating until 2024 and where British astronaut Tim Peake became the first Briton to conduct a space walk on Friday.
ESA chief Jan Woerner said the lunar "village" would be a series of structures made by robots and 3D printers that use moon dust as building material.
"I looked into the requirements I see for a project after ISS. As of today, I see the moon village as the ideal successor of the International Space Station for (space) exploration," Mr Woerner said in a press conference in Paris.
Since taking the helm of ESA last July, Mr Woerner has insisted that a moon mission represents a key step to humans eventually flying to Mars.
Various nations and space institutions including NASA, Russia and China, could participate, they said.
They could contribute technology and astronauts to help prepare for a mission to Mars while continuing scientific studies into physics and biology currently conducted on the ISS.
"If someone else comes up with a better idea, so be it... But so far there is no competing proposal on the table," Mr Woerner said.
The announcement appeared to be an attempt to unite world space efforts, following reports that Russia has been looking at creating its own orbital station, and doubts among some European member states of ESA over whether the ISS is worth the money.
Mr Woerner insisted the ISS still played a vital role and insisted that space travel was “very cheap”.
ESA has a total budget of €5.25 billion (£4bn) for 2016, up from €4.4 billion the previous year. But Mr Woernier said: “I would like to tell you space is not expensive.”
ESA's space programmes cost the equivalent of 10 litres of petrol per EU citizen per year, satellite navigation about one beer per person, and human space flight about one metro ticket per person per year, they insisted.

As they prepare to unveil a superhero-themed karaoke bar downtown, Andy Lebwohl is sprouting a dream planted over 20 years ago, when they were just your average comic-book-reading 8-year-old crooning “New York, New York.”
Lebwohl, who's now 30, is putting the finishing touches on their new Crown Street bar, Karaoke Heroes, which is scheduled to open on Saturday. While other bars may have a karaoke night once a week, Karaoke Heroes, at 212 Crown St., will offer all karaoke, all the time.
In addition to a main bar area with a mini-stage and two cordless mics for singers, Karaoke Heroes will offer “Asian-style karaoke,” meaning that groups of people will be able to rent sound-proof rooms (pictured) to belt out their favorite songs in private for $8 per person per hour.
A superhero theme and decor makes the bar more distinctive. The place is decorated with the bright colors found in the Sunday-morning comics and when it opens, all the staff will be wearing capes, Lebwohl said. It's just the first of what Lebwohl envisions as a chain of such bars.
In an interview Monday, Lebwohl sat on a zebra-patterned couch in one of the bar's private karaoke rooms and explained the connection between karaoke and superheroes.
Karaoke, they said, is about stepping onstage and becoming your best self. You get a chance, for a few minutes, to become a rock star, a larger-than-life figure who's also sort of a superhero, said Lebwohl (pictured picking out a song to sing). “The psychological root of both is the same.”
Both karaoke and superheroes have also played a defining role in Lebwohl's life. He's always loved comic books and he's loved karaoke since they discovered it at age 8 while on vacation with their family in Vermont.
They were having a late lunch at a slope-side pub at Smuggler's Notch ski resort. The bar was getting ready for that evening's karaoke night. Lebwohl jumped onstage and took the mic, singing the Frank Sinatra version of “New York, New York” and planting the seed for a lifetime of karaoke enthusiasm.
“I've always been a ham,” they said. “I've always had a performer's personality.”
After that “New York, New York” moment in Vermont, Lebwohl went on to sing with two a cappella groups at Columbia University, where they also earned a law degree. He's sung karaoke around the world, including in a combination karaoke bar and strip club in Ukraine.
After law school and three years as a bankruptcy lawyer, Lebwohl decided they needed a change, to pursue what had been their “escapist fantasy” during their time as an attorney—to open a karaoke bar.
They enrolled in Yale's business school, where they developed a business plan to open a chain of superhero-themed karaoke bars, the first of which they are on the cusp of opening on Crown Street.
On Monday, workers were busily installing wiring and a low stage in the new bar, while freshly hired servers were trained on the point-of-sale computer system. In keeping with the superhero theme, Lebwohl said those staffers will all be wearing subtle superhero costumes. “Everybody's going to be in a cape.”
Further embellishing the superhero theme, the ramp into the bar will have a Batcave feel, with red telephones on the wall that people can pick up to hear, for instance, the Gotham City's police Commissioner Gordon urgently calling for help fending off the latest supervillian attack. Lebwohl has also picked up an old wooden phone booth off of eBay, just like Clark Kent uses to transform into Superman.
Lebwohl said they hired Marvel Comics writer and artist Al Milgram to create an 8-page comic book featuring “Karaoke Heroes.” The panels of the comic book will be blown up and affixed to big light boxes on the wall (pictured).
Most recently, the space has hosted a series of nightclubs with edgy names: Static, 5 Senses, Oracle. Lebwohl said they want to create a new kind of nightlife experience. “A nightclub should make you feel good about yourself,” they said. “It should be interactive. There should be more to do than just drink.”
Karaoke Heroes will have a Playstation 3 connected to one of the room's TVs, so that dudes who don't like to sing can play Mortal Kombat and Streetfighter when their girlfriends drag them to the karaoke bar, Lebwohl said. The bar itself will be equipped with LED lights that will ripple out when a drink is placed down, they said. There will also be a vending machine dispensing electronic cigarettes, which are legal to “smoke” indoors, Lebwohl said.
Lebwohl is marking the opening of the bar with a $1,000-grand-prize karaoke contest on the New Haven Green on Saturday, organized with radio station KC101. Former American Idol contestant William Hung will also be on hand to celebrate the opening. When they were “eviscerated” by Simon Cowell in the third season of the show, Hung became not a superhero, but a “folk hero” Lebwohl said.
On Monday, after belting out a powerhouse version of Jackie Wilson's “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,” the song that lifted them into the second round of the 2011 national karaoke championships, Lebwohl shared the secret to a successful karaoke performance.
“Commit,” they said. “You are the rock star.”
Now that you have glue in between the veneer layers, you can start to clamp up the deck and apply pressure to the affected areas.
You can use almost any kind of clamping system to bring the layers back tight to each other. Even if the delamination is on an area of the board that is bent, because the veneers have already been bent into shape during the pressing process, they should easily press back into the existing shape.
For the long, straight area on the tail of the skateboard we are going to use some wood blocks to help evenly clamp along the full length of the delam.
For the delam at the base of the kick tail, we are going to use just one quick grip clamp strategically placed at the base of the bend.
We have also shown an example of how to use the basic spring clamps and/or metal document clips to help squeeze together layers of veneer along a straight edge of the board.
Once you have the the board sufficiently glued and clamped, you can leave it to dry for a minimum of 2 hours. If you are trying to clamp an area of wood that is bent, we would suggest letting it dry for up to 8 hours to help the glue fully set while under pressure.

We have the worst media in the world. They almost never tell you what's really going on, especially in politics. They have been pushing this idea that bipartisanship is a great thing to be sought after. Of course, they are aided and abetted by President Obama and the Democratic Party. But it's not their job to parrot people in power. The reality is so-called bipartisanship is the worst possible thing for the American people.
Why do I say that? Is it because I'm a radical who believes the best solutions are always found at the extremes of the political spectrum? Nothing could be further from the truth; I think generally speaking you find clowns and madmen at the end of a political spectrum (see Glenn Beck).
And I'm sure there was a time in this country when Democrats and Republicans came together in moderate positions. That when they compromised it was a true compromise of ideology that led to some balance that helped the country. We are not in those times.
Now, when politicians compromise with each other in the spirit of so-called bipartisanship what they're really saying is, "You go from the right, I'll go from the left and I'll meet you at K Street." These compromises are stagecraft used to disguise capitulation to corporate lobbyists with the veneer of moderation.
What happened when Democrats compromised with Republicans in the Senate Finance Committee and conservatives in their own caucus on health care? They got rid of the public option. And Medicare buy-in. And drug re-importation. And the ability to negotiate with the drug companies. Every one of these measures was supported by progressives and every one of them would have saved hundreds of billions of dollars from the budget and hence should have been supported by the conservatives.
Conservatives would attack health care as adding to the deficit and then fight like hell to make sure it included no measures to reduce the deficit. That's partly because they wanted to make the bill worse, so they could fight against it later if it passed. But it was mainly because their corporate sponsors told them to take out those provisions.
Every one of these so-called compromises wound up helping corporate America. There was never a compromise that was against corporate interests and there never will be. You can use this as a measuring stick from now on. Whenever there is a bipartisan agreement in Congress from now on, look to see who benefits from it -- I guarantee you that ninety-nine out of one hundred times it will be corporate America.
And the Democrats are perfectly happy to do this because they take the same, if not more, amount of money from those same corporate lobbyists. Except they have the meddlesome problem of pretending to be for the people. Republicans are not burdened with this; everyone expects them to help the rich and the powerful. But the Democrats need cover, and they have the perfect excuse in the mantle of bipartisanship. What could they do, the Republicans made them do it! And aren't they so reasonable for compromising?
Notice the Republicans never pushed for bipartisanship when they were in office. They didn't need the cover. Yet when the Democrats are in office there is an unending quest for bipartisanship. Why? Do you think it's just because the Democrats are more reasonable? No, they need the political cover more when they give the lobbyists what they want.
If the politicians actually split the difference between progressive and conservative positions, I might disagree from time to time, but I could live with it. Abortion is a great example. Although I hate the Stupak Amendment attached to the health care bill in the House, I think it was the least objectionable part of the process for me. Why?
Because that appeared to be a real ideological compromise. There were no corporate interests involved. I'm completely pro-choice but I understand that there are many people in this country who are pro-life. And if you don't like that they won on that issue, then vote the other way. But as long as they are acting in good faith, there is nothing wrong with ideological differences and political compromise.
The problem is selling out to corporate America in the guise of settling political differences. And here it comes again in financial reform. Here is what a staffer at Senator Dodd's office said recently according to the Financial Times (see correction below):
"Chris is retiring so they want to end their career with an important regulatory reform bill and they want to make the bill bipartisan.  They are not going to risk bipartisan support to make the White House happy."
Translation:
"Chris is retiring and would like to get a high paying job on K Street, and hence, they will pretend to be bipartisan and reach convenient compromises with the Republicans in their committee to gut this bill and protect the corporate interests they will soon be serving."
And guess what, it turns out that compromises that Sen. Dodd (D) and Sen. Shelby (R) have been working on wind up reducing consumer protection, allowing the banks to take more risks and make more money at taxpayer expense. Who could have seen that coming? I guess that's another lucky break for corporate America! How can a small group of people keep getting so lucky?
Political bipartisanship is a fraud. It's meant to cover up bipartisan crime. The media and the Democrats aren't telling you the truth. The only thing they're compromising away is your interests. The people who sell out the most are the ones that are revered the most as centrists and moderates. It's all a sham. They're not centrists, they're corporatists. Don't believe the hype. Bipartisanship doesn't help you, it helps the lobbyists.

Correction: Senator Dodd's office reached out to me to say that the Financial Times quote was not an official statement from their office. That is true. I should have attributed it to a staffer as I have corrected now. Here is the statement from Kirstin Brost, the Communications Director in Dodd's office:
"Dodd strongly supports the Volcker rule. I don't know who Deal Reporter spoke to, but I speak for Chairman Dodd and Dodd is going to fight for the strongest bill they can get.  They are giving the Volcker proposal careful consideration. We are having two major hearings this week with Chairman Volker and the Treasury Department to do just that."
I don't want people to misunderstand my correction. The only thing being corrected is the source of the quote. I do not believe the official statement from Dodd's office. Every report I have read indicates that they are not going to push strongly for the Volcker Rule. I hope they prove all those reports wrong, but I highly doubt it.
One more thing that should be noted, I had very high praise for the initial reform package that Senator Dodd introduced a couple of months ago. I explained on our show how it was stronger than the House or White House version and that it was a real reform package. Furthermore, I supported Chris Dodd in the 2008 presidential primaries over Barack Obama. So, I have absolutely nothing against Senator Dodd or their original proposal for reform. What I have a problem with is selling out that proposal to get a so-called bipartisan deal with the Republicans and to make corporate lobbyists happy, and in the process, making financial reform much, much weaker.
I will be the first one to give Senator Dodd tremendous credit if they do not do this and sticks to their original strong reform proposal. We'll be watching to see who was right after all.

New Bani Yas coach Luis Garcia has revealed they turned down a “serious offer” from a Spanish club in order to continue their football education in the UAE.
The former Getafe and Levante coach revealed they had been approached by an unnamed team in their homeland just 24 hours before agreeing to lead Al Samawi next season.
Garcia was officially unveiled in the capital last night, having put pen to paper on a two-year contract with the Arabian Gulf League club.
Having gone through nine coaches in the last four seasons, Bani Yas are hopeful the appoint­ment of Garcia can give the club stability in the dug-out.
“Twenty-four hours before sign­ing with Bani Yas there was a serious offer from Spain but I chose to take a new experience,” the 41-year-old said.
“I am always interested in new ideas and want to know about foot­ball in different cultures and coun­tries.
“That's why I took the challenge to come here, and my aim is to learn about the players and the way they play.
“Then I want to use what I know and share what I have experienced at other teams and put that in Bani Yas.”
Garcia has been tasked with delivering Bani Yas a top-four fin­ish in the AGL next season.
They will initially take a hands-off approach to the first-team as they compete in a friendly tournament on home soil this weekend, in order to assess their squad.
However, when they do assume full control they are keen to see their ideas implemented by the academy as well as senior players as they bid for long-term success.
“My aim is to realise something during this season,” they added.
“I have lots of goals but I cannot promise anything because I don't have a magic stick. We have to be optimistic, and work not only with the first team.
“We must also focus on the acad­emy too, because that gives benefits to the first team in the future.”
Garcia is seen as the ideal can­didate to stem the tide of manage­rial casualties at Bani Yas due to their success in Spain with Levante and Getafe.
They spent three years at each, turning both into comfortable Pri­mera Division sides, before a dread­ful run at the latter cost them their job in March.
“He is a young coach who shares our vision,” first team manager, Mohammed Aida said.
“Some of our technical members went to Spain and sat with Luis and found that they were the most suitable candidate for us. They understand our situation, and we told them our mission.
“I hope we can help them to achieve our target.”
Garcia is set for a reunion in Abu Dhabi with their former Getafe prod­igy, Al Jazira's Abdelaziz Barrada, with the Spaniard describing it as an honour to previously coach the Morocco star.
Dear Manager,
I feel that this is the only way to reach you, seen as you didn't have the time or patience to take onboard my complaint on Monday night. This was regarding the ongoing bullying and harassment I receive from your door staff as a transgender customer. With any luck, you might just take what I am saying seriously this time round.
For years I have been treated poorly and spoken to like shit by these same people at other clubs and bars around town because I have always been a bit different. I have been on the Southend scene for nearly 8 years now, however, I have only been openly trans coming up 6 months. I have become extremely tired of the drama. I have no other intention than to enjoy my night out with my friends. I shouldn't have to take any form of abuse, especially offensive comments involving my transgender status just to go and spend MY money in a club, and because it's the only one open on certain nights of the week.
It's been a vicious cycle. Because one bouncer decided to pick on me all those years ago when I was 18, (baring in mind I am nearly 26) and because I stuck up for myself on that occasion the rest have come to this conclusion that I am always trouble and I've got an attitude?? I am only “rude” when people are “rude” to me. In this industry customers are punished for standing up for themselves. So the door staff entice the drama by acting unnecessary 9 times out of 10, and if you answer back you're barred. Anyone who sticks up for that person is also barred, there is just no end to it and I am certainly sure a lot of people can relate. Majority of the situations I've seen over the years that have ended badly could of been resolved if the door staff just spoke to people with respect and dignity rather than jumping straight in with physical and verbal abuse. It's always a case if you didn't argue with them, you wouldn't be barred. But if you didn't speak to the person like shit off your shoe then there would of been no reason to argue or escalate?? I am certain this was the demise of Mayhem Nightclub.
Considering I haven't been thrown out of your club or had any confrontation with any of your staff for the past 4 years, I don't think using that I have been thrown out in the past because I got too drunk is any justification for the way I am discriminated against today. Everyone makes mistakes every now and then especially when alcohol is involved, but you know what, compared to the amount of times I have been out over the past 7/8 years in ratio to the amount of times I've ever been thrown out of a club, that is a very minor percentage. It doesn't even relate to the incidents am about to detail so I don't know why at one point this was even bought up in one of the incidents. It doesn't excuse door staff for not practising basic human rights.
You are fully aware that I am transgender and so are the door staff, some of whom I work with, so we are all acquainted. Even there they speak to me like shit, mock me and take the piss with their little comments, but that's not your problem to deal with.
One of the recent incidents when I came to the club a few weeks ago, I used the men's bathroom. This is the gender I take medication for. Sometimes I do still use the women's, but that's because the men's aren't catered for monthly processes my body still goes through, what do you want me to do? Anyway, one of your bouncers approached me while I was in there and told me to come with him. When I asked why, they said because I'm in the men's. I said yeah, I'm a boy? At to which point they grabbed my arm and started pulling me. I said I was trans and when I pulled back they asked to see my passport which I refused because by this point this man should of left it. If they aren't sure then what would have been more polite (considering I was a customer spending my money in there) would of been for them to go off and find you for advice on what to do. Instead they kicked me out of the club. So not only at this point am I am embarrassed, they go on further to make the situation worse by when explaining it saying “she thinks she's a man”. Are you actually serious??
But you know what, despite that whole situation I let it go because after 20 minutes of me waiting outside, you came up to me and said that you had resolved it. You said you had made all the staff aware now and I am allowed back in the club. You said I am welcome to use the men's toilet under the compromise that if you get a lot more complaints from customers about me being in there then would it be ok if I can use the women's as you're running a business. It's nice that you think about all your other customers. Even though you tried to word it as best as you could, the whole situation was not right, and I didn't even receive an apology. Still, I dropped it because I just wanted to get on with my night.
Now a few weeks on from that, which led to this Monday comes the second incident.
I am fully aware of the rules regarding I.D on the door policy but I also know that these can be bent sometimes under discretion. Before my friends and I headed out that night, one of them contacted one of the bouncers to double-check if it was ok for one of our friends without I.D to come in. They said yes. Now, I could pull up a million photos of this friend in this club and other places around Southend over the years. Cut a long story short, when we got to the door it was a no. I said in a friendly way that they know them she's usually with me and always in here etc to which it was a no. I asked to speak to you which is when I was told no. When asked why I can't speak to the manager, I was told that he's not calling you for something that petty, of course this was said aggressively. It was still quite early in the night and there were hardly any customers so it would of been no harm to just see.
The door staff then went on to mock me amongst each other, so in the end I walked off for a moment to avoid it escalating. I then returned with one other person from the group who had I.D. Pointlessly I was asked to show mine to which a comment was made regarding my name change “Well this doesn't say Hunter does it??” and continued to discuss it as I walked inside. It's comment's like this I do not appreciate, they are not my pals, they are people I put up with when I'm at work and when I come out to see my friends.
This is where it gets concerning. I managed to speak to you and you said no about my friend coming in without I.D, fair enough. I said I wanted to make a complaint about the door staff as I am sick of them bullying and harassing me. At that point you went over to ask what had happened and they told you the I.D story. Obviously not realising that I wanted to actually complain about the conduct of the doormen, you again said about the I.D situation which at that point I said it's fine about that I just want something done about the way I get spoken to because at this point they were still saying “she” when they full well know the situation. This is where I became disappointed. You then told me that I need to appreciate that not everyone understands my situation. Whether people understand something or not, it costs nothing to be decent. How does that warrant this type of behaviour, not understanding it??? At that point I should think I am well within my rights to get upset, because I am making a serious complaint and you couldn't care less. This is probably the reason why they think it is ok to discriminate because nothing ever gets done and people like me have to put up with it. Because I got upset you said you haven't got time and walked off.
Do you know what happened when you walked off?? I was approached by two of them in an aggressive manor. “You making fucking complaints about me??” I said I am well within my rights to make a complaint if I want to because you've offended me at the end of the day to which they replied you're just a customer??? Which to me is the reply from a fool who has nothing to say. But they are right, I am a customer so if I want to make a complaint then just like any other industry with paying customers, I should be welcome to. From the other one I got “You ever talk about me like that again I'll fucking make sure you never step foot in here or any other bar in Southend again”. Baring in mind their security badge that is supposed to be on display at all times was no where to be seen on their personnel. So for making a complaint I now have been threatened. If you don't believe me ask who was on the front desk that night, there were plenty of witnesses.
The door staff on this occasion did not ask me to leave, I left of my own accord because at that point in time I thought to myself no way am I spending a penny in a place that think it's ok to act this way towards another human being. I have never been rude to these people, in fact if anything I am as polite as a person can possibly be to them usually, because I know that they use any excuse to start a drama. It's not right that after all that I have been through, I am expected to keep my mouth shut and lick their arses when they are the ones in the wrong. All just to be allowed into the club, I am supposed to allow these people to bully me because I'm different, and keep my mouth shut to avoid a ban. I'm sure you pay them to keep people safe not to go on power trips.
So tonight I returned back to the club, because before publishing this post I wanted to see how they are with me after me making the initial complaint. I was right. I got to the door and I was told I had a 3 month ban. I'm refused entry to a club for not actually being a danger to people, as that's what they're paid to do, but because of a personal problem. Because you know after everything, I got upset and angry like any other human being in my position would of. So even though they were in the wrong, I am being punished? What because I had a rant as I walked off and disappeared into the night. Or was it because I stuck up for myself and told them outright I'm not taking it any more?? I can't say I know anyone that would be ok with this. It makes no sense why I am banned. Trying to reason with these people is like talking to a brick wall. The only thing they are qualified in is pushing people's buttons because guaranteed now they will turn around and say I kicked off so I'm banned for good. I am really interested to know other people's opinions on this.
At this point what have I got to lose? That situation could have been on it's way to being resolved if they had not given me shit tonight, and instead accepted that I made a complaint about them because what they have been doing is not right in any shape or form. To add insult to injury they are straight up liars who often stick together, they will tell you the sky is grey if it meant getting away with something.
What I have experienced is bullying. It's discrimination. It's harassment. If you want to turn a blind eye to it then that is what will define you as a person. If you want to say I was the one in the wrong because of my reaction then you need to reflect on the situation and realise it was a REACTION, which in this instance I am well within my rights to be angry and upset. Would you be the same if this was a complaint about direct homophobic or racist comments? In this day and age people would expect action to be taken. In any other industry this would not be tolerated so why should these people be allowed to get away with it? If you want a to see a long detailed list of all the other incidents along with quotes, names and descriptions I am more than happy to sit there and write that out for you if something will be done about it.
If you want to contact me please feel free to do so through Facebook. Alternatively, if you would prefer to email me a response please send it to huntsman_92@outlook.com
I am very interested to hear your thoughts.

We go again. Transfer deadline day. Last orders in the football saloon. A biannual event that is ostensibly a final opportunity for football clubs to buy enough new players to see them through until the next time, it has become seared on the public consciousness by the excitable people at Sky Sports.
They have attached such monumental significance to this glorified trolley-dash through the supermarket of international football humanity that it has now eclipsed the FA Cup and Capital One Cup to become English football's second most prestigious tournament.
It is apparently not uncommon for grown men to call in sick from work on transfer deadline day so they can monitor goings on at The Hawthorns, St James' Park or Loftus Road. Yes, they are ill, but not in the kind of physically debilitating way that should preclude them from going to work.
Sky's star pundit, Gary Neville, once observed that barometers for discovering which football clubs in England are the most badly run do not come more accurate than transfer deadline day.
The busiest are invariably the most inefficient, they claimed, pointing out that better organised clubs conduct their business long before the need for a last-minute panic splurge arises.
Quite what their employer made of these comments remains unknown, but one suspects that if it had its way, all 20 Premier League clubs would be forced to embark on a frenzy of reckless spending for no other reason than to boost viewing figures and subscriptions.
You know the drill by now. With transfer deadline day upon us on Monday morning, Sky Sports will have deployed an army of news reporters and cameramen to assorted football stadiums and training grounds around the country.
Their job? To loiter. To cajole. To plead. To peer. To occasionally grovel. To monitor who's coming and who's going.
To engage reluctant passers-by in stilted, often unwelcome chit-chat. If the gates and fences outside which they congregate belonged to schools, they would be arrested or, at the very least, ordered to move on.
David Craig. Ian Bolton. Nick Collins. Amy Lewis. Vinny O'Connor. Bryn Law. Just some of the names with which Sky Sports viewers will have become familiar over the years, watching them stoically man their posts outside the Britannia Stadium, Villa Park, Loftus Road, Selhurst Park, White Hart Lane and the Stadium of Light for the thick end of 16 hours.
Maintaining enthusiasm can't be easy, but apart from their microphones, enthusiasm is often the only weapon. Faking excitement and intrigue after suffering the spirit-crushing humiliation of being blanked by a sullen, young multimillionaire riding shotgun in their agent's Range Rover can't be easy, but these transfer-window warriors remain consistently inquisitive and upbeat.
Even in the face of intimidation from local delinquents and ne'er-do-wells, the facade never slips. Perhaps on the back of a comical January assault which resulted in the deadline-day veteran Gary Cotterill stoically continuing a live broadcast to camera despite being covered in silly string, reports suggest that the satellite broadcaster has requested that several Premier League clubs provide designated safe standing areas for their reporters this Monday, to prevent them from having to rub shoulders with the hoi polloi, on the entirely understandable grounds that it is only a matter of time before one of them is seriously hurt by a drunken nutter who takes it upon themselves to liven up proceedings.
Whether the clubs who, let's not forget, don't want them hanging around the place keeping their eyes peeled for Peter Odemwingie lurking in the shadows, choose to comply or leave them to run the gauntlet remains to be seen.
Of course, every circus needs a ringmaster and when it comes to transfer deadline day, it is the excitable Sky Sports News presenter Jim White who cracks the whip, bringing us home to 11pm in the company of their more understated sidekick, Natalie Sawyer.
“Nobody enjoys it more than me,” says White of deadline day, even if recent revelations regarding astronomical agents' fees paid by Cardiff City suggest their outlandish claim might be a little spurious.
“There's a heck of a lot of people involved, not just myself and Natalie,” they added, although your humble columnist may have added the final two words of that particular sentence in a bid to make them sound more gallant.
The straight man to White's ridiculously hyperactive, breaking newshound, the importance of Sawyer to this double act cannot be overstated.
Without their present to rein in their ludicrous overexcitement upon hearing that Chris Baird might be off to Aston Villa, there's a very real possibility that once the Sky Sports transfer deadline day clock hits zero, the man might actually explode. Boom!
A new Bitfury white paper aims to advance the study of how bitcoins sent using certain privacy-enhancing techniques could be traced back to participants.
Released today, “Shared Send Untangling in Bitcoin” explores how bitcoins in this type of transaction can be “untangled”, or sorted, into their original value flows. Shared send transactions originate when users organize into groups, by way of an intermediary, in order to obfuscate how funds may be moving between wallets.
“We establish a theoretical approach to shared send transaction analysis, which formulates the transaction untangling problem in terms of the graph theory. We also describe several practically important modifications to the untangling problem,” the paper states.
Of note are its implications for CoinJoin and CoinSwap, algorithms that mix transactions inputs and outputs, and that were seen as advances in bringing privacy to the open, public blockchain that records bitcoin transactions.
The research is also the latest by Bitfury that demonstrates its willingness to expand beyond bitcoin mining, following a report in July that sought to solve challenges related to the Lightning Network, an in-development bitcoin micropayments platform.
According to the company, the findings will serve to inform the “Bitfury Crystal Blockchain”, a forthcoming web service for blockchain investigation and analysis.
A spokesperson for the startup said:
“We are looking to solve hard technical problems that we can commercialize. What we're doing with this project is something that we think we can monetize.”
The work comes at a time when blockchain analytics tools are increasingly in demand from financial institutions seeking to interact with industry businesses.
Startups like Chainalysis, Elliptic and Skry, for instance, have all so far moved to capitalize on demand from industries and governments, though Bitfury would be the best capitalized firm to enter the market.
The research does not explore “shared coin services”, tools that send bitcoins to an intermediary and in which the process of sending and receiving an intended transaction is divided into several transactions.
Transaction definitions
As part of this effort, Bitfury's researchers spend much of the report seeking to define shared send transactions, a process that involved categorizing transactions observed on the blockchain in a way that provided more nuance to the interactions studied.
The white paper divides transactions into four types, the most basic of which are wallet-to-wallet transactions and separable transactions, or those that can be split into “subsets” of money flows.
Ambiguous transactions (those observed to have at least two separate money flows) and intractable transactions (those whose category cannot be determined) are among the more complex and potentially challenging from a compliance perspective.
“People who aren't involved in this transaction can't say which people sent the money,” a researcher explained.
In total, Bitfury said it analyzed 10 million bitcoin transactions that took place between 27th May and 11th July of this year, finding that just 2.5% were ‘intractable'.
“Shared send transactions constitute approximately 13.5% of all studied bitcoin transactions. Of these, about 82% are simple transactions, ~9.6% are separable, and ~6.3% are ambiguous,” the report reads.
In comments, researchers involved with the project noted that intractable transactions don't technically exist, as should there be a proper analysis, it could always be sorted into one of the three classes.
‘Nefarious actors'
Long term, the Bitfury team wasn't shy about stating that the tool is intended for use by firms that want to ensure they are transacting in a compliant manner.
“Ultimately we're seeking to make the blockchain more secure by ensuring it's used for good purposes, not nefarious actors,” a spokesperson said.
The paper, however, cautioned that shared send transactions aren't necessarily the result of a mixing service meant to hide illicit actions, and that hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, those that derive keys from a single seed, can be sorted into this category.
“In this paper, we think of the problem and ask, ‘What kind of transactions are there?'” a researcher said.
Representatives of the company said the paper should be thought of as Bitfury's “first step” in advancing work in this part of the field, but that more research in this area is likely.
The full white paper can be found below:

Congress is under scrutiny for allegations of sexual harassment — and victims coming forward on Capitol Hill must navigate a web of bureaucracy and mandatory waiting periods, with taxpayer money funding the defense of alleged harassers.
On Sunday, MSNBC's Kasie Hunt laid out the process for workers to file a sexual harassment claim in Congress in a segment on Kasie DC. In just over a minute and 40 seconds, they make clear the current setup is deeply flawed: “It's very convoluted,” they say.
Harassment is a prevalent problem in Congress. A 2016 survey by CQ Roll Call found that four in 10 women congressional staffers believed sexual harassment to be a problem on Capitol Hill, while one in six said they personally had been victimized. The vast majority of cases are likely going unreported.
That's because, as Hunt explains, the process for coming forward with allegations against staff or members of Congress are anything but simple:
So, what happens when you file a sexual harassment claim on Capitol Hill? Let's walk through it ... pic.twitter.com/fltUcd2cdl — Kasie DC (@KasieDC) November 20, 2017
Sexual harassment victims in Congress have 180 days to bring a claim to the US Congress Office of Compliance, the office responsible for handling workplace complaints, Hunt explains.
Victims are then subject to up to 30 days of mandatory counseling and then have 15 days to decide whether to bring claims to mediation. If they don't want mediation, they're out of options.
If victims do opt for mediation, a lawyer representing the congressional office gets involved, whose job it is to protect the office and institution. That lawyer is funded with taxpayer money.
If no settlement is reached, then there's a 30-day cooling-off period before a victim can file a lawsuit or request a hearing.
And if a settlement is reached, it is usually accompanied by a nondisclosure agreement — and paid for, again, with taxpayer money.
Several current and former female members of Congress have shared their own experiences of harassment in recent weeks. Allegations that Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) groped a Los Angeles radio host without their consent in 2006 and the growing chorus of women making allegations of inappropriate conduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have increased pressure even more.
Both houses of Congress this month moved to make sexual harassment training mandatory for lawmakers, staff, and employees. Still, many say lawmakers have a long way to go in addressing sexual harassment, including the process through which victims are able to make claims.
"We have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), who has been a vocal advocate for sexual harassment victims, said in a Sunday interview on Face the Nation.
Speier, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and other lawmakers last week introduced the ME TOO Act, legislation to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in Congress.
“We have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously. And the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or intimidated into not filing the complaint,” Speier said on Sunday. “That's what it is right now in Congress.”

The internet is abuzz with talk of Khamisa Sawadi, a 75-year-old Syrian widow living in Saudi Arabia who was sentenced to 40 lashes and 4 months in jail for the crime of khalwa, being alone with a man who is not their relative. The verdict, issued on March 3rd, also demands that Sawadi be deported after serving their sentence. Sawadi's husband was Saudi Arabian.
According to Arab News:
The elderly woman met the men […] after they asked one of them to bring them five loaves of bread. […] The men — [her late husband's] nephew, Fahd Al-Anzi, and their friend and business partner, Hadiyan bin Zein [both aged 24] — went to Sawadi's home in the town of Al-Shamli. Suleiman Al-Radhiman, director of the Hail office of the commission, told Al-Watan that their officials detained the woman after receiving a written message that two men had entered their house. They pointed out that police had arrested the woman on two previous occasions. Bin Zein said the commission officials arrested them about 200 meters from the woman's house. “There were six commission members who all had their faces covered.”
The widely read CNN article (which made the top 10 most dugg stories yesterday) says the men were caught inside the house by one police officer, which doesn't really make sense. Why would a member of the virtue police suddenly enter an old woman's house? The answer: they didn't. A little more research would be helpful CNN. And who exactly wrote the message? And Sawadi was arrested twice before? Why?
What makes the situation worse is the fact that Sawadi insists that Al-Anzi is their son, since they breastfed them as a child and in Islam breastfeeding gives a degree of maternal relation. But since they have no ‘proof,' they cannot claim they are a relative. (Interestingly, the court can't have evidence that they didn't). So-called “Islamic” law was enough to charge her, but not to clear them name?
According to Yahoo! News, the court based it's verdict on “citizen information” and testimony from Al-Anzi's father, their late husband's brother (!), who accused them of “corruption.”
Maybe they just didn't realize their son would also get sentenced to 40 lashes and 4 months in jail? (The business partner got 60 lashes and 6 months). Sawadi's verdict read:
Because they said they don't have a husband and because they are not a Saudi*, conviction of the defendants of illegal mingling has been confirmed.
So if they were married and a Saudi Arabian it would have been okay? Them birthplace and marital status make them guilty?
I can't help but wonder at Saudi Arabia's continued attempts at shooting itself in the foot. The Saudi Arabian judiciary and the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) have once again come under fire.
Al-Watan, the Saudi paper which first covered the issue, actually interviewed Sawadi back in June 2008, who has not spoken to the press since their verdict was handed down. They quote them as saying the CPVPV entered their house under false pretences to investigate her:
They used deceit and explotation of my old age and poverty by saying they were from a charity organization. One was short and one was tall. They said they were there to see if I needed any financial or in-kind donations. I had called my son Fahd to get me bread and they did. I am a poor woman without air conditioning in my house and I only have my son from breastfeeding. When they left they were arrested for helping out an old woman.
Laila Ahmed al-Ahdab, a columnist in the paper, wrote:
How can a verdict be issued based on suspicion? A group of people are misusing religion to serve their own interests.
Media reports covering Sawadi's case are varied.
One article comments:
It is not known if the religious police really believed the men were behaving improperly with a woman old enough to be their grandmother or if the prosecutions were just a matter of principle.
Some articles blur the line between Saudi Arabia's interpretation of Islam with Islam, calling Sawadi's punishment “Shari'a law,” and not a country's interpretation of what Shari'a law would look like. Almost all the articles make sure to mention that in Saudi Arabia women can't drive, need a male relative's permission to travel, etc.
Others make sure to mention some or all of the most recent (negative) stories in Saudi Arabia featuring women, including the Qatif girl rape case who was sentenced for gang rape, the case of two novelists last week who were questioned for wanting to get a female writer's autograph, the 8-year-old married to a 58-year-old man who was denied divorce until they reach puberty etc.
Others still mention several unrelated stories about Saudi Arabia, such as Saudi Sheik Saleh Lihedan who condoned killing TV channel owners that broadcast “immoral” content, just to plug in how “crazy” the country is.
An interesting thing I've noticed when reading blog posts about the issue is the degree to which Sawadi's age affects people's impressions of the charge. A story published today in the Al-Watan newspaper reports that a Saudi woman and man were arrested yesterday for being alone together in a car (car chase and accident ensued), and many of the commentators accepted this, saying the man and woman deserved to be punished because they were being ‘sinful.'
But Sawadi's age makes a huge difference, say some bloggers. If it was a young woman alone with two men in an apartment, the situation might be different. If the men had spent a long time in the apartment, it would be different, and so on. I haven't come across one post that heavily critiques the punishment for khalwa, especially when nothing was going on!
The only article I read about the Sawadi case which was somewhat balanced, trying to show that it's all not doom and gloom in Saudi Arabia was in the LA Times, by Raed Rafei, specifically stating that:
A handful of changes in the past two months suggests an increase of freedoms for women, activists say.
It linked to an interesting article in the Middle East Online talking about Saudi women activists in Saudi Arabia. Rafei goes on to mention the fact that:
King Abdullah appointed last month the first woman to a ministerial post. […] They recently dismissed a leading fundamentalist cleric and the head of the kingdom's religious police, Sheik Ibrahim Ghaith. The monarch also removed Sheik Saleh Lihedan as chief of the country's highest religious tribunal. The man issued a fatwa in September saying it was permissible to kill TV executives for broadcasting “evil” and immoral programs.
The latter fact being one other articles opted to ignore when they mentioned Sheik Saleh Lihedan.
It's still not enough, as Sabria Jawhar, the once Jeddah bureau chief of the Saudi Gazette and leading Saudi Arabian columnist, writes:
For every [one success story] there are 100 Khamisa Sawadis. For every female Saudi graduate student studying abroad, there are 100 other Saudi women denied their right to divorce abusive husbands or to gain custody of their children. A Saudi delegation can stand before the United Nation's Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and provide a laundry list of all the good things the Saudi government has done for their women. But closer scrutiny of Khamisa Sawadi, the Qatif Girl, forced divorces and the countless 13-year-old brides married off to men four times their age tarnishes the appointments of Saudi women to high places. While we have seen remarkable changes recently in the general presidency of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice and a new chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Council, it's the judges in court that seem to have lost sight of their religious and social obligations and revert to tribal customs.* There is no religious prohibition preventing women from driving yet we are forced to mingle with unrelated men who are employed as our drivers. If Sawadi is guilty of mingling with men who are not their close relatives, then 95 percent of the Saudi women are guilty of the same thing. Imagine if the laws, as interpreted by the Saudi courts, were administered in an equitable manner. [Some] judges [parse] every word of a Hadith to reach a verdict [they] had already decided on or [are those] who will succumb to tribal pressures.
But they're still steps on the road to reform. Let's hope King Abdullah steps in and overrules Sawadi's sentence, and that of the men who were only running them an errand.
* emphasis mine.
Art Spiegelman, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning comic book “Maus: A Survivor's Tale” and the artist behind this week's sketchbook, is often credited as being the father of graphic novels. Their response to the claim: “I demand a blood test!” But they have lately softened to the idea.
“About seven years ago, I was invited to do a comics page for the op-ed section of the Washington Post,” they recalled. “The editor was very excited and told me, ‘Great—we've never had a graphic novel before!' I pointed out that it was only a one-page comic, but the editor repeated, ‘Right, and we never had a graphic novel before!'” As a result, Spiegelman decided it was time to embrace the term that has come to characterize “an ambitious comic book,” whether the narrative is drawn on one page or three hundred. “Since comics is the art of compression, I started looking back on the one-pagers which either in terms of their subject matter or in terms of their resonance had stayed in my brain,” they said.
See below a few comics pages from over the years that Spiegelman embraces as one-page graphic novels.

It's been a long road, but the initial release of the Exchange Server Role Requirements Calculator is here. No, that isn't a mistake, the calculator has been rebranded. Yes, this is no longer a Mailbox server role calculator; this calculator includes recommendations on sizing Client Access servers too! Originally, marketing wanted to brand it as the Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Client Access and Mailbox Server Roles Theoretical Capacity Planning Calculator, On-Premises Edition. Wow, that's a mouthful and reminds me of this branding parody. Thankfully, I vetoed that name (you're welcome!).
The calculator supports the architectural changes made possible with Exchange 2013 and later:
Client Access Servers
Like with Exchange 2010, the recommendation in Exchange 2013 is to deploy multi-role servers. There are very few reasons you would need to deploy dedicated Client Access servers (CAS); CPU constraints, use of Windows Network Load Balancing in small deployments (even with our architectural changes in client connectivity, we still do not recommend Windows NLB for any large deployments) and certificate management are a few examples that may justify dedicated CAS.
When deploying multi-role servers, the calculator will take into account the impact that the CAS role has and make recommendations for sizing the entire server's memory and CPU. So when you see the CPU utilization value, this will include the impact both roles have!
When deploying dedicated server roles, the calculator will recommend the minimum number of Client Access processor cores and memory per server, as well as, the minimum number of CAS you should deploy in each datacenter.
Transport
Now that the Mailbox server role includes additional components like transport, it only makes sense to include transport sizing in the calculator. This release does just that and will factor in message queue expiration and Safety Net hold time when calculating the database size. The calculator even makes a recommendation on where to deploy the mail.que database, either the system disk, or on a dedicated disk!
Multiple Databases / JBOD Volume Support
Exchange 2010 introduced the concept of 1 database per JBOD volume when deploying multiple database copies. However, this architecture did not ensure that the drive was utilized effectively across all three dimensions – throughput, IO, and capacity. Typically, the system was balanced from an IO and capacity perspective, but throughput was where we saw an imbalance, because during reseeds only a portion of the target disk's total capable throughput was utilized. In addition, capacity on the 7.2K disks continue to increase with 4TB disks now available, thus impacting our ability to remain balanced along that dimension. In addition, Exchange 2013 includes a 33% reduction in IO when compared to Exchange 2010. Naturally, the concept of 1 database / JBOD volume needed to evolve. As a result, Exchange 2013 made several architectural changes in the store process, ESE, and HA architecture to support multiple databases per JBOD volume. If you would like more information, please see Scott's excellent TechEd session in a few weeks on Exchange 2013 High Availability and Site Resilience or the High Availability and Site Resilience topic on TechNet.
By default, the calculator will recommend multiple databases per JBOD volume. This architecture is supported for single datacenter deployments and multi-datacenter deployments when there is copy and/or server symmetry. The calculator supports highly available database copies and lagged database copies with this volume architecture type. The distribution algorithm will lay out the copies appropriately, as well as, generate the deployment scripts correctly to support AutoReseed.
High Availability Architecture Improvements
The calculator has been improved in several ways for high availability architectures:
You can now specify the Witness Server location, either primary, secondary, or tertiary datacenter.
The calculator allows you to simulate WAN failures, so that you can see how the databases are distributed during the worst failure mode.
The calculator allows you to name servers and define a database prefix which are then used in the deployment scripts.
The distribution algorithm supports single datacenter HA deployments, Active/Passive deployments, and Active/Active deployments.
The calculator includes a PowerShell script to automate DAG creation.
In the event you are deploying your high availability architecture with direct attached storage, you can now specify the maximum number of database volumes each server will support. For example, if you are deploying a server architecture that can support 24 disks, you can specify a maximum support of 20 database volumes (leaving 2 disks for system, 1 disk for Restore Volume, and 1 disks as a spare for AutoReseed).
Additional Mailbox Tiers (sort of!)
Over the years, a few, but vocal, members of the community have requested that I add more mailbox tiers to the calculator. As many of you know, I rarely recommend sizing multiple mailbox tiers, as that simply adds operational complexity and I am all about removing complexity in your messaging environments. While, I haven't specifically added additional mailbox tiers, I have added the ability for you to define a percentage of the mailbox tier population that should have the IO and Megacycle Multiplication Factors applied. In a way, this allows you to define up to eight different mailbox tiers.
Processors
I've received a number of questions regarding processor sizing in the calculator. People are comparing the Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculator output with the Exchange 2013 Server Role Requirements Calculator. As mentioned in our Exchange 2013 Performance Sizing article, the megacycle guidance in Exchange 2013 leverages a new server baseline, therefore, you cannot directly compare the output from the Exchange 2010 calculator with the Exchange 2013 calculator.
Conclusion
There are many other minor improvements sprinkled throughout the calculator. We hope you enjoy this initial release. All of this work wouldn't have occurred without the efforts of Jeff Mealiffe (for without our sizing guidance there would be no calculator!), David Mosier (VBA scripting guru and the master of crafting the distribution worksheet), and Jon Gollogy (deployment scripting master).
As always we welcome feedback and please report any issues you may encounter while using the calculator by emailing strgcalc AT microsoft DOT com.

Currently, the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts in different states permit the first sale of crops — after harvesting by farmers — to take place only in regulated market yards or mandis.
In what could potentially transform marketing of crops in India, the government has approved the creation of a common electronic platform which will allow farmers and traders to sell their produce to buyers anywhere in the country.
Advertising
Currently, the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts in different states permit the first sale of crops — after harvesting by farmers — to take place only in regulated market yards or mandis.
The farmer's universe of buyers is restricted only to traders or commission agents licensed to operate in the area under a particular APMC. In most cases, multiple licences are required to trade in different mandis within the same state.
What is now being envisaged, based on the proposal cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday, is a National Agriculture Market (NAM) online trading portal where farmers can offer their produce to buyers in any part of the country.
“This virtual marketplace will allow a farmer from, say, Narsinghpur in Madhya Pradesh to sell their chana to a dal miller in Delhi who may be willing to pay a higher price. The miller, too, benefits by virtue of not having to be physically present in Narsinghpur or being forced to depend on traders in that APMC area,” Pravesh Sharma, Managing Director, Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), told The Indian Express.
SFAC has been designated the lead agency for developing the NAM e-platform. “While buyers can log into the platform from homes or offices anywhere in India, the transactions will, however, be recorded as having been conducted through the mandi where the seller would normally bring their produce. The APMC concerned will, therefore, continue to earn the mandi fee on the transaction even if it does not happen in that particular market yard,” Sharma said.
The APMC-regulated mandis will, in fact, gain through the significant increase in turnover volumes likely from more buyers bidding for produce. “The NAM e-platform basically gives farmers the choice to accept the bids of local traders or price offers by online buyers. In either case, the APMC is not deprived of revenues through mandi fees. The portal will provide an integrated platform for transferring the money to the accounts of farmers and the APMC after ensuring delivery of the produce to the buyer,” Sharma said.
The Centre has earmarked Rs 200 crore for creation of the NAM portal that targets to cover 585 mandis across India: 250 in the current fiscal, 200 in 2016-17 and 135 in 2017-18.
The idea of integrating the existing APMC markets through a common e-platform has come from Congress-ruled Karnataka. The state government has established Rashtriya e Market Services Private Limited, a 50:50 joint venture with NCDEX Spot Exchange, to offer an automated auction platform for connecting all the mandis in Karnataka. Already, 55 of the 155 main market yards have been integrated into a single licensing system through this platform.
Mega irrigation plan cleared
Moving to improve farm productivity and reduce dependence on the monsoon, the government has approved spending of Rs 50,000 crore over the five years to expand irrigation in rural areas.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said: “The major objective of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana is to achieve convergence of investments in irrigation at the field level… expand cultivable area under assured irrigation.”

Megyn Kelly revealed on TODAY Monday that they sent an email last year to the co-presidents of their former employer Fox News complaining about the behavior of anchor Bill O'Reilly toward women.
Kelly's revelation came after the The New York Times reported on Saturday that O'Reilly paid $32 million to settle a sexual harassment claim with Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl in January and then was given a new contract by the company.
O'Reilly responded to the report by saying through a spokesperson that the report had "maliciously smeared" him. They also claimed that no woman ever spoke to human resources or the legal department about their behavior in their 21 years at Fox News.
"O'Reilly's suggestion that no one ever complained about their behavior is false,'' Kelly said Monday. "I know because I complained."
Kelly, who worked at Fox News from 2004 until January, said they wrote an email to the co-presidents of Fox News, Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, in November 2016 about O'Reilly's treatment of women.
Kelly's memoir, "Settle for More," had been released that day and included a chapter in which Kelly said they were sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes.
In an appearance on CBS News, O'Reilly became defensive when they were asked about the book.
"I'm not interested in basically litigating something that is finished that makes my network look bad,'' they said. "I'm not interested in making my network look bad at all. That doesn't interest me one bit."
That prompted Kelly to complain to Shine and Abernethy.
"Perhaps they didn't realize the kind of message their criticism sent to young women across this country about how men continue to view the issue of speaking out about sexual harassment,'' they wrote in the email. "Perhaps they didn't realize that their exact attitude of shaming women into shutting the hell up about harassment on grounds that it will disgrace the company is in part how Fox News got into the decade-long Ailes mess to begin with.
"Perhaps it's their own history of harassment with women, which has, as you both know, resulted in payouts to more than one woman, including recently, that blinded them to the folly of saying anything other than, 'I'm just so sorry for the women of this company who never should've had to go through that.'''
Kelly said Shine informed them they would "deal with it."
"By 8 p.m. that night, O'Reilly had apparently been dealt with, and by that I mean they were permitted with management's advance notice and blessing to go on the air and attack the company's harassment victims yet again,'' Kelly said.
On their show that night, O'Reilly said, "Don't run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it,'' about any women who feel they have been harassed.
O'Reilly was fired by Fox News in April after revelations by The New York Times that five women were paid millions in settlements after claims of sexual harassment.
"This is not unique to Fox News,'' Kelly said. "Women everywhere are used to being dismissed, ignored or attacked when raising complaints about men in authority positions. They stay silent so often out of fear."
Kelly also said Fox News' media relations chief, Irena Briganti, was "known for their vindictiveness."
"To this day they push negative articles on certain (Roger) Ailes accusers like the one you are looking at right now," they said.
"It gives me no pleasure to report such news about my former employer, which has absolutely made some reforms since all of this went down. But this must stop. The abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threatening, the retaliation, the silencing of them after the fact. It has to stop."
Kelly said they made the email public "because I think it speaks volumes about powerful men and the roadblocks one can face in taking them on."
Kelly also spoke on TODAY with their former Fox News colleague, Juliet Huddy, who settled a claim of sexual harassment against O'Reilly last year. They spoke about the challenge of making those types of claims against at a large company like Fox News.
"You know that you're just this one person that's about to go up against literally a machine,'' Huddy said. "It's daunting and it's frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes."
Huddy, who cannot comment on their own case after signing a non-disclosure agreement, spoke about those types of agreements in general.
"I think people have regrets when they sign non-disclosure agreements,'' they said. "I would imagine that they do. I think it's something that you grapple with when you're going through it and you think it's the best move to make, and it's not necessarily the best move."

An Italian village council has caused outrage after it erected a large road-sign at the entrance of the village warning anyone who enters to respect its 'deep Christian traditions' or leave.
Pontoglio's entry sign clearly urges anyone entering the small town of 9,000 people, to only come in if they respect its Christian values, leading some people to criticise it as being racist.
'Pontoglio, town of western culture and deep Christian tradition. People unwilling to respect local culture and tradition are invited to leave,' the sign reads.
'Pontoglio, town of western culture and deep Christian tradition. 'People unwilling to respect local culture and tradition are invited to leave,' the sign reads
The shocking sign has been defended by one councillor, named as Paolo Bocchi, who said they didn't believe it was racist.
They said that it informed anyone arriving at Pontoglio, situated near the Italian city of Brescia, that 'our culture is based on mutual respect. From women to music, art, habits and traditional rites.'
The councillor said that it was designed to provide clear 'cultural and historic information' about the small village, although many social media users have labelled it was racist.
The sign was agreed by the village's council and backed by the centre-right mayor, Alessandro Seghezzi.

Many social media users criticised the council for the sign, describing it as 'ignorant' and 'backward'
Brescia deputy mayor Laura Castelletti questioned the wording of the new signs and the reasoning behind it's controversial statement.
Commenting on social media, Miss Castelletti said that they 'thought Italy was a secular country with no state religion and was not aware that women could be listed as part of a town's customs and traditions.'
The sign has led to an array of comments on the council's Facebook page, with some users describing the statement as like being 'back in the Middle Ages.'

In June, Blizzard will be opening up its new ranked mode for Overwatch. The newly released first-person shooter (released May 24th 2016) will soon feature a competitive ranked mode. The game initially provided a competitive mode but the early stages of matchmaking set up low skilled players with those of a higher skill level.
Overwatch's game director, Jeff Kaplan, expressed that the “competitive mode is the current focus of the Overwatch team, and it's the most important thing for us to add to the game right now.” Although there is no definite release date for the ranked mode in Overwatch Kaplan stated that an update can be expected “towards the end of June.”
According to Blizzard, Competitive play mode will be locked until level 25 in order to give players looking for more serious game modes the option. In the ranked mode the players will be categorized in regards to their tier which is obtained by winning games to climb up the ranked ladder. The tiers (Challenger, Advanced, Expert, and Master) are broken into five (1-5) divisions. Once a player reaches Master 5 their next tier would be Heroic which has no division. Rather, the player would then be categorized depending on the tier (Heroic) and a numeric rank which determines their position within the tier.
To go into further explanation the video below provides more information on what you can expect within Overwatch's competitive play mode:
The game currently features four play modes. Quick Play automatically allows individual or parties (up to six players per team) to queue up for a random map in a death-match style game mode which puts two teams against each other to compete for their objectives. Play vs. AI allows players to play a game against bots (which is a good mode for beginners). Custom Game gives the player the option to choose who will join as well as fill in any remaining spot they choose with an AI. Overwatch also offers a Weekly Brawl mode as an alternative to the other modes but does not offer Loot Boxes (boxes which contain character skins, player icons, in-game currency, etc..) as a reward.
Overwatch is published and developed by Blizzard Entertainment (known for Diablo 3, World of Warcraft, and Starcraft 2) for $39.99 USD. Other Overwatch packages include its Origins Edition for $59.99 which add five origin skins and some “Digital Goodies” that can be used in several other Blizzard games. For $129.99 Overwatch's Collector's Edition provides the above with a few added bonuses including a Soldier:76 statuette, Overwatch Visual Sourcebook, as well as the Overwatch Soundtrack.
Tasmanian Gothic is a genre of Tasmanian literature[1] that merges the traditions of Gothic fiction with the history and natural features of Tasmania, an island state south of the Australian continent. Tasmanian Gothic has inspired works in other artistic media, including theatre and film.
Origins [ edit ]
Although it deals with the themes of horror, mystery and the uncanny, Tasmanian Gothic literature and art differs from traditional European Gothic Literature, which is rooted in medieval imagery, crumbling Gothic architecture and religious ritual. Instead, the Tasmanian gothic tradition centres on the natural landscape of Tasmania and its colonial architecture and history.
A densely populated Europe of the industrial revolution prompted Urban Gothic literature and novels like Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). But in sparsely populated colonial Australia, especially the penal colony of Tasmania, the religious zeal of some prison wardens[2] (akin, in many ways, to the institutionalised religion of the Inquisition; a theme reflected in European gothicism) and the mysterious rituals and traditions of Tasmania's indigenous Aboriginal inhabitants lent itself to an entirely different gothic tradition.
Frederick Sinnett (founder of the Melbourne Punch),[3] writing in 1856, considered traditional gothic romanticism inappropriate to Australian literature precisely because the colony lacked the requisite antiquity. For many, however, "the very landscape of Australia was gothic".[4]
Elements of Tasmanian Gothic art and literature also merge Aboriginal tradition with European gnosticism, rustic spirits and the faerie.
History [ edit ]
Nineteenth century [ edit ]
The dramatic landscape and impenetrable rainforests of Tasmania and the real and imagined brutality of the original penal colony provided a ready source of horror stories. Unsettling events such as the story of Alexander Pearce, the wandering cannibal who roamed through Van Diemen's Land in the 1820s, also influenced the bleak and sinister atmosphere that provided an ideal setting for gothic fiction. The first major work of Australian Gothic fiction, Marcus Clarke's For the Term of their Natural Life, provides a highly sensationalised account of the adventures of a convict unjustly transported to Van Diemen's Land for murder. It was first published as a novel in 1874 while the notorious prison settlement at Port Arthur was still in operation.
When the gold rush switched the focus of attention to Victoria, Tasmania began to lose its importance in the Australian economy; "[one] of Tasmania's principal exports during the first twenty years of this century was their young men".[5] As time passed, those who remained on the island became the butt of jokes by mainland Australians, who regarded them as inbred, parochial, and out of touch with civilisation.
Given Tasmania's relatively recent colonisation, artists and authors of the gothic tradition had little to draw on in terms of non-indigenous history. What indigenous history was available to them, however, was mysterious and misunderstood enough be drawn upon to support gothic imagery.
There are families (for example, the Jones family at Lower Marshes) who still own the land originally granted to their ancestors in the early years of the 19th century and still live in the houses built by their grandfathers. These families passed on stories of hardship, of encounters with Aborigines, convict servants, bushfires and floods as surrounding forests were cleared for farmland. This intersection of past and present informed the island's gothic character.[6]
Twentieth century [ edit ]
During the 20th century, a new generation of artists and authors living and working in Tasmania began to explore the gothic sensibility, drawing on Tasmania's colonial and more recent history for bizarre people and events, factual or imagined, and creating a uniquely Tasmanian stock of gothic characters and situations: deranged convict escapees ("bolters"), cannibals, corrupt and drunken officials, tough women, troubled and homesick immigrants, malevolent forest spirits, deformed halfwits and feral backwoodsmen, set among spectacular mountains, remote forest camps and Tasmania's crumbling penal colony infrastructure.
The alleged discovery of a small degenerate community on the West Coast in the 1930s became the subject of The Golden Age, an important Tasmanian Gothic work by playwright Louis Nowra, first performed by the Playbox Theatre Company at the Victorian Arts Centre's Studio Theatre in 1985.[7]
Modern variations [ edit ]
Works by novelists Richard Flanagan, Christopher Koch and Chloe Hooper are regarded as a continuation of the Tasmanian Gothic tradition. Flanagan's 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish, winner of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, is a fictionalised account of Van Diemonian painter William Buelow Gould, focusing on their years spent imprisoned at the notorious convict settlement of Macquarie Harbour. According to Carmel Bird, Helen Hodgman's novels "distil the very essence of Tasmanian gothic."[8] Danielle Wood's Tasmanian Gothic novel The Alphabet of Light and Dark won the 2002 The Australian/Vogel Literary Award.[9] Rohan Wilson won the award for their 2011 novel The Roving Party, a historical "re-imagining" into the misdeeds of John Batman and the band of convicts and Aboriginal trackers they led through Van Diemen's Land in 1829.[10] The debut novels of Cate Kennedy (The World Beneath, 2009) and Favel Parrett (Past The Shallows, 2011) have also been aligned with Tasmanian Gothic.[11]
Roger Scholes' 1988 film The Tale of Ruby Rose is about a young woman's fear of darkness in the Tasmanian highlands. Tasmanian sculptor Gay Hawkes created a series of wooden sculptures based on the film, citing Tasmanian Gothic's "synthesis of the present and past" as an inspiration. National Gallery of Victoria director Patrick McCaughey called their work the "visual embodiment of the fatal shore".[12] Julia Leigh's 1999 novel The Hunter is about a lone man's search for the last Tasmanian tiger. Described as being in the "best tradition of Tasmanian gothic",[13] the novel won the 2000 Kathleen Mitchell Award, and was adapted into a 2011 film of the same name. The story of Alexander Pearce was made into two feature films: The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce (2008) and Van Diemen's Land (2009). The 2008 horror film Dying Breed is about Pearce's fictional descendants in the backwoods of Tasmania.
In 2011, Tasmanian art collector David Walsh opened the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart, the Southern Hemisphere's largest privately-owned museum. The popularity of MONA — with its theme of "sex and death" — and the wider Tasmanian Gothic movement, has led Tasmanian tourism operators to promote the state's "dark, eerie, cold and bracing history and climate".[14]
A 2016 television series The Kettering Incident, which won an award at the Séries Mania festival (French language Wikipedia) in Paris, is also regarded as an example of Tasmanian Gothic.
Further examples include The Outlaw Michael Howe and The Nightingale.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says the country's powerful Armed Forces are defending and safeguarding the country's national interests as well as geographical, political and cultural borders.
Addressing a ceremony to mark the National Army Day in Tehran on Sunday, Rouhani said, "If arrogant powers and their mercenaries in the region cannot have a covetous eye on the Islamic Republic, it is because of the country's powerful Armed Forces."
They added that Iran currently enjoys high security and stability in an insecure region due to its powerful Army.
Rouhani emphasized that Iran has both logic and hard power on its side, emphasizing that the country's diplomats and Armed Forces are pursuing the same objectives, which are based on national security, Iran's might and its stability and development.
The Iranian president said the country's power is merely for defensive purposes and will never target its neighbors and countries in the Muslim world.
“I clearly announce here, just as I clearly announced in the presence of the heads of Islamic countries [at the summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul] a few days ago, that the power of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including our military, political and economic power will not be [used] against neighbors and countries in the Muslim world,” Rouhani added.
There is no rift among the Iranian nation, government and the Armed Forces, they said, emphasizing that the Iranian Army would repel any aggression against the country.
“However, our logic is [based on] peace and brotherhood with our neighbors and with the Muslim world,” Rouhani pointed out.
They also said that Iran's diplomacy seeks to safeguard the country's national interests, adding that during the nuclear negotiations with world powers, Iranian diplomats sought to maintain and boost the country's military might.
Iran's latest defense achievements were showcased during nationwide parades on the National Army Day, which is held to commemorate the role played by the Iranian Armed Forces in maintaining security and stability of the country.
The ceremony is held every year in the vicinity of the mausoleum of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, in the south of the capital.
Iran displays S-300 missile system
During the ceremony, Iran displayed the first batch of S-300 surface-to-air missile defense system delivered by Russia recently.
In November 2015, Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, quoted Sergei Chemezov, the chief executive of Russian state-owned defense conglomerate, Rostec, as saying that Tehran and Moscow have signed a new contract for the long-overdue delivery of the missile defense systems to Iran. Following Chemezov's remark, Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan said Iran has purchased as many S-300 missile defense batteries as it needs, adding that Iranian forces are currently undergoing training in Russia on the missile system.
In April 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a presidential decree paving the way for the long-overdue delivery of the missile defense system to Iran. The decision to deliver the system came after Iran and the P5+1 group of countries - the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia plus Germany - reached a mutual understanding on Tehran's nuclear program in the Swiss city of Lausanne on April 2, 2015.
It is very easy to get reality television wrong and exceptionally difficult to get it right. This feat, however, was achieved with aplomb by Royal Marines Commando School (Channel 4, Monday), an eight-part documentary from the makers of Educating Yorkshire , which went behind the scenes of one of the most arduous military training programmes in the world.
Using a combination of fixed-rig cameras and “embedded directors”, the documentary showed how a group of wet-behind-the-ears 18 and 19-year-olds were transformed into men over 32 weeks, by way of a succession of sharp shocks.
Presiding over the process was Corporal "Froggy" Chaffour, a French-born marine with a soft midriff, staring eyes and a wryly brusque manner. On the one hand, the training offered everything that one would expect: the obsession with sheet-folding and boot-polishing, the endless press-ups, the mindless square-bashing.
On the other, the remarkably intimate programme revealed many surprising, humorous and at times poignant aspects of life as an aspiring marine.
For one thing, it was all rather old fashioned. When not in uniform, the recruits were expected to wear suits and ties; before training commenced they had to swear their allegiance to the Queen in somewhat archaic language (all of them, I'm pleased to say, took it extremely seriously).
The first drop-your-cup-of-tea moment was when the new recruits went to bed on the first night. They were told to line up by their beds, stark naked: “A Royal Marine does not sleep in their boxers,” yelled Froggy. “He does not sleep in their socks. They sleep naked. If I catch any one of you in boxers, or in socks… Now get into your beds. Lights out.”
READ: Piper's of the Trenches, BBC Four, review: 'true moments of horror'
This was but the first example of the potently homosocial thread that ran through the documentary. A little later, the recruits were made to crowd around a shower to watch one of their superiors demonstrate how to wash, including how to clean a foreskin properly.
Overall, life as a Royal Marine recruit appeared to involve a strange combination of being mothered, being supported, being victimised, and being taught how to kill people. Which, some might argue, is precisely what a man needs at that age.

WASHINGTON -- If a fiscal cliff deal isn't struck by the end of the year, President Barack Obama will be in such a strong bargaining position that Republicans will be forced to accept the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for income above $250,000, Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), an arch conservative, predicted Thursday.
In fact, the prospect of broader tax hikes motivated Rep. Jeff Flake, soon to be the junior Republican senator from Arizona, to say that he'd accept the $250,000 limit today.
"That's an easy one for me, because you're lowering taxes that would otherwise be going up," Flake told reporters of the hypothetical $250,000 limit preferred by Democrats.
Burton told reporters that he'd be voting for House Speaker John Boehner's "Plan B," which would end the tax cuts only for income over a million dollars, because the alternative would be much worse for Republicans.
"Let's say that we don't do anything," said Burton, gaming it out in conversation with reporters off the House floor. "He lets us go over the fiscal cliff. They're going to blame Republicans. And then the president's going to be the savior."
Obama, reasoned Burton, will be able to use the bully pulpit, including their State of the Union address, to force Republicans into accepting a deal that's worse than they could get now.
"If we go over the fiscal cliff, the president just comes back and says, 'OK, we're going to give tax cuts to everybody under $250,000.' Who's going to vote against that? Everybody'll vote for that. Everybody. Because it will be just a fait accompli. You won't be voting on whether you're going to do away with a tax cut, you're going to be reimposing tax cuts for everybody under $250,000. So the Republicans are in an untenable situation."
Break your iPhone in this case, and you'll get a new one for free. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?
Meet Cellhelmet, a new protective iPhone case from a company called Cellpig. Originally started as a Kickstarter project, the cases recently went into production and are now available for retail sale.
“Originally, we wanted to create the most 'indestructible' case on the market, “ Mike Kane, CEO of Cellhelmet told Mashable. “But, as we developed our designs, we realized that we were basically recreating something that can already be found on every shelf - a big and bulky case, which wouldn't fit comfortably in a pocket. That idea went out the door real quick. At this point, a light went on and we thought, 'Why don't we design a case that is slim and sleek, with moderate protection, but get a company to back the product, saying that if the iPhone breaks inside, it will be repaired or replaced?' Bingo - we went with it.”
Cellhelmet turned out to be exactly that, a super-protective case that doesn't add a ton of bulk to your phone. The case is backed by by Global Warranty Group, and is the only case on the market that offers damage coverage on not only the case itself but also your phone inside.
If your phone breaks in the case (excluding water damage), then the company promises to replace it for a year for a $50 handling fee, with no monthly fee for the coverage. Phones are repaired or replaced within three days of receipt and are overnighted back to your address.
The case is made of dense polyurethane rubber, and has angled edges for drop-shock displacement around the device. It is purchased and used on any iPhone 4 or 4S, even jailbroken iPhones and ones you've been using for a few years now.
Apple offers AppleCare+ for new iPhones for $99, and will replace your broken phone twice due to mishandling under the program for $49 — making it still probably a better bet for new phone owners. The win with Cellhelmet is going to be for people who are still using a phone where Apple Care has run out, people who didn't sign up for coverage when they bought their Phones (most require you sign up immediately or within 30 days), and those who have jailbroken their iPhones which makes them ineligible for Apple protection.
What do you think about Cellhelmet? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

Progressive groups and their allies in Congress win one for the people.
A few months into their defense of Social Security progressive organizers and their congressional allies, sick of playing defense, decided it was time to encourage its expansion.
The release of the White House's 2014 budget in April 2013 was a stomach-churning occasion for American seniors who depend on Social Security.
In an effort to woo the austerity-now crowd, President Barack Obama included in their proposal a new formula to calculate Social Security cost-of-living adjustments: the chained consumer price index, or chained CPI. Presented as a harmless technocratic fix, chained CPI would have hit America's retirees in the pocketbook by reducing their Social Security cost-of-living increases.
At the time, much of Washington was fixated on the “grand bargain”—a long-term bipartisan budget deal. To centrist Democrats, chained CPI seemed like the ideal bargaining chip to nudge Republicans into accepting modest tax increases on the wealthy.
This year, Obama's 2015 budget includes no mention of chained CPI—a victory that can be attributed to progressive organizers working inside and outside the halls of Congress.
Chained CPI reared its head in Congress in late 2012, when the Republican and Democratic leadership were trying to broker a deal to avert the so-called “fiscal cliff ”—automatic across-the-board spending cuts. The president had previously floated chained CPI in the summer of 2011 as a way to incentivize a long-term budget compromise, and now they were doing it again.
D.C. progressives were unnerved to find so many Capitol Hill Democrats receptive to the use of Social Security as a bargaining chip. Alex Lawson is a executive director of Social Security Works , a group that seeks to expand Socia Security. “If you went around the Hill,” they say, “the Democrats were willfully silent, getting messages from the White House that we have to do [chained CPI]. People didn't know if they were allowed to fight against it.”
Lawson was also disturbed by the disconnect between the attitudes of policymakers and the will of the people. Polls from the last few years consistently show that a majority of Americans are opposed to Social Security cuts.
While groups such as Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) and Social Security Works, in addition to the AFL-CIO and AARP, had been raising the alarm about cuts since the Bowles-Simpson Commission in 2010, Lawson felt the threat demanded a larger, more active coalition. So they teamed with progressive organizers from CREDO Action and Netroots Nation to help translate public opposition into stronger Congressional opposition. They put out a call for an informal meeting about chained CPI. The goal was to get a broad swath of the national progressive movement to take a stand against cuts.
That may seem like a no-brainer. But fresh in Lawson's and others' minds was the healthcare-reform debacle. A coalition that had been united in support of the public option gradually buckled under pressure from the White House and Democratic leadership, eventually settling for a version of the Affordable Care Act that lacked a public option and that no one liked much.
“Progressive groups … all started off on the same page, but throughout the course of this fight, [power brokers] on the Democratic side would be able to pull people off on certain issues,” says Netroots Nation's Raven Brooks of the healthcare compromise.“There are a lot of reasons why [a public option] didn't win as a policy option, but … an important piece of it was this destruction of the unity that was there initially.”
During the 2012 fiscal-cliff showdown, Brooks and others were determined to stop history from repeating. So, in December 2012, about 35 representatives of progressive groups—the AFL-CIO, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), Democracy for America MoveOn and Progressives United , among others— came together and held a thumbs-up and thumbs-down vote on whether to draw a line in the sand against any cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The result was unanimous: Chained CPI was an unacceptable pill to swallow, no matter the circumstances.
Congress didn't reach a grand bargain in time to avoid sequestration. The budget cuts took effect in March. But with the White House still committed to striking a long-term compromise with the GOP, progressives kept up the pressure to save Social Security.
Led by Social Security Works, PDA and the PCCC, the coalition kicked off the New Year by pressuring the Congressional Left to go on record against chained CPI. In the Senate, they lined up Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who all spoke out against the proposal. In the House, the coalition found a champion in Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who had just retaken their seat after a defeat in the 2010 midterms.
Grayson and their colleague in the Progressive Caucus Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) rallied House Democrats against chained CPI by rounding up signatories to a letter that drew a hard line against slashing the social safety net . “We will vote against any and every cut to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security benefits,” the letter promised. Forty-four Congress members, including Progressive Caucus Co-Chairs Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), signed the Grayson-Takano letter and six more representatives made statements in support of it. That effort triggered a less strongly worded anti-cuts letter from Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) that drew 107 signatures.
Meanwhile, in April 2013, the progressive coalition delivered a petition with more than 2 million signatures to the White House. And the AARP coordinated a large-scale petition drive against chained CPI, culminating in August 2013 with the delivery of 1.5 million signatures to the House Ways and Means Committee.
At that point, Grayson was confident the president's proposal was dead in the water.“The combination of all these efforts on our part made it clear that the proposal was a political loser and would substantially undermine support for the president and anyone else who pursued it,” they say.
Tim Carpenter, national director of PDA, says the fight shows what the nationally focused progressive groups can accomplish when they devote their resources toward a common goal. “It wasn't so much about branding your organization,” says Carpenter, “but [instead about] coming together around the issue and framing the issue as part of a larger progressive movement.”
Of course, it was only a minority of Democrats actively agitating against cuts. But the opposition was amplified by the fact that there was no countervailing Democratic congressional force. All of the enthusiasm for slashing benefits emanated from the White House. Neither the 53-member neoliberal New Democrat Coalition nor the 15-member conservative Blue Dog Coalition, for instance, served up pro- chained CPI letters. This suggests that the no-cuts camp wielded influence that went beyond its visible voting bloc.
Of course, it wasn't just the work of organizers and left-wing members of Congress that kept chained CPI off the table. As the 113th Congress moved through its first session, Republicans had deluded themselves into thinking they'd be able to go on a budget-slash- ing binge without giving anything in return. As they repeatedly refused to give ground on tax reform, the GOP helped make the prospects of a deal unlikely.
The White House did not respond to In These Times' request for comment about the impact of progressive opposition to chained CPI.
From defense to offense
But the progressive coalition wasn't satisfied with holding the line. A few months into their defense of Social Security, progressive organizers, sick of playing defense, decided it was time to encourage its expansion.
In the summer of 2013, the same core of mostly online progressive organizers put out a call for another informal gathering, this time devoted to the question of expanding Social Security. The crowd gathered in late June at the Netroots Nation conference in San Jose. The vote was, once again, unanimous. “The idea was we don't want to fight for just definitional stuff [like defending Social Security],” says Lawson. “Let's fight for our aspirational stuff.”
The Netroots crew also reached a consensus on how to back an expansion. Initially, some wanted to back a proposal from Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), a moderate facing a tough reelection fight in their conservative-leaning home state. Others favored liberal stalwart Sen. Harkin's plan, which went a step further than Begich's by creating a new formula for calculating benefits that would boost them, on average, by about $70 a month. In order to maintain unity, the groups decided to cross-endorse each bill, and together push for the “Harkin-Begich plan.”
A month later, the blitz was on.
On July 27, the senators went on The Ed Show on MSNBC to promote their proposal to scrap the program's cap on high-income earners and increase benefits. Yearly income above $113,700 is exempted from the payroll tax that funds the Social Security Trust Fund. Lifting that cap would extend the program's long-term solvency and provide the means to fund two major increases: Harkin's proposal to raise monthly benefits and a more generous cost-of-living adjustment.
The PCCC sent out a video of the segment to its supporters, and along with Democracy for America, Social Security Works and CREDO, started collecting signatures in support of an expansion. They now have more than 650,000. The AFL-CIO, too, strongly backs Social Security expansion. Neither Harkin's nor Begich's bill stands a chance of passing the GOP-dominated House, but that's beside the point— the Harkin-Begich plan, at its core, is about messaging. It's about changing the parameters of the debate over Social Security, which during the Obama era has been limited to quibbles over how much to cut. By these measures, the drive for expansion has been a re- sounding success.
This offense-is-the-best-defense strategy probably helped push chained CPI and the grand bargain off the White House's agenda. But the push for expansion bore other fruit. Instead of withering away like most “clicktivist” initiatives, the effort helped pave the way for what many call the “new populism” in Congress, buoyed by the headline-grab- bing abilities of Sen. Warren.
In November 2013, Warren spoke on the Senate floor, blasting chained CPI and backing Harkin and Begich. An ensuing kerfuffle revealed how drastically inner-party dynamics had shifted in the course of only a year. Writing in the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal , the leaders of Third Way , a neoliberal think tank, charged that “economic populism is a dead end for Democrats.” The article generated backlash, which, in turn, sparked much public debate about the future of the party. About a month-and-a-half after the op-ed, Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D-Pa.), who's running for Pennsylvania governor, resigned as honorary co-chair of Third Way. (Her spokesperson said the member of congress thought the article was “outrageous and strongly disagree[d] with it.”)
Out to further prove their credentials to the Left, Schwartz went on to lead the effort to get Obama to ditch chained CPI in their recent budget. Instead of one of the usual suspects like Grayson, Takano or Grijalva, it was Schwartz's name that appeared at the top of a February letter to the White House decrying the proposed cut, followed by 116 other members of Congress.
It is that kind of jockeying that provides evidence of where Democrats want to stand on Social Security ahead of the 2014 elections.
What began as a fundamentally defensive fight has now evolved into an offensive one. The PCCC is trying to make Social Security an election issue in 2014. Each of the four non-incumbent candidates the group has endorsed so far—Kelly Westlund in Wisconsin's 7th, Lee Rogers in California's 25th, Daylin Leach in Pennsylvania's 13th, and Shenna Bellows, running for Senate in Maine—all support strengthening the program.
Westlund is taking on Rep. Sean Duffy, a Tea Party Republican (and lumberjack) who lauds “entitlement reform,” in a district with the highest percentage of seniors in the state.
“Social Security is one of the most effective anti-poverty programs that we've ever had,” Westlund says. “If we scrap the cap, that's only going to expand the opportunity for seniors to stay out of poverty for the future.”
Toying with cost-of-living adjustments was supposed to be an easy way to reduce Social Security benefits. It just may have been the Left's long sought-after impetus to expand them.
Capcom adds to its horrible habit of making games with an X in the title that you're supposed to pronounce "cross" (i.e. Street Fighter "Cross" Tekken, Project "Cross" Zone)--only this time, it makes more sense.
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Mega Man, Capcom is working on a social RPG featuring every version of the Blue Bomber to date. Titled Rockman Xover, it's being released this fall in Japan for iPhones. Taking place in Xover World (Crossover World), a combination of every Mega Man universe, players will take control of a special mass-produced battle robot co-developed by Dr. Light and Dr. Cossack. Series villains including Dr. Wily and Sigma have trapped all of the individual Mega Man heroes, so it's up to you, other players, and this new customizable robot to save the world.
I'm normally pretty optimistic when it comes to games, but... this looks too much like the craptastic iOS port of Mega Man X. If one of my all-time favorite games got that kind of treatment, you can understand why I'm a little leery of this--even if the idea sounds fun as hell.
What do you think? Is Mega Man Xover (Rockman Xover in Japan) going to be better than we all expect?

Bandai Namco is continuing its Tales of Berseria information blast this week with more information on the game's “Break Soul” system, which we in the over 70 screenshots released earlier this week.
Get the information below.
■ New Battle System: “Break Soul”
Break Soul enables players to exceed the upper limit of performable artes per combo. They're character-specific actions that trigger special effects.
Basic Outline
If you possess three or more souls, you can trigger an action with a special ability. By using Break Soul, you can exceed the upper limit of performable artes per combo. Additionally, character-specific actions are also being prepared, whose effects and ability each vary greatly. By switching between characters based on enemies and the state of battle, the breadth of battle will rapidly expand.
Additionally, there are stages to Break Soul, and as you play through the game, you'll unlock even more ability.
Conditions for triggering: If you possess three or more souls, press the R2 button to consume one soul and trigger Break Soul.
■ Break Soul by Character
Velvet's Break Soul: “Consume Claw”
A battle specialized ability that combines strength and attack.
With the power of their left hand, Velvet eats the ability of their opponent, and enters the “Theronized” strengthened state that reveals their inhuman left hand. When certain conditions are met in this state, you can unleash powerful special moves artes.
As compensation for the powerful ability, your HP will gradually decrease in the strengthened state, and since when your HP is low the power of your special artes increases, it can be used for maximum effect depending on the direction of battle.
If you press the R2 button, the attack that tears apart enemies via the change in your left hand will be triggered.
A feature of Velvet's Break Soul is that depending on the species of the attacked enemy, the “strengthened effects” and “types of special artes triggered” change.
—Species: Beast-Type
Strengthen effect: Increases damage to the degree of the enemy's high attack power.
Specil Arte: “Scarlet Edge” can be triggered.
—Species: Amorphous-Type
Strengthen Effect: Increases damage to the degree of the enemy's high defense power.
Special Arte: “Thunder Blitz” can be triggered.
Laphicet's Break Soul: “Divide Pain”
When you trigger Laphicet's ability, the field expands to halve the damage received from the enemy for five seconds. Also, when the effect is cancelled, you can heal all of your allies' HP. And when you're surrounded by enemies, or if you're in a battle against a formidable foe, it's an ability that will get your allies from a in a pinch to back into a good position.
If you press the R2 button, the field expands with Laphicet at its center. There is also a hitbox in the expanded field. If you can hit a guarded enemy, it is also possible to break their guard.
Rokurou's Break Soul: “Retribution”
By receiving an enemy's attack, you can trigger a powerful counter technique. It's difficult to use, but is very powerful and a successful hit will result HP recovery for Rokurou.
If you press the R2 button, Rokurou will take stance and a counter will be triggered when you receive an enemy attack. If the counter is successful, the “Retribution Rip” counter technique will be triggered. This is particularly effective against enemies that dish out big attacks, but if you use it well, you can drag surrounding enemies into the mix when you counter.
Magilou's Break Soul: “Spell Absorber”
When you use Magilou's Break Soul at chanting enemies, you can cancel the enemy's chant. At the same time, you can absorb the spiritual power produced by the enemy's chanting, and when it accumulates to a certain amount, trigger a counter technique.
In the case that there is an enemy using an technique, this is an ability that shows overwhelming effect. Also, when you cancel a chant, it will effect all chanting enemies.
There are several counter techniques you can trigger, and which one is triggered is based on Magilou's mood in the moment.
1. While the enemy is chanting its technique, press the R2 button to trigger Spell Absorber.
2. Cancel the enemy's chant and at the same time absorb its spiritual power.
3. When you accumulate a certain amount of absorbed spiritual power, you'll trigger a powerful counter technique.
4. The triggered counter technique is random, but there are wide range and high power techniques, and skillful use can catch all the enemies in a single blow.
■ Combos Using Break Soul
Break Souls can be embedded into combos, and you can link at least as many Break Souls as the number of souls you posses. When you trigger a Break Soul, in exchange for one soul, there is a special characteristic that lets you resume the combo from the first stage of your artes without stopping while staying in the combo state.
Example: A combo when you have four souls
Immediately following a four combo arte link, you trigger Break Soul. The Break Soul consumes one soul, reducing your total amount of souls to three. You can resume the combo from the first stage of your artes without stopping and continue until you get down to three souls.
1. The first arte…
2. The second arte…
3. The third arte…
4. The fourth arte, naturally where the combo ends, but…
…a Break Soul is triggered and in exchange for one soul, you can start the combo again from the first arte.
5. The Break Soul…
6. The first arte again…
7. The second arte again…
8. The third arte again, and since you only have three souls, you can only link until the third arte…
…before, if you're playing as Velvet, you end the combo with a powerful special arte.
■ Other Break Soul Characteristics
Since Break Souls also have an effect where they recover HP when triggered, by adding combos to a Break Soul, you can recover HP while attacking. Additionally, Break Souls also have a guard break effect.
■ Changing the Controlled Character
By pressing L1 + the left or right directional keys, you can switch between the character you're controlling. In the battle menu, you can also switch between characters using the L2 and R2 buttons.
Introduction
Associated Press
On June 17, 1972, when a security guard found five men in an office at the Watergate complex in Washington, they opened a door not just on a break-in by Nixon operatives at Democratic National Committee headquarters, but also on a network of presidential criminality and deceit that shocked the world.
There were slush funds and hush money, wiretaps and burglars, cover-ups and corruption, an “enemies list” and “dirty tricks.” These tactics were used in the name of national security to fight antiwar activists and attack political enemies.
After the Watergate scandal, there were calls for greater regulation of political fund-raising, stricter ethical codes, more aggressive news media and more independent prosecution of official misconduct, as well as scorn for government secrecy and surveillance. But have those notions survived the last four decades?
“Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,” said the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
But lately facts haven't been breaking in Mitt Romney's direction and so their campaign is fluctuating between moments of panic and outright denial, trying to impose its opinion on unwelcome polls.
“At this early stage, polls go up and polls go down. I'm tied in the national polls; both Gallup and Rasmussen have the numbers at even,” Romney told ABC News, while asserting that they didn't just think they were going to win, they were sure of it.
Yes, candidates always say they will win elections. But there is a particular problem with this bit of bravado - Romney is basing it on made-up information. Because at the time, Gallup put Barack Obama six points ahead, 50 per cent to 44 per cent.
This matches most national polls to date. The crucial swing states have all been breaking for the president over the past two weeks — with V irginia and New Hampshire showing eight-point moves toward the Democrats after months of being deadlocked.
Ohio is likewise drifting decisively in Obama's direction. Florida and Nevada remain closer in most polls, but none of these states show a Romney lead right now.
The Republican response has been to blame the polls. After all, in this hyper-partisan world view, all “mainstream media” is skewed by a liberal conspiracy to diminish conservatives and so the polls must be rigged. One partisan website even attempts to readjust the ratios of Republicans and Democrats sampled in the polls, to put Mitt Romney ahead.
This is the bargaining stage, denial masked by rationalisations, desperately searching for silver linings and reflexively shooting the messenger.
The national numbers seemed to have hinged on Romney's instantly infamous 47 per cent comment, caught by a bartender's camera-phone at a fundraiser and released last week.
Speaking in front of a well-heeled crowd, Romney said that proportion of Americans who don't pay federal income tax are in the tank for Obama: “There are 47 per cent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.”
Calling this 47 per cent of Americans — which includes senior citizens and active duty military — “victims” didn't do the candidate any favours. In addition, the stark division of the country into producers and moochers seemed un-presidential, if you believe that the job of the president is to try to unite the nation after an election.
These comments crystallised negative narratives about Romney being the candidate of the Super-Rich, out of touch and un-empathetic, a million miles from George W Bush's successful campaigns, based on a philosophy of “compassionate conservatism”, that reached out beyond the Republican base to cobble together a majority coalition.
Moreover, it is no longer an “early stage” of this campaign, despite Romney's assertions. Yes, a week can be a long time in politics and the three presidential debates remain, but we are now 40 days out and despite the still sluggish economy with 8.1 per cent of Americans unemployed, Romney has yet to lead in any recent national polls.
Politics is not a science: at its best it is an art and at its worst it is something like a war - but in all cases history is the most reliable guide.
And here too there is bad news for the Romney campaign. Nate Silver, the statistician behind the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog calculates: “Of the 19 candidates who led in the polls at this stage since 1936, 18 won the popular vote (Thomas E Dewey in 1948 is the exception), and 17 won the Electoral College (Al Gore lost it in 2000, along with Mr Dewey).”
In other words, while the fat lady isn't yet singing, they are clearing them throat.
In the past, a candidate could disregard the polls and say with some defiant confidence that “the only poll that matters is on Election Day” — but that is no longer the case. Thirty-six states now offer early voting, either in person or by mail. Iowa started early voting this week and the bulk of the other states begin in early October. That means that the current polls can reflect current voting trends — and the trend is not their friend.
Mitt Romney has so far not just failed to make the sale, they have managed to dig themselves a deeper hole. On every major personal attribute — from “connects well with ordinary Americans” to “takes consistent positions on issues” to “strong leader” and “shares my values” — polls show President Obama beating Mitt Romney by double digits. Perhaps most troubling, even Romney's own supporters see their vote as being against Obama rather than for the Republican.
The conservative echo chamber has long been so negatively obsessed with President Obama that they frankly can't believe the polls they see — everyone they know hates the man. But it turns out that there is a downside to creating your own alternative political reality: you can't credibly spin your way out of statistics.

Image caption No injuries were reported after the plane skidded off the runway
An Indonesian passenger plane has skidded off a runway into a field after crashing into a cow.
The Lion Air plane, with at least 110 passengers on board, hit the cow as it came into land at Jalaluddin airport on the island of Sulawesi.
No-one has been reported injured, but the cow was crushed to death under a plane wheel.
The pilot, Iwan Permadi, told the national news agency Antara that they could smell "burning meat".
They said they initially thought there were dogs in front of the plane, "but it turned out there were three cows wandering in the middle of the runway".
Transport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan told AFP news agency that all the passengers had safely disembarked.
The airport was closed after the incident, affecting people's travel plans for the Eid holiday. It has now reopened.
Indonesia relies heavily on air travel to connect its more than 17,000 islands, but the country has one of Asia's worst air safety records.
Lion Air is one of Indonesia's biggest private carriers, and has been expanding rapidly in recent years.
In April this year, at least 22 people needed hospital treatment when a Lion Air plane on a domestic flight missed the runway at Bali's Denpasar airport and came down in the sea.
This little prototype began as an idea for a twin-stick shooter in the vein of Super Stardust HD. But while the action in Super Stardust HD takes place on a sphere, I wanted to see if similar gameplay was possible on implicit surfaces.
The idea was that the movement of the surfaces would supply a constantly changing play field. The way the primitives that compose the surface break apart and rejoin supplies a new mechanic to aid in attacking or escaping from enemies. Jumping could also be implemented as a means of getting from one primitive to another.
I already had an old implicit surface library that I made years ago. That took care of drawing the surfaces. On top of that I added some basic navigation and shooting of projectiles.
A great looking enemy for this sort of twin-stick shooter would be a snake or worm, reminiscent of Centipede. And, when prototyping, it's good to try to implement the most difficult parts first. Such an enemy was the trickiest thing I could think of programming in this environment, so I got to work.
It wasn't long before I decided this implicit surfaces environment would be a good platform for a collection of mini-games, not just a twin-stick shooter. One obvious possibility is a snake game where you eat food, grow, and try to not run into your ever-lengthening body.
As expected, making a snake move the way I wanted was hard. This video shows one of my first attempts. Notice that the body slides around a lot.
Sliding randomly across the surface, the snake would be too unpredictable. To make such a game playable, and to make the snake look alive, it needed to slide along one unchanging path. Of course, the path would change a little because the surface is changing, always stretching or compressing underneath the snake.
I had programmed the necessary basics for my twin-stick shooter idea. For example, I could already differentiate between an entity's velocity and the velocity of the surface on which it resided. So I set about solving the problem with a slew of vector math tricks to try to preserve the snake's curves. I kept making so many corrections to the movement that the code became overcomplicated and hard to think about. I even considered laying unmoving points on the surface that could be used as control points for some type of spline and having the beads of the snake body follow the spline, but this failed too many thought experiments.
The final solution is a two-step process. First, create a polynomial curve between each pair of beads. This curve is defined by the positions of each bead in the pair and a center point. The center point is a weighted average of points indicated by various beads' positions. The weighting is carefully tuned so that the snake will hold its shape.
Second, a target position is found for each bead somewhere along its polynomial curve. Then its velocity is modified to bring it toward that position. It isn't brought all the way to that position so the snake will feel more flexible and alive (this is an art project, after all (we don't need cold, mathematical precision)).
Notice in the video how the path of the snake holds its shape. If you adjust the polynomial weighting one way, curves in the path collapse into straight lines. Adjust it the other way and curves expand.
The next video shows the addition of food. When the snake eats, it gets longer. There is also collision detection, so if the head runs into the body the game resets. The collisions also keep parts of the body from passing through one another. When the surface changes enough to cause different strands to intersect, the collision detection causes one strand to rise off the surface a little and pass over the other. The camera has been modified to face the same direction as the snake's head and tilted back a little to help the player see what dangers lie ahead.
At this point, it's actually a playable game. Of course, there is no interface in the video, but you can see the length of your snake printed in the console where you executed the game. This is only a prototype of the difficult programming issues. To make it better you could add fancy graphics, levels, power-ups, multi-player, and anything else you can dream up.
Math is hard.
Professional relationships are as disposable in our culture as goods on the shelves at Walmart, and so it is an especially happy occasion to report on the flowering of an artistic pairing, in this case of playwright J.T. Rogers and director Bartlett Sher. Their previous work together produced Blood and Gifts, Rogers' tidal drama, spellbindingly staged by Sher, about the intersection of the personal and the political (or, more accurately, the blurring of any line between them) among an ebbing-and-flowing power mash-up of spies, warlords and U.S. and Soviet functionaries in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 1980s; I wasn't alone in naming it one of the best plays of 2011.
Now comes the extraordinary Oslo, Rogers' riveting dramatization of another complex political tarantella that unfolded in secret before, in September 1993, stunning the world. That was when Bill Clinton presided at a Rose Garden ceremony in which Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization's chairperson Yasser Arafat shook hands after signing a historic peace accord. Oslo opened last summer in Lincoln Center Theater's Mitzi E. Newhouse; it's moved upstairs to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont, where it opened tonight. It's even better the second time around.
“Oslo,” by J.T. Rogers. T Charles Erickson
We look back on that Rose Garden scene with bitter nostalgia for the blinding ray of hope that event promised but was destined to renege on. Irony is not, however, Rogers' métier. Their point in Oslo is to reveal — carefully, fully and sensitively — the backstory of the accords and how a Norwegian couple with approximately zero political capital brought the two intransigent sides together at an ancient castle where, through a series of meetings virtually mined to explode or collapse, they forged an imperfect but tangible peace treaty.
The naively optimistic couple are Terje Rod-Larsen and Mona Juul. He's an academic who has developed an interpersonal approach to conflict resolution that he's convinced will work in advancing the cause of peace where everything else has failed. She's a smart, ambitious cog in the office of the foreign ministry. That they are played by the insanely convincing and appealing Jefferson Mays and Jennifer Ehle only underscores their determination against all odds, including diplomatic convention and protocol, a key factor in making this nearly three-hour evening pass swiftly.
Terje and Mona manage, through clandestine, coded telephone conversations, to bring together a foursome of Shakespearean ingenuity, intelligence and humor. From the PLO, the finance minister Ahmed Qurie (the elegant Anthony Azizi) and their fevered, slogan-spouting lieutenant Hassan Asfour (Dariush Kashani, coiled and intense). From the Israelis, insistent on protecting their plausible deniability over any negotiations with the declared enemy, two economics professors, the earthy, brilliant Yair Hirschfeld (Daniel Oreskes, as though born to this rich role) and the sedate Ron Pundak (Daniel Jenkins, all business).
“Oslo,” by J.T. Rogers. T Charles Erickson
The interconnections among the Norwegians can be a bit dizzying: Mona's boss, the deputy foreign minister (also played by Jenkins) is married to Terje's academic colleague (Henny Russell), and the couples are social friends. And as the negotiations surprisingly begin to suggest movement on both sides as the four negotiators thrust and parry and nurse unexpected friendships, the Israeli professors are replaced by government officials (Michael Aronov and Adam Dannheisser) and their Washington-based legal muscle (Joseph Siravo), threatening at first to torpedo the whole enterprise before succumbing, as their predecessors have, to a more human impulse.
This all sounds talk-talky, and it is – which is what makes Sher's accomplishment with the text so compelling. As they showed earlier this season with their elegant staging of Romeo et Juliet at the Metropolitan Opera, Sher has always shown a willingness to take imaginative leaps that bring an engaging perspective to material – whether with revivals including the musicals The King and I and South Pacific, the plays of Clifford Odets and a heart-wrenching take on August Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone — or new work such as this.
Rogers and Sher take the players in this comedy of terrors at face value, refusing to douse it in cynicism or the certainty of hindsight. We hardly need them to remind us of how soon the hopes of Oslo were dashed. Working with a first-rank group of artists (Michael Yeargan, the simple, suggestive sets; Donald Holder, the detailed lighting plan; Catherine Zuber, the spot-on costumes) they conspire every bit as persuasively as Terje and Mona to lend these unseen events enduring weight. Like the boy in the tree witnessing Admiral Perry's meeting with the Japanese in Pacific Overtures, we have observed history in the making (and unlike the boy, we have heard it as well). For an all too brief moment, we can look back to that handshake in the Rose Garden and recall how thrilling hope can be.
Bobby Cannavale and the company of “The Hairy Ape.” Stephanie Berger
To the list of the season's great theater performances that won't be eligible for recognition come Tony time, we must now add Bobby Cannavale, who is astonishing in Richard Jones' revelatory revival of Eugene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape, which is running only through April 22 at the Park Avenue Armory. Taking their cue, I suppose, from Chekhov, O'Neill called this brutal drama, first presented in 1922, a comedy “of ancient and modern life.” Cannavale is Yank, a proud, cocky coal stoker in the bowels of a ship, where he's the gruff alpha male among the beefy, beer-swilling crew. When Mildred, the swank, slumming daughter of the ship's owner gets a look at Yank, they have an attack of Anne Darrow-itis to their King Kong, calling them “a filthy beast.” Yank is much more than that; they pride themselves a thinker as well as a bruiser, and Mildred's denunciation unexpectedly shakes them to the core. They set out on a harrowing nightlong journey through the swellsville of Park Avenue, demanding to know, “Where do I fit in?”
Could any play be timelier than this wrenching, tragic cry of an outsider looking for acceptance? Jones, a visionary director, and their team (Stewart Laing, design; Mimi Jordan Sherin, lighting; Sarah Angliss, music and sound; Aletta Collins and Thomas Schall, movement and fights) have turned the gaping field hall of the Armory into a blinding Expressionistic fury, something like a solar flare, with the audience in searing yellow bucket seats on rafters facing an enormous revolve on which the suggested set pieces – cages, mostly, for the stokers and others – roll into and out of view. There's nothing realistic about it, except for the emotional truths of alienation and dehumanization that suffuse the events leading to the play's inevitable, tragic climax.
Against this, and with the assist of a brilliant company, Cannavale gives a performance that's utterly lacking in affectation, so completely open and raw, that by the end we're left spent as well as rattled to our own core. Among the many things we seek in the communal act of theatergoing, finding out where we fit in ranks high. The answer O'Neill offered up in The Hairy Ape is devastating.

The Warriors wanted respect in 2015. They wanted to show the world they weren't lucky in 2016. They wanted to hush those 3-1 blown-lead joke tellers in 2017. But what will they rely on in 2017-18, when there is nothing left to prove?
It all starts with a ring ceremony to celebrate their accomplishments, pass out championship rings, and raise a banner to forever remember their season.
hdnux.com
Their last championship chase was so dominant that they pushed their closest rival to split, made others with no hope tap out until the Warriors call it quits, and forced would-be challengers to cross their fingers and hope they'll find reward in risky combinations.
Commissioner Adam Silver started the event by introducing the 2016-17 champions. After the name of each executive, coach and player was announced to the sold-out crowd, owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber distributed the rings to the Warriors personnel.
Stephen Curry lead a countdown from five to raise the franchise's new banner. The crowd erupted with cheers when the banner was revealed. The Warriors have been to three straight NBA Finals, winning two of three.

HTML, SVG or Canvas Labels?
Posted in: javascript infovis toolkit , visualization , javascript
Using HTML labels
//Add the name of the node in the correponding label //and a click handler to move the graph. //This method is called once, on label creation. onCreateLabel : function ( domElement , node ){ domElement . innerHTML = node . name ; domElement . onclick = function (){ rgraph . onClick ( node . id ); }; }, //Change some label dom properties. //This method is called each time a label is plotted. onPlaceLabel : function ( domElement , node ){ var style = domElement . style ; style . display = '' ; style . cursor = 'pointer' ; if ( node . _depth <= 1 ) { style . fontSize = "0.8em" ; style . color = "#ccc" ; } else if ( node . _depth == 2 ){ style . fontSize = "0.7em" ; style . color = "#494949" ; } else { style . display = 'none' ; } var left = parseInt ( style . left ); var w = domElement . offsetWidth ; style . left = ( left - w / 2 ) + 'px' ; }
I'm using well known HTML elements. Dealing with DOM elements let's you add event handlers, individual styling and things like that.
I'm using a DOM tree, which means that if labels are plotted at all times I'm exhaustively updating the DOM and this might lead to performance problems. HTML is good for structuring pages, but for example you might want to apply transformations to HTML elements (like rotating labels, etc), and these aren't supported by all browsers yet. So one of the problems that might arise is, for example, the fact that in radial layouts labels might be occluded:
Using SVG labels
Graph.Label.Native (for native canvas labels)
Graph.Label.DOM(abstract class for dom elements)
Graph.Label.HTML(extends the DOM interface with HTML specific stuff)
Graph.Label.SVG(extends the DOM interface with SVG specific stuff)
//Add the name of the node in the correponding label //and a click handler to move the graph. //This method is called once, on label creation. onCreateLabel : function ( domElement , node ){ domElement . firstChild . appendChild ( document . createTextNode ( node . name )); domElement . onclick = function (){ rgraph . onClick ( node . id , { hideLabels : false }); }; }, //Change some label dom properties. //This method is called each time a label is plotted. onPlaceLabel : function ( domElement , node ){ var bb = domElement . getBBox (); if ( bb ) { //center the label var x = domElement . getAttribute ( 'x' ); var y = domElement . getAttribute ( 'y' ); //get polar coordinates var p = node . pos . getp ( true ); //get angle in degrees var pi = Math . PI ; var cond = ( p . theta > pi / 2 && p . theta < 3 * pi / 2 ); if ( cond ) { domElement . setAttribute ( 'x' , x - bb . width ); domElement . setAttribute ( 'y' , y - bb . height ); } else if ( node . id == rgraph . root ) { domElement . setAttribute ( 'x' , x - bb . width / 2 ); } var thetap = cond ? p . theta + pi : p . theta ; domElement . setAttribute ( 'transform' , 'rotate(' + thetap * 360 / ( 2 * pi ) + ' ' + x + ' ' + y + ')' ); }
Just like with any other DOM element, you can add event handlers.
You can apply transformations to labels.
Performance, for the same reasons as HTML.
IE does not support SVG.
Native Canvas labels
Graph . Label . Native = new Class ({ plotLabel : function ( canvas , node , controller ) { var ctx = canvas . getCtx (); var coord = node . pos . getc ( true ); ctx . fillText ( node . name , coord . x , coord . y ); }, hideLabel : $empty });
Opera does not support this feature.
You can't natively add event handlers to labels. I think I've seen someone do something similar for text in processing, but I'm not sure there's a good way of doing this without keeping track of the position of each label and perform a check each time a click is triggered in the canvas element.
I should change the way I define controller methods, in order to be able to pass a custom label object with x, y, theta, rho, width, height properties that could be modified on the fly, and then translate these changes into translate and rotate native canvas calls to be able to plot the text the way the user wants it. This seems just to damn complicated.... But I'll consider it.

As you might know, the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit uses the HTML5 Canvas element for plotting and animating graphs. This is all very nice, Canvas performance compared to other techniques for plotting these things (SVG for example) is by far superior. But of course, there are drawbacks. Canvas better performance is due to the fact that there are no tracked elements: the Canvas is simply an image and you're drawing there just like you'd be drawing something in paint. One big problem is that there's no native possibility to add events to what's drawn in Canvas, like a plotted node, edge or label. As opposed to Canvas, SVG has a DOM/XML like spec: you have all these tags () and each of them is just like a DOM element: you can add click event handlers, individual styling with CSS, etc. Having to keep track of all these elements and handling a DOM-tree makes the performance of SVG not suitable for visualizing (and animating) medium to large datasets on the web.Just like SVG, HTML is a DOM/XML-like spec, where you can add event handlers to each element. Also, every web developer knows HTML so exposing HTML labels through user-defined controller methods in the library seemed to me like a good choice. For controller methods like onCreateLabel or onPlaceLabel an HTML element is passed and the user can style or add event-handlers to it. For example, here's a fragment of the code used in the RGraph demo . You can see the rest of the code here In my opinion this is a good approach, good points are:Weak points are:So I began exploring other possibilities to create labels. For this I abstracted the Label interface I had and split it into:I also modified the Canvas class so you can specify the type of labels you want to use, labels:'HTML', labels:'SVG' or labels:'Native'. Default's HTML. The same RGraph example code now would look like this:This code does a little bit more than just plotting the label, it rotates the labels so they're not occluded:Good points of this approach are:Weak points:Bonus good point: Google is making work SVG in IE with some open source library that works apparently the same as the ExCanvas library. Here's the Open Source project that will be presented here . That's like the main reason why I've been considering a different approach for labels ;)Native Canvas labels make use of the HTML5 Canvas text API to plot labels. Since the labels are just painted in the Canvas there's no DOM tree to update, and performance is good. The Canvas text API has fillText, strokeText and measureText as methods. You can read more about the Canvas Text API here . This is the code I added to the Graph.Label.Native class:A very good point about this approach is performance. Also, the code is simpler. You don't have to keep a labelContainer and update DOM labels each time you're making an animation. Weak points are:Anyway, these are the methods I've found to plot labels into graphs. Which one do you think is the best? Do you know about any other approaches I could take to solve this problem?
British Airways is set to shut its lucrative final salary pension scheme as it battles a £3.7billion black hole.
The move will hit 17,000 workers who save for their retirement in the airline's New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS).
Instead, it will move members to its defined contribution scheme.
But the move risks a battle with unions which will be concerned that stock market-linked pension schemes are less lucrative than final salary schemes.
BA has been fighting a growing deficit in its pension scheme as it has been hammered by low interest rates and increasing longevity. It is paying the largest contributions of all UK pension deficits relative to its value.
However, BA says that if NAPS stays open, the cost of providing future benefits to members could rise to 45 per cent of a worker's pensionable pay in 2018 – four times the typical employer contribution of UK airlines.
It said: ‘Since 2003, the airline has pumped £3.5billion into NAPS, but the deficit – resulting from record low interest rates and increased life expectancy – had risen to £3.7billion by March.
It is the largest of all UK company pension deficits relative to the company's overall financial value.'
Unions have slammed the plans, which they claim will leave ‘thousands of loyal staff facing uncertainty in their retirement'.
Workers who pay into a defined benefit pension scheme get a guaranteed income for life, based on their final salary, or career average pay.
The income is usually adjusted for inflation and often provides benefits for next-of-kin.
But workers who pay into a defined contribution scheme pay into savings which are used to buy a pension when they retire. The size of the pot is determined by the performance of the stock market.
BA paid £750million in pension contributions in 2017 and has already committed to provide between £300million and £450million a year until 2027 to address the shortfall.

Defensive “castle wall” approaches to cybersecurity no longer deter increasingly aggressive hackers. To meet cyber challenges, CIOs are now deploying tools and strategies that support prevention, early detection, and rapid response.
Increasingly, cyber criminals attack organizations using sophisticated techniques that evade many of the security controls established over the last several years. Recognizing this reality, CIOs at some leading organizations are approaching cyber risk more broadly by utilizing both defensive and offensive capabilities. In the landscape of cyber intelligence, mere deterrence is no longer sufficient. Companies must be able to identify threats before attacks occur—and respond proactively.
To support this approach, CIOs and IT are adopting forensic, logistics, and analytic capabilities and techniques to mine intelligence from both internal and external sources. By doing so, they are able to develop a deeper understanding of the origin of attacks and track specific adversaries to enhance future risk analysis. If a security breach occurs, they can move quickly to detect, isolate, and contain it.
Moreover, CIOs may soon be able to add new tools to their cyber intelligence arsenals, including technologies that support real-time sharing of threat information within industries; digital identity programs to validate employees and other users working both internally and externally; improvements in the way companies recruit and retain cyber intelligence talent; and bold new approaches to office design that promote privacy and compliance with security policies.
Although cyber threats are pervasive and often complex, the building blocks of a proactive approach to addressing them are similar to those for any well-planned business initiative. As such, organizations need to understand what's at stake and the maturity level of their current efforts, and then make improvements by enhancing their capabilities whenever possible.

This weekend I slipped back into the realm of Eorzea. I intentionally wanted to have an entirely different play experience than I have had in previous weekends so I decided to make use of the Playstation 3 client and instead of playing my typical melee centric characters I choose to start anew as a thaumaturge.

I have a confession to make. I never really play alts. In fact up until a few years ago other than using them as mules I downright despised them. I've since lightened up on my stance on alts (it was kind of ridiculous to begin with) but I had some kind of stupid "moral objection" to them. When I played an MMORPG and created my character, that character became my primary concern in the game. I would do anything I could to make that character as powerful and as complete as it could be, whether that is through crafting, fishing, doing every quest the game has to offer, exploring every nook and cranny on the map... that's what you would find me doing. While chasing this goal of completion of my one character I ultimately missed out on a lot of what any one game had to offer. This is one of the reasons that I adore the job system in Final Fantasy XIV:ARR. I can still spend all of my time on a single character but now I'm not limited to only ever getting to play one class and job. I can now play all of them. This system, for completionists like me, is a dream come true. While this sounds like it may present a whole new set of challenges when it comes to inventory management, Square Enix had the foresight to add in the Armory Chest (see Ryahl's article earlier this week) which addresses this concern.
I had reservations about playing the game on my PS3. First, how could it look as good? Second, how was the game going to handle. The answer to the first question is, it will not, but it still looks good. In fact it looked much better than I assumed it would. I was also pleasantly surprised with how the game handled with the controller. While I still prefer to play the game with a mouse and keyboard the controller scheme works very well. The cross hotbar design that SE has developed for FFXIV:ARR is very well done. You have immediate access to 16 slots on your hotbar and that is more than enough actions for any normal situation. SE could teach Trion a thing or two about creating UIs for a game that is going to be played both on the console and the PC. The biggest limitations when using the controller are that you have to toggle across menu items on your UI that you can just click on if you are using a mouse and keyboard and secondly it is much slower to chat. I'm sure that last one doesn't come as a surprise to any of you. For me this lends itself to using the different clients for different purposes. If I want to participate in group content and be social I will choose to play the game on my PC in my office. If I am in the mood to work on my tradeskills and lounge about in my living room I can play the game on my PS3.
After getting familiar with the controls on the PS3 I switched back over to my PC and leveled my thaumaturge. Last time I leveled a job I spent the majority of my time in The Black Shroud. This time, with a new job came a new starting area. Ul'dah and their surrounding areas of Thanalan provided a nice arid contrast to the deciduous forest of the Shroud. The new Thanalan does fell like less of a wasteland than its 1.0 version did. I had no difficulty in finding enough quests to keep me occupied on my journey to level 20. In fact my main job quest did well guiding me through the story of the game as well as opening up new systems to my character. Job specific skills become available at certain intervals: the ability to learn a new job, how to dye your equipment, and how to use the armory system among other things all become available and explained to you by following your main job story-line through the world. Square Enix has also done a masterful job at crafting their tutorial system in this game. The pop ups that explain new systems as you encounter them are invaluable. I like to look at tutorials as insurance. You may never need one, but when you finally do you will be extremely happy that you have it.
I enjoyed my time as a Thaumaturge. I found it interesting that they were able to equip a shield. Even when I did not wield a shield, this job was much less squishy than I thought I would be. I also like how SE differentiated the Fire, Ice, and Lightning spells from the very beginning. Instead of essentially being the same spell having the same amount of damage just with different elemental affinities, each spell had different properties. Fire dealt more damage and cost more mana. Ice cost less mana and dealt less damage but increased in combat mana regeneration. Lightning spells left damage over time effect on your target. One thing that I wish SE would change is the naming convention of the spells. Blizzard I was a single target ranged spell, Blizzard II was a point blank area of effect spell, and then Blizzard III went back to being a single target ranged spell. I hope they find a way to work spell names like Blizzara, and Blizzaga into the mix. It is attention to the little details like this that will continue to make this game feel more like Final Fantasy and not just another high fantasy theme park MMO.
I also spent some time working on my crafting this weekend. I switched back over to my console and worked on Goldsmithing. Much like hunting logs, SE rewards you with bonus experience for completing a recipe for the first time. This makes it much easier to complete the early levels. If it wasn't for this bonus experience learning a craft could quickly become a grind. You are also able to craft items that you would actually use very quickly and for a reasonable cost in materials. I also like that, at least in this stage of beta, you can buy all the low level materials you will need besides crystals from a vendor in your guildhall. This still leaves a market for gatherers to sell crystals on their retainers but does not make the hunt for materials so severe that crafters are forced to either gather all their materials for themselves, go broke in the bazaar, or just abandon their pursuit. You also learn skills as your progress in crafting that allow you to increase the chance that you will make high quality items.
The more I play FFXIV:ARR the more I keep wanting to play. I continue to applaud SE on taking the risk to rebuild this game and I hope their efforts are properly rewarded. I'm also hopeful that FFXIV:ARR can be one of the leaders in a MMO renaissance on consoles. With Dust 514 already on the PS3 and PlanetSide 2 and Elder Scrolls Online recently announcing they too will be on next generation platforms, eventually MMO gaming on consoles could be as commonplace as it is on PCs. I'm looking forward to the next beta weekend where I can start to tackle some more of the systems that make FFXIV:ARR different. While I have done Tam Tara Deepcroft I have not participated in any of the other dungeons yet. I also want to take part in more Guildhests and I'm interested to find out more about what SE has in store for the Free Companies as they are allowed to gain points for something. What about you? What was your favorite part of the past beta weekend and what are you itching to learning more about? Does the game feel enough like Final Fantasy to you? I look forward to reading your comments below.

Ergüven's film shortlisted for foreign Oscar
LOS ANGELES - Agence France-Presse
‘Mustang' is focused on five sisters living in a village in northern Turkey.
France's “Mustang” and Hungary's “Son of Saul” are among the nine films that have made it onto a shortlist in the contest for the foreign-language Oscar, Academy Awards organizers said late Dec. 17.The nine films, seven of them from Europe, one from Colombia and one from Jordan, were selected from 81 submissions.“Mustang” is the first feature film by Franco-Turkish director Deniz Gamze Ergüven.Focused on five sisters living in a village in northern Turkey who are kept at home by their family when they are deemed too rebellious, it was screened at the Director's Fortnight at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and has received international critical acclaim.It is the first time in decades that France is being represented by a non-French-language film.The last time was in 1960, when its Portuguese-language submission, “Black Orpheus,” won the Oscar. France last won an Oscar in 1993 with “Indochine,” starring Catherine Deneuve.The harrowing Holocaust drama, “Son of Saul,” that offers unflinching depictions of the gas chambers of Auschwitz, claimed the runner-up Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.Hungarian director Laszlo Nemes has been widely acclaimed for taking audiences into a Nazi concentration camp and showing the Holocaust in a different way.Others in the running are Belgium's “The Brand New Testament,” Colombia's “Embrace of the Serpent” and Denmark's “A War.” Finland's “The Fencer” also made the cut, as well as Germany's “Labyrinth of Lies,” Ireland's “Viva” and Jordan's “Theeb.”The shortlist will now be whittled down to five finalists who will be announced together with all other Oscar nominations on Jan. 14, 2016.The 88th Academy Awards will take place in Los Angeles, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2016.
Were toddlers in the boot drugged with Nytol before mother 'asphyxiated them'?
Tests are being carried out today to determine whether two children allegedly murdered by their mother were drugged with Nytol before they were smothered.
Fiona Donnison walked into a police station on Wednesday and told shocked officers they had killed their son Harry, three, and daughter Elise, two.
An initial post-mortem carried out yesterday on the bodies of Harry and Elise revealed that they had been asphyxiated less than 24 hours before they were found.
The bodies of Elise, 2, and Harry, 3, Donnison were found in the boot of a car in Heathfield on Wednesday. A post mortem revealed they had been asphyxiated
Officers are investigating whether Mrs Donnison gave the children the sleeping drug Nytol before suffocating them a few hours before they were found, the Sun newspaper reported.
However the results of toxicology tests won't be known for several weeks.
A Sussex Police spokesperson yesterday confirmed that officers had had 'previous contact' with the Donnison family 'within the last few months'.
It also emerged last night that Mrs Donnison, 43, suffered the agonising cot death of a baby daughter six years ago.
Mrs Donnison and their husband Paul found their world falling apart after their first child - Mia Florence - died at just ten months.
Although they had two more children, the rows and spells of depression grew more frequent until Mrs Donnison took Harry and Elise and moved into a rented home several months ago.
Friends spoke of a 'history of allegations and counter allegations' between the couple, who had both been married previously.
Last weekend Mr Donnison, 46, an accounts manager, was arrested over claims that they assaulted their estranged wife during a bitter argument.
Arrested: Fiona Donnison, pictured last July, and right, their daughter Elise in a photograph Mrs Donnison posted on the Friends Reunited website
On Wednesday, Mrs Donnison walked into an East Sussex police station and confessed to murdering them children..
Their bodies of Harry and Elise, in two sports holdalls, were in the boot of their Nissan car, parked close to the £500,000 home in Heathfield, East Sussex, where the family had lived.
Detectives were still searching the house and the rented home in Surrey where Mrs Donnison, a former City worker, moved with the children.
They slashed their wrists before walking into the police station in Heathfield - which is just 300 yards from their former home - and was taken to hospital in Eastbourne.
 They are recovering under police guard but detectives have not yet been able to interview them

Incident: The grey Nissan where the bodies of two children were found
Family home: The Donnisons lived together in this house before separating just before Christmas
Friends said the marriage began to collapse after little Mia died in April 2004, just two months before their first birthday.
When the couple discovered they were not breathing, they took them to hospital but doctors could not save them
At an inquest the following month, coroner Alan Craze returned a verdict of death by natural causes.
The official cause was 'sudden unexpected death in infancy'.
Family members posted tributes to Mia on a memorial website.
A poem written by one of their grandmothers reads: 'A flower blossoms; then withers and dies.
'It leaves a fragrance behind which, long after its delicate petals are but little dust, still lingers in the air...'
Cordoned off: The car is removed from the scene as the road remains closed off

I parents, and Mrs Donnison's sons from their previous marriage, wrote: 'We all miss Mia terribly - with all our love and hugs always - Mummy, Daddy, Will and Ollie xxxxx'
Neighbours noticed a marked change in Mrs Donnison after the tragedy and said they often appeared 'strained'.
A friend said they had been deeply depressed after losing Mia, but was always a 'loving mum' to their other children and well as their two older sons W, 15, and O, 12.

The friend said: 'This was not like them They must have snapped.'
But the couple's marriage had been falling apart for a long time. The friend said: 'I knew it was never going to work between them.
'It was just not meant to be. They were both so different. I've been around them when they rowed.'
Mr Donnison is currently on police bail after being arrested for common assault.
It is understood their wife accused them of scratching them during a row at their old home.
A Sussex Police spokesperson said: 'We are aware of previous contact with the police in relation to this family.
'This will be reviewed as a matter of standard procedure with various agencies and also to help the current inquiry.'
It is thought the Independent Police Complaints Commission will be asked to probe the force's dealings with the Donnisons, as there appeared to be no warning of the horror that unfolded this week.
Insiders said detectives were trying to establish what drove Mrs Donnison to allegedly take the lives of their children.
A source said: 'At this stage, police don't know what caused the break-up of their marriage and what triggered this terrible tragedy.
'It is not clear whether either of the Donnisons were involved in new relationships.'
Officers are also checking Mrs Donnison's mental health records and are liaising with social services over whether they had had any contact with the family.
Social services refused to comment but a spokesperson for the local mental health trust said it had had no dealings with Mrs Donnison.
Forensic scientists last night removed what looked like a medicine box from Mrs Donnison's rented home in Lightwater, Surrey. The clear plastic box appeared to contain tablets and medicine bottles.
Neighbours on the quiet residential street in Lightwater, where one of Mrs Donnison's older sons was also living, described them as a 'loner' who had made no effort to get to know people in the area.
'She was always looking down,' said one man.
'I think they only ever waved to me once and that was because they had no other choice because I was standing right in front of her.'
An elderly neighbour said: 'The previous Monday they just put the kids in the car and went. They were gone for the whole week.
'Nobody knew where they had gone and then a For Rent sign went up but they came back on Saturday. I just assumed it was to clean the house ready to move out.'
At Mr Donnison's parents' home in Chertsey, Surrey, a relative said: 'We're going through hell. We've never been through anything like this before.
'I'm sure you can imagine how difficult it is to come to terms with what has happened.'

Size, speed, incredible leaping ability and safe hands. Everything you look for. Plus that little extra something that usually separates the good from the great — an agitated, pissed off with the world attitude.
I never had a problem with Sidney's fairly frequent visible frustration. They knew how to get open — and one of Russell Wilson's major areas for improvement is to capitalise on missed chunk plays. I'm sure we can all remember one of the several times Rice — hands clasped to their helmet — knew their QB had missed a chance.
One sticks in the mind — an impressive scramble in the playoff victory over Washington 18 months ago. At the time it looks great on the TV — until they played the replay. Rice destroyed the coverage. They were wide open. One look and throw from Wilson — it would've been a touchdown. And for a timely fourth quarter comeback that play could've been costly.
For all the clutch plays and grit shown by Seattle's receivers last year, nobody quite knew how to get open like Rice. Even when they were covered they usually found a way to make things happen — a late knee to the turf, an elbow grazing the grass just as they were about to go out of bounds.
Who can forget their touchdown in Arizona? Brilliance from Wilson to scramble and throw off balance — but also brilliance from Rice to adjust their route and find a soft spot in the end zone. Textbook. Pure class.
I'm not sure why this announcement was made today. ‘Concussions' seem to be the slightly vague determining factor. Have they received some fresh medical advice? Was this latest comeback from a serious knee injury a step too far? Did they secretly know deep inside they wouldn't make the cut?
As talented as they are, Rice just couldn't stay healthy. He's one of those guys who always seemed to be banged up one way or another.
It cost them a potential shot at greatness. The talent, the physical qualities, the attitude. It was all there.
Yet their role in Seattle shouldn't be underestimated. We talk about it a lot on here — but the 2010 Seahawks roster was a patchwork effort by Pete Carroll and John Schneider when they inherited a mess of a franchise. They needed to inject some proven quality in free agency to get it going.
When they signed Rice and Zach Miller during the 2011 off-season after a lengthy lockout, it continued the Beastquake momentum. It was the start of Seattle becoming a trendier destination for free agents. And as hoped, they made the team better. Good enough to contend and then eventually dominate.
They got a lot of cash for an injury hit spell with the Seahawks, but I highly doubt anyone in the front office will be second guessing the decision to sign Sidney Rice.
Seattle added Morrell Presley as a replacement — a TE/WR. Essentially, another big bodied target.
Rarely, if ever, can a prospective transfer be simultaneously described as both ideal and horribly ill-advised. Currently, however, Tottenham are flirting with that dichotomy in their pursuit of Paris Saint-Germain's Serge Aurier.
It's a situation which has been forced by the sale of Kyle Walker to Manchester City. Mauricio Pochettino had decided as early as March that Walker's shifting priorities had made them expendable, but must also have known that the full-back's acceleration and staggering athleticism would, in their absence, leave a void in their first team.
Kieran Trippier is a fine crosser of a ball and, in Kyle Walker-Peters, Spurs have a young player capable of enjoying a Premier League future.
Trippier: a superior crosser but might lack Kyle Walker's dynamism
Nevertheless, neither covers the pitch in quite the same way as Walker. Their detractors commonly reference their haphazard delivery and occasional defensive blunder, but the essence of their value lies in their ability to provide shape. By virtue of being able to cover so much space, Walker was the bridge between the two halves of Pochettino's team; able to cover the channels to the right of the centre-halves, but also a decisive attacking component who drew markers' attention beyond the halfway line. They may have their flaws, but Walker is an impact player capable of changing the speed of a game.
The natural replacement
Superficially, Aurier is a natural replacement. He's the quintessential modern full-back: loaded with skill, full of dynamism, and with the lung capacity of a deep sea diver. At just 24 years old and priced at under £25m, Tottenham would - under normal circumstances - be crazy not carry an interest.
But this is not a normal situation. As the rumours of their arrival in north London have intensified, so the discussion about Serge Aurier the person has begun.
Supporters have generally accepted that young athletes, sometimes without the benefit of a regular upbringing, make mistakes
The last two years of Aurier's career reads as a vivid caveat. They have been banned and fined by UEFA for making disparaging remarks about a Champions League referee, and arrested for (and convicted of) assaulting a police officer after refusing a breath test. Notoriously, they were also filmed on social media making disparaging remarks about several PSG team-mates.
Worse, they included a series of homophobic slurs against their then-manager Laurent Blanc.
If the bulk of those issues can be categorised as generic, the latter cannot. Supporters have generally accepted that young athletes, sometimes without the benefit of a regular upbringing, make mistakes. They also understand that great wealth can sometimes act as a multiplier of personality defects, often created by the over-indulgence that the game affords its gifted youth.
Blanc referred to Aurier's homophobic insults as "pitiful" in a press conference
If that was the extent of the complication, it's likely that Tottenham's signing of Aurier would pass without incident - maybe with an urging for caution and concerns about a wayward character, but nothing truly prohibitive.
The remarks made by Aurier don't fall into that category, though. The loaded terminology used, whether measured or flippant, carried a great deal of offence. At a time when football believes itself to be entering into a period of heightened awareness, the perception of a seemingly unrepentant player being allowed to continue their career without major repercussions is particularly damaging.
Ultimately, what none of the initiatives which either target homophobic abuse or promote equality for LGBT people obscure, is that football retains a habit of whitewashing social issues at its convenience. As has been shown in other instances, albeit involving behaviour aimed at other minorities or directed towards particular ethnicities, sporting achievement is often allowed to masquerade as redemption.
Tottenham's conundrum
Mauricio Pochettino is a diligent manager who prioritises squad harmony above everything else. This implies that, if Tottenham's interest is firm and they do intend to complete this signing, they have received certain assurances from Aurier's representatives or the player himself. Such due diligence is entirely appropriate, but it would amount to just a single layer of a process which needs to take place.
FEATURE Football's age of personality scouting: why ability is only half of it these days
The club is not in a position to tell its supporters what they should be comfortable with and they must not be tempted to draw their own line under a matter of such complexity
Whatever the sporting value of the player may be, the greater concern is that their arrival alienates supporters from the club - that their signing, by implication, tramples the fears and concerns of those fans and entrenches them within a moral dilemma. It would be a grave mistake, for instance, if Tottenham - or any other club - believe that a nice cross, an important goal or just a series of good performances would be a sufficient form of redemption.
The hope must also be, beyond the worst case scenario of zero communication, that the boundaries of acceptability are not drawn by the club and bluntly presented to those with concerns. The club is not in a position to tell its supporters what they should be comfortable with, and they must not be tempted to draw their own line under a matter of such complexity. While fans sometimes have unrealistic expectation over the influence they can expect to exert, this is an instance in which co-operation with LGBT supporter groups should be considered mandatory.
Aurier milks the moment after PSG win the French Cup
It's plausible that Serge Aurier becoming a Tottenham player would have a depth of impact which isn't fully understood, but that only emphasises the importance of a conversation. Rather than just a presentation of facts, that must be a discourse in which people are actually heard and their perspective genuinely respected and acted upon.
Perhaps Tottenham have had Aurier's remorse demonstrated to them. Maybe. But that's still something which must be communicated properly, because - as yet - the toxicity of the Blanc episode hasn't been contained. At least in public, there has been no real show of contrition, comprehension or regret.
Without that, there's no validity to the voices of appeasement who urge forgiveness. It's credible to portray Aurier as a troubled young man, as someone detached from society by their wealth, and also a person who hasn't necessarily enjoyed certain environmental or societal privileges, but this kind of arguments are always lit by contrition.
In 2017, the growing belief is that supporters only matter to football clubs for as long as they're willing to pay for tickets and buy replica shirts. They can certainly be forgiven for believing that they only matter for as long as they can afford that relevance.
In this particularly instance, though, Tottenham has to tread very carefully, or otherwise they'll create another reason for people to turn away. Not because they want to, but because they have to. Serge Aurier might well be a very fine footballer, but sporting ambition is never reason enough to compromise the values of a club or create conditions under which anybody feels uncomfortable inside their stadium.

Politician-bureaucrat-contractor nexus the biggest bane of India's water sector: secretary
Shashi Shekhar, the top official in India's water ministry, explains what is wrong with the whole sector, and what should be done about it
India's National Democratic Alliance government headed by Narendra Modi has placed a lot of emphasis on cleaning rivers – especially the Ganga – and improving irrigation efficiency throughout the country. It has also revived the controversial project to interlink India's rivers. Through it all, Shashi Shekhar, secretary in the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has largely been the man behind the scenes. Now, a few weeks before their retirement, the ministry's top official describes the problems and prospects of India's water sector in a candid interview with indiaclimatedialogue.net.
Question: Just a few days ago, you said at the conclusion of India Rivers Week that the biggest problem with the country's water sector was the politician-bureaucrat-contractor nexus. Can you please explain that?
Answer: Look at irrigation works. Construction has money. Any construction with a lot of earth work (as for building a reservoir and canal irrigation) interests more and accountability is also less. I say that I am creating irrigation but basically I am constructing assets. Look at the difference between irrigation potential and actual irrigation, and you'll see what I'm talking about. The average gap is about 45%. The interest is not in irrigation but in constructing assets because that is where the money is. All the states have sizeable budgets for this. After all that, the total (canal) irrigated area in the country is 10-15%. So why should it get such vast resources? It does so, because the contractor is interested, and there are below the table payments. This is the problem.
Question: What is the solution?
Answer: The solution lies in giving control of all irrigation – surface and groundwater – to the people who use the irrigated water, the farmers. Water is too important, too vital for our lives, to be left to others. Its control has to be in the hands of panchayats (elected village councils). They are the ones who must decide how to use water, first for human needs, then for animal needs, then for irrigation. And when the panchayats or local water users groups have the (water availability) information, they do take the correct decision. When they know the supply, they manage the demand. There are examples of this from Maharashtra and Pennagaram in Tamil Nadu. This needs to be replicated all over the country.
Question: But considering the current situation, especially the depletion of groundwater, can panchayats make effective decisions unless there is an overall law regulating extraction of groundwater?
Answer: These are the challenges that face us today. The question is, should we allow this to continue? The answer is no. We have to have conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water and bring them under one umbrella. That is what we're doing with the (planned) national water commission. We get all our water in 90 days, and that has to be used for 365. We have to store water. But for the reasons I've said, storing them on the surface is not the best way to do it. You cannot have more surface reservoirs as India is a land deficit country, so the storage can happen only below ground level. Plus underground water does not evaporate. So we have to store our water underground, and use that sensibly. Anyway, how much water do you need for irrigation? Kharif (summer) crops grow during the monsoon, when it's raining. Rabi (winter) crops need three wettings at most.
When a village knows it has a total of 100 units of surface and groundwater available, it also knows it cannot use 400 units. We must learn to live within our means. Out of nearly 650,000 villages in the country, only about 100,000 get water from canals. The other 550,000 villages have to fend for themselves. So there is a need to prioritize the use of water and that has to be done at gram (village) panchayat level. For this, capacity building of gram panchayats is most urgent. It is an enormous task.
For equitable distribution of water, panchayats have to sit and decide. Law cannot help in this. And it works. Pennagaram recorded a 20-fold increase in income in just the first year. But for the villagers to draw up a water budget, they need to know how much water they have. That is where the government comes in. We have been providing one piezometer for a 20 km by 20 km area. We are now increasing this to a 5 km by 5 km area. I think we should provide a piezometer for every 2 km by 2 km area. Then people will know how much water they have, and they can decide how to use it, how to save some in case the next year is a drought year. Then you won't have this situation of growing water intensive crops like sugarcane in a water scarce area.
The state of rivers
Question: Healthy rivers are a very important part of what you're talking about. What's your ministry doing to restore the health of India's rivers, especially when inter-state water disputes keep getting worse all the time?
Answer: In this country, we have rivers without water. They go dry for nine months and hence they're not serving their ecological functions. And this includes the Ganga, our national river. Rivers and humans are competing with each other. When it comes to inter-state water disputes, nobody is thinking of the river as an ecosystem. They are fighting only for the water. Due to lack of data (on water flow and the health of the river) this has become a perpetual problem.
Question: But don't we have a lot of data on highly contested rivers such as the Cauvery?
Answer: No we don't. The Cauvery agreement was drawn up in the 1920s, when its headwaters in Coorg flowed through far more forested areas. Now those forests have been largely replaced by coffee plantations, roads and other projects. Coorg does not generate that kind of water any more, and we have no data.
Opening up data
Question: So what are you doing about generating more data and making it more transparent, available to everybody?
Answer: Yesterday (December 7) in the cabinet meeting it was decided that free (water flow) data will be made available for each river basin in real time. It will be put on our website and anybody can use it. It was also decided earlier that groundwater data for every 25 square kilometres will be made available.
Question: Will this apply to water flow data in transboundary river basins as well – the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins?
Answer: That will be the next step.
Rejuvenating the Ganga
Question: Coming to Namami Gange (the government's large project to rejuvenate the Ganga), what is the current situation?
Answer: It is a difficult question to answer. I will choose it to answer it in a circuitous way. No river that has been taken up for rejuvenation, be it Danube or Murray, and these are narrow rivers compared to the Ganga, have taken less than 30-40 years. Then why are we talking about five years?
As far as the cleaning part is concerned, there are different types of pollution that needs to be tackled like sewage, industrial waste, solid waste that flows from various households into the drains that empty in the river. Since the 1980s (when the first Ganga Action Plan was launched) , the focus has largely been on two things – STPs (sewage treatment plants) and riverfront development. As far as STPs are concerned, most of them are either lying idle or are being bypassed. That is because my interest is to construct STP and I am only concerned with the construction part of it. It is just the same as for irrigation. Once it's built, it doesn't matter to me. But if salaries are paid on the basis of O&M (operation and maintenance), there will be some accountability. PPP (public private partnership) makes a lot more sense.
The government has prepared a strategy for pollution abatement. But the real test of a river is whether it carries enough water. And with that if the river's ecology gets restored, if fish species like rohu and katla get restored, that will be the proof of the pudding.
Question: When you talk about restoring rivers, do you face a problem because water is largely a state (rather than central) subject in the Indian Constitution?
Answer: Yes, it is a problem. Even when it comes to resolving disputes, the centre can step in only if the concerned states agree. No state has invoked that act of Parliament. See what Punjab is doing now (on the Sutlej Yamuna link canal issue). A change in the Constitution is required. The demand for that has to come from the people. Only then will the politicians listen.
Question: What is your opinion of the interlinking of rivers scheme?
Answer: I'll not speak about this on record.

Voters should support the Liberal Democrats in constituencies where Labour cannot win, Gordon Brown has indicated, further fuelling speculation that Labour expects to be unable to form a majority government after polling day.
In an exclusive interview with politics.co.uk the prime minister gave their strongest signal yet that voters should consider tactical voting in order to prevent the Conservatives forming the next government.
The prime minister was asked whether they endorsed an appeal made by Peter Mandelson in March to voters in the south-west of England. They suggested they should vote Liberal Democrat in order to stop Conservative candidates from winning seats in the region, as first reported by the Western Morning News.
"The Liberal Democrats have more in common with Labour than with any other party," Lord Mandelson added.
When asked for their views on the comments, the prime minister told politics.co.uk : "I don't think we want a Conservative government, let's be honest about that.
"But the choice is between a Labour government and a Conservative government. You're not going to end up with one of the minor parties running the government - no matter how keen you are to see their interests represented and no matter how interesting some of their policies may be.
"So I think what they [Lord Mandelson] is saying is if you don't want a Conservative government make sure you don't get one.
"I want everybody to vote Labour and I want people to vote for our party, and I want our vote to be the highest and I want our number of seats to be the highest.
"But if people don't want a Conservative government then they must make sure they don't allow the Conservatives in."
The comments go even further than those made by the transport secretary Lord Adonis, who raised the sensitive issue of tactical voting in a provocative article in the Independent on Friday morning.
In an article for the newspaper they wrote: "To avoid a Tory government after May 6th, it is vital to grasp now the fundamental Labour-Lib Dem identity of interest. This can best be served by Labour coming out of the election as strong as possible, able to form a government.
Lord Adonis added: "In Labour-Tory marginals, a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote which helps the Tories against progressive policies. And in Labour-Lib Dem marginals every Labour MP returned is a seat in the Commons more likely to put Labour ahead of the Tories and therefore better placed to form a government."
The comments are in direct contrast to the sentiments of Tony Blair before the 1997 general election.
During the 1997 campaign, activists who called for voters to vote Lib Dem to get the Tories out of power were expelled for breaking Labour party rules.
The Lib Dems have reacted furiously at being called a minor party as well as the suggestion that a vote for the Liberal Democrats would lead to another five years of a Gordon Brown-led Labour government.
The Tories are targeting a number of potentially vulnerable seats in the south-west including Somerton and Frome, Bristol North West and Taunton Deane, where the election contest is a straight fight between the Conservative and Lib Dems.
Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson and former leadership hopeful Chris Huhne's seat in Eastleigh, where they are defending a majority of just 530, is also highly vulnerable.  They are number 11 on the Tories' overall target list.
The Lib Dems are also weakened in Cornwall. Two seats with radical boundary changes in central Cornwall, Truro & Falmouth and St Austell and Newquay, will hit long-time incumbent Matthew Taylor's vote, while Colin Breed is standing down in Cornwall South East.
A senior Lib Dem source said: "As the Independent's front cover on Friday shows, Labour are sending out mixed messages on this all the time.
"Brown is more mealy mouthed than some of their colleagues. But I think people will see it as the partisan posturing it really is.
"We're not going to give a running commentary on the latest desperate tactic of Labour HQ, just keep campaigning for every vote for the Liberal Democrats!"
“Frontier in Space” is an adventure of the tenth season of “Doctor Who” classic series which aired in 1973. It follows “Carnival of Monsters” and it's a six parts adventure written by Malcolm Hulke and directed by Paul Bernard.
The story
The Tardis materializes in a starship and the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) states that they arrived in the twentysixth century. There's no time for exploration because the spaceship is attacked but a member of the crew who discovers them and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) thinks them to be Draconians, like their attackers. Suddenly, everyone sees the other in different ways.
According to the Doctor, someone's using a hypnotic sound to cause hallucinations but he's immune and sees that actually the ship was attacked by Ogrons. When they discover that the Draconian Empire accuses humans of attacking their starships, they suspect that someone wants to provoke a war between the two powers but they must first defend themselves from the accusation of being a Draconian spy.
Extras
This DVD is rich in extras. There are typical contents such as production subtitles, Radio Times Listings, a trailer about the next “Doctor Who” DVDs to be released and a gallery of pictures from this adventure.
There are comments in the adventure alternative audio track by protagonist Katy Manning, producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks moderated by Clayton Hickman.
Perfect Scenario: Lost Frontier. In the XXVI century, there's no more oxygen on Earth and humans must live in a kind of stasis locked up in special pads. Some of them look back and discover how in the XX century the series “Doctor Who” looked at the future. It's a curious way to see the different possible futures in a pseudo-documentary.

On the occasion of the tenth “Doctor Who” anniversary producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks wanted to create an adventure at least as long as the epic “The Daleks' Master Plan”, consisting of twelve parts. However, the production would've been complex and there were concerns about the audience reactions to such a long adventure so eventually it was decided to produce two connected adventures six parts each.
“Frontier in Space” is the first of those adventures. The author Malcolm Hulke was strongly inspired to the political situation of the time imagining a future Cold War between the humans and Draconians. Between these two powers there's a fragile peace achieved after a war started because a first contact went wrong. Today's science fiction fans can notice the similarities of the incident that triggers the Earth / Minbari war in the series “Babylon 5”.
The conflict between humans and Draconians isn't the usual kind with humans being the good ones and aliens being the villains, in fact the situation on Earth and its colonies is ambiguous to say the least. In theory, there's a democracy and the President was elected by the people. In reality, General Williams can threaten the President to heve them deposed to put pressure on them to start a new war against Draconia.
It's not clear who holds real power on Earth but certainly armed forces are a part of it. Opponents, however, can be sent to the Moon penal colony for the rest of their lives even if they're peaceful.
The Draconians are interesting aliens though they were created using the clichés of warrior people inspired by the Japan of the samurai era. “Frontier in Space” would've been better if more time had been dedicated to showing something more about their planet and their society.
The Draconian also appeared in Big Finish audio adventure “Paper Cuts” – available on Amazon UK , Amazon Canada and Amazon U.S.A. – featuring the Sixth Doctor.
It's interesting that the Doctor can be heard with greater openness by the Draconians than by humans. Of course, when they present themselves in front of the emperor of Draconia they tell them they visited the planet in the past and they were elevated to Draconian noble by the emperor of the time for their services. This makes things easier for the Doctor but the contrast with the closed minds of the Earth's authorities shows the climate of paranoia that exists among humans.
The Master tries to take advantage of this situation and he's another of the highlights of “Frontier in Space” more for their humour than for their clash with the Doctor. This is the last appearance of the actor Roger Delgado, who unfortunately died in a car accident a few months later.
There was the idea of producing another adventure where the Doctor and the Master would've been forced to work together and their relationship would be revealed. There was even the idea to reveal that they were brothers but it had to be abandoned so we'll never know how the series would've been affected.
“Frontier in Space” has several interesting elements, unfortunately not enough to fill six episodes. The consequence is that the Doctor and Jo spend most of this adventure closed in some prison. In the classic “Doctor Who” series it often happened that the Doctor and their companions got in trouble with the local authorities and were locked up. It was a way to make the adventures longer when there was a need but in this case the padding is really exaggerated.
The various elements of “Frontier in Space” would work better if compressed into four episodes but the need was to produce six and the padding tends to break the plot. The fact that this adventure has no real ending but ends with a cliffhanger that starts the next adventure makes the situation worse.
I think the overall result is still good, however I also understand the people who remain dissatisfied seeing the elements of the story a little fragmented amid the many moments when the Doctor and Jo are closed in some prison.
This DVD is part of the “Dalek War” box set – available on Amazon UK , Amazon Canada and Amazon U.S.A. – so a global judgement of that box set must necessarily be given only at the end of the reviews of the adventures it contains.
Ever on the lookout for victims of Obamacare – which Fox then trots out as “proof” that the entire Affordable Care Act is a failure, Fox is not too particular about the facts. Such as whether or not these people really are victims. We saw it with the Hannity show, with The Kelly File and now… Your World.
Media Matters has the scoop on this latest crop of disingenuousness:
The October 29 edition of Your World with Neil Cavuto featured two “victims” of the ACA who had previously appeared in a misleading NBC report on the sticker shock of the health care law. Host Neil Cavuto spoke first with Deborah Cavallaro, a Los Angeles resident highlighted repeatedly by NBC, who received a notice saying their current plan would be replaced by a plan with higher premiums. Like NBC, Fox failed to mention that Cavallaro's current plan “barely deserved to be called insurance at all.” Moreover, neither network compared Cavallaro's current plan to those that they could get on the California exchange, where a Bronze Plan would cost less and likely offer more coverage than their current bare-bones plan. … Cavuto also hosted Richard Helgren, a retiree from Lansing who, like Cavallaro, was featured in the NBC report. Helgren said that their “plan would no longer be available because of changes under the ACA,” and that their deductible would skyrocket under an alternative policy offered by their insurance company. Although Helgren did not shop through the exchanges, they ultimately used an insurance agent to find a good plan with a lower premium, a fact noted by the NBC report but neglected on Fox.
Watch the video below and note how Cavuto makes no indication Fox has fact-checked a single claim from either guest. But they did chime in to add, “That's a large chunk of Americans, …it's about 18%” who buy their own insurance, as Cavallaro does, when they said people like them fared poorly under Obamacare. The obvious implication was that nearly that many Americans would be screwed.

The Forth Road Bridge is to be closed until new year because of structural defects. The 51-year-old bridge has been hit by numerous problems over the past decade. What has happened this time?
From the end of next year, the Forth Road Bridge will cease to be the most important link between Fife and Edinburgh when it is replaced by the new Queensferry crossing.
The decision to build a new crossing came after years of problems with corrosion in the steel cables which support the existing suspension bridge's 13,800-tonne weight.
However, the latest closure is for a completely different failure.
Image copyright Forth Road Bridge Image caption Engineers showed pictures of the crack in the truss under the bridge carriageway
Image copyright Forth Road Bridge Image caption The diagram shows the location of the defective steel component
Chartered engineer Mark Arndt, from maintenance contractor Amey, told a media conference they had been faced with an "unprecedented set of circumstances".
They described the fault as a failure of the "inner link support beam to the North east tower truss end link".
The engineer went on to explain how a crack of about 20mm in width had appeared in the load-bearing link.
If the same had gone on to happen on the other side, the road deck could have fallen by a minimum of 150mm (6in).
Image caption The Forth Road Bridge will be closed for at least three weeks
Mr Arndt said: "Should this has failed and the deck did drop, that poses an immediate safety risk because it could happen very quickly.
"The other issue is that the load is then supported on other elements that are not designed to take it. Instead of being the end of the year to get the repair implemented you would be talking months."
Mr Arndt said "fatigue and over-loading over the course of the bridge's 50-year lifespan" had led to the "shear failure" at the bottom of the truss - in other words the steel of the link fractured and became detached from the rest of the load-bearing structure.
The engineer said: "Shear failures happen very quickly. It is very difficult to predict when they might happen but when they happen it is very quick and very significant.
"This is the main support below the carriageway at the point where the bridge cables meet the tower."
They said detailed non-destructive testing was carried out on the adjacent supporting members and they found the load was "propagating" there.
Mr Arndt was concerned that a similar fault could appear on the other side of the tower support leading to more damage and safety implications.
"As shear failures happen quickly and unpredictably we were left with no alternative but recommend the bridge be closed," they said.
"It is an unprecedented set of circumstances that we faced here. Independent opinion was sought throughout the process. It is a complex engineering challenge at a very difficult to access location."
Image caption The Queensferry crossing should open at the end of next year
The problem was first discovered during a planned routine inspection on Tuesday afternoon.
The southbound carriageway was closed that evening to "remove live-loading from the carriageway above the defective area".
A contraflow was put in place and on Wednesday a full-scale technical assessment began which worked through the night into Thursday.
Mr Arndt said work on an interim repair had been ongoing but the structural assessment indicated "significant over-stress at this and other locations as a consequence of this failure".
At 14:30 on Thursday the bridge was closed to HGVs because of the "over-stress" on the defective areas.
At midnight it was closed completely and will remain shut for at least three weeks.

The Joint Communication adopted today outlines steps to be taken to address the obstacles which are hampering the movement of military equipment and personnel across the EU with the aim of facilitating and expediting their mobility to react in a fast and effective way to internal and external crises. In doing so, the European Commission and the High Representative are delivering on the commitment to use all the tools at their disposal to build a Union that protects.
"European citizens understand that only together, as a Union, can we tackle the security challenges of our times. Cooperation inside the European Union and with our partners has become a must. There is a growing demand for our Member States to coordinate and work together on defence. So while we are moving forward with the Permanent Structured Cooperation to make our defence more effective, we have also decided to further strengthen military mobility among EU Member States and in cooperation with NATO," said High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini upon adoption of the Communication.
Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc said: "The European Union has a modern transport network that serves the needs of Europeans. These needs can also be of a military nature. The swift movement of military personnel and equipment is hindered by physical, legal and regulatory barriers. This creates inefficiencies in public spending, delays, disruptions, and above all a greater vulnerability. It is high time we maximise civil and military synergies also through our transport network in an efficient and sustainable manner."
Due to the specific status of armed forces and equipment, military mobility is legally bound by a range of national decisions and EU rules, but there is room for a more coordinated and harmonised approach which would maximise the EU-added value and build on civilian/military synergies.
With the Joint Communication, the European Commission and the High Representative are setting out how they will work to facilitate and to help expedite military mobility, ranging from routine needs to strategic pre-deployment of military forces and resources – all this will be done in full respect of the sovereignty of Member States, in synergy with civilian activities and without disrupting civilian use of infrastructure or unnecessary inconveniences. Any action will be coordinated not just between the EU and the Member States, but also with other relevant stakeholders, especially NATO.
Key lines of action for stepping up military mobility within the EU are:
- To develop a shared understanding of the needs and requirements, which will need to be further examined and agreed upon by the Member States.
- To develop a common understanding on the infrastructure to be used and its impact on the infrastructural standards.
- To address relevant regulatory and procedural issues (customs, dangerous goods, other legal barriers, national procedures).
As regards infrastructure policy, the Joint Communication proposes to build on the existing Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). It identifies a number of points on which synergies could be envisaged. This includes the possible dual use of the network for civilian and military purposes, cooperation with defence stakeholders as regards the TEN-T policy database (TENtec) and a reflection on the use of the Connecting Europe Facility – the funding instrument implementing the TEN-T – in the defence field.
Next steps
By March 2018, the High Representative and the Commission will propose an Action Plan on Military Mobility for Member States' endorsement. This plan will suggest recommended actions, implementing actors and ambitious timelines on how to address identified barriers hampering military mobility in European territory, building on the results of the European Defence Agency's Ad Hoc Working Group on Military Mobility, established recently to provide expert input.
Background
Since the end of the Cold War, military movement in Europe – for example for major exercises – has become much less frequent. In today's security environment however, the European defence forces depend on the ability to move quickly, both in the EU and NATO context.
Several initiatives are already helping to improve military mobility in the EU context: transport infrastructure is a good example of existing opportunities to increase the coherence and synergies between defence issues and existing Union policies. Member States are furthermore taking forward a number of projects in the framework of the European Defence Agency (e.g. the Multimodal Transport Hub project).
The Joint Communication on improving military mobility is in line with the EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy as well as the principles that underpin the "defence package" proposed last year.

Thank Deadpool It's Friday!
Just in case you don't subscribe to Deadpool and Friends on Youtube I highly recommend that you check it out. The channel is a cartoon like Mugen cut-and-paste comedy featuring our favorite Merc-with-a-Mouth in various crazy situations and helped out by a slew of other Mugen Marvel characters. There are PSA's by Deadpool themselves as well as sketch type comedy featuring Wade himself.
Deadpool #33 came out and while the story was great the overall feel of the book is off as we see “Artist” John Lucas continuously vomit onto the panels and then make their inkers go back over it. It is a shame that this good story line is hard to swallow because you have to look at the art in this book. We can only hope that Lucas run is almost over.
Deadpool Guantlet #6 came out as well and this is some art that people should get behind! Reilly Brown and Scott Koblish are amazing in this book, and has made a lackluster story hide its flaws with flawless pencils and ink. Amazing!
The X-Force variant of the Kotobukiya Deadpool looks pretty solid and the color scheme on it looks pretty awesome. Nothing short of amazing when it comes to their statues.
Deadpool is featured in a .gif promo for upcoming Marvel event Axis. The interview with Rick Rememender makes it seem that Deadpool plays a very huge roll in the Axis Storyline. My theory on this is that it involves Cable (One of the many) and Apocalypse.

OLYMPIA — The fallout over Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo elephants, and more recently, its decision to shut some protesters and media out of a public meeting, continues.
This time, the battle came south, to the halls of the Legislature, where lawmakers Thursday heard testimony on a bill that would make the zoo subject to state open-records laws. HB 1425 would make nonprofit organizations that have been given government funding and tasked with performing a government job subject to state open-records and open-meetings laws.
The zoo sits on public land and will receive more than $7 million next year in Seattle city money.
“Nothing is more fundamental to trust in government and our democracy,” said Rep. Gerry Pollet, D-Seattle, the bill's sponsor. “And sadly, we have to bring this bill forward, because people sometimes forget that.”
Few in the audience seemed to forget. Supporters of the bill who testified ranged from the Washington Coalition for Open Government, Allied Daily Newspapers of Washington, public-records activist Arthur West and several citizens bedecked in orange “Elephants suffer at WPZ” T-shirts.
Jeff Leppo, vice chairperson of the Woodland Park Zoo Society board, which oversees the zoo, apologized for the society's December meeting, which shut out some protesters as well as media.
But, “With one exception, the board has successfully held public meetings and provided public comment at every meeting for nearly 15 years without incident,” Leppo told lawmakers.
Robert Davidson, chief executive officer of the Seattle Aquarium, which could be swept up in the new law if it passes, also testified against the bill. Other than the aquarium property, which is owned by the City of Seattle, and a small maintenance budget to keep it up, the facility receives no government funding, according to Davidson.
Dogs are loyal animals who love us no matter what. Because of this, they have feelings and thoughts too. We should remember this if we want to give them the best life possible. Here are 20 facts we should not forget..
Don't be upset mad with me if I jump for joy when you come home. I dont live as long as you. And the time I do have is spent with you. I miss you when you leave me.
Give me a chance to understand what it is you want I won't get it right all the time, but i'll always try my best.

Put your trust in me. In the same way that I trust you, I need you to trust me too.
Dont stay mad at me forever. And don't punish me for long. You have your friends and family to keep you company. You are my only company.

Dont leave me outside when the weather gets bad. The outside doesn't have a heater and its freezing. Im not asking to sleep in your bed or on the sofa, but the kitchen floor will be better than this.
Speak to me. We might not be able to talk back, but your voice makes us happy.
Look after me when I'm scared. You know what all those loud noises and people out there are, I don't. I need you to comfort me. I always feel safer when I am with you.
Remember i'll never forget the way you treat me. Make sure I know that humans are just as loving as we are.
Take me for walks. All the sights, all the sounds, they are the greatest pleasure for me. We don't have to walk for ages, you don't even have to play with me. I just want to enjoy the outside with you.
Let me make new buddies. I might not get on with everyone I meet in the end, but meeting new animals once in a while brightens up my life.
Treat me every so often. Food is one of my favourite things in life. I know you want to look after me and keep me healthy, but once in a while it would make my day if you gave me a treat or two.
Please don't hurt me. I could easily bite you, however I choose to bath you in sloppy kisses. Please don't hit me.
Understand that I need to be alone sometimes. Understand that I won't always want to play, even though its rare. And that I want to sleep sometimes where its cooler.
Show me the big wide world. Unless you take me anywhere different, I mostly ever see the house of the garden. Take me with you sometimes when you go places, I would love to go with you.
Teach me new tricks. Teach me new tricks to keep me active, and let me show off in front of your friends. It makes me happy when I see how proud you are.
Let me get messy and have fun sometimes. Let me get back to my wild roots every so often. Your world is indoors, but I thrive outside.
Touch me and give me hugs. I may not be able to understand what you are saying, but I can understand how good a hug feels.
Take notice when I don't seem myself. It might look like I'm being lazy or boring, but sometimes if I am not myself, I might need your help.
Love me always, even when I am older. I might not be the puppy I once was, but I still love you the same. Look after me when my body is no longer as young.
Be by my side on my final journey. It won't be easy, but I need you buy my side. I have spent my entire life by your side, and need you there as I leave this world.

Donald Trump's budget director launched an absurd and inaccurate attack on television icon Big Bird, while dishonestly defending a budget that would cut off access to PBS for many children across the country.
Donald Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney smeared beloved children's television icon Big Bird while defending a budget that would deny children access to PBS.
Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mulvaney discussed the proposed cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) by claiming, “Big Bird makes more money than everybody in this room.”
MULVANEY: It's a for-profit organization. And it does extraordinarily well. I don't know if Henson Associates is owned by Disney or if they have a licensing agreement. I can assure you Big Bird makes more money than everybody in this room. When I do go to that family in Grand Rapids and say, “Is this what you want your money to go to?” I think they might tell me no. Maybe they can afford to do it without us.
But the CPB's funds don't go to Big Bird or the rest of the Sesame Street cast. Sesame Workshop, the production company that produces Sesame Street — which, contrary to Mulvaney's claim, is a non-profit — is now funded via a production deal with HBO. The network gets the rights to do the first run of broadcasts for Sesame Street episodes, which are then aired 9 months later on local PBS stations.
It is those stations, and their viewers, particularly in rural areas, who would feel the effect of the proposed Trump cuts.
Paula Kerger, president of PBS, explained to the Washington Post that without federal funding, “A number of those stations would go off the air.” They added, ” It's an existential question for many of them.”
Republicans have often targeted the public funding of PBS and NPR as a way to signal that they are being tough on the “liberal” media. But it has repeatedly blown up in their faces.
Americans value public media, and consistently rate it among the most trusted sources of information. They don't buy in to conservative demagoguery of PBS, and they trust Sesame Street to play a role in helping to educate and entertain children.
Smearing Big Bird never works.
Even though Donald Trump spent the entirety of the 2016 election insisting (without offering evidence) that the election was going to be “rigged” against him, it turns out recounts are about to get underway in three states which mounting evidence suggests may have been rigged for him. And at the worst possible time for Trump in the perception department, one of their own campaign staffers has just been convicted of felony election fraud.
To be clear, Brandon Hall – who worked for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign in the key swing state of Michigan – was convicted today for felony election fraud they committed in 2012 on behalf of a different candidate. Hall falsified thousands of signatures in order to get a judicial candidate named Chris Houghtaling onto the ballot, which is a felony. It took four years for Hall to finally be tried and convicted, as reported today by local Michigan newspaper Grand Haven Tribune – during which time they went on to work for Trump's campaign.
There is no known evidence that Brandon Hall committed any illegal activities while working for the Donald Trump 2016 campaign in Michigan. However, their conviction for 2012 election fraud comes just days before a recount is set to begin in Michigan to determine whether the election results in the state were legitimate. Even as recount proponents try to make the legal case and the popular case for the recount, and Trump tries to belittle the recount effort, he's now left with Hall's conviction hanging around their neck like an albatross.
Meanwhile, numerous oddities and inconsistencies have surfaced in the 2016 Michigan presidential vote totals. For instance, once 100% of precincts had fully reported, Donald Trump had a lead of more than thirteen thousand votes. But since that time, their lead has mysteriously shrunk to just over ten thousand votes, as various precincts have since revised their totals without explanation. Michigan's official numbers also claim that 87,000 people showed up just to vote in downticket races while skipping the presidential vote, even though there were no Governor or Senate races in the state to attract that kind of downticket-only interest. And now one of Trump's staffers in the state was just convicted of felony election fraud. The recount is forthcoming.
A suicide attack has killed at least 15 people at a Shia funeral in Baquba, north of Baghdad, officials say.
Another 40 people were wounded in the blast in the city centre, according to police and hospital sources.
A wave of bombings aimed at Muslim Shia pilgrims and religious sites has killed more than 130 people in Iraq since the beginning of June.
On Saturday, two car bombs targeting Shia pilgrims killed at least 32 people in the capital Baghdad.
The suicide bomber in Baquba detonated their explosive belt in a tent where Shias had gathered to mourn a tribal chief early on Monday evening, a police source said.
About 150 people, including senior politicians and security officials, were present in the tent, Sadiq al-Hussaini, the head of Diyala province's ruling council, told the Associated Press news agency.
Mr Husseini blamed the attack on Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda.
"Absolutely this is the way of al-Qaeda - targeting innocent people to ignite sectarian unrest," they said.
The head of the Iraqi army's ground forces, Lt-Gen Ali Ghaidan, was among the mourners, but was unhurt, according to AP.
Powerful blast
"The bomber came in through a side entrance in one tent. When they blew themselves up, all I could see was dust and people being thrown back by the pressure of the blast," police officer Abbas Ali, who was among the mourners, told the Reuters news agency.
The force of the blast could be heard and felt 2km (1.2 miles) away, farmer Saif al-Tamimi told the agency.
The recent upsurge in violence has sparked fears of a return to the sectarian conflict that beset Iraq in the years after the 2003 US-led invasion.
It comes as Iraq's most prominent Sunni Arab politician, Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, is being tried in absentia on charges of funding death squads targeting Shia officials. They deny the accusations.
Iraq's Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, has faced calls for a confidence motion in parliament from parties within their national unity government, which have accused them of concentrating power in their hands.
Baquba, the capital of Diyala province, was major focus of Sunni insurgent activity during the civil war.
While the number of attacks has fallen since the height of the violence in 2005-7, the security situation deteriorated again after the withdrawal of US troops last December.
The Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group and al-Qaeda affiliate, has said it carried out many of the recent bombings.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has announced plans to rebuild Hadrian's Wall and will make England pay for it.
Shortly after Theresa May said they would block any plans for another independence referendum, Sturgeon said they would go right ahead and build a wall to keep out the meddling English.
“We never get the best of them coming across the border. No, it's just the Tories and the other canvassing politicians – there are some good ones, too, I assume,” they told reporters.
“That's why I'm going to build a wall, a great wall. It's going to be so great.
“And best of all, England is going to pay for it. Yes, they are. They might say they're not, but they will be. Yes they will.”
Sturgeon's speech has been welcomed by Scottish Nationalists who are keen to believe literally anything they're told as long as it contains an anti-English sentiment.
“She's telling it like it is, and I think she's great,” explained Glasgow resident Simon Williams.
“Sure, it might seem bonkers to most people, and the English might deny they'll contribute a penny to it – but why would they lie about it?”
Building contractors have said they will need cash up front to do any building work on the wall after taking a cursory look at predictions for the Scottish economy post independence.

Sparks police arrested a man following a six-hour standoff after they reportedly armed themselves with a handgun and barricaded themselves inside a home with four hostages early Tuesday morning.
The incident occurred at 4:59 a.m. on Tuesday at a home on 30 E. O Street in Sparks, police said.
No one was hurt and no shots were fired during the standoff, Det. Ken Gallop said.
The man, who was identified as Daniel Isaac Enriquez, was wanted by Reno police after they were accused of a robbery at a Scolari's Food & Drug Co. pharmacy in late April and a shooting at the Gold Dust West casino late last month, Sparks police said.
The Sparks and Washoe County Sheriff's SWAT teams were called to the scene after police learned that Enriquez had a handgun and had threatened to shoot officers, Gallop said.
The incident began as Reno police officers followed a suspect into Sparks, said Officer Tim Broadway of the Reno Police Department.
Reno police then handed off the situation to Sparks police.
Authorities had evacuated neighboring homes and then attempted to talk Enriquez down. After the four hostages were evacuated, SWAT team members gassed the home and Enriquez voluntarily turned themselves in, Gallop said.
One neighborhood resident said they and their family woke up to police knocking on their door and windows early Tuesday morning.
"We were sleeping, me and my wife and kids, and we saw a lot of lights," Luis Garcia said.
Garcia, who lives next to the house where police say Enriquez barricaded himself, was evacuated and waiting to return home. In the rush to get out, they said they had left their dog inside their home, Garcia said.
Information on the relation between the hostages and Enriquez was not immediately known Tuesday afternoon.
The incident had prompted authorities to block traffic in the area of 1st Street and Greenbrae Drive, and Probasco Way and Greenbrae.
Nearby Greenbrae Elementary School was unaffected by the incident, according to school district spokesperson Victoria Campbell. Students were still on winter break, although there were intersession classes at the school.
Enriquez's stepmother, Lorraine Vains, said they learned about the incident through their son's friend and immediately contacted police to ask to speak to him.
“My son and I are very close,” Vains said in a phone interview Tuesday. “He calls me every Sunday.”
Vains described their son as calm and level headed.
“I know that if they told them their (step) mother was calling him, they would call me back,” they said. “I want to make sure my son comes out safely.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller has expanded their investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to include an examination of President Donald Trump's business dealings, Bloomberg reported Thursday.
"FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump's involvement in a controversial SoHo development with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump's sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008," Bloomberg said, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday that Mueller would cross a line if they began digging into their finances. But in early June, Mueller began hiring lawyers with extensive experience in dealing with fraud, racketeering, and other financial crimes to help them investigate whether Trump or their associates worked with Russia to undermine Hillary Clinton during the election.
The follow-the-money approach began with a money-laundering case initiated last year by Preet Bharara, at the time a US attorney, according to Bloomberg.
Mueller — who was appointed in May to lead the FBI's probe after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey — is also homing in on money laundering and the business dealings of Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and their former campaign chairperson, Paul Manafort, Bloomberg said.
Bayrock and Trump SoHo
One of Trump's real-estate advisers in the early 2000s, the Russia-born business person Felix Sater, was accused nearly two decades ago of being a co-conspirator in a $40 million fraud and money-laundering scheme involving four Mafia families. Trump worked with the real-estate firm where Sater was an executive, Bayrock Group, on at least four projects, including the Trump SoHo in Manhattan. Some of those projects ultimately failed.
A lawsuit brought in 2010 against Sater and others, which is ongoing, alleges that "for most of its existence [Bayrock] was substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated," engaging "in a pattern of continuous, related crimes, including mail, wire, and bank fraud; tax evasion; money laundering; conspiracy; bribery; extortion; and embezzlement."
The lawsuit, filed by Bayrock's former finance director, Jody Kriss, accused Sater and Bayrock's founder, Tevfik Arif, of cheating them out of millions of dollars via fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, among other misconduct. In December, a New York judge ruled that the lawsuit could move forward as a racketeering case.
Trump SoHo. trumpsohohotel.com
According to that complaint, Sater and Arif began negotiating with the Trump Organization in 2003 to market certain projects under the Trump brand but didn't tell Trump about Sater's criminal past.
In a 2007 deposition, Trump said their organization would never have agreed to partner with Bayrock on the development of Trump SoHo had they known about Sater's past. Trump also said they would not be able to identify Sater if they were in the same room.
Bayrock's office was once two floors below Trump's in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. A person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by Sater or their associates, told Business Insider that Sater and Trump had standing meetings each week.
Sater has said in a deposition that they met with Trump "on a constant basis," Bloomberg previously reported, and Kriss told the publication that Trump valued Sater's loyalty — and their Russia connections.
"It's ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia," Trump said in the 2007 deposition. "Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment."
Sater was evidently still in touch with Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as recently as late January. The two met at a New York hotel on January 27 to discuss a peace plan for Russia and Ukraine that was drafted by a Ukrainian politician, Andrey Artemenko, The Times reported. Cohen was said to have delivered the plan directly to Michael Flynn before they resigned as national security adviser on February 13, though Cohen has disputed that in subsequent interviews.
Sater showed Ivanka Trump and their brother Donald Trump Jr. around Moscow in 2006 when their father was scouting real estate in Russia. They stayed for several days at the Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin, according to The Times.
Sater also acted as a fixer to help the former Kazakh cabinet minister Viktor Khrapunov buy three apartments in Trump SoHo using shell companies, the Financial Times reported. The Kazakh government has alleged that Khrapunov stole those funds from the state.
Khrapunov's use of shell companies to buy Trump real estate was not unique — a USA Today investigation found that approximately 70% of buyers of Trump properties since June 2016 were limited-liability companies, compared with about 4% of buyers in the two years before.
Miss Universe in Moscow
Mueller is apparently interested in learning more about Trump's relationship with Aras Agalarov, a billionaire Azerbaijani-Russian developer who paid Trump $20 million to bring their Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.
Agalarov came under renewed scrutiny earlier this month when The Times reported that their son, Emin Agalarov, had requested a meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer last June at Trump Tower. An email chain released later by Trump Jr. showed that Emin's publicist, Rob Goldstone, had arranged the meeting on their behalf.
While in Moscow in 2013, Trump had dinner with Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia's largest bank and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also met at least 10 other Russian business people and oligarchs.
"The Russian market is attracted to me," Trump said shortly after the meeting. "Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room."
They also tweeted: "TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next."

Sergey Gorkov was appointed CEO of Vnesheconombank — a bank under US sanctions — in January 2016 after Gref recommended him. Gorkov met with Kushner in December at Trump Tower for reasons that are still unknown.
Reuters reported in May that the FBI was examining whether Kushner entertained an offer from Gorkov to finance the Trump family's business ventures in exchange for the administration relaxing or lifting economic sanctions on Russia.
Deutsche Bank and Dmitry Rybolovlev
As Trump praised and defended Putin along the campaign trail, many questioned whether the real-estate mogul had any financial incentives — including business ties or outstanding debt — to seek better relations with Moscow.
The Washington Post has reported that "Trump and their family members have made numerous trips to Moscow in search of business opportunities" since the 1980s, "and they have relied on Russian investors to buy their properties around the world." The Trump Organization is also believed to have received loans from Russia when it was struggling in the 1990s, the report said.
The family's bank of choice has long been Deutsche Bank, the only bank willing to loan to Trump after they lost others money in a series of bankruptcies — something they figured "was the bank's problem, not mine," they wrote in their 2007 book, "Think Big: Make it Happen in Business and Life."
"What the hell did I care?" Trump wrote. "I actually told one bank, 'I told you you shouldn't have loaned me that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good.'"
Deutsche Bank was fined earlier this year as part of a Russian money-laundering scheme that involved its Moscow, New York, and London branches. The bank refused in June to hand over documents requested by five Democratic lawmakers related to the bank's relationship with Trump, citing the confidentiality of nonpublic customer information. But the FBI is likely to get ahold of them.
Questions have also been raised about Trump's relationship with Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian multibillionaire who was an early investor in one of the world's most lucrative fertilizer companies.
Rybolovlev bought a Palm Beach property from Trump for $95 million in 2008, two years after Trump put it on the market for $125 million. (Trump purchased it in 2004 for $41 million.) It was believed at the time to be the most expensive home sale in US history.
According to PolitiFact, in 2008, Trump Entertainment Resorts missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize.
Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort
The FBI is also examining whether Russian officials suggested to Kushner that Russian banks could finance Trump's associates' business ventures if US sanctions were lifted or relaxed, Reuters reported in May.
The possibility first came under scrutiny after Kushner met with Gorkov in December. That meeting came on the heels of Kushner's meeting with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, at Trump Tower, in which they reportedly floated the possibility of setting up a secure line of communication between Trump's transition team and Russia.
Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the US to communicate, which would essentially conceal the Trump team's interactions with Russian officials from US government scrutiny, The Post reported in May.
The meeting with Gorkov came as Kushner was trying to find investors for a Fifth Avenue office building in Manhattan. That deal ultimately fell through, but the Kremlin and the White House have provided conflicting explanations for why Kushner met privately with Gorkov in the first place.
Meanwhile, Manafort has faced questions about whether they received cash payments reportedly earmarked for them for their work with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's political party throughout the 2000s. The Times reported on Wednesday that Manafort was in debt to pro-Russian interests as recently as last year.
Manafort has also come under scrutiny for more than a dozen bank accounts and companies they set up in Cyprus beginning in 2007 that were linked to offshore companies, NBC reported, one of which was used to receive millions of dollars from the Russian oligarch and Putin ally Oleg Deripaska.
Americans roughly equate the danger of trying LSD once or twice with consuming four to five alcoholic beverages a day, a testament to our country's drug warriors.
Across all age groups, 69.5 percent of respondents "perceive great risk" in trying LSD once or twice, while 68.3 percent of respondents feel similarly about "having four or five drinks nearly every day," according to new survey data released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Among respondents over the age of 26: 74 percent saw harm in trying LSD once or twice, while 69 percent saw harm in consuming nearly half a dozen drinks a day.
Alas, a majority of American adults are wrong (our youths much less so). Although included in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, LSD is a relatively safe, non-habit forming drug, while alcohol is a hepatotoxic sedative that kills roughly 80,000 Americans every year (37,000 of those from liver disease, 9,967 in alcohol-related driving accidents).
In the interest of opening the Overton Window of discourse ever so slightly, let's go through some studies.
In 2010, the British psychopharmacologist David Nutt measured the relative harms of various legal and illegal drugs with a system designed in coordination with other members of Britain's Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs. The committee used 16 criteria to determine a drug's potential harm to the user and to society. The criteria range from easily measurable (drug-specific and drug-related mortality; risk of physical and/or psychological dependence); to nebulous (international damage and community impact). Nutt's team then weighted those factors, combined them into an overall harm score, and, in a paper published in The Lancet, laid the scores out in a very nice chart:
As you can see from the x-axis labels, alcohol is the most harmful drug, followed by heroin. LSD is the third least harmful after buprenorphine (which is common in medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder) and psilocybin mushrooms.
The relative safety of LSD has been demonstrated in clinical settings as well. A double-blind randomized control trial to measure the safety of LSD as an adjunct to psychotherapy in 2014 found that "[n]either the experimental dose (200 micrograms of LSD) nor the active placebo (20 micrograms of LSD) produced any drug-related severe adverse events, that is, no panic reaction, no suicidal crisis or psychotic state, and no medical or psychiatric emergencies requiring hospitalization." Two hundred micrograms is twice the dose of the average black market acid tab, while 20 micograms is the amount commonly used by micro-dosing enthusiasts.
What about "acid flashbacks," a concept coined in the 1950s to describe visual distortions that persist or return after psychedelic drugs have cleared the body? A literature review published earlier this year found them to be quite rare:
The 2015 Krebs and Johansen study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found "no significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and increased likelihood of past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety."
A 2015 report from SAMSHA on suicide and drug use found that 15 percent of hallucinogen users reported suicidal thoughts; of that group, four percent planned a suicide and two and a half percent made an attempt. While those numbers seem high, SAMSHA and the National Institute of Drug Abuse categorize PCP as a hallucinogen, despite the fact that it is a dissociative anaesthetic and has a very different user demographic than more traditional hallucinogens like LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. I don't know if the agency's suicide dataset includes reported PCP users, but if it does, their inclusion likely skews the results, as suicidal ideation is a common side effect of long-term PCP use.
The Drug Abuse Warning Network, a project of SAMSHA that tracked drug-related emergency department admissions until its discontinuation in 2011, found a paltry number of LSD admissions in its final year of data collection. DAWN hospitals reported a total of 1.25 million E.D. admissions related to illicit drug use in 2011. Of that number, cocaine was cited in either the chief complaint, the assessment, or the diagnosis in more than 500,000 patient cases, while LSD was cited in only 4,819 cases. An undated DEA fact sheet suggests that LSD E.D. admissions are relatively rare due to the "fewer adverse reactions generated by the low-potency LSD that has been produced since the late 1970's."
As for the positive aspects of LSD: A 2016 analysis of two double-blinded studies conducted in Switzerland found that "LSD positively altered the processing of emotional information by decreasing the recognition of fearful and sad faces and enhancing emotional empathy and prosociality." (Prosociality is a good thing.) Other small trials, some dating back to the 1950s, suggest LSD is a promising treatment for both alcoholism and end-of-life anxiety in terminally ill patients.
And in case you need any more convincing, actor Cary Grant believed LSD saved their lives when they tried it in their 50s. "When I broke through, I felt an immeasurably beneficial cleansing of so many needless fears and guilts. I lost all the tension that I'd been crippling myself with. First I thought of all those wasted years. Second, I said, 'Oh my God, the humanity. Please come in.'"
Damn this is getting good.
Climate Science Watch:
Briefly, on how this case got started, from a post at Climate Progress:
The kick-off for the lawsuit was actually a piece written by Rand Simberg at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), which referred to Mann as “the Jerry Sandusky of climate science” because they “molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science.” The editors eventually removed the offending sentences, but not before Mark Steyn picked them up at National Review's online blog. Steyn said they aren't sure he'd have “extended that metaphor all the way into the locker-room showers with quite the zeal Mr Simberg does, but they have a point.” They then went on to call Mann's work on the famous “hockey stick” graph “fraudulent.” So Mann sued Simberg, Steyn, CEI and National Review for defamation.

Accusing a scientist of conducting their research fraudulently is a factual allegation that can be proven true or false, not mere hyperbolic opinionating. If it is false it is defamatory, and if it is made with actual malice it is actionable. So said DC Superior Court Frederick Weisberg in tossing out motions by defendants National Review et al. to dismiss Prof. Michael Mann's defamation complaint — thus moving the case a step toward discovery proceedings and a jury trial.
The matter before the court in this latest step of the thus-far procedurally rather tangled case was on the separate special motions of defendants Mark Steyn and National Review, Inc. and of defendants Competitive Enterprise Institute and Rand Simberg to dismiss Michael Mann's amended defamation complaint. On January 22 DC Superior Court Judge Weisberg denied defendants' motions to dismiss under the DC Anti-SLAPP Act and on one other ground.
The judge's ruling, and specifically what they say in their order, looks good for Prof. Mann's position. Here's a bit of what Judge Weisberg said:
Opinions and rhetorical hyperbole are protected speech under the First Amendment. Arguably, several of defendants' statements fall into these protected categories. Some of the defendants' statements, however, contain what could reasonably be understood as assertions of fact. Accusing a scientist of conducting their research fraudulently, manipulating their data to achieve a predetermined or political outcome, or purposefully distorting the scientific truth are factual allegations. They go to the heart of scientific integrity. They can be proven true or false. If false, they are defamatory. If made with actual malice, they are actionable. Viewing the allegations of the amended complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable finder of fact is likely to find in favor of the plaintiff on each of Counts I-VI, including the Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress alleged in Count VI as to both sets of defendants.
So much for the argument that what Simberg and Steyn were doing was mere opinionating, mere rhetorical flourishes. Judge Weisberg appears to slam dunk that position. It's against the law to accuse someone, with malice, of scientific fraud, if the accusation won't stand up in court (and not just to the satisfaction of the defendants and their support subculture).
Weisberg continued –
In Count VII, plaintiff alleges that CEI published, and National Review republished, the following defamatory statement: “Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, they have molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science that could have dire economic consequences for the nation and planet.” The allegedly defamatory aspect of this sentence is the statement that plaintiff “molested and tortured data,” not the rhetorically hyperbolic comparison to convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky. …
The statement “he has molested and tortured data” could easily be interpreted to mean that the plaintiff distorted, manipulated, or misrepresented their data. Certainly the statement is capable of a defamatory meaning, which means the questions of whether it was false and made with “actual malice” are questions of fact for the jury. … [T]o state as a fact that a scientist dishonestly molests or tortures data to serve a political agenda would have a strong likelihood of damaging their reputation within their profession, which is the very essence of defamation….
Well that's interesting. Commenters on the case have focused on the rhetoric of the Jerry Sandusky analogy, while perhaps not keeping their eye on the “molested and tortured data” part. The defendants and their support subculture have been throwing around this sort of casually malicious and intellectually sloppy defamation of climate scientists so much, for so long, that perhaps they're surprised to learn they can be busted for it.
Weisberg:
Viewing the alleged facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as the court must on a motion to dismiss, a reasonable jury is likely to find the statement that Dr. Mann “molested and tortured data” was false, was published with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not, and is actionable as a matter of law irrespective of special harm. …
Turning to the special motion of defendants National Review and Steyn to dismiss Count VII, when Mr. Steyn republished Mr. Simberg's words, they stopped short of wholeheartedly endorsing the offensive Sandusky metaphor. Nevertheless, Mr. Steyn did not disavow the assertion of fact that Dr. Mann had “molested and tortured data,” and they added insult to injury by describing Dr. Mann as “the man behind the fraudulent climate-change ‘hockey-stick' graph.” … In context, calling Dr. Mann's work “fraudulent” is itself defamatory…
Supporters of the defendants made a point of accusing the previous judge in the case of incompetence and other bad things. It will be interesting to see if they continue to play that card by slamming Judge Weisberg as well. They seemed to think the previous judge's rulings would be trashed and re-done, but as it turns out they got essentially the same thing from Judge Weisberg in this new ruling.
We hope this ends the roadblocks to moving on to the discovery phase. The defendants may appeal Judge Weisberg's ruling, but the opportunities for delay seem to be running out. We have the impression that National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute aren't particularly eager to be opened up to discovery. On the other hand, Prof. Mann apparently isn't too worried about it as they push their case forward — contrary to what their attackers always seem to assume.
Image copyright PA Image caption The three sisters were attacked at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch on 6 April
A woman who was attacked with a claw hammer at a central London hotel "lost part of their brain", a court has heard.
The victim Ohoud Al-Najjar and their two sisters were set upon at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch on 6 April, while their children slept alongside them.
Ohoud's sister Fatima Al-Najjar told the court they were woken by their sister's screams before they were attacked.
Philip Spence admitted three counts of grievous bodily harm at Southwark Crown Court. They deny attempted murder.
Mr Spence, 32, from Harlesden, also denies a charge of aggravated burglary.
'Split skull'
Ohoud Al-Najjar, Khulood Al-Najjar and Fatima Al-Najjar, from the United Arab Emirates, were on a family holiday when they were subjected to a "sustained and vicious" assault, prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said.
Mr Mayo said Mr Spence bludgeoned Ohoud with such force, their skull was split open.
The court heard their nine-year-old nephew hid under the sheets next to them during the attack.
"The women suffered terrible injuries; one even lost part of their brain," the prosecutor said.
"Her skull was smashed so badly that brain tissue protruded from a hole in their head."
The court heard after the attack, Ohoud underwent emergency neurosurgery to reconstruct their skull and their left eyeball had to be removed. They can no longer speak and is not expected to make a full recovery.
Repeatedly struck
The sisters were sharing adjoining rooms at the four-star hotel.
The court heard the rooms had been left unlocked to allow a fourth sister to return later in the night, but Mr Spence was seen by Khulood rifling through handbags at about 01:30 BST.
They attacked Khulood in the bed they were sharing with their 11-year-old daughter and their sister Fatima. Khulood's seven-year-old daughter was also asleep on the floor, the jury heard.
"It is almost impossible to imagine the terror that must have seized these poor women as they were confronted in the darkness of their room by Philip Spence wielding that claw hammer," Mr Mayo said.
"Worse still when they began to rain blows down on their heads."
Speaking through an interpreter, Fatima, 31, who suffered damage to their skull, ear and facial nerves, told the court they tried to stop the attack on Khulood but was struck repeatedly. The jury heard both sisters were left unconscious.
"He was hitting them really hard. They brought their hand above their head and down," they said.
"He just started attacking me. They attacked this side (left side) but I was always moving, they were hitting me everywhere, I didn't know what was happening."
Khulood, who also gave evidence, told the court they believed they had been hit more than 30 times.
Prosecutor Mr Mayo said an expert forensic pathologist found the three women had suffered life-threatening injuries and it was due to the skill of surgeons treating them that they survived.
Mr Spence fled the room with a suitcase filled with valuables and the women were not discovered until the fourth sister Sheika Al-Mheiri returned, the court was told.
The hammer was later found on a window sill on a stairwell in the hotel.
Mr Spence is alleged to have planned the attack in the early hours of 6 April with Thomas Efremi, 57, from Islington, north London. Mr Efremi denies conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary.
The case continues.
SAN ANTONIO -- Spurs forward Tim Duncan sprained their left ankle Monday night against Golden State after coming down awkwardly on the foot.
X-rays were negative. Duncan did not return to San Antonio's 111-96 victory over the Warriors.
The 34-year-old All-Star fell and immediately reached for their left foot after landing on the foot of Ekpe Udoh following a short jumper early in the first quarter. Duncan lay on their side, clutching their foot with both hands, for more than a minute before being helped into the locker room.
Following the game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said Duncan would be out "a while" but didn't have a timetable.
Duncan has stayed healthy all season for the NBA-best Spurs, avoiding injuries unlike recent years.
Duncan has started all but one game. That was Saturday against Charlotte -- when Spurs coach Gregg Popovich didn't want to risk Duncan getting hurt on the second night of a back-to-back.
Popovich's biggest fear happened two nights later instead.
The AT&T Center fell quiet when Duncan crashed to the court and reached for their foot. Tony Parker was one of the first players over to check on him; Parker then turned and winced at Popovich, who was standing in front of the Spurs bench with their hands in their pockets and watching their two-time MVP writhe on the ground.
Before Saturday, Duncan had been the only Spurs player to start the team's first 68 games. Duncan had played 32 minutes the night before in Dallas.
"I saw them in pain. He's not one of those guys that's going to
pretend or do that if they are not hurting," Spurs guard Manu Ginobili said. "It's
bad, but hopefully it's just a couple of games and he'll be back
soon."
Even though their role has greatly diminished and their averages are at career lows, Duncan remains a big reason why the Spurs (57-13) are on pace to surpass their franchise record of 63 wins set in 2005-06.

If you have been here before, you will probably notice the design has been changed. After 8 years almost to the day (and 103 million visits), it was time for a bit more modern look. In addition to the new user interface, a number of the underlying pages have changed as well. Even if you are a long-time visitor, it is suggested that you click on each of the items on the new menu, which is now to the left of the map. Items 3, 4, and 5 are especially interesting.
The Senate races now have their own home page, reachable by clicking on "Senate" on the blue bar. This page also has a menu with various goodies. Check them out. From any page on the site, you can get back to the main page by clicking on "electoral-vote.com" in the red bar on top of the page.
Another change is that the old site was optimized for windows of 1024px, whereas the new one is optimized for 1152px. From the statistics, I know that > 90% of the visitors have at least 1152px, often much more. Adding this new real estate made it possible to put the menu on the left and reduce the depth of the top part of the page. Some sites are even more aggressive about size. For example, the NY Times requires 1188px to prevent a horizontal scroll bar and Salon.com requires a whopping 1400px to view the main page, so 1152px seemed like a small step. For people with 1024 x 768 monitors, you can do one of these things:

Texas is primary today. It was delayed because under federal law, certain Southern states, including Texas, have to get permission from the Dept. of Justice before their redistricting maps are official. If recent history is any guide, Mitt Romney will get about 60-65% of the primary vote, even though they have no opponents.
One Texas race everyone is watching is the primary to nominate the GOP candidate to run for the seat of retiring senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. The establishment choice is Lt. Gov. David Dewhurt but there is a tea party candidate in the race as well, Ted Cruz. Finally, the former mayor of Dallas, Tom Leppert, is also running. Leppert is unlikely to win but they might draw enough votes to keep the other candidates below 50% and thus force a runoff. The Republican establishment is not looking forward to a one-on-one race between Dewhurst and Cruz, given what happened in Indiana 3 weeks ago, where a tea party candidate beat a six-term senator and turned a boring relection of a solid conservative Republican senator into a real horse race.
The city Montreal, Canada, formally launched its 2015-2025 Baseball Action Plan (“Politique du Baseball – Plan d'action 2015-2025”), a long-term, C$26 million dollar baseball development project and vision.
The 10-year blockbuster policy aimed at “encouraging and promoting the practice of baseball” in Montreal was announced by Mayor Denis Coderre, wearing a Baseball Canada hat, at a press conference at Olympic Stadium in early April.
The city of 8.2 million aims to have two international-standard venues that would allow Montreal to attract international events like the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup™. The next U-18 Baseball World Cup will be held in Thunder Bay, Canada, in 2017.
Focused on increasing participation numbers and “passion” in the sport of baseball, approximately 20 concrete action-items will be rolled out by the city of Montreal, including:
$15 million to establish and support regional baseball hubs
$11 million to renovate existing ballparks within the next three years
Baseball Québec and Softball Québec, provincial associations of Baseball Canada and Softball Canada, collaborated on the 10-year roadmap.
Also among the announcements, Baseball Canada, the national governing body, launched “Summer's Perfect Game” to promote baseball as the summer sport of choice for Canadians.
“Our registration numbers have experienced a steady climb recently including an 8% increase in 2015. With the success of our National Teams, a strong grassroots presence that includes programs for all, combined with the impact that the Toronto Blue Jays have in our country, baseball is alive and well in Canada,” Baseball Canada President Ray Carter said in a statement.

Joop Donkervoort is a man cut from the same cloth as Colin Chapman, if that cloth is lightweight, devoid of everyday practicality and ruddy quick.
In fact, Mr Donkervoort actively cites Chapman as inspiration, something you should bear in mind while reading the following. Internet, meet the new Donkervoort GTO.
It comes after two and a half years of development in conjunction with Audi, and is an open-topped, two seat roadsters. That Audi hookup means the GTO - yes, a rather presumptive name - gets the same 2.5-litre turbocharged five-pot as the RS3 and TT RS, producing 340bhp and 331 torques from just 1,600rpm.
See more pics of the Donkervoort GTO
Donkervoort has added its own magic to this motor though, lifting an estimated 30kg of weight thanks to a redesigned inlet manifold “that follows a more favourable route through the motor area”. Mr Joop hasn't released performance figures, but couple this power to the GTO's weight of around 700kgs and you can estimate what kind of acceleration the car is capable of. Hint: lots.
But there's more. Donkervoort tells us there's a special race module switch on the dashboard that instantly ups the power of that five-pot to 400bhp. Now, Donkervoorts of old - the D8 270RS and GT - were famously shorn of nannying eccentricities such as ‘power steering' and ‘ABS' and such. This new GTO though, is the first car from the company's Lelystad base to come with traction control. “Only when it is raining, of course”, Donkervoort quickly adds, lest you get your straighteners ready. Still no power steering. Or ABS.
The body consists of a steel tubular frame, carbon composite panels and a one-piece door said to withstand a sideways blow of up to 1,500kgs, using techniques derived from aviation, while the aluminium bonnet gets a locking system used by the American rocket industry. Yes, inspiration from the rocket industry.
Production kicks off in 2012 on an intial run of 25 cars, with the first deliveries expected over summer. Price? You're looking at between £85,000 to £125,000, excluding taxes.
So - want one?
Tucson native Linda Ronstadt was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama on Monday. The White House cited the singer's "one-of-a-kind voice and their decades of remarkable music."
"Drawing from a broad range of influences, Ms. Ronstadt defied expectations to conquer American radio waves and help pave the way for generations of women artists," said a military aide during a White House ceremony.
Speaking afterward, Obama said they whispered to Ronstadt during the medal ceremony that he'd once had a crush on them
"I told Linda Ronstadt I had a crush on them back in the day," they said.
Ronstadt was one of a dozen honored with an arts medal. Ten others were awarded National Humanities Medals.
Among those recognized were choreographer Bill T. Jones, filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, documentarian Albert Maysles, and journalist Diane Rehm — who interviewed Ronstadt on their radio show Tuesday morning (sidebar).
"I felt like a fraud," Ronstadt told the veteran reporter. "I felt surely they'd made a mistake and they would be telling me any minute that, you know, I needed to go home. I was on the wrong list."
"I didn't know anybody else in the world felt that way," Rehm responded.
Obama, while likely over their youthful infatuation, didn't agree with the singer's self-assessment.
"The late, great Maya Angelou once said, 'A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song,'" Obama said during Monday's ceremony. "Each of the men and women that we honor today has a song -– literally, in some cases. For others, it's a talent, or a drive, or a passion that they just had to share with the world."
"We can never take for granted the flash of insight that comes from watching a great documentary or reading a great memoir or novel, or seeing an extraordinary piece of architecture. We can't forget the wonder we feel when we stand before an incredible work of art, or the world of memories we find unlocked with a simple movement or a single note," Obama said.
"The moments you help create -– moments of understanding or awe or joy or sorrow -– they add texture to our lives," the president said. "hey are not incidental to the American experience; they are central to it -- they are essential to it. So we not only congratulate you this afternoon, we thank you for an extraordinary lifetime of achievement."
Ronstadt was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, just months after they told the world that their renowned singing voice had been silenced by Parkinson's disease.
Although in Tucson, she's now known more for their work covering traditional mariachi songs and appearances as a political activist, four decades ago Ronstadt was known as the "Rock's Venus."
Well before 1987's "Canciones de mi Padre," they launched their career in the late '60s with the Stone Poneys and went on to receive 11 Grammys, an Emmy, two Academies of Country Music awards, and be nominated for the Tonys and Golden Globes.
Heralded for their perfect pitch and a voice so powerful it challenged even the most sturdy microphones, Ronstadt recorded hits such as "You're No Good," "When Will I Be Loved," "Heat Wave," "Blue Bayou" and of course a cover of the Eagles' "Desperado" before turning their attentions to genres as varied as Broadway (appearing to acclaim in "The Pirates of Penzance"), a duet with Mick Jagger ("Tumbling Dice"), a failed opera (a short-lived production of "La Boheme") and a series of pop/jazz albums with arranger Nelson Riddle.
Them last album, recorded as the ZoZo Sisters, was 2006's Cajun-flavored "Adieu False Heart."
In recent years, Ronstadt returned to Tucson after living in San Francisco, but not long after moved back to the Bay Area, citing the noise of aircraft from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base flying over their Midtown home.
Last August, Ronstadt, now 68, announced that they were no longer able to sing, citing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. They told AARP that they now use poles to help them walk on uneven ground, and uses a wheelchair when traveling. They had stopped performing publicly in 2011.

A PATERNITY suit filed by a man contesting child support payments for a set of twins took an unexpected turn after the results of a court-ordered DNA test came in.
They revealed that the man, identified only by their initials, AS, for legal reasons, was “almost certainly” the father of one of the twins — but not the other.
New Jersey Superior Court Judge Sohail Mohammad ruled that the babies had been fathered by two different men in a case they described as rare but not without precedence.
The mother, known as TM, gave birth to twin girls in January 2013 and named AS as the father when they applied for public assistance.
A legal battle began after AS disputed the claim on the grounds that their sexual relationship had not been exclusive. After TM admitted they slept with another man in the same week they had sex with AS, social services ordered a DNA test.
When the results arrived in November, they shocked both parties. In a ruling handed down earlier this week, Judge Mohammad said it was possible for a woman to have two of their eggs fertilised by two different men if they had sex with both during the same menstrual cycle.

MORE: EX-HUSBAND WINS BACK CHILD SUPPORT
They cited two other cases, both in the US, that had gone through the courts.
DNA expert Dr Karl-Hanz Wurzinger testified that according to their own research, the incidence of twins with different fathers occurred in about one in every 13,000 paternity cases involving twins.
Judge Mohammad ordered A.S, who represented themselves in court, to pay $28 (AUD34) a week in child support payments to their half of the twins.
Before iTunes meta tags and Spotify algorithms reduced "indie rock" to a catch-all term for "music with guitars", the genre was a cultural force to be reckoned with. Forming the template for the guitar-bass-drums bands we still cling to today, its emergence in the late 80s took pop music and rock 'n' roll and forced the two to settle their differences in a flurry of emotion and headphone-filling guitarwork.
Two prominent bands of the genre, Death Cab For Cutie and Teenage Fanclub, were born a decade apart: Teenage Fanclub were the Scottish darlings of the early 90s' jangly indie boom, while Death Cab rode the slipstream of the 00s' first indie "revival" to arenas and iconic guest spots on The OC. Look, if you didn't at some point shout-sing along to either at an 00s indie night IDK what you were up to. Despite their difference in age however, both frontmen share a similarly rich tone of songwriting, making it little surprise to hear Death Cab's Ben Gibbard was heavily influenced by Norman Blake's Teenage Fanclub.
Earlier this year Gibbard released their self-produced take on Teenage Fanclub' Bandwagonesque, their favourite album by their favourite band. So, as Death Cab enter the studio to record their ninth (!) full-length and Teenage Fanclub ride their 11th into the sunset, there has surely never been a better time to bring these two musicians together for one giant DIY conversation about their indie rock past, present and future. Read on below.
***
THE BANDWAGON DEPARTS
Ben Gibbard: I was a kid, 13 or 14, living in this little town across the water from Seattle called Bremerton. Everybody listened to Southern Cal punk-rock, like Bad Religion and Circle Jerks. That stuff's fine, but it wasn't my music – I wasn't a punk rock kid, I wasn't an angsty kid; my dad brought me up on The Beatles and the Stones. Hearing Bandwagonesque, it not only scratched that itch of like, 'This is familiar to me: melodically familiar, structurally familiar, the harmonies feel familiar', but at the same time, it has this energy to it. The production is kinda gritty and dirty, but within that production are some really beautiful love songs; really dense lyrical material. I fell in love with it. I don't know if I've ever told you this, Norman, but I had a photo of you and Raymond [McGinley, Teenage Fanclub guitarist] from a guitar magazine in my locker in high school! Everyone would open up their lockers and there'd be picture of women, and punk bands, and metal bands, and I had a photo of Norman and Raymond in my locker. I was learning to play guitar when I was 12, 13, and [in those magazines] it was all Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, the guy from Extreme, all that shit! It was funny, after 1991, they had to begrudgingly acknowledge bands that didn't play ripping guitar solos.
Norman Blake: That signalled the sea change, didn't it? When you could tell that that era was over. All of a sudden J Mascis was in there, and Sonic Youth. Sonic Youth were very interested in terms of what they were doing with guitars, and different tunings, and stuff like that. It wasn't about how fast they could pull off their licks, it was just about the detail, and the intricate nature of the interplay between two guitars in different tunings.
Ben Gibbard: Even at a young age, I remember the metal guys at the music store were really furious that a Dinosaur Jr. song was being transcribed in Guitar Player! I've often thought of that sea change as like, people were just eating dessert for every meal. At a certain point, they realised that they were full, but not nourished. And that was musically what was happening – then in '91 all this nutrient rich music comes to the forefront.
FROM SEATTLE TO SCOTLAND, AND BACK AGAIN
Ben Gibbard: What always struck me about playing in the UK was that it always seemed like an 'every band for themselves' mentality, certainly in London. There never seemed to be a sense of community; it always seemed very careerist. My impression of Glasgow was always that it feels like a community of musicians that is most similar to the American indie-rock aesthetic: a lot of bands that are all friends, we grew up together, we play on each other's records, we tour together, we stay on each other's floors. My experiences as a touring musician, going to Glasgow, were like that. Immediately, the sense of humour, the motivation for playing music seemed very similar. Like, 'I'm doing this because I love it – if I get successful, that's great; if not, I'm not gonna stop doing it.' As I delved deeper into the Glaswegian scene, I just fell in love with everything I heard.
Norman Blake: There are actually connections, too. Stephen Pastel [owner of Glasgow's Monorail Records] owned a label called 53rd & 3rd Records in the mid-80s, and they signed The Vaselines, and put out an album for Beat Happening. Kurt Cobain heard The Vaselines through Calvin [Johnson, Beat Happening], and I was there the day they met! Nirvana were touring Bleach, and they had asked The Vaselines to reform to play with them in Edinburgh. I went from Glasgow to Edinburgh with them – we got drunk in the back of the bus on cheap wine – and we get to the venue and walk in, we meet Krist [Noveselic, bassist], and we go up to the dressing room and Kurt was wearing really heavy eyeliner. It was amazing – Kurt turned around and went, 'Woah, Eugene Kelly, I can't believe I'm meeting Eugene Kelly! I'm such a big fan!' They were a total fanboy. Those connections were quite strong – they were very similar scenes, no doubt about it.
Ben Gibbard: I had the same reaction when I met Eugene as well – and you, Norman, back in the day!
A MEETING OF MINDS
Ben Gibbard: We had emailed a bit, before that, but I remember we met face-to-face in 2005 in Japan. I remember this moment – which, for me, is still very special – where you and I were standing watching The La's. I remember they were playing "There They Go" and you're turning to me and saying, 'Oh, a classic pop song – it's weird that it's about heroin.' It blew my mind! I'd never thought of it that way before. The singer of my favourite band was schooling me on a song that is one of my favourite songs of all time, which I'd never really had a deeper understanding of. So thank you for that!
Norman Blake: A pleasure! Oasis were playing that too, right?
Ben Gibbard: Yeah, they were playing the enormodome across the way – that must have been one of the last Oasis shows, actually... Me being a real fan of Norman's work, it's been a real treat to get to know them more.
REBUILDING 'BANDWAGONESQUE'
Norman Blake: For me, what I find interesting about this kind of projects is that when you go and look at someone else's music and then you reinterpret it, it gives you an insight into other people's process. I always find that interesting. I've been listening to Ben's Bandwagonesque recently – I haven't listened to ours in a good few years! I'm extremely flattered that they chose to do it.

Ben Gibbard: When I announced that I was doing this, I got a Direct Message from The Cribs – Gary [Jarman, Cribs bassist] was like, 'I hope you're not gonna do that super-long outro on "The Concept"', and I wrote them back saying, 'Oh, I'm gonna make it even longer'. They said: 'Then my reverse psychology has worked!' I want that part to go on forever in my mind.
Norman Blake: It's been going on forever for me for years, mate.
PASSING THE TORCH
Norman Blake: I recently went to see a great band, the Canadian band Alvvays.
Ben Gibbard: Oh, man! Oh my god! That band is so good – god dammit, she's such a great songwriter. It's insane. That new record [ Antisocialites] is so wonderful. I'm just really astounded by their wordplay, and their songwriting is just absolutely amazing. You sing on that first song, right, "In Undertow"?
Norman Blake: I do, yeah! They're totally the real deal. It's great how exciting young bands can be.
Ben Gibbard: But there's a lot of new music that I shouldn't understand. For example, this guy Yung Lean – this vaporwave guy from Scandinavia. I'm not saying I don't think it's good, I just have no frame of reference for it at all! And I was kinda pleased that I felt that way, because I shouldn't get it. Death Cab was in Vancouver, and we walked down the street, and they were playing this theatre... The line-up of kids down the street, it was like, 'I'm scared of all of these kids. These kids are scaring me.' And they should scare me! I don't understand the fashion, I don't understand what they're talking about, I don't know what drugs they're doing – and, yeah, at 41 years old, I shouldn't get that. To me, that's a positive marker of time moving forward. Kids should have their own music.
STAYING INSPIRED
Ben Gibbard: I've often felt like our back catalogue is our worst enemy. We're about to make our ninth record, and it's very likely that we've made the record that we're known for – that we'll be remembered for. Even if you could scientifically determine that our next record was the best record we ever made, it wouldn't be seen as such, because Transatlanticism or We Have The Facts... or whatever, they were so pivotal in a lot of our fans' lives. You can't recreate that moment. I'm totally OK with that – that doesn't bother me at all. I think it's a good problem to have.
Norman Blake: I feel the same way. Your favourite record within yourself is always the one you're working on, but I always say to people that it's almost masochistic to listen to your own music. You're right in that this could be the best thing you've ever done technically, musically or whatever, and it won't be perceived that way – that's just the way it goes. I'm turning 52 this year, and I'm aware and I've realised that we're not gonna have a hit again. Well... actually, we never had one!
Ben Gibbard: What makes that music transcendent is when you hear a song that you swore you could have heard before, but you are reacting to it as if it's the first breath you've taken in life. I felt that way when I heard Bandwagonesque; I felt that way when I heard "Archie, Marry Me" by Alvvays. That, to me, is the beauty of pop music, and the beauty of guitar music. It can feel so familiar, and yet so new at the same time.
Norman Blake: Absolutely, and people are going to keep doing that. People are going to keep coming up with those little moments.
Ben Gibbard: I think that's one of the beauties of what Teenage Fanclub does – they construct these really meticulous, intricate harmonies, but they sound so simple. That, to me, is the mark of what makes a band or a record great: the ability to make something very complex sound simple and attainable.

Hosni Mubarak has stepped down as president of Egypt, after weeks of protest in Cairo and other cities.
The news was greeted with a huge outburst of joy and celebration by thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the heart of the demonstrations.
Mr Mubarak ruled for 30 years, suppressing dissent and protest, and jailing opponents.
US President Barack Obama said that Egypt must now move to civilian and democratic rule.
This was not the end but the beginning and there were difficult days ahead, the US president added, but they were confident the people could find the answers.
"The people of Egypt have spoken, their voices have been heard," Mr Obama said. "Egypt will never be the same again."
"They have made it clear that nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day."
'God help everybody'
President Hosni Mubarak Elevated from vice-president when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981
Supported Sadat's policy of peace with Israel
Maintained emergency law for entire presidency
Won three elections unopposed
Fourth term secured in 2005 after allowing rivals to stand
Economic development led many Egyptians to accept continued rule

Regularly suppressed dissent, protests and political opponents Middle East after Hosni Mubarak Egyptians celebrate new era In pictures: Mubarak's presidency Mubarak resigns: World reaction
Announcing Mr Mubarak's resignation, Vice-President Omar Suleiman said the president had handed power to the army.
Mr Suleiman said on state TV that the high command of the armed forces had taken over.
"In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, citizens, during these very difficult circumstances Egypt is going through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to step down from the office of president of the republic and has charged the high council of the armed forces to administer the affairs of the country," they said.
"May God help everybody."
Later an army officer read out a statement paying tribute to Mr Mubarak for "what they have given" to Egypt but acknowledging popular power.
"There is no legitimacy other than that of the people," the statement said.
The military high command is headed by Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.
US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks described Field Marshal Tantawi as "aged and change-resistant", but committed to avoiding another war with Israel.
Mr Mubarak has already left Cairo and is in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where they have a residence, officials say.
In Cairo, thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace, in Tahrir Square and at state TV.
They came out in anger following an address by Mr Mubarak on Thursday. They had been expected to announce their resignation but stopped short of stepping down, instead transferring most powers to Mr Suleiman.

"The people have brought down the regime," they chanted in reaction to the news of their eventual resignation less than 24 hours later.
Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said: "This is the greatest day of my life."
"You cannot comprehend the amount of joy and happiness of every Egyptian at the restoration of our humanity and our freedom."
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's banned Islamist opposition movement, paid tribute to the army for keeping its promises.
"I salute the Egyptian people and the martyrs. This is the day of victory for the Egyptian people. The main goal of the revolution has been achieved," said the Brotherhood's former parliamentary leader, Mohamed el-Katatni.
At the scene It is hard to know where to look as you walk through central Cairo. Everyone in this mega-city has spilled out onto the streets to party. Soldiers lift small, smiling children onto their tanks to pose for photos, whole families are flying flags and wearing matching hats in red, white and black as they walk along the Corniche by the Nile, and motorcyclists precariously weave their way through the crowds yelling "Egypt, Egypt". The excited din from Tahrir Square, the scene of the massive protests against President Mubarak that began on 25 January, can be heard from miles off. It is packed with huge crowds. The demonstrators' barricades that had controlled entry to the square have been dismantled, and security checkpoints at which people showed identification and had their bags searched have all gone. Some people are already packing up their tents in the campsite nearby. They have achieved what they set out to do. Day of glory for Tahrir Square protesters
Ayman Nour, Mr Mubarak's rival for the presidency in 2005, described it as the greatest day in Egypt's history.
"This nation has been born again. These people have been born again, and this is a new Egypt," they told al-Jazeera TV.
Meanwhile Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister, announced that they would leave their post as secretary general of the Arab League "within weeks", the Egyptian news agency Mena reported. They hinted that they might stand for president.
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo said the announcement caught everyone by surprise: all over the city, drivers honked their horns and people fired guns into the air.
But the army takeover looks very much like a military coup, our correspondent adds.
The constitution has been breached, they say, because officially it should be the speaker of parliament who takes over, not the army leadership.
'Historic change'
There was jubilation throughout the Middle East and North Africa, including in Tunisia, where people overthrew their own president last month.

For the Arab League, Mr Moussa said events in Egypt presented an opportunity to build a national consensus.
Meanwhile, Iran described the recent events as a "great victory".
A senior Israeli official expressed the hope that Mr Mubarak's departure would "bring no change to its peaceful relations with Cairo".
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said they respected the "difficult decision" taken in the people's interests, and called for an "orderly and peaceful transition".
European Union leaders reacted positively to the news of Mr Mubarak's resignation.
Foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton said the EU "respected" the decision.
"It is important now that the dialogue is accelerated leading to a broad-based government which will respect the aspirations of, and deliver stability for, the Egyptian people," they said.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron said this was a "really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the people together", and called for a "move to civilian and democratic rule".

German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the "historic change" in Egypt.
US Vice-President Joe Biden said Egypt had reached a pivotal moment in history.
The anti-government protests that began on 25 January were triggered by widespread unrest in Egypt over unemployment, poverty and corruption.
They followed a popular uprising in Tunisia which brought about the downfall of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.
Sexual harassment and assault are not limited to Hollywood. Rumors and vague accounts of aspiring actores being preyed upon have circulated in Asian showbiz for years. But it is highly unlikely that Asian actores will come forward in the way that their Western counterparts have done following the explosion of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
Asia's relatively conservative attitude towards sex, the fear of consequences that could jeopardize the lives of their families as well as careers, and public judgment are reasons that stop abuse victims in the Asian entertainment business from coming forward, industry insiders say.
Candice Yu, executive secretary of Hong Kong Performing Artistes' Guild, said that their organization has not received such complaints since they took over the position two years ago. But they do not deny such situations exist.
“People are much more reserved and conservative here in China or Asia. People are afraid of the consequences, such as losing their career,” Yu said. They said coming forward to reveal the truth about sexual assault was never easy for anyone, let alone those living in the limelight. “Many of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein referred to events that happened many years ago. But if our members seek help from us, we will definitely support them,” Yu said.

One insider who spoke on condition of anonymity said there had been instances involving men masquerading as film or music executives and making sexual advances towards aspiring actores. “They pretend to offer these girls a movie or record deal opportunity, if these girls could ‘return favor.' But these girls will not come forward, because they would put themselves in the spotlight, be judged by netizens, and considered as gold-diggers,” said one producer who asked not to be named.
Public sex scandals are unusual in Asia, but not unheard of. Action star Jackie Chan made news headlines in 1999 when a former Miss Asia, Elaine Ng, was found to be pregnant with their child. Chan belatedly acknowledged the affair, but has maintained arm's-length relations with Ng and their daughter.
In 2012, Chinese actor Zhang Ziyi was accused by U.S.-based dissident website Boxun.com of having sex with top Chinese officials, including the disgraced politician Bo Xilai. They sued for libel and settled out of court in 2013 after the site retracted its story.
In Korea, where the Busan Film Festival opened Thursday, an unnamed actor this year accused leading indie director Kim Ki-duk of physical and verbal abuse during the filming of their 2013 movie “Moebius.” Through the Federation of Korean Movie Workers' Union, they said that the director forced them to take part in an unscripted, violent sex scene. They withdrew from the film and was replaced. Kim denies the accusations and said that they were providing them with acting coaching on the first day of production. The case is currently with prosecutors.
In India, where rape and other violence against women has become a major social issue in recent years, there are multiple examples of sexual misconduct in show business. But the industry has barely tackled the issue.
Mahmood Farooqui, co-director of India's 2011 foreign-language Oscar contender, “Peepli (Live),” was arrested by Delhi police in June 2015 on charges of raping an American woman. They were sentenced to seven years in prison in August 2016, but acquitted and released in September 2017. The appeals court judge said: “Instances of woman (sic) behavior are not unknown that a feeble no may mean a yes.”
In July 2017, Kerala state police arrested popular Malayalam-language cinema actor Dileep on charges of kidnapping and attempting to rape an actor. They were granted bail this month, a week after their film “Ramaleela” opened in theaters. The film is now on its way to becoming a smash hit.
And in June 2009, a domestic servant accused Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja of rape. Ahuja was sentenced to seven years in prison in March 2011, but was released on bail the following month. They have resumed work and made a comeback with 2015's “Welcome Back.”
Orbiting a nearby red dwarf star called Gliese 581 are 6 planets. One of them is a rocky ball, bigger than Earth, in the "habitable zone" where water is liquid and temperatures are human-friendly. It's possible we could live there.
Unlike Earth, this planet called Gliese 581g, is "tidally locked" to its star. That means one side of the planet always faces the sun, and the other faces darkness. Temperatures on the two sides would be dramatically different, with the livable area in the "terminator" between day and night.

Living on Gliese 581g would put you in an eternal twilight, which doesn't sound bad at all. Temperatures in the terminator area might be between -24 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-31 to -12 degrees Celsius), which is the average temperature of the planet's surface. So things would be a bit chilly, but you could always visit the perma-sun on dayside if you needed a dose of red dwarf radiation.
According to AFP:
The planet, found by astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Carnegie Institution of Washington, is orbiting in the middle of the "habitable zone" of the red dwarf star Gliese 581, which means it could have water on its surface. Liquid water and an atmosphere are necessary for a planet to possibly sustain life, even it is might not be a great place to live, the scientists said. The scientists determined that the planet, which they have called Gliese 581g, has a mass three to four times that of Earth and an orbital period of just under 37 days. Its mass indicates that it is probably a rocky planet and has enough gravity to hold on to an atmosphere, according to Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and one of the leaders of the team that discovered the planet.

The researchers say the most important aspect of this discovery is that it means Earthlike worlds are probably pretty common, given that we found one that's practically in our own stellar backyard.

Time Magazine has apologized for including the word “feminist” in its annual list of words to ban for the new year. Nancy Gibbs, the magazine's managing editor, penned an apology that is included as an editor's note above the article:
Time apologizes for the execution of this poll; the word ‘feminist' should not have been included in a list of words to ban. While we meant to invite debate about some ways the word was used this year, that nuance was lost, and we regret that its inclusion has become a distraction from the important debate over equality and justice.
“Feminist” was nominated along with words like “bae,” “basic,” “disrupt,” “kale,” “bossy” and “turnt,” among others, with humorous explanations of the words. Previous castoffs have included OMG, YOLO and twerk. "Feminist" has since been removed from the poll.
As for why Time's staff chose to have readers vote the word "off the island" in the first place, its inclusion was explained: “You have nothing against feminism itself, but when did it become a thing that every celebrity had to state their position on whether this word applies to them, like some politician declaring a party? Let's stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade.”
Adding "feminist" to the list was clearly an attempt at humor, but it left a bad taste in quite a few readers' mouths. Blogger and professor Roxane Gay wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Post, “The list is supposed to be funny, but it is largely a policing of the vernacular of anyone who isn't a white, heterosexual man."
In the Los Angeles Times, blogger Susan Rohwer opined it was “deeply troubling a news organization like Time would suggest banning a word that means something as basic and seemingly uncontroversial as ‘all humans deserve the same rights regardless of their gender.' Apparently, we need yet another reminder of why anti-feminist rhetoric like this needs to end.”
The New York Review of Books, Planned Parenthood and others all weighed in on social media, generally panning the magazine's decision to include the word on its banishment poll.
Jamyah Lee, 7 months, after being released from the hospital on Tuesday, May 5, 2015.
A South Side man is due in bond court Friday, accused of throwing a chunk of concrete through a window, which struck a 7-month-old girl in the head.Jeremy O'Neal, 25, of the 9500-block of South Houston Avenue, was arrested Thursday and charged with aggravated battery stemming from the May 3 incident, officials said.The baby, Jamyah Lee, spent two days in the hospital and was treated for skull fractures, internal bleeding and brain swelling."I'm just glad the police do their job," said Patricia Hicks, the baby's grandmother. "It's the way it should be."The incident happened at about 8:30 p.m. May 3 when O'Neal was looking for a woman they were angry with, prosecutors said. They went to a home in the 1400-block of West 73rd Place in the city's Englewood neighborhood on the South Side. When O'Neal was told the woman was not there, investigators said O'Neal threw a concrete block through a window.The baby was playing on a bed inside the home when the incident occurred. They were taken to Comer Children's Hospital, where doctors treated them for.The family said that Jamyah may have to take medication to prevent seizures."I don't let what happen frighten me in my own home," Hicks said. "That's where I got to be safe and that's where I'm going to be safe."
AT&T celebrated Google Fiber's reported struggles yesterday by publishing a blog post lecturing its competitor about the difficulties of broadband investment. AT&T also criticized Google for seeking favors from the government—something AT&T would never do, of course.
The blog post is titled "Broadband investment: Not for the faint of heart" and is written by AT&T VP Joan Marsh, who manages AT&T's regulatory interests at the federal government. It provides a timeline of Google investment in broadband infrastructure starting with a bid on spectrum in 2007, saying that the company has never lived up to its grand ambitions. The latest example is Google Fiber, which has reportedly fallen well short of subscriber goals and may be downsizing. (Google hasn't confirmed or denied the reports of impending layoffs.)
AT&T says the "moral of the story" is that "building reliable, ubiquitous high-speed broadband connectivity is tough."
"Google Fiber will no doubt continue its broadband experiments, while coming up with excuses for its shortcomings and learning curves," AT&T wrote. "It will also no doubt continue to seek favoritism from government at every level. Just last week Google Fiber threatened the Nashville City Council that it would stop its fiber build if an ordinance Google Fiber drafted wasn't passed. Instead of playing by the same rules as everyone else building infrastructure, Google Fiber demands special treatment and indeed in some places is getting it, unfairly."
AT&T knows a few things about demanding favors from the government. In February, when some legislators in Tennessee unsuccessfully tried to overturn a law that helps AT&T avoid competition by preventing expansion of municipal broadband networks, AT&T lobbied to keep the law in place. At the time, a Republican state senator described AT&T as "the most powerful lobbying organization in this state by far." In Missouri, AT&T donated $62,500 to lawmakers months before a vote to limit municipal broadband.
A Google Fiber spokesperson declined comment on AT&T's blog post, though the root cause of Google Fiber's Nashville problems involve AT&T. The telecom giant is able to delay Google Fiber's access to utility poles, so Google is seeking an ordinance that would let it attach wires to poles without AT&T involvement even when AT&T wires need to be moved. AT&T is fighting the ordinance in Nashville and already sued the government in Louisville, Kentucky, to stop a similar rule that gave Google Fiber faster access to utility poles there.
AT&T's blog post yesterday also scoffed at Google Fiber's purchase of Webpass, a wireless Internet provider. Using wireless technology could help Google Fiber avoid pole attachment problems and deploy Internet service faster. But AT&T predicted that Google Fiber will "discover that wireless networks are expensive to build as well and learn that microwave broadband may work well in dense urban areas, particularly where supported by higher-cost commercial services, but offers tougher economics when trying to serve residential customers."
AT&T concluded that "Google Fiber still complains it's too hard… and costs too much… and takes too long… even as it's reported that Google Fiber will now try to do all this with half its current workforce. Meanwhile, without excuses or finger-pointing, and without presenting ultimatums to cities in exchange for service, AT&T continues to deploy fiber and to connect our customers to broadband services in communities across the country. Welcome to the broadband network business, Google Fiber. We'll be watching your next move from our rear view mirror. Oh, and pardon our dust."
AT&T's discussion of complaints and ultimatums didn't include its own reaction when the FCC debated whether to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers and impose net neutrality rules. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson claimed in November 2014 that the company would have to "pause" investments in fiber networks because of the proposed rules and made a similar claim in 2010. While the FCC shelved the common carrier idea in 2010, it finally reclassified ISPs in February 2015. AT&T sued and lost but has vowed to take it to the Supreme Court.
AT&T boasted in yesterday's blog post that it hasn't stopped investing in fiber, suggesting that its threat of a "pause" wasn't purely a complaint or ultimatum but was rather a failed bluff.

This is one book that can be judged by its cover, which features a startling 2012 artwork by the Cherokee painter America Meredith. The image is a playful riff on the jacket of the Beatles album Abbey Road. But instead of world-famous British rock stars striding over the zebra crossing in 1969, we see three Cherokee diplomats who toured London in 1762. The artist's feat of time travel is both witty and unsettling, raising a host of questions. What are those Cherokees doing there, so far out of place and time? What was—and is—the meaning of their presence at the heart of the British Empire, straddling its rise and fall?

How colonial trade turned a sacred plant into a toxic threat
Coll Thrush's Indigenous London: Native Travelers at the Heart of Europe addresses such questions in a wide-ranging exploration of the 500-year relationship between imperial centre and colonial periphery; between Londoners of all kinds—kings, queens, adventurers, onlookers, showmen, rakes, writers—and visiting folk from faraway lands invaded by Britain's empire, often violently. Some of those visitors were lured or kidnapped; others came of their own free will in hopes of shaping British policy. The latter, mostly high-ranking envoys seeking talks with royalty and officials, also came to gather intelligence of what their people faced. One of the 1762 Cherokees, Utsidihi, gave a revealing demographic report when they got home: “the numbers of warriors and people being all one color which we saw in England far exceeded what we thought possible.” Their journey had taught them that the white tide of settlers flooding onto the Cherokee Nation came from an inexhaustible source: the slums of Europe's biggest city and its rural hinterland. Such insights were doubtless intended by the British; sightseeing tours of London were propaganda contrived to impress foreign visitors with the empire's might and reach, implying resistance would be futile.
“Settlers” is hardly the right word for land-hungry whites clawing at the frontier, repeatedly on the move. It was eastern North America's indigenous peoples who were truly settled there, who lived in towns, farmed the land, and had done so since time immemorial. Many were still using great earthen pyramids built by their ancestors in a time before Spanish marauders brought (and followed) the first depopulating scythe of smallpox through the Americas, as they had in Mexico and Peru. The “pioneer” was essentially parasitic, taking over developed lands whenever the Native owners were weakened by warfare, disruption and plague. The Plymouth Pilgrims survived their first winter only by living in Wampanoag houses and eating the corn harvest left by the dead. Yet the most tenacious Anglo-American myth, from that day to this, is that all “Indians” were nomads, sparse in number, living only by what they could hunt in a “primeval” forest. A popular 1931 history of the United States even claimed that “a squirrel might have leapt from bough to bough for a thousand miles and never have seen a flicker of sunshine on the ground.” This was not simply mistaken. It was a self-serving lie rooted in Biblical notions that the Earth belongs to those who till it. By portraying the “savages” as not really using America in the first place, the “civilized” British and white Americans bestowed on themselves the right to take it. The same sleight of logic is still at work today, in both Canada and the United States, whenever First Nations are accused of getting in the way of pipelines, clear-cut logging and other forms of what we deem progress.
While indigenous diplomacy usually garnered little more than empty promises, it did occasionally bear fruit, notably the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on which Native rights in North America still rest today. The Proclamation enshrined the principle that only the Crown (now the federal governments of Britain's two successor states) can lawfully alienate indigenous territory. When Stephen Harper's pipeline “consultations” with First Nations were recently ruled invalid by Canadian courts, it was because Harper had turned the process over to private corporations.
Shakespeare's Tempest, written a few years after the founding of Jamestown, drew on reports from Virginia and the Spanish Empire.
In the early days of contact, especially those of the faltering Jamestown colony in the Powhatan Confederacy, there were some beginnings of a reciprocal relationship between the British and the Native powers. In 1614 Pocahontas, daughter of the confederacy high chief who ruled from “Powhatan's Tower” (likely an ancient earthwork) at what would become Richmond, Virginia, married the leading Jamestowner John Rolfe. Two years later this couple led a delegation to London during which Pocahontas was treated almost as an equal by King James and Queen Anne. A portrait of the day shows them in Jacobean dress, ruff and hat, and describes their (in Latin) as “daughter of Prince Powhatan, Emperor of Virginia.” Thrush writes that their presence at court was “a public-relations coup.” Both sides had high hopes for their alliance: new land for the British; new weaponry and other goods for the Powhatans. But Pocahontas's stay in London ended sadly—in a way all too common for New World visitors: “two months later, they were dead, likely of dysentery, struck down as their ship descended the Thames.” One thinks of the Iroquoians kidnapped by Jacques Cartier at Stadacona (Quebec City) in 1534: of the ten they took to France, nine sickened and died.
Thrush, a professor of history at the University of British Columbia (and author of Native Seattle: Histories from the Crossing-Over Place) has a vast topic on their hands; it must have been hard to decide what to put in and leave out. Their book is a feast of fascinating and important narratives involving about 40 indigenous peoples, from North America, New Zealand (or Aotearoa), Australia and the native Kingdom of Hawai'i have overthrown and occupied by the United States since the 1890s. By focusing on London, Thrush not only unearths an indigenous presence there that is largely forgotten, but also gives themselves a fresh standpoint from which to examine the complexities of colonialism and its fallout today. Some of the most moving passages describe the return to London of descendants, searching for their dead and forming modern communities within the metropolis.
Indigenous London seems to be written for general readers as well as students and academics. Each chapter is followed by an “interlude,” a blending of poetic imagination with primary sources (perhaps inspired by Eduardo Galeano's technique in Memory of Fire). Mostly these vignettes succeed, although some strive too hard for effect or need more explanation. Newcomers to North American history and ethnography may feel a want of background on the various cultures from which indigenous travellers came. This is easily found elsewhere, although there are pitfalls for the unwary. As the settler-versus-nomad myth illustrates, North American history is highly politicized and always has been. The past is endlessly rewritten for the present, mainly by and for the winners. Even pre-contact population estimates are still bitterly contested—all the more so because the evidence has been swept away by the invaders' roads and cities. Nothing remains of Powhatan's Tower at Richmond; and when people remember that the place was once a capital, it is a more recent confederacy that springs to mind—the Confederate States of America.
A minor but off-putting problem for readers new to the subject will be identifying well-known ethnic groups and persons for whom Thrush uses autonyms and linguistically rigorous spelling, when in most other works they appear under longstanding Englished forms. This practice, with its whiff of overzealous correctness, is not followed consistently; why substitute Kanaka Maoli for Hawaiians, yet leave Mohawks (Kanienkehaka in their own language) as Mohawks? Future editions would benefit from a glossary of correspondences.
Thrush's political sensitivities, although certainly needed to deconstruct the overweening ethnocentrism of imperial power, sometimes lead them astray. Among the book's illustrations is a striking 1872 image by Gustave Doré called The New Zealander. This shows a robed man, probably a Maori, sitting on fallen stones beside the Thames. The figure seems to be holding a sketchbook and gazing at the broken dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, which presides over a future London as ruined as ancient Rome. Taking the picture as a visual “lie” (albeit inverted) sustaining the colonial prejudice that “urban and Indigenous realities cannot coexist,” Thrush rips Doré for ignoring the fact that Maori had been coming to London for decades by 1872. Unfortunately, they seem unaware that Doré was merely echoing a then-famous passage from an 1840 essay by Thomas Macaulay, who had themselves lifted the idea from a 1774 letter by Horace Walpole. Macaulay's point was the remarkable durability of the Roman Catholic church, which they impishly suggested might still be in business long after England's church and state had fallen, when “some traveller from New Zealand shall, in the midst of a vast solitude, take their stand on a broken arch of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St Paul's.”
That said, Thrush's review of influences from indigenous visitors on literary London is otherwise sound. Shakespeare's Tempest, written a few years after the founding of Jamestown, drew on reports from Virginia and the Spanish Empire. Another source (not mentioned here) was the brilliant essay On Cannibals by Montaigne, a founder of cultural relativism avant la lettre. Three Tupinambá visitors from Brazil told them they were mystified by the gulf between rich and poor in France: “some men gorged to the full with things of every sort while [others] were beggars at their doors.” This is sometimes dismissed as the essayist's own social rhetoric, not reportage. Yet many similar observations made by the visitors in Thrush's book bear out Montaigne's truthfulness. The Mohegan author and minister Samson Occom, who spent some years in London during the 1760s, later told the Oneida that the English nobility “keep the rest of their Brethren under their Feet, they make Slaves of them.” Likewise, the Mohawk poet and celebrity Tekahionwake (Pauline Johnson) who visited in the 1890s and early 1900s: “With slums like this in the heart of London, they'll dare to send missionaries to our Indians in Canada!”
The voices of Indigenous London often speak as eloquently to the world today as they do about the past.
MOORHEAD – A Felton, Minn., man admitted in court Thursday, March 17, to accidentally shooting their 22-month-old daughter in the leg.
Fernando Rocha, 25, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of child endangerment.
Rocha said they were cleaning their .45 caliber pistol while in bed with their wife and daughter when the gun fired, hitting their daughter in the leg.
Rocha said they had 12 beers before the shooting and said they did meth a couple days before.
Previous reports say Rocha's daughter was rushed to a Fargo hospital, where they underwent emergency surgery to save their leg. They have since recovered.
On Thursday, a judge accepted Rocha's testimony, which was part of a plea deal. A sentencing hearing for Rocha is set for April 18.
Rocha is also facing two separate charges from earlier this month. One is for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1,000 feet of a school and a second charge for possession of drug paraphernalia.
I had quite a lot of experience of the both approaches when writing an RPG game in Java. Originally I wrote the whole game using class-based OOP, but eventually realised that this was the wrong approach (it was becoming unmaintainable as the class hierarchy expanded). I therefore converted the whole code base to prototype-based code. The result was much better and easier to manage.
Source code here if you are interested (Tyrant - Java Roguelike)
Here are the main benefits:
It's trivial to create new "classes" - just copy the prototype and change a couple of properties and voila... new class. I used this to define new type of potion for example in 3-6 lines of Java each. Much better than a new class file and loads of boilerplate!

Much better than a new class file and loads of boilerplate! It's possible to build and maintain extremely large numbers of "classes" with comparatively little code - Tyrant for example had something like 3000 different prototypes with only about 42,000 lines of code total. That's pretty amazing for Java!

Multiple inheritance is easy - you just copy a subset of the properties from one prototype and paste them over the properties in another prototype. In an RPG for example, you might want a "steel golem" to have some of the properties of a "steel object" and some of the properties of a "golem" and some of the properties of an "unintelligent monster". Easy with prototypes, try doing that with an inheritance heirarchy......

Easy with prototypes, try doing that with an inheritance heirarchy...... You can do clever things with property modifiers - by putting clever logic in the generic "read property" method, you can implement various modifiers. For example, it was easy to define a magic ring that added +2 strength to whoever was wearing it. The logic for this was in the ring object, not in the "read strength" method, so you avoided having to put lots of conditional tests elsewhere in your code base (e.g. "is the character wearing a ring of strength increase?")

Instances can become templates for other instances - e.g. if you want to "clone" an object it is easy, just use the existing object as the prototype for the new object. No need to write lots of complex cloning logic for different classes.

It's quite easy to change behaviour at runtime - i.e. you can change an properties and "morph" an object pretty much arbitrarily at runtime. Allows for cool in-game effects, and if you couple this with a "scripting language" then pretty much anything is possible at runtime.

It's more suited to a "functional" style of programming - you tend to find yourself writing lots of functions that analyse objects an act appropriately, rather than embedded logic in methods attached to specific classes. I personally prefer this FP style.
Here are the main drawbacks:
You lose the assurances of static typing - since you are effectively creating a dynamic object system. This tends to mean that you need to write more tests to ensure behaviour is correct and that objects are of the right "kind"

This tends to mean that you need to write more tests to ensure behaviour is correct and that objects are of the right "kind" There is some performance overhead - since reads of object properties are generally forced to go through one or more map lookups, you pay a slight cost in terms of performance. In my case it wasn't a problem, but it could be an issue in some cases (e.g. a 3D FPS with a lot of objects being queried in every frame)

IDEs / refactoring tools can't really help you since they can't grok your approach. I never found this a problem, but it could get out of hand if you are not careful. You probably want tests to check that your inheritance hierarchy is being constructed correctly!

It's a bit alien - people used to a conventional OOP style may easily get confused. "What do you mean there's only one class called "Thing"?!?" - "How do I extend this final Thing class!?!" - "You are violating OOP principles!!!" - "It's wrong to have all these static functions that act on any kind of object!?!?"
Finally some implementation notes:
