CAIRO (Reuters) - Food security in the Middle East and North Africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region, the United Nations said on Thursday.
In those hardest hit by crises — Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan — an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security.
A quarter of Yemen's people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times.
The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000.
It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries.
“The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition,” the FAO's assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said.
“Decisive steps towards peace and stability (need to be) taken.”
Several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.
Syria's civil war, which also began with popular demonstrations, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made more than 11 million homeless.
Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Uma Therman and Tom Hanks were among the A-listers on the red carpet for the Baftas 2014.
The star-studded event, hosted at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, has attracted a glittering crowd this year.
But despite nerves kicking in for the 2014 nominees, one leading actress enjoyed the event safe in the knowledge that she had scooped an award.
Helen Mirren got the royal seal of approval and was presented with the Fellowship prize by Prince William.
The queen of British cinema - who has played the monarch on stage and screen and won the leading actress Oscar in 2007 for The Queen - joined other winners of the prestigious award including Martin Scorsese and Sir Christopher Lee.

The Baftas are widely seen as a dry run for next month's Oscars and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is tipped to continue its award season success.
The film, which stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in America's deep south, has 10 nominations including for best film and best director.
Ejiofor is nominated for the leading actor award while co-stars Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender are nominated for supporting actress and actor.
London-born Ejiofor said there was "something particularly special about receiving a Bafta nomination from home".

Most Americans have no idea that the U.S. government once issued debt-free money directly into circulation. America once thrived under a debt-free monetary system, and we can do it again. The truth is that the United States is a sovereign nation and it does not need to borrow money from anyone. Back in the days of JFK, Federal Reserve Notes were not the only currency in circulation. Under JFK (at at various other times), a limited number of debt-free United States Notes were issued by the U.S. Treasury and spent by the U.S. government without any new debt being created. In fact, each bill said “United States Note” right at the top. Unfortunately, United States Notes are not being issued today. If you stop right now and pull a dollar out of your wallet, what does it say right at the top? It says “Federal Reserve Note”. Normally, the way our current system works is that whenever more Federal Reserve Notes are created more debt is also created. This debt-based monetary system is systematically destroying the wealth of this nation. But it does not have to be this way. The truth is that the U.S. government still has the power under the U.S. Constitution to issue debt-free money, and we need to educate the American people about this.
Posted below are pictures of the front and the back of a United States Note printed in 1963 while JFK was president….
Notice that there is a red seal instead of a green seal on the front, and it says “United States Note” rather than “Federal Reserve Note”.
According to Wikipedia, United States Notes were issued directly into circulation by the U.S. Treasury and they were first used during the Civil War….
They were originally issued directly into circulation by the U.S. Treasury to pay expenses incurred by the Union during the American Civil War. Over the next century, the legislation governing these notes was modified many times and numerous versions have been issued by the Treasury.
So why are we using debt-based Federal Reserve Notes today instead of debt-free United States Notes?
It seems rather stupid, doesn't it?
Well, that is what Thomas Edison thought too.
Thomas Edison was once quoted in the New York Times as saying the following….
That is to say, under the old way any time we wish to add to the national wealth we are compelled to add to the national debt. Now, that is what Henry Ford wants to prevent. He thinks it is stupid, and so do I, that for the loan of $30,000,000 of their own money the people of the United States should be compelled to pay $66,000,000 — that is what it amounts to, with interest. People who will not turn a shovelful of dirt nor contribute a pound of material will collect more money from the United States than will the people who supply the material and do the work. That is the terrible thing about interest. In all our great bond issues the interest is always greater than the principal. All of the great public works cost more than twice the actual cost, on that account. Under the present system of doing business we simply add 120 to 150 per cent, to the stated cost. But here is the point: If our nation can issue a dollar bond, it can issue a dollar bill. The element that makes the bond good makes the bill good.
Our current debt-based monetary system was devised by greedy bankers that wanted to make huge profits by creating money out of thin air and lending it to the U.S. government at interest.
Sadly, the vast majority of the American people have no idea how money is actually created in this nation.
In a previous article about money and debt, I explained how more government debt is created whenever the U.S. government puts more money into circulation….
When the government wants more money, the U.S. government swaps U.S. Treasury bonds for “Federal Reserve notes”, thus creating more government debt. Usually the money isn't even printed up – most of the time it is just electronically credited to the government. The Federal Reserve creates these “Federal Reserve notes” out of thin air. These Federal Reserve notes are backed by nothing and have no intrinsic value of their own.
When each new Federal Reserve Note is created, the interest owed by the federal government on that new Federal Reserve Note is not also created at the same time.
So the amount of government debt that is created actually exceeds the amount of money that is created.
Isn't that a stupid system?
The U.S. Constitution says that the federal government is the one that should actually be issuing our money.
In particular, according to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, it is the U.S. Congress that has been given the responsibility to “coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures”.
So why is a private central banking cartel issuing our money?
As is the case with so many other issues, we desperately need to get back to the way the U.S. Constitution says that we should be doing things.
The debt-based Federal Reserve system is literally stealing the future from our children and our grandchildren.
Back in 1910, a couple years prior to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the national debt was only about $2.6 billion.
A little over 100 years later, our national debt is now more than 5000 times larger.
So why don't we just admit that this system simply does not work?
Our current debt-based monetary system also requires very high personal income taxes to pay for it.
In fact, it is no accident that the personal income tax was introduced at about the same time that the Federal Reserve system originally came into existence.
Our children, our grandchildren and many generations after that are facing a lifetime of debt slavery because of us.
As I have written about previously, if the federal government began right at this moment to repay the U.S. national debt at a rate of one dollar per second, it would take over 440,000 years to pay off the national debt.
Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are proposing any solutions to this problem. Rather, both parties are only trying to slow down the rate at which we are going into even more debt.
But the truth is that the federal government does not have to go into a single penny of additional debt.
How could this be?
It is not too complicated.
If Congress took back the power over our currency and started issuing debt-free money a lot of our problems could be fixed.
A basic plan would look something like this….
#1) The U.S. Congress votes to take back all of the functions that it has delegated to the Federal Reserve and begins to issue debt-free United States Notes. These United States Notes would have the exact same value as existing Federal Reserve Notes, and over time all existing Federal Reserve Notes would be taken out of circulation.
#2) The U.S. Congress nationalizes all debt held by the Federal Reserve. That would instantly reduce the national debt by 1.6 trillion dollars. In fact, there are a few members of Congress that have already proposed this.
#3) A Constitutional amendment is passed limiting future U.S. government deficits to a reasonable percentage of GDP. Any future deficits would not be funded by borrowing. Rather, future deficits would be funded by newly created United States Notes. Therefore, the federal government would never again accumulate another penny of debt.
And it would be important to inject new money into the economy from time to time. When existing money is destroyed or when the population grows it is important to inject a certain amount of new money into the system in order to avoid deflation.
#4) The existing national debt would be very slowly paid off with newly created United States Notes. The U.S. government spent over 454 billion dollars on interest on the national debt during fiscal year 2011, and over time this expense would go to zero.
If the national debt is paid off slowly enough, it would not create too much inflation. I believe that it could be paid off gradually over 50 years without shocking the economy too much.
There are some that would object to any measure that would ever cause a small amount of inflation, but my contention is that we have created a $15 trillion dollar debt mess for future generations, and it would be absolutely criminal to pass that legacy on to them.
We created this mess, and it is our responsibility to clean it up.
While there is certainly a danger that we would have a limited amount of inflation under a debt-free monetary system such as the one described above, the reality is that we are absolutely guaranteed inflation under the Federal Reserve system.
Most Americans believe that inflation is a fact of life, but the sad truth is that the United States has only had a major, ongoing problem with inflation since the Federal Reserve was created back in 1913.
If you do not believe this, just check out this chart.
Sadly, the U.S. dollar has lost well over 95 percent of its value since the Federal Reserve was created.
So, yes, there would be a need for strict monetary discipline under a debt-free monetary system, but it would be hard to do worse than the Federal Reserve has already been doing.
And Congress could always slow down inflation using other methods. For example, raising the reserve requirements for banks (which should be done anyway) would help keep inflation in check.
If the above proposals were adopted, the end result would be something that we could all live with. The Federal Reserve system would be abolished, the national debt burden on future generations would be wiped out, the economy would not have to go through a devastating economic collapse that could last a decade or longer, and we could eventually make a fairly smooth transition to “hard money” if we wanted to after the national debt is gone.
Is there any other proposal out there that does all of those things?
There are many out there that would dispute some of the points above, and debate is good. By engaging in debate, we can hopefully help educate the American people about the nature of money.
The key is to get rid of our current debt-based Federal Reserve Notes and replace them with debt-free United States Notes.
The American people need to understand that it is a lie that the U.S. government “must” borrow money from somebody else.
When the U.S. government borrows money, it slowly transfers wealth from the American people to those that lent it.
At this point, we have created a financial nightmare for future generations that is unlike anything the world has ever seen before. We owe it to future generations to eliminate the debt problem without destroying the United States economy. Adopting debt-free money would allow us to do that.
But sadly, neither political party is even talking about debt-free money. In fact, most of the politicians in both political parties probably do not even know what debt-free money is.
So we need to get the American people educated about these things. Because if we stay on the course that we are currently on, an economic collapse is inevitable.

ATHENS, Ga. -- Chris Conley has a problem today. Actually, Conley has a problem with today. It lasts only 24 hours. There is so much to do.
When you're a starting senior flanker on a top-10 team and a college senior, a film director and a screenwriter, a budding athletic administrator and a coffeehouse musician, a Bible-quoting honor student and a superhero-loving, "Star Wars" geek, time is not something you waste. "Madden" can wait.
Take July 17, when Conley boarded a plane in Athens at 7:30 a.m., flew to Birmingham for SEC media days, spent several hours bouncing from one interview room to the next, flew back to Athens, went through a seven-on-seven session with his teammates, showered and ate dinner.
And then worked on his next film into the wee hours.
"I'll sleep when I'm dead," Conley said that day in Birmingham.

If you have any question about the talent and dedication of the college generation, spend a day with Conley. He will leave you shaking your head, just as he does the men and women who spend every day with him.
"I think everybody who's ever met him wants to hire him," Georgia coach Mark Richt said. "Whoever coaches him is going to fall in love with this guy, because of his ability, because of his coachability, because of his leadership, how he'll affect the locker room."
Conley has made himself into a good football player. A kid who never played organized football until his freshman year at North Paulding High School in Dallas, Ga., has caught 81 passes for 1,281 yards and 12 touchdowns in three seasons at Georgia. Richt believes Conley will be drafted next April.
Conley has made himself into a promising film director. A young man, who sent out a tweet earlier this year requesting to video some light-saber battles on the Georgia campus, developed that whim into "Retribution," a 26-minute "Star Wars" fan film. It has been viewed nearly 400,000 times on YouTube.
"It was pretty impressive for a student film," said producer Chris Hines, the board chairman of FilmAthens, a local nonprofit agency. Hines is working with Conley on his next film, about a superhero of Conley's own creation. Conley petitioned the NCAA to allow him to raise money for the film on Kickstarter, the crowdsourcing website. The NCAA said yes, albeit after extensive head-scratching. No student-athlete had ever asked to use Kickstarter.
"There are a lot of talkers," Hines said. "There are a lot of people that have ideas and want to do stuff. He's doing it. He's really doing what he says he wants to do. I'm super-impressed with him, with everything he's done."
Conley made himself into one of the most influential student-athletes in the nation. He already has completed two-year terms on both the Southeastern Conference and the NCAA Student-Athlete Advisory Committees (SAACs). He became a regular consultant to the NCAA president Dr. Mark A. Emmert.
"I talked to President Emmert multiple times about various issues, many having to do with how to communicate with student-athletes," Conley said. "Being the president of such a large organization, he can't be everywhere at once, and sending emails and memos isn't as effective as spoken word. We talked about how to bridge communication gaps."
Emmert, in a statement, called Conley "a remarkable young man. ... I always learn something from my conversations with him and all the student-athletes on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee."

The first SEC SAAC meeting that Conley ever attended, "He commanded the room," said Tre Stallings, a former SEC officer who now is the Tennessee Titans' director of player engagement. "He asked me if he could step in [and lead]. This was rare. He stepped in and kids automatically gravitated to him. They wanted to hear what he had to say."
Conley remains a non-voting member of the Georgia Athletic Association Board of Directors.
"Within the first month of him being here as a freshman," Carla Williams, the Georgia executive associate athletic director, said via email, "... We had a discussion about his goals and intent to maximize his time at [Georgia] by excelling in football, in the classroom, on campus, and in the community. I told him we would do everything within our power to help him reach his goals. What freshman does that?"
Conley arrived at Georgia in January 2011, a semester ahead of schedule, and will graduate with a degree in journalism in December, a semester ahead of schedule.
"I always talked to my advisers, 'I'm not going to drop a class. I'm going to finish every class even if I don't like it. But that being said, don't put something on my schedule that's not going to go towards my degree,'" Conley said. "... Some people don't necessarily have a plan for when they want to graduate. I did, and my plan was 'As Soon As Possible.'"
We can go as far back as you want. All-State in chorus in high school. Regional winner of a third-grade science fair. That one was cool -- he received a $5,000 savings bond and a family trip to Chicago for the national competition, where he got to meet TV handyman Bob Vila.
"That's when we got an idea," said Conley's mother, Christina. "I asked, 'Lord, is this what we're in store for from him?'"
Christina is a high school teacher. His father, Charles Conley, made a career in the U.S. Air Force. They emphasized faith (Chris' given name is Christian) and academics to their three children. Sports never ranked higher than third, which is why Chris didn't play football until he reached North Paulding High.
"He wanted to play receiver," Charles said. "I would go pick him up [after practice]. He would just come back upset because he couldn't catch the ball. Other kids were picking on him. One day, when I picked him up, he said, 'Dad, I can't catch the ball.' I guess God told me to say this: I just said, 'Look, all you gotta do is catch one. Just one ball. That's all.'
"I don't know if it was the next day or when, but I went to pick him up and he came back to the car and was all excited. 'Dad! Dad!' He had caught a ball. And it just kind of took off from there."
By midseason, Conley had begun making leaping grabs, his hands away from his body. He has handed the size of oven mitts, a hereditary gift from his paternal grandfather, a bricklayer. "One game," Charles said with a glance at his wife, "we both were looking at each other and looking at him, 'OK, whose child is this?'"
As a sophomore, he began getting letters from recruiters. Vanderbilt and Stanford showed interest. Alabama invited him to camp. But once Conley met Richt, another devout man, he knew where he would play.
Under the glass on Richt's desk is a piece of white copy paper, folded in quarters. At the top, Richt wrote, "Chris Conley."
As a sophomore in high school, Conley wrote 10 goals that applied to his life in high school, college and beyond, and then posted the goals in his bedroom. In 25 years of recruiting, Richt hadn't seen that very often. When he saw the goals during his recruiting visit to the home, he asked for a copy.
Chris Conley's favorite superheroes 1. Superman
"I can watch Superman movies all day. Love Superman." 2. Batman
"I'm a DC (Comics) guy at heart." 3. Spider-Man
"I loved Spider-Man when I was a kid. I thought I was Spider-Man for the longest time. I was climbing walls, furniture, jumping off stuff." 4. Iron Fist
"I was really intrigued by this dude with the fiery fists and all the stuff he could do." 5. Black Panther
"I thought I was going to shoot a short on (him). Until I found out how much it would actually cost to make that costume. I do not have that kind of money."
"If he went off the deep end somewhere along the way," Richt said, "I was going to open this up and show them to him, remind him, 'These are your goals. They're not mine. What are you doing?'"
In four years, Richt said, "I never pulled them out for him. I pulled them out for some other guys."
The goals are printed neatly in ink on unlined paper:
Be a man after God's heart.
Be the best athlete I can be.
Win region in football senior year.
Leave Tradition and Pride at NPHS
Be the man God wants at [Georgia's black block G logo].
Play 4 years -- earn a spot and contribute significantly.
Graduate with my degree.
Go into NFL draft and have career.
Marry God's woman for me.
Teach other young men wisdom and God's grace.
"When I wrote those things down," Conley said, "I wanted to be ambitious. I wanted to be lofty. If you don't have a big dream, you're shooting for something that's small, and why would you want to do that?"
Of the first five, Conley seems to have taken care of four (North Paulding didn't win its region in 2010). He can take care of the next two -- playing four years and graduating -- by December. That leaves the NFL and marriage. Conley nailed the last one, to teach young men wisdom and God's grace, some time ago.
When Conley arrived at Georgia as one of two midyear freshmen, he resumed living the life he had led for 18 years. He worked in the classroom and in the weight room. He studied his schoolbooks and his playbook. He went hard every snap. That didn't go over so well in the locker room.
"I had a lot of those moments," Conley said, "when we'd be in a meeting and they'd be talking about doing your best, someone in the crowd would say [sarcastic tone], 'Conley!' And everybody would just start laughing."
Conley didn't drink alcohol. He didn't want to hit the bars in the offseason. Richt said Conley isn't the only player in the locker room who goes all out on every snap and every drill, on the field and in the weight room.
"But not many guys are wired that way outside of football," Richt said. "That's what makes him different. And just realize that he's more than just a football player. He's got other interests. He's got other gifts. He's not afraid to explore them. That's the way I see him: not afraid to explore life, and not worried about what anybody thinks about him. He's willing to accept anyone mocking him or criticizing him or 'Why ya doing it' or 'You can't do it.' He just kind of ignores it."
Said Conley, "It's just being different and being all right with being different and loving that you're different. The fact that I don't shy away from my love of superheroes and comic books, 'Star Wars.' That's me. And I like the fact that that's me."
One middle school summer, Chris and his siblings discovered their father's cache of comic books from his youth. Conley's devotion to the DC and Marvel canons, as well as the galaxy, far, far away, is the basis for his filmmaking.
Earlier this year, Conley wrote, directed and starred in his "Star Wars" fan film, set on the Georgia campus. "Retribution" has the "Star Wars" theme of good versus evil, filtered through a Dawg sensibility. Tailback Todd Gurley has a role as a student with Superman-like qualities. Richt performs a hilarious deadpan cameo, and Hairy Dawg, the Georgia costumed mascot, appears as a leader of the rebels fighting the empire.
At the end of the film, after the rebels repelled the empire yet again, the voiceover intoned, "In loss lies a challenge, an inspiration to achieve victory, to unite, to fight."
In the wake of the Dawgs' disappointing 2013 season, when injuries sent a top-five team to an 8-5 finish, that voiceover took on added meaning.
"The ending of 'Retribution' had many themes that deal with obstacles and loss," Conley said. "These were some themes that we encountered as a football team, and when writing this film, we put many of these themes in the project."

His next film will focus on a reluctant superhero, a man who can absorb energy from other sources but is spent after using it. Conley, with the help of Hines, the producer and FilmAthens chair, hired a professional crew and cast from Atlanta.
"We really play with the idea, is a hero born or does destiny raise a hero when his efforts are needed?" Conley said. "Is a hero made or does he actually come along when he is needed the most? We play with the idea of sacrifice. How much are you willing to give?"
They shot 22 hours on the final weekend before Georgia's workouts began. And Conley's work on the film took a backseat to football and graduating and the rest of his multilayered life.
In the film "Broadcast News," a colleague sarcastically says to the news producer played by Holly Hunter, "It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room."
"No," Hunter says, her hyper-efficient shell cracking just a little. "It's awful."
His coaches say Conley works so hard that he doesn't know when to back off. The nagging injuries that kept him out of two games last season came from overwork. Offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said the coaches are careful what they tell Conley. When they tell him not to perform extra work, they monitor the practice field and the weight room to make sure he doesn't.
"I wouldn't call myself obsessive," Conley said. "I realize that all of these things that I do are just that. They are things that I do. They're not me. They're things that make up who I am, but they're not me. I don't put all my eggs into a basket and say, 'I am football.' I don't say, 'I am a filmmaker.' I say, 'Those are things that I do. But that's not just who I am.' Who I am is Chris Conley, a guy who is extremely flawed. People just choose not to look at those things because they think I do some cool stuff."
His mother recalls doing the dishes one night during Chris' junior year in high school.
"Mama," he said to her, "I want to be the best. How can I be the best?"
Christina responded with the first three lines of the first psalm, which blesses the man who walks not with the ungodly but who takes delight in God's law. The third verse ends, "And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
Sounds about right.

Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance is the rip-snortin', bone-crushing, brain-blasting story of a pistol-packing Gorilla and his bloody quest to hunt down and destroy the gang of cut-throats who murdered the man who raised him like a father.
East Congo, 1849: While on Safari in Africa, an English big-game hunter slaughters an entire troop of gorillas. While butchering the animals for trophies, his bush guides discover a survivor among the carnage: an infant gorilla, still clinging to his mother's breast. The orphan is placed aboard a boat to Europe where he captures the attention of two passengers: an Irish circus owner named Malloy and his young daughter, Abigail.
Malloy wins the baby gorilla in a card game and brings him to America, where grows up as a member of the circus family. They name him "Kumba", an African word for "roar".
America, 1865: Taught to use giant, hand-crafted pistols as part of a sharpshooting act, Kumba has become a frontier sensation.
Although he loves his adopted father, Kumba's closest relationship is with his “big sister”, Abigail, who has become an accomplished trick horse rider. The unlikely siblings communicate through sign language, making Abigail the only one who can truly understand him. As the Civil War rages in the East, the circus tours the American Southwest staying as far away from the conflict as possible. But the war is about to come to them.
Enter mysterious stranger Giuliano Schmidt, a European immigrant on the run from a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Gravesend, the meanest knife-throwing killer West of the Pecos. Wounded in battle with the gang, Giuliano stows away in one of the circus caravan's gypsy wagons where he is discovered by Malloy and Abigail. Together, they nurse the stranger back to health.
Understanding that he's put his saviors into great peril, Giuliano slips away at the first opportunity. But it's too late: Gravesend and his gang have followed his trail to the circus and, in a display of savage violence, exact a terrible price on the family for meddling in their affairs.
Driven half-mad with grief and rage, Kumba takes up his guns and sets out to kill the men who have shattered his life. The strangest, most startling Western hero of them all has been born.
Kinda bad-ass, huh? And the next four issues are going to be even better. More shoot-outs, more breath-taking chases, more brawls and even a… but I can't spoil the surprise. Are you along for this ride? Help us to complete Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance and help Kumba get the righteous payback he deserves!
We've got heroes:
We've got one very pissed-off gorilla cutting a bloody swath through the Old West in search of righteous payback!
When I published the first issues of Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance, I expected that some of the critics would get a kick out of it. What I didn't expect was the veritable stampede of praise the book has garnered since the release of that first issue in 2013. Critics and fans alike have just gone bananas over it. (That's not me boasting, by the way, that's me being very, VERY grateful!)
"It doesn't get much better than this, Pal. A rootin--tootin' six-gun shootin', Western adventure that makes me run off at the adjectives. Wonderful stuff." - JOE R. LANSDALE (author of Bubba Ho-Tep and Cold In July)
"Cartoonish by only a pinch, the story does a great job of walking that line of being too fantastical, yet has just enough realism to make you understand that this is a story with heft and emotion… (an) indie powerhouse of a book.” - AIN'T IT COOL NEWS
“...it has real weight and emotion… a well-crafted western that just happens to have a gun-toting gorilla as the main character. If you like westerns, gorillas, crazy concepts, or just plain ol' good comics, then this is one worth checking out.” - COMIC BOOK THERAPY

HISTORY:
To call Six-Gun Gorillaobscure is an understatement. The only reason anyone knows of the story and its titular character is thanks to a 1948 book about British Pulp literature called Boys Will Be Boys. Scholars and other interested parties couldn't help but be captivated by the author's description of that story and so it took on a mythic, Holy Grail status the way lost films like London After Midnight often do. Jess Nevins, an authority on this subject, recently got a chance to scan the story and has posted it on-line as a free download, bless his heart. Check it out - it's a real hoot!
The character first came to my attention sometime in 2011, when I was perusing a website on Golden Age and Pulp superheroes (i.e. Doc Savage, The Shadow, The Spider). As a kid I was absolutely obsessed with great apes and was a huge fan of the original King Kong and Mighty Joe Young. I'm also a huge Western fan so the concept clicked with me instantly. I looked for the story and discovered, much to my chagrin, that not only was it out of print, it had never been reprinted and that the only two know copies in existence were under lock and key in a British museum!
But I just couldn't get that title out of my head. That afternoon I drove to my local shopping mall (listening to the Hawk the Slayer soundtrack of all things) and the story basically wrote itself. By the time I pulled into the parking lot I had the entire yarn, beginning to end. As a writer it's rare that stories emerge fully formed like that, but this was one of those times. If there was no Six-Gun Gorilla for me to read, dag nabbit, I was gonna have to write the dang thing myself!
What initially inspired me about the character was the sheer outrageous nature of the concept. The more I thought about it I realized how it would make for a great story about loss, grief, revenge and redemption. That's just how my mind works. I love taking different genres and throwing them in a blender and seeing what comes out. Of course, you can't just rely on novelty alone; you've got to have a good story populated with characters you genuinely come to care about for the thing to work.
There's something really fun about taking a gorilla and just dropping him in this familiar setting where he couldn't be more out of place. Talk about a fish out of water! Making that work is a real challenge, but holy sh-t is it a fun one. It's a balancing act. I wanted to craft a story that was played straight, but also needed to make sure that it didn't become ponderous and self-aware; that it had a sense of fun and adventure.
I see it as Tarzan flipped on its head: instead of a human raised by apes in the jungle you've got an ape raised by humans in the Old West. Tone-wise, think of the original Robocop. Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance has outrageous moments aplenty – you'd hope so, given the outrageous premise – but at its core it's a very “human” story about the things we want to do versus the things we should do.
Wait... there are TWO Six-Gun Gorilla comics!?
Despite the uber-obscure nature of the story, turns out I wasn't the only one who got the idea to do a comic book inspired by that long lost Pulp yarn.
Just as the finishing touches were being put on the first issue I got an e-mail about an article on Comic Book Resources about an upcoming comic called Six-Gun Gorilla... and it wasn't mine. Turns out I wasn't the only one to get bitten by the gunslinging gorilla bug! BOOM! Studios announced a new project, loosely based on said pulp, written by Si Spurrier and drawn by Jeff Stokely.
What were the odds of two Six-Gun Gorilla comics to coming out at the same time? I knew this was a public domain character so the possibility was always there, but that the likelihood was “slim and none”. Turns out “slim” won the day. And when did I get this news? On April Fool's Day. You can't make this stuff up!
It's a case of Hollywood refers to as “parallel development”. Both of us were fired up by that title and concept, largely I'm guessing because the actual story wasn't available to read, so our imaginations filled in one very big blank. We both knew that the character was falling into the public domain in 2013 and so we set to work on our books completely oblivious of each other.
Luckily, our stories couldn't be more different. For starters they're in two totally different genres. The BOOM! Six-Gun Gorilla is a Science-Fiction "re-imagining" (set on another planet in the 22nd Century about a televised blood sport ala The Running Man) while mine is a straight-forward, traditional Western... with a very odd twist.
I'm old enough to remember that in 1983 there were two James Bond movies that came out that same summer: one with Roger Moore and another with Sean Connery. In the end, both films ended up benefiting from the controversy and were successful, but the real winners were the fans who got to have two James Bond movies in the same year. I was hoping there would be room for two Six-Gun Gorilla comics but, alas, the major indie publishers didn't feel that way.
Despite changing the title of my book to Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance and managing to get the digital version of the first issue out a full week before the BOOM! one, the damage had been done. Despite all the glowing reviews and enthusiasm from readers, despite selling over 300 copies at the New York Comic Con, I still haven't been able to find a publisher for the book. As a result, I've had to do the comic on my own dime... hence this Kickstarter!
GOAL:
1. Finish the last four issues of the first ten issue arcs.
2. Release a graphic novel compiling all ten issues.
That's it. Couldn't be simpler.
Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance is 100% creator owned. I'm not an established industry professional that's using crowd-sourcing as a promotional platform. I'm just a guy who is making the comic book he always wanted to read. I'm off to a great start, if the critics and readers can be believed, but the the only way I can wrap this tall-tale up is with your generous assistance.
Brian Christgau - That would be me, your humble author. I live in suburban New York with my exceedingly handsome cat Figaro (aka. Mr. Figs, Mr. Handsome, Mr. Sexy, Sexecutioner). When I'm not exhuming obscure Pulp characters I volunteer at the local animal shelter, collect monster toys, practice German longsword fencing, and serve on the Board of the Rockland County Depression and Bi-Polar Support Alliance. (That's an old pic, but can you blame me? Look at that sweet Lemmy I was rocking!)
Adrián Sibar - Adrián is one of those artists who have a distinctive style but also a great deal of versatility, painting snazzy pop art canvases as well as crafting beautiful sequential art for comics like Batgirl for DC and Star Wars and Planet of the Apes for Dark Horse. Not only is he great illustrator, but he has a visual storytelling ability that is great at conveying drama and a sense of the epic. Most of all, he invests his work with the one thing I value most: heart. He's also just a genuinely good person and incredibly easy and fun to work with. He lives in beautiful Buenos Aires, Argentina. His sexy Latin accent makes him the Antonio Banderas of the team, but sorry ladies - he's taken!
Wes Huffor - Our cover artist. Wes is a Southern Californian artist best known for visceral, seductive, and pathological crime and horror storytelling. Wes started out working for small press publishers in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire. In 2011, Wes was selected by the Historic House Trust of New York to have one of his illustrations entombed in the freaking wall of the Edgar Allen Poe cottage in the Bronx. How bad-ass is that? Aside from being a very sexy man, Wes has been instrumental in helping me get Six-Gun off the ground.
Bram Meehan - Our letterer. Bram designs, writes, account manages, creative directs, and produce the materials companies and individuals need to sell their products and services. He's all you could hope for in a letterer: fast and great!
So glad you asked! Why am I asking for $15,000 to make a silly funny book? That's because I like to pay the freelancers who work for me and, guess what? They like to get paid for their work! Ain't that a sumbitch? Here's a quick breakdown:
Art: $3,000 per issue. 4 issues = $12,000
Covers: $500 per issue. 2 issues = $1,000
Lettering: $300 per issues. 4 issues = $1,200
Printing: Ballpark figure is going to about $15 - $20 dollars for each copy of the graphic novel and about $10 for each copy of the Art Book.

On his radio show Friday, conservative host Mark Levin called for the Republican Party to be completely purged of what he viewed as non-conservative figures.
He noted that Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Mike Shields recently said the party needed to distance itself from “the professional right.” The suggestion enraged Levin, who claimed the RNC was targeting grassroots activists.
“The Republican Party, the RNC, needs to be fumigated,” Levin said. “Need to get rid of all the cockroaches, clean it out, start new bottom-up top-down with conservatives. They all pretend to be conservatives, but I'm telling you folks, they hate our guts. The feeling is mutually, by the way, but they hate our guts.”
He noted two prominent Fox News personalities had recently taken positions that many conservatives viewed as hostile. Karl Rove launched an organization to defeat “unelectable” far-right candidates in Republican primary races and Bill O'Reilly described opponents of same-sex marriage as “Bible thumpers.”
“War on us,” Levin remarked. “Karl Rove, war on us. War on the ‘Bible thumpers.' War on ‘conservative hate radio.'”
He concluded by claiming that intelligent and consistent conservative arguments were always favored by the American people.

When AMD came out with CPU-support I was the last one who was enthusiastic about it, comparing it as feeding chicken-food to oxen. Now CUDA has CPU-support too, so what was I missing?
This article is a quick overview on OpenCL on CPU-extensions, but expect more to come when the Hybrid X86-Processors actually hit the market. Besides ARM also IBM already has them; also more about their POWER-architecture in an upcoming article to give them the attention they deserve.
CPU extensions
SSE/MMX started in the 90's extending the IBM-compatible X86-instruction, being able to do an add and a multiplication in one clock-tick. I still remember the discussion in my student-flat that the MP3s I could produce in only 4 minutes on my 166MHz PC just had to be of worse quality than the ones which were encoded in 15 minutes. No, the encoder I “found” on the internet made use of SSE-capabilities. Currently we have reached SSE5 (by AMD) and Intel introduced a new extension called AVX. That's a lot of abbreviations! MMX stands for “MultiMedia Extension”, SSE for “Streaming SIMD Extensions” with SIMD being “Single Instruction Multiple Data” and AVX for “Advanced Vector Extension”. This sounds actually very interesting, since we saw SIMD and Vectors op the GPU too. Let's go into SSE (1 to 4) and AVX – both fully supported on the new CPUs by AMD and Intel.
SSE – a quick(!) overview
If you look through the history of version 1 to 5, you see different names and different subsequent extensions, like “SSE 4.2a”. What's more interesting for us is where to find the “packed” instructions. Packed stands for a bundle of data, so actual parallel instructions; not massively parallel by the way. The last two letters of the instruction are important for us: Packed or Single, Precision. Precision can be Single, Double, Word, Quadword or Binary. Later (in SSSE3) packed-instructions start with a P, and SSE4 mixes both naming-conventions. So all xxxPx and many Pxxx instructions are of of interest. If you check the details of those packed instruction, you see that the single-precision have twice much input as the double; and that's why it's called “packed” and is directly the limit of SSE.
SSE has the most important instructions introduced, and is well explained by tomesani.com. SSE2 completed SSE1 for all types. SSE3 (Pentium 4 / Athlon 64) adds instructions to add and subtract the multiple values stored within a single register. SSSE3 introduces only packed instructions, such as permuting the bytes in a word, multiplying 16-bit fixed-point numbers with correct rounding, and within-word accumulate instructions. SSE4 (Core2 duo) had a two very interesting additions: “Compute eight offset sums of absolute difference” and the dot-product.
There is a lot more to read on the instruction-sets, but I leave it by this, since I'm not an expert on this. If you know a good article, just put it in the the comments.
AVX – another quick overview
AMD's SSE5 exists out of XOP, CVT16 (together AVX-like) and FMA (fused multiply-add, to be implemented by Intel later). Since AMD has said they will implement AVX too, I focus on AVX only for now. For a complete overview, see AVX on Wikipedia and Intel's AVX-page.
The instructions start with a “V” for Vector now. But how to get vectors in, while the SSE-instructions were restricted by the maximum pack-size? The answer lies in a VEX-prefix; according to Wikipedia this allows instruction codes to have up to five operands, where the original scheme allows only two operands (in rare cases three operands). It also allows the size of SIMD vector registers to be extended from the 128-bits XMM registers to 256-bits registers named YMM. There is room for further extensions of the register size in the future.
So in short, they have doubled the register-size. If we look at single precision (32 bit) and 1 core only for now, that brings us to:
X86-instructions: 2 operands
SSEx: 4 operands
AVX: 8 operands
A CPU's clock-speed is roughly 4 times higher than a GPU's, so a quad-core using AVX would give 8 x 4 x 4 = 128 GPU-cores-equivalents. That's bull would most say; I agree, but it does give an idea of its parallel potential.
Transfer times
Copying a block of memory to the GPU takes a lot of time, since the PCIe' bus-speed is limited to 8 GB/s (64 Gb/s). Now you say that DDR3 is not more than twice as fast as that, you have to know all the data has to via the CPU and thus the actual speed is of the PCIe is 4GB/s. Also there is no possibility for CPU-extras such as caching – although I haven't found clues that support the idea that OpenCL for Intel uses CPU-caching directly. You also see a lot of benchmarks of OpenCL both with and without transfer-times, like this one on Bealto where around one eighth part is consumed by transferring data.
(The following is added on 10-DEC-2010)
Maximum memory-bandwidths gives an idea of bottles&necks:
Sandy Bridge: 25.6 GByte/s (and even faster cache)
NVIDIA M2070: 150.0 GB/s
AMD HD6870: 134.4 GB/s
PCIe 2.x: 4GB/s.
Here is where architecture-optimising will make a big difference: because of the transfer to the GPU, the setup of the programming (i.e. need for batch-loading and more memory-bandwith available) the software will be totally different than one written for a a CPU.
This is actually a subject on its own, so later more on transfer-times and latency. I wanted to make a point needed for the conclusion that it takes clock-ticks to get the data to and from the GPU.
The image shows how Intel managed to get 25 speed-up of a N-body simulation on their CPU, but better benchmarks can be expected Q1 2011. Read their full presentation here.
Conclusion
I was missing the extensions for sure: they are not as parallel as GPUs, but there is clearly more parallel going on in a CPU than parallel memory-buses and multiple cores. So what are the big advantage for using OpenCL on a CPU?
The results are on the CPU for further processing
CPU-code can be mixed with OpenCL – this means extra optimisation-potential when OpenCL-code is compiled
Specific algorithms can be processed faster because there is no PCIe-overhead
We still have the GPU
We saw the first two items of the list on the discussion-boards when mixing OpenCL with OpenGL was discussed. When interoperability with OpenGL-code is important, then OpenCL-on-the-CPU might not be the best strategy – as mixing with CPU-code processing on the GPU might not be the best strategy.
The performance of an embedded OpenCL-capable GPU on a CPU might be placed between AVX and a separate high-end GPU, but overlaps mostly with AVX and therefore the current focus on AVX is a logical decision. The first benchmarks of OpenCL-on-SSEx now come in, but for interesting results we have to wait until the launch of Intel Sandy Bridge in a few weeks.
For sure we can open up al thrown away projects where the PCIe-overhead was an issue.
A Zen Master Explains Life and Death to a Child and Outlines the Three Essential Principles of Zen Mind
If death is so enormous a mystery that we remain unable to wrap our grownup minds around it, despite comfort from our great poets and consolation from our great philosophers, how are tiny humans to make sense of it all? Although there exist some exceptional children's books about loss and grief, explaining death to a child remains one of the most challenging tasks for a human being to undertake.
Because the language of Zen, holding great complexity of experience in great simplicity of expression, is so organically suited to the child — children, after all, have a way of leaning their minds toward the profound by way of the simple — it is perhaps the best language we have in offering a befitting explanation, as much to ourselves as to our young ones.
That's what the great Korean-born Zen teacher Seung Sahn Soen-sa (August 1, 1927–November 30, 2004) offers in one of the chapters in Dropping Ashes on the Buddha: The Teachings of Zen Master Seung Sahn (public library) — a tiny treasure of a book originally published in 1976, irreverent yet immensely spiritually invigorating, collecting his correspondence and conversations with Zen students in the West.
Soen-sa recounts his conversation with Gita, the seven-year-old daughter of one of his students at the Cambridge Zen Center, after the death of the center's beloved cat, cleverly named Katz. (“KATZ!” is the transcription of the famous Buddhist belly-shout, used as a way of focusing energy and intention during Zen practice.) Katz had died after a long illness and was given a traditional Buddhist burial, but the little girl remained troubled by his death. One day after practice, she came to the great Zen teacher for an explanation. He relays the exchange:
“What happened to Katzie? Where did he go?” Soen-sa said, “Where do you come from?” “From my mother's belly.” “Where does your mother come from?” Gita was silent. Soen-sa said, “Everything in the world comes from the same one thing. It is like in a cookie factory. Many different kinds of cookies are made — lions, tigers, elephants, houses, people. They all have different shapes and different names, but they are all made from the same dough and they all taste the same. So all the different things that you see — a cat, a person, a tree, the sun, this floor — all these things are really the same.” “What are they?”
With an eye to our tendency to mistake a thing's name for its thingness, Soen-sa answers by urging the little girl to contact the universal life-force of the metaphorical cookie dough:
“People give them many different names. But in themselves, they have no names. When you are thinking, all things have different names and different shapes. But when you are not thinking, all things are the same. There are no words for them. People make the words. A cat doesn't say, ‘I am a cat.' People say, ‘This is a cat.' The sun doesn't say, ‘My name is sun.' People say, ‘This is the sun.' So when someone asks you, ‘What is this?', how should you answer?” “I shouldn't use words.” Soen-sa said, “Very good! You shouldn't use words. So if someone asks you, ‘What is Buddha?', what would be a good answer?” Gita was silent. Soen-sa said, “Now you ask me.” “What is Buddha?” Soen-sa hit the floor. Gita laughed. Soen-sa said, “Now I ask you: What is Buddha?” Gita hit the floor. “What is God?” Gita hit the floor. “What is your mother?” Gita hit the floor. “What are you?” Gita hit the floor. “Very good! This is what all things in the world are made of. You and Buddha and God and your mother and the whole world are the same.” Gita smiled. Soen-sa said, “Do you have any more questions?” “You still haven't told me where Katz went.” Soen-sa leaned over, looked into her eyes, and said, “You already understand.” Gita said, “Oh!” and hit the floor very hard. Then she laughed.
Soen-sa ends the anecdote with an exchange intended to be funny, but in fact a tragic testament to contemporary Western education being a force of industrialized specialization, deliberately fragmenting the unity of all things and deconditioning our inner wholeness:
As she was opening the door, she turned to Soen-sa and said, “But I'm not going to answer that way when I'm in school. I'm going to give regular answers!” Soen-sa laughed.
In another section of the book, Soen-sa examines the principles and practices that help us cultivate the pre-thinking mind necessary for truly tasting the metaphorical cookie dough of the universal life-force. Responding to a letter from a Zen beginner, a young woman named Patricia who had trouble grasping the value and very notion of “don't-know mind,” he writes:
Throw away all opinions, all likes and dislikes, and only keep the mind that doesn't know… Your before-thinking mind, my before-thinking mind, all people's before-thinking minds are the same. This is your substance. Your substance, my substance, and the substance of the whole universe become one. So the tree, the mountain, the cloud, and you become one… The mind that becomes one with the universe is before thinking. Before thinking there are no words. “Same” and “different” are opposites words; they are from the mind that separates all things.
A few months later, in another letter to Patricia, he explores the three pillars of Zen's don't-know mind:
Zen practice … requires great faith, great courage, and great questioning. What is great faith? Great faith means that at all times you keep the mind which decided to practice, no matter what. It is like a hen sitting on her eggs. She sits on them constantly, caring for them and giving them warmth, so that they will hatch. If she becomes careless or negligent, the eggs will not hatch and become chicks. So Zen mind means always and everywhere believing in myself… Great courage … means bringing all your energy to one point. It is like a cat hunting a mouse. The mouse has retreated into its hole, but the cat waits outside the hole for hours on end without the slightest movement. It is totally concentrated on the mouse-hole.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A mother filed suit against a Lakewood police officer who broke her 17-year-old daughter's jaw in November as he wrestled the girl out of a branch of the Lakewood Public Library.
Sabrina Robinson alleged in the lawsuit that Lakewood officer Kevin Jones used excessive force and violated the teen's civil rights when he grabbed her, shoved her into a book cart, put her in a full nelson headlock and kicked her out of the library's Madison Branch, all without provocation.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, also alleges that the city of Lakewood failed to train its officers how to treat children with dignity and respect, and that Jones and other officers failed to provide medical care to the girl as she lay bleeding on the front steps of the library.
"As parents, we expect that our children will be safe at a public library and that library employees will protect them from violence, not attack them," attorney Subodh Chandra, who filed the suit on behalf of the mother, said in a news release.
The encounter was captured by surveillance cameras inside the library and partially by Jones' body camera.
Update: Lakewood police respond to lawsuit
Jones was moonlighting in uniform at the library, where the girl and her 11-year-old brother were regular visitors, the complaint says.
The girl was listening to music on her cellphone with her headphones and Jones told her to turn it down, the complaint says. She moved and sat with her brother in a seating area inside the library and started watching videos on a laptop, sharing a pair of headphones, the complaint says.
Jones approached them and told the girl to get her feet off a chair, the lawsuit says. The girl complied. The surveillance video showed Jones and the girl continued to trade words, until he walked back to her, stood over top of her and told the girl to leave the library, the lawsuit says. The girl stood up, and, when Jones didn't move, she said, "excuse me," the lawsuit says. Jones then grabbed her by the neck and shoved her toward the library's front door, the suit says.
He shoved the girl into a rolling book cart next to the counter and she fell to the floor. Jones then put the girl in a full nelson, squeezing his arms around her armpits from behind forcing her arms into the air, the video showed.
He wrestled her out into the lobby and fell on top of the girl. She landed face-first with all of his weight on her, and the impact snapped her jaw, the lawsuit says.
He dragged her out to the front of the steps and waited for responding officers to arrive.
Blood dripped from her jaw onto the concrete steps, and Jones later used a bottle of water to rinse off the blood.
Jones and the other officers refused to call for an ambulance, the lawsuit says. Instead, they joked about clocking out early, and one officer told the girl to spit blood in the grass instead of on the concrete, the lawsuit says.
The girl was eventually taken to the Cleveland Clinic Lakewood Emergency Department, where doctors reset her jaw, the suit says.
Jones told Robinson that the girl was "mouthing off" to him, and refused to leave despite his orders, the suit says.
The girl's brother watched the entire encounter and followed the officer out for he building and waited by his injured sister.
The incident left the children too afraid to return to the library, which they frequented, the lawsuit says.
An internal investigation into the incident found that Jones used excessive force, and that he should have de-escalated the situation and called for back-up before touching the girl, and that he violated the department's use-of-force policy, according to the lawsuit. The report recommended internal charges.
Jones remains on the force, the lawsuit says.
Lakewood police spokesman Capt. Ed Hassing was not immediately available to comment.

For years, American companies have been saving money by “offshoring” jobs — hiring people in India and other distant cubicle farms.
Today, some of those jobs are being outsourced again — in the United States.
Nexient, a software outsourcing company, reflects the evolving geography of technology work. It holds daily video meetings with one of its clients, Bill.com, where team members stand up and say into the camera what they accomplished yesterday for Bill.com, and what they plan to do tomorrow. The difference is, they are phoning in from Michigan, not Mumbai.
“It's the first time we've been happy outsourcing,” said René Lacerte, the chief executive of Bill.com, a bill payment-and-collection service based in Palo Alto, Calif.
Nexient is a domestic outsourcer, a flourishing niche in the tech world as some American companies pull back from the idea of hiring programmers a world away.
When dry shampoo hit the mass market women went crazy.
Finally, there was a magical elixir to prolong blowouts and keep hair looking and smelling fresh between washes. It was a key to emancipation allowing users to skip the lather, rinse and repeat routine for one more day because contrary to popular belief, "I can't. I have to wash my hair tonight" is actually a thing.

Beauty enthusiasts just might find the same relief.
Cosmetic company Sephora has plans to release an instant cleaning spray specifically for makeup brushes.

Cleaning beauty tools is a lot of work for the average makeup wearer, let alone a professional who has cases full of products and applicators.
“Brushes should be washed once a month with a mild non-greasy shampoo," NARS Lead Makeup Stylist Jake Broullard told Mashable. "I recommend baby shampoo because it is mild and doesn't leave a residue. To wash your brushes, simply hold them horizontally only allowing the bristles to get wet. Massage a small amount of shampoo into the bristles and rinse. Wring out and reform the brush hairs to the shape of the brush and lay them flat overnight to dry."
Using a brush spray cuts that process in half.
While brands like Sonia Kashuk, Ulta and Sephora already offer similar cleansers, according to Allure, Sephora Collection's new Dry Clean Instant Dry Brush Cleaner Spray promises to be a miracle product.
Users simply pump the mist directly onto the dirty brush head then rub or blot the bristles on a clean tissue to watch the makeup swipe right off.
Powders dissolve effortlessly while cream-based residue requires slightly more elbow grease.
This is wonderful news for those who dread spending hours properly sanitizing a kit full of brushes. And for those of you who didn't even realize you should be cleaning your beauty tools, this will be an easy way to start.
Sprays might not provide the thorough, deep clean you get with soap and water, but like dry shampoo they provide temporary solutions between washes.
Sephora's newest brush spray will be available for $14 in stores and online in April.

Putting Your Spouse Before Your Parents
09/05/2013
Many married couples have trouble with the question of who comes first, your spouse or your parents? The answer is your spouse – that's your first obligation. When you get married, you leave your parents. It doesn't mean you don't talk to them any more (unless they're horrible), but you have to cater to the new dynamic. You're going to have a much stronger marriage if you become a loyal husband or wife.
Here are some of the things I hear all the time from callers on my show:
"I just don't have the courage to say ‘no' to my parents."
"I don't have a problem saying ‘no' to my spouse, but I can't say ‘no' to my parents.”
"My parent did nothing wrong, my spouse is overreacting."
I want to discuss how to put your spouse before your parents, and particularly, how to stop your parents from ruining your relationship. But first, let me ask you a few questions:
Does your husband or wife get upset when your parents drop by uninvited?
Is your spouse bothered by the fact that your mother calls constantly at all hours, day and night?
Do you pressure your husband or wife to spend vacations with your parents because your parents want you to?
Do you listen to your Mommy or Daddy gossip about your mate?
Guys, do you accuse your wife of overeating when she complains about something your parents said?
Ladies, do you consistently turn to your father for advice instead of your husband?
If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then you're caught in a classic parent-spouse tug-of-war: “I want to please my parents. No wait, my spouse. No, my parents. No, my spouse…”
But don't panic quite yet – I have some good news. Ready?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO PLEASE EVERYONE!
The choice between your spouse and parents was already made when you took your vows. Your vows trump everything, even your neurotic attachment to your parents or your wussyhood in dealing with their over-controlling nature. You have to focus on making your spouse your first priority, no matter how much it pisses off your mom or dad.
Here are 9 of the most common things your parents might be doing to interfere with your marriage and how you can deal with them:
1. They're too intrusive. They always have to know everything about what's going on. They show up uninvited and/or overstay their welcome.
How to deal: Set some rules and set them fast. Talk to your parents about visits and say that they have to call first because “we might be in the middle of sex in the living room and we don't want to be interrupted” (when you say things like that, parents hear you loud and clear). Tell them that you love them, but if they don't call in advance, the door will not open unless it's an emergency or somebody just died. Saying this might hurt their feelings, but it's required.
2. They assume that since you came from them, you're going to do exactly what they did. Houses, finances, kids, clothes, vacations – whatever it is, your parents expect you to do things exactly the way they did.
How to deal: A marriage brings together two people with two sets of genes, behaviors, family dynamics, and ways of doing things. Tell your parents that you appreciate their input and viewpoints, but you've made your own decision. Say you expect that someday your kids are going to tick you off too when they make their own decisions (a good joke thrown in is always helpful).
3. Your parents try to do everything for you. They shower you with a car or a vacation (of course, the car is the one they picked out and the vacation is with them.)
How to deal: If you don't have a lot of money, it seems like fun to have your parents pay for you, but there are always strings attached. You become dependent on them, which means that you and your spouse are not two adults joined together as one. Tell your parents no gifts over $100. It may take you longer to save for your house or you may be staying at home for your vacation instead of going to Hawaii, but you'll have more pride in yourself and your spouse.
4. They bad-mouth your spouse.
How to deal: Explain to your parents that you don't want to hear it and that you won't be talking to them if they don't stop. You married your spouse, not them, and if you're happy, then that's what matters.
5. They criticize your lifestyle. From how far away you live to how you spend your money, it's constant condemnation.
How to deal: Stand by your choices and your spouse. You must live your life your way. NEVER side with your parents against your spouse, and don't carry their criticisms home with you. Don't tell your spouse it went down, just deal with it.
6. They make a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe you picked your sister-in-law's wedding over the annual family reunion and now your parents are mad.
How to deal: Gently remind them that you have two families now and that there is going to be triage (in this case, the one-time wedding takes precedence over the annual reunion).
7. They set a bad example. Your mother has been divorced four times, or your dad is cheap beyond repair.
How to deal: You can't fix your parents or the past, so don't bother trying. Instead, put your energy into not picking up their bad habits.
8. They don't want to share. You have to be there for every birthday and holiday because that's the tradition.
How to deal: Parents usually expect all holidays and family celebrations to remain the same even after you get married. However, you need to tell them that you have a new family, which means new traditions.
9. They ignore the rules you have for your kids. They load your kids up with gummy bears or worms, and let them stay up until 2 in the morning when you've said “no” (and when they never let YOU do it when you were a kid).
How to deal: Don't fight, just lay down the law. Limit your parents to short periods of time if they don't follow the rules, or make sure you're there. Minimize the time that they can do damage.
Now, what happens if it's your spouse's parents who are rubbing you the wrong way?
How to deal: Talk to your spouse. Say, "I don't know why I have such a bone to pick with your parents, but I can't stand it when your mother or father does ______." Usually, your spouse will respond, "I know, I grew up with that." By having an honest conversation instead of attacking them, you can become a team in learning to deal with it.
Everything was going great on Sunday evening. My wife was having dinner with friends, my newborn was sleeping soundly, and I was sprinting toward the end of Quantum Break, the latest game from Max Payne and Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment. It's a flawed game but an enjoyable one. Yet everything ground to a halt during the game's final boss, an infuriating sequence that left an awful taste in my mouth.
Quantum Break is not a difficult game; it's a goofy playground for messing up soldiers with your absurd time-travel powers. Then, out of nowhere, with the end credits in sight, the game decides it's time to become something that pushes your skills to the edge. Actually, that's giving the game too much credit; if it really was about testing your skills, it might have been fun. It's just a bad, poorly designed boss battle, where the enemy's capable of wiping you out with a single hit, often out of nowhere and without giving you a chance to save yourself.
And it'd be one thing if the final boss was merely difficult, but each time you die, the game forces you to skip a cutscene and sit through a loading screen before the fight can begin again.
Sigh.
I quickly started having flashbacks to the many games with questionable final bosses: the weird human baby robot thing in Mass Effect 2, Naughty Dog's obsession with shoving QTE bits into their climactic fights, and whatever the hell was at the end of the original Half-Life.

The quality of a game is not defined by its final minutes, but it's hard to remember that in the moment. It's far easier to focus on the burning emotions you're feeling, like the one that was compelling me to throw a controller at the wall because, you know what, maybe the wall would have better luck beating the boss. In the span of 30 minutes, the hours of entertainment that had leaded me to Quantum Break's conclusion were being muddled by a flash of frustration.
By all accounts, Quantum Break had a bumpy and protracted development. That might explain why the quirky final boss seems to come out of nowhere. It might also be the case that ending a video game is hard, and developers get it wrong all the time. You probably don't remember the final boss of BioShock, for example, because fighting against a weird statue dude hopping around the room has been collectively banished from our memories. Even BioShock designer Ken Levine admitted they didn't stick the landing.
"It's terrible," he told Glixel in an interview recently. "You have this great game, and then you end up fighting this giant nude dude. We didn't have a better idea."
Games have long struggled with how to end, and the growing importance of stories has complicated things. In the past, final battles were the ultimate trial for everything the game had been teaching you, an endurance run that let the player pull out all his or her tricks. Most bosses would go through multiple forms, never seeming to die. In BioShock and Quantum Break, you get the sense designers felt obligated to include a closing battle because that's what video games have always done, not because their game (or story) demanded it.
Look, I still had a great time with Quantum Break. I'd still recommend you play it, even if it's not quite as good as their other games. When you find this boss, if you feel yourself reaching for the button to turn off your Xbox or PC, take a deep breath and... maybe watch the ending on YouTube? You've made it that far, and it's not your fault the last few minutes of the game leave something to be desired.

Level 18 : Journeyman Crafter
Despite what the game version says, the download folder actually comes with two separate .zips for 1.8 and 1.9+, and the 1.9 pack doesn't have the glitch where the inventory-crafting square is unaligned.
So, SN0CONE (and yes, there is a zero between the N and the C) is a little side-project I've been working on for the past few months. I'm not nearly done, but I try and add new textures whenever I can. If there's anything serious that I've missed, please comment them. Thanks!
edit: Just to be clear, do not directly download the folder and shove it into your resourcepacks folder.Open the download file and then put "SN0CONE [1.8]" and/or "SN0CONE [1.9+]" into your rp folder.

Here's what happened on the last episode of “ Game Of Thrones ”:
While the president has been urging “insourcing,” the government has been sending money to the Philippines to train foreign workers for jobs in English-speaking call centers.
According to New York Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop and North Carolina Republican Rep. Walter Jones, this is unacceptable and “shocking.”
The pair is calling on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to immediately suspend what is known as the Job Enabling English Proficiency (JEEP) program.
According to Jones' office, in 2010, after the two men compelled USAID to end a similar training program in Sri Lanka, the agency assured the congressmen that they would “conduct a review to ensure the project will not take any jobs away from Americans.”
In a letter to the USAID administrator, Rajiv Shah, Bishop and Jones expressed their displeasure at learning of the effort they thought the agency had explicitly promised against.
“I believe it was reasonable to conclude from that statement that your agency's outsourcing training program was terminated, particularly in light of President Obama's ‘insourcing' initiative announced earlier this year,” the pair wrote. “Therefore, I was shocked to learn that USAID has used taxpayer dollars to invest in outsourcing training programs in the Philippines at the expense of American workers.”.
According to Bishop, more than 4.5 million Americans currently work in call centers, but since 2007 more than 500,000 call center jobs have been outsourced to foreign countries.
Information Week broke the story about the JEEP program this week. According to Information Week, the program is part of the Growth and Equity in Mindanao (GEM) initiative, which costs $100 million annually.
“The JEEP program was developed to promote peace and stability in Mindanao by teaching English to youth in conflict-prone areas to help them pursue gainful employment in tourism, nursing and other locally-based industries and to break the cycle of violence which had gripped that region of the Philippines,” a USAID spokesperson told Information Week, adding that it is set to expire at the end of the year.
The congressmen want it gone yesterday.
“Using Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars to fund the training of foreign nationals to take our jobs is absolutely crazy and totally unacceptable,” Jones said in a statement. “Uncle Sam is over $15 trillion in debt and unemployment is still elevated because of policies like this, and it's got to stop.”
The pair pledged in their letter to “use every legislative option available to permanently prohibit USAID from engaging in such practices in the future.”
“I support the international development mission of USAID but my top priority is protecting American jobs and American taxpayers,” Bishop concluded. “I anticipate working closely with USAID in a bipartisan manner to ensure that none of its programs overseas will hurt workers here at home.”

From January 1 to July 9, Chiang Mai had 761 dengue fever patients, with the average prevalence rate of 40.77 per 100,000 population.
The province is ranked 17th in the nation in terms of the number of dengue patients, and third (following Nan and Mae Hong Son) in Public Health Region 1, Dr Waranyu Jamnongprasartporn said.
So far a 75-year-old man in Fang district was confirmed to have succumbed to the disease, while the deaths of a 22-year-old man in Doi Tao and a 10-year-old girl in Muang district were still being investigated through lab tests, he said.
Among Chiang Mai's 23 districts, the five with the highest prevalence rates were Chom Thong (144.26 per 100,000 population), Wiang Haeng (115.46 per 100,000), Mae Ai (107.61), Doi Lor (65.31) and Mae Wang (49.07), he said. Only Samoeng and Kalayaniwattana districts had no reports of dengue fever patients.

I'm being mean to Google because there's no way their Chrome team is happy with this extension vetting/moderation situation. — SwiftOnSecurity (@SwiftOnSecurity) October 9, 2017
SwiftOnSecurity says the fake extension was created by a "fraudulent developer who clones popular name and spams keywords." Indeed, it's pretty hard to tell that it's fake, since its developer's name is "Adblock Plus," and it has a considerable number of reviews.
According to one of the fake Adblock's reviewers, he started getting invasive ads that open lots of tabs after he installed it. Unfortunately, it's unclear what else it can do or if it has even more detrimental effects that we still don't know of. We asked Google if it has unearthed anything about the fraudulent extension, but even if we never hear back, it may be best to re-install Adblock Plus if you notice getting random ads after downloading it.
In his glory years with the Cardinals, Albert Pujols had few leaguemates he could truly call peers. In his first few seasons, there was Barry Bonds, then there was Pujols, followed by the rest of the league. When Bonds left the game, Pujols vied for hardware with the likes of Ryan Howard, Lance Berkman, Carlos Beltran, and Prince Fielder. By 2009 he was the undisputed best player in baseball, taking home his second straight MVP award and leaving even stars like Chase Utley, Hanley Ramirez, and Miguel Cabrera in the dust.
Pujols keeps different company these days. On a park- and league-adjusted basis, his 2013 numbers are in line with those put up by Michael Brantley and Yunel Escobar. He's 33 years old and in his third straight year of sharp decline, with more than eight years and $220 million left on his contract and full no-trade protection. He's been a replacement-level player through his first 63 games this season, one of the biggest reasons the Angels own the second-worst record in the American League.
Have we seen the last of Albert Pujols, baseball superstar? And if we have, what could that mean for the future of gigantic free-agent contracts?
This season, Pujols is hitting just .242/.314/.418. An optimist might point out that Pujols started slowly last year. On May 14, 2012, he was hitting .197/.235/.275; he hit .312/.374/.589 the rest of the season, not quite at peak levels but still a strong enough line to rank among the league's best players, if projected over a full season. Pujols hasn't started as slowly this year. But it's four weeks later in the calendar than it was when last year's struggles started to turn for the better, and we're still waiting for Pujols to come alive.
When talking about his woes, you have to start with injuries. Pujols hasn't actually missed much time for any of them. But there's evidence — even if it's circumstantial — to suggest that health setbacks have eroded his skill set. Though Pujols played in 154 games last year, Baseball Prospectus's injury tracker lists four distinct maladies on his ledger for 2012. On July 18, he was diagnosed with left foot soreness. A week later, it was an elbow contusion. Four weeks after that, a lower leg strain. Finally, at season's end, Pujols had right knee surgery, described as a relatively minor cleanout.
Though he missed only that handful of games, observers frequently discussed the effects of the foot and leg injuries in particular, noting that Pujols didn't look like the player he once was. Did the foot and leg injuries affect, say, Pujols's ability to plant and stride at the plate? That was tough to prove one way or another. But you could draw a more direct link between those injuries, and a severe downturn in Pujols's mobility. FanGraphs tracks a stat called Baserunning Runs above average, which measures everything from stolen bases and times caught stealing to a runner's ability to take extra bases. Once a solidly above-average base runner, Pujols had by far the worst year of his career on the basepaths in 2012, costing his team nearly six runs. Pujols's lower-body injuries have mounted this year, further eating into his once-impressive mobility. He's battled plantar fasciitis in his left foot since the spring, then reported right knee soreness on May 18. Those ailments haven't knocked him out of the lineup. But at the risk of overreacting to a smallish sample size, they have put him on pace to post his worst defensive season (by advanced stats) in more than a decade, with another negative performance running the bases.
Of course most of that's small beer. Pujols at his peak had a fine reputation as a solid first baseman who moved well for a big man. But the Angels obviously signed him primarily for his bat. That bat has gone from an instrument of death to … whatever it is that Michael Brantley uses.
We have plenty of tools to tell us how that's come to pass. For starters, Pujols is hitting for less pop than ever before, posting a career-low Isolated Power (slugging percentage minus batting average) mark of .176. One out of every nine of his fly balls have gone for home runs, by far the lowest result of his career. He's swinging more often than ever before, swinging at more pitches outside the strike zone than ever before, and swinging and missing more than ever before.
ESPN Stats & Info offers further insight. Turns out Pujols can't lay off breaking balls out of the zone anymore.
Albert Pujols vs. Curveballs/Sliders 2009-11 2012-13 Chase rate 25% 32% Miss rate 23% 27% Swing rate 39% 44% Slug pct. .487 .351 AB per HR 17.6 30.3
There's more. Pujols used to crush hanging breaking balls, but he's not doing that anymore.
These two heat maps show his batting average against curves and sliders. The first map shows Pujols crushing breaking pitches up in the zone from 2009 through 2011. The second one shows how limited his success has been against curves and sliders since, with the only remaining hot zone being middle-in.
Even if we have the how, the why remains uncertain. We have too big a sample at this point to shrug it off as random chance. So you could argue that those injuries have dragged him down. Or it could simply be the inevitable burden of age. Position players typically peak in their mid-to-late twenties. Pujols celebrated his 33rd birthday on January 16, so what we could be seeing is his age manifesting itself in slower bat speed, which in turn could be causing his higher swing rate and maybe even frustrating him into chasing more pitches out of the zone. Having this precipitous a decline happen this quickly might seem unusual. But the smart money was on some kind of downturn, given what aging has done to even the best hitters of previous generations. You can call that the result of a body's natural deterioration, or be cynical and wonder if players get a bit complacent after signing a monster contract after age 30 — maybe both. Whatever the case, we have enough data to suggest that Pujols has won his last MVP, and that he might never again rank among the game's elite.
Which brings us to the bigger question: With Pujols (and Josh Hamilton) looking like colossal busts, will teams rethink spending nine figures for over-30 sluggers?
For some perspective, consider a larger list of $100 million–plus players. There have been 11 contracts of $100 million or more handed out to players over 30 years old, with Pujols getting the 10th. As the table below suggests, only three of them could be considered any kind of success: Jason Giambi to the Yankees in 2002, Matt Holliday to the Cardinals in 2009, and Cliff Lee to the Phillies in 2010.
$100 Million Contracts to Players Over 30 (Avg. WAR Per Season) Player Before After (Includes 2013 season) Kevin Brown 4.6 3.3 Mike Hampton 3.2 0.3 Jason Giambi 4.7 1.9 Alfonso Soriano 3.3 1.1 Carlos Lee 2.5 1.3 Alex Rodriguez 7.9 4.2 Matt Holliday 3.9 3.9 Jayson Werth 3.4 0.7 Cliff Lee 3.0 5.5 Albert Pujols 7.9 3.0 Josh Hamilton 4.1 -0.1
Four of the first five contracts on this list have expired, with only Giambi finishing out his deal with the team that signed him. Soriano's expires after the 2014 this season and he's still with the Cubs, providing a small fraction of the value that he did while in his prime. Of course none of those players convinced Angels owner Arte Moreno not to drop $240 million (or more, counting incentives) on Pujols, and another $125 million over five years on Hamilton. I don't see these latest busts dramatically changing future free-agent bidding, either.
First, consider the money that's streaming into the industry now. Major League Baseball is set to become a $9 billion industry in 2014, buoyed by a passel of increasingly lucrative local TV deals and a national television contract that'll double every team's take, dropping an extra $25 million into each team's kitty. Owners can use that money however they see fit, whether it's on capital improvements for their ballparks or just buying bigger yachts. But at least a portion of those funds will inevitably be used on player contracts. The cost of one Win Above Replacement on the open market now sits at around $6 million; if a two-win player is considered average, we can and should expect teams to shell out eight figures a year for merely decent talent, as we've already seen this past offseason with the signing of Shane Victorino and similar players at those prices.
Beyond mere dollars per WAR projections, though, consider who makes the final call on deals of this magnitude. When the Tigers signed Prince Fielder to a nine-year, $214 million deal in January 2012, this wasn't some cold, calculating deal by highly analytical general manager Dave Dombrowski. Instead, this was the will of Mike Ilitch, the then-82-year-old Tigers owner who told Dombrowski in no uncertain terms to get the big, slugging first baseman, because he wanted a fresh World Series ring before he moved on to the next life. Likewise, multiple reports pegged the Pujols and Hamilton signings as having Angels owner Moreno's fingerprints all over them. Maybe Moreno didn't have the same clock ticking against him when he had his own GM pull the trigger. But when you can lure 4,200 people to Angel Stadium in the middle of December just to catch a glimpse of Pujols (and $77.5 million signee C.J. Wilson) standing at a podium, that's going to sway the owner's decision. We've been talking about teams overpaying for talent since free agency's advent in the '70s. We've got decades of aging-curve data to tell how most long-term, big-money deals for over-30 players will fail. Yet whether it's trigger-happy GMs or jewelry-seeking owners, someone inevitably steps forward with a jaw-dropping offer. They might regret it down the road, but that's never done anything to curb future mistakes by other teams.
If there's any enduring lesson from Pujols's increasingly scary-looking contract, it's that teams would do well to build farm systems so flush with talent that those teams don't need to even consider breaking the bank for aging stars who'll likely disappoint. When the Cardinals let Pujols go two winters ago, plenty of fans and local media members wrung their hands over the departure of the franchise's best hitter since Stan Musial. Today the Cards don't simply have an adequate replacement for Pujols. They've got too many options, with 24-year-old slugging first baseman Matt Adams unable to secure an everyday job, and perhaps the best hitting prospect in the game (Oscar Taveras) forced to cool his heels in the minors.
So if you want to avoid making a $240 million mistake you'll regret for a decade, the answer's simple: Assemble a bottomless well of homegrown talent and hire a GM with enough clout to talk his billionaire boss out of doing anything rash. Piece of cake.

While Time magazine recently chose President-Elect Donald Trump as its Person of the Year, CRISPR gene editing pioneers were a runner-up choice. Few innovations in the last millennium carry such transformative prospects as the ability to edit our own genome and make ourselves into fundamentally something else. Some experts think genetic editing might be the key to curing all disease and achieving perfect health.
Unlike other epic scientific advances—like the 1945 explosion of the first atomic bomb in New Mexico—the immediate effect of genetic editing technology is not dangerous. Yet, it stands to be just as divisive to humans as the 70-year proliferation of nuclear weaponry. On one hand, you have secular-minded China and its scientists leading the gene editing revolution, openly modifying the human genome in hopes of improving the human being. On the other hand, you have a soon-to-be broadly Republican US administration and Congress that appear to be strongly Christian—conservatives who often insist humans should remain just as God created them.
The immediate effect of genetic editing technology is not dangerous. Yet, it stands to be just as divisive to humans as the 70-year proliferation of nuclear weaponry.
Therein lies a great coming conflict, one that I'm sure will lead to street protests, riots, and civil strife—the kind described explicitly in my novel The Transhumanist Wager, where a religious-fundamentalist government shuts down extreme science in the name of conservatism. The playing field of geopolitics is pretty simple: If China or another country vows to increase its children's intelligence via genetic editing (which I estimate they will be able to do in 5-10 years time), and America chooses to remain "au naturel" because they insist that's how God made them, a conflict species-deep will quickly arise. If this scenario seems too bizarre to happen, just consider the Russian Olympic track and field team that was banned in the recent 2016 Games for supposed doping.
It's quite possible the same accusatory flavor of "banning" could happen between China and America in the game of life—between its workers, its politicians, is people, its artists, and its media. I wonder if America—approximately 70 percent who identify as Christians—will put up with beings who modified themselves by science to be smarter and more functional entities.
This type of idea takes racism and immigration to a whole new level. Will America close off its borders, its jobs, its schools, and its general openness to the world to stay pure, old-fashioned human? Will we stop trading, befriending, and even starting families with those who are modified?
In short, will genetic editing start a new cold war? One that bears much finger pointing and verbal reprimands, including the use of derogatory terms like mutants, cyborgs, and transhumanists. Think the videogame Dues Ex, but with modified people taking all the best jobs.
So, now that we know what can happen if America won't embrace the most important science to emerge this century, how can we avoid it?
First—and this is wishful thinking, since 100 percent of the US Congress and the Supreme Court appear to be religious at the moment—is we could just embrace genetic editing and be better at it than the Chinese. This is the exact scenario I suggest. Yes, it will lead to a place where beings are similar to those in Star Wars and Star Trek, but after all, we love those movies because we want to reach that super-science age. And in the long run, such evolution of the species is inevitable anyway, so long as we don't kill ourselves first in a nuclear war or an environmental catastrophe.
In a second scenario, America could focus more on technology and less on biology and genetics. On my recent 4-month long Immortality Bus tour across America, I found conservative people seem more inclined to use tech accessories or wear a special headset that would make them smarter (for example, by connecting their thoughts Matrix-style into the cloud and AI)—as opposed to structurally changing their brains, as the Chinese likely will do. America could innovate that accessory tech that would keep us ahead of the biological modifications of other nations. I'll accept that—reluctantly—if the first scenario I presented is a no-go.
A third way—and this is the blatant transhumanist nightmare—is we could establish a non-modification policy across all countries, similar to how we have created the Paris Treaty for climate change or rules of war that ban chemical weapons. The major nations of the world, sensing a significant global legal issue in genetic editing, could come together as a species and criminalize the science.

To some extent, this has already happened, because as soon as the world realized the Chinese had experimented on the human genome, calls were made to put a stop on some of this science. Such a reaction is not dissimilar from what George W. Bush did with stem cells when his religious values made him shut down federal funding on all but a tiny portion of the research in America. Stem cells have since been shown to be one of the most important medical applications in the world, and those lost years of science have potentially negatively affected millions of lives.
Sadly, the third option of a general or even partial moratorium on genetic editing will surely harm innovation. The great thing with gene editing is we can likely do many wondrous things with it, such as potentially cure cancer, halt aging, grow better organs, and overcome disability by better repairing ourselves. Beyond making ourselves superhuman, we can simply make ourselves better fit for Earth, including dealing with a changing environment.
I also don't think the third option will work in the long run. More than ever, science is the hands of individuals, who can buy amazing bio-testing kits on eBay for just a $1000—as well as incredibly powerful computers to analyze the data. Citizen scientists would just create the new gene editing tech and begin doing it themselves—perhaps more dangerously had the government not been overseeing the research from the start.
I argue for the first path. Let's allow good, old-fashioned scientific competition with China to proceed. Let's see which country can create the best enhancements for their citizenry, and let's share the best of our work with one another in the end to make it so all peoples are as equal as possible. If we're too closed-minded about such radical science, we might find ourselves embroiled in a state of hostile speciation, where another new cold war swallows a generation.

The Justice Department strongly disputed any suggestion that Holder misled Congress. Smith wants Holder inquiry
After new documents suggested Attorney General Eric Holder may have contradicted himself over comments about the Fast and Furious gun program, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) called on President Barack Obama to appoint a special counsel to determine if Holder lied to Congress.
“I write to urge you to instruct the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to determine whether Members of Congress were misled by the Attorney General during his recent testimony before the House Judiciary Committee,” wrote Smith, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday.
Story Continued Below
“Allegations that senior Justice Department officials may have intentionally misled Members of Congress are extremely troubling and must be addressed by an independent and objective special counsel. I urge you to appoint a special counsel who will investigate these allegations as soon as possible,” Smith added.
Documents released on Monday suggest that Holder knew about the Fast and Furious gun program well before he told Congress in testimony that he had first become aware of it.
The documents include a memo to Holder from Michael F. Walter, director of the National Drug Intelligence Center, dated July 5, 2010, that mentions Fast and Furious.
But in May 2011, Holder told the House Judiciary Committee that he had only recently learned about Fast and Furious.
“When did you first know about the program, officially known as Fast and Furious?” asked Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
“I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks,” Holder replied.
Under the program, weapons were allowed to be illegally purchased in the Phoenix area so that they could be tracked to gun traffickers and drug cartel leaders. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lost track of these firearms, and many were allowed to cross into Mexico.
The Justice Department strongly disputed any suggestion that Holder misled Congress.
“The attorney general's testimony to both the House and the Senate was consistent and truthful,” said spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. “He said in both March and May of this year that he became aware of the questionable tactics employed in the Fast and Furious Operation in early 2011 when ATF agents first raised them publicly, and at the time, he asked the Inspector General's office to investigate the matter.”
A senior official at the agency told POLITICO that while Holder knew that an operation was going on in 2010, he was not aware until early 2011 of the controversial tactics used in Fast and Furious.
Gerard Parkes (October 16, 1924 – October 19, 2014) was an Irish-born Canadian actor. He was born in Dublin, and moved to Toronto in 1956. He is known for playing "Doc" on the HBO television series Fraggle Rock and the bartender in the film The Boondock Saints and its sequel The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day.
Career [ edit ]
His acting career spanned film, radio, television, and the stage. Parkes worked often on CBC radio, beginning in 1959, and shifted into television and film, acting in such diverse series as the 1960s' ecological adventure series The Forest Rangers, children's show The Littlest Hobo, and the detective series Cagney and Lacey. In 1968, Parkes won the first Canadian film award (then called the Etrog and now known as the Gemini) for his portrayal of Uncle Matthew in the movie Isabel. He received the Andrew Allan Award in 1983 for Best Radio Actor, and in 1999, he won the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding Performance in a Featured Role for Kilt.
Parkes played the role of Doc in the North American version of Fraggle Rock. When he was cast in Fraggle Rock, Parkes was finishing a regular role as another type of "doc," playing Dr. Arthur Lowe (no relation to the English actor of the same name) on the Canadian TV series Home Fires. After Fraggle Rock, in addition to returning as Doc in A Muppet Family Christmas, he continued to work in children's television, guest starring as alcoholic photographer Phil (opposite Sesame Park puppeteer Nina Keogh) on the TVOntario puppet series Today's Special, and appearing regularly on PBS's Shining Time Station as store owner Barton Winslow.[citation needed] In 1988 he made a cameo appearance in the hit comedy Short Circuit 2 as a priest.
In 1996, he portrayed Jonathan Swift in the HBO Original Film Handel's Last Chance. In 1998, he appeared on an episode of PBS's Noddy, as Wally the Wanderer in "Noah's Leaving". He appeared with Willem Dafoe and Billy Connolly in The Boondock Saints (playing a Tourette's syndrome-afflicted bartender, also named "Doc"). He reprised the role for The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day.
He appeared in The Adjuster (1991), premiering at the New York Film Festival. In 1991, it won the Special Silver St. George[1] at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film 10th in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.[2]
Death [ edit ]
He died three days after his 90th birthday on October 19, 2014.[3] His remains were cremated.
Honors and awards [ edit ]

Greer, Sandy. "Small Screen", The Toronto Star, August 2, 1986
A week ago Friday, the tragic events in Newtown, CT, unfolded as the world watched in horror. In the end, 20 students and six adult employees were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary school. Tributes have poured in from everywhere, including the sports world.
The AHL's Bridgeport Sound Tigers play about 30 minutes away from Newtown and have hosted students from Sandy Hook Elementary at games in the past.

The team announced this week that they would wear commemorative patches and stickers on their uniforms for the rest of the season to honor the victims. Behind both nets “S.H.E.S.” and “12.14.12” will be painted into the ice, as well.
On Thursday, the Sound Tigers announced another way they will pay tribute, this one in incredible fashion:
For their next seven home games at Webster Bank Arena, the Sound Tigers will replace the last names of players from their black alternate jerseys with a name of one of the Sandy Hook Elementary students.
In addition, the six adult victims will have their names shown on the center ice scoreboard throughout the entire game.
From the Sound Tigers:
“Sandy Hook Elementary School has been a part of our family, supporting the Sound Tigers at games and community events since the team began calling Bridgeport home, 12 years ago,” Sound Tigers President Howard Saffan said. “We are honored to recognize the victims of the heart-breaking events that happened less than 20 miles up the road.”
The team will begin wearing these jerseys this Saturday through Jan. 20. After the seventh and final game, the Sound Tigers will invite a representative or relative of the victims to the game to accept the jerseys featuring their child's name off the back of the players.
Story continues
An online auction featuring various hockey memorabilia will also be held with proceeds benefiting the families.

The release of Edge Of Tomorrow - which opened in the US this past weekend, following its bow in the UK a week earlier - has brought, not for the first time, a strange Hollywood trend to light. And it's this: do we trust big stars to make decent movies anymore?
Many people, this writer included, took a lot of convincing to venture out and see Tom Cruise in a hugely expensive sci-fi spectacular (notwithstanding the fact that Cruise has fine form in science fiction). The film in question, Edge Of Tomorrow, is directed by Doug Liman of The Bourne Identity, and based on a graphic novel with a cool title. So surely this should have been a movie which audiences were enthusiastically anticipating? Yet It didn't seem that way, both in certain geeky circles and - off the back of its US box office numbers - amongst the broader audience either.
There was something about the movie which some potential audience-members didn't seem to engage with immediately. The trailer and publicity didn't help, but it seemed that there was more to it than that. Yet soon, after the reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations began coming, it became apparent that Edge Of Tomorrow was a veritable treasure trove for moviegoers.
Indeed, Edge Of Tomorrow is a strong sci-fi/action flick with splashes of dark humour, which doesn't take itself too seriously and, perhaps most importantly, hinges on two great central performances. Looking at the trailers, and the director's previous form, it seems a bit odd that most of us didn't predict this would be a contender for one of the most geek-friendly films of the year.
Have we, as a cinema-going whole, become disillusioned with ‘star power' then? Is all we anticipate these days the next superhero flick or franchise instalment? If so, why? We had a look through recent history in search of some answers…
The 1990s: Star-driven cinema at a high point
For those growing up in the 1990s, star power was most certainly a big thing. My generation fervently tuned in to BBC2 day in day out, to follow up our daily Simpsons fix with a much-needed dose of Will Smith in The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I distinctly remember putting my school blazer on inside-out to try and emulate the star-in-the-making's seemingly effortless cool.
Although my peers and I fell short of the 18 certificate for his first blockbuster outing Bad Boys, Will Smith's double salvo of Independence Day (12) and Men In Black (PG) cemented him as the complete cinematic star to a whole new generation of cinemagoers. He had the looks, the charm, the comedy-factor, the family-friendly rap records.
In short, Smith was everything geeky kids wanted in a star. Let it be stressed - we even liked Men In Black 2. To this new batch of film-lovers, he was bulletproof. He was our entry-level star, who made the jump from our TV screens, to the local cinema, to our hearts, with relative ease.
And if Will Smith was the king of bringing comedy nuances to high concept actioneers, Tom Cruise was quickly learning to dominate the world of the straight action cinema. The late 1980s had seen Cruise wow audiences with Top Gun and Born On The Fourth Of July, and now the 1990s handed plenty more opportunities to headline movies (some of which he produced). He overcame much controversy to emerge triumphant from Interview With The Vampire and attempted legal thriller with The Firm before launching Mission: Impossible in 1996.
The film performed well enough, claiming the third spot at the yearly box office behind Bill Paxton-starring disaster flick Twister and, at the top of the pile, Will Smith's Independence Day.
Comedy had its own rising star too, with Jim Carrey climbing through the ranks to become a household name, and a bankable leading man. Although another popular star Tom Hanks had held the box office top spot in 1994, Jim Carrey had not one, not two, but three films in the top twenty for the year: Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber.
This was a time, then, when studios banked hard on stars – one crowd-pleasing turn could open up countless opportunities near-immediately, which would mostly all seem to connect well with audiences (albeit with a few blips like The Cable Guy foreshadowing the more difficult future to come). Another example of the 1990s reliance on star power was the Batman franchise which, in the wake of Tim Burton's departure, would add Carrey, Clooney and Schwarzenegger across two sequels in an attempt to stay afloat. And we all know how that turned out.
In 1999, though, the box office crown went to Star Wars: The Phantom Menance. The return of a franchise which had always endorsed an ensemble cast and hadn't relied on established stars in its original run, but made their own (and as we've discussed, 1999 was a year with big ramifications for cinema).
The 2000s: Rise of the huge franchises
So was this the beginning of the end? Did the return of a huge franchise which was based on the principle of casting unknowns and a few experienced thespians against a backdrop of spectacular fantasy-action herald the end of cinema's dependence on stars?
Well, short answer: no. Not immediately anyway. The decade began incredibly well for star power, with the box office totals for 2000 seeing Carrey, Hanks and Cruise at the top of the pile with How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Castaway and Mission: Impossible II respectively.
If you scroll down to eighth on the list though, things begin to get interesting. Bryan Singer's original X-Men, despite falling short of the star vehicles, had taken a very respectable US total of over $150m. This grew to just shy of $300m worldwide. Like Star Wars, Singer didn't rely on the power of star actors. He welcomed experienced thespians like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (who was already an established geek favourite after 13 years since Star Trek: The Next Generation had begun) to help guide new talent through an engaging, fantastical plot, without the camp and disappointment of the now-dead Batman franchise.
The film's success was like a calling card to Hollywood, a potent suggestion that there were other ways to make big money worldwide beyond simply thrusting Cruise, Carrey, Smith, Hanks, or any other star, into a new scenario. Already in production at this stage, and on their way to huge success, were Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone and The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. Both delivered a similar message by grabbing the top two spots in 2001. Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky came 20th while Will Smith's Ali just snuck into the top 40 and Jim Carrey struggled around the eighty mark with a serious turn in the underappreciated The Majestic (although, to be fair, all three of these were more projects that got made because of a movie star's involvement, rather than as potentially huge blockbusters). Ben Affleck's Pearl Harbour did better than any of the stars who had dominated the previous year. Tom Hanks didn't have a movie out.
Within a year, the whole system had been flipped, turned upside-down. Audiences were clearly more up for fantastical franchise fun (with mixed experience-meets-newcomers casts) than their usual stars. Interestingly, animated efforts in the shape of Shrek and Monsters, Inc. had come third and fourth respectively, beating all the old favourites, too.
Throughout the 2000s, this battle continued to rage, with both sides having their moments of glory. To look purely at the statistics though, the franchises generally did better than the star vehicles. The films which mixed both stars and fantasy elements (I'm looking at you, Pirates Of The Caribbean) fared pretty well too.
The other 2000s US box office end-of-year toppers were: Spider-Man, The Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King, Shrek 2, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Spider-Man 3, The Dark Knight, and Avatar.
Tom Cruise movies regularly made good money in the 2000s with Minority Report, War Of The Worlds, The Last Samurai and Mission: Impossible III, but henever took the end-of-year crown. War Of The Worlds took a strong $230m+ US gross in 2005 but came fourth behind not only the final Star Wars prequel, but also Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire and The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. 2000s film fans clearly loved fantasy and science fiction but undoubtedly seemed to trust recognisable franchise names than studio-endorsed stars, in 2005 at least.
Similarly, Will Smith's biggest film between 2001 and 2009 was zombie flick I Am Legend, which took $255m+ US box office haul, but lost out to Spider-Man 3, Shrek the Third, Transformers, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End and Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix in the end-of-year league table.
Carrey's Bruce Almighty took $240m+ in the US in 2003, but couldn't beat The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King, Finding Nemo, Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl or Matrix Reloaded. Without a Toy Story sequel (with animation being the other clear favourite here, alongside the fantasy/sci-fi/comic book franchises), Tom Hanks' biggest film from 2001-2009 was The Da Vinci Code, which lost out to Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Cars, X-Men: The Last Stand, Cars and, a bit of a curveball, Night At The Museum.
Appreciating that stars were headlining films that were still making lots of money in some cases, there was nonetheless a sense that the tide was turning....
The 2010s: Underperforming star vehicles
So, the full picture seems to be forming - we've begun doubting star vehicles due to the rise of comic book/science fiction/fantasy franchises which don't rely on casting stars, but specialise in making them. Who would have thought a few years back that Robert Downey Jnr would have more consistent appeal at the box office than Tom Cruise?
We live in a time where studios entrust big money to the likes of Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, not to ensnare a star, but to find a good match for their characters and make the best spectacle possible with whoever that might be. The casting of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, albeit not as the first choice, is another prime example of this modern make-your-own-star mentality at play. Not many had heard of him before, everyone has now.
In the last few years, Hollywood's stars from the 1990s have seen their films flop in ways that would have seemed unfathomable to many growing up. Tom Cruise's Oblivion failed to break $100m in the US last year, while Will Smith's After Earth barely broke $60m on home turf. Without Pirates to prop him up, Johnny Depp has had the unenviable double-bill of The Lone Ranger and Transcendence, neither of which broke the $100m mark in America. Jim Carrey co-starred with some penguins in his latest solo vehicle, Mr Popper's Penguins. That didn't do too well either.
Audiences, it seems, won't just accept any old rubbish from a star anymore. In comic book and effects-dominated blockbusters, that bring with them homemade stars, the movie stars of old are struggling to fit in. Even something as critically loved as Edge Of Tomorrow is struggling to find success in the US. Ten years ago, that would have been a huge box office smash. Now? It's hitting big in areas outside the US - in China, for instance, movie stars are still big business - but on home turf? It's struggling.
But then maybe the days of the big budget star vehicle as we know it are all but done. Only Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks (in their roles as Captain Jack Sparrow and Toy Story's Woody, respectively) have hit the heady heights of year-end US box office number one since 2001.
Toy Story 3, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2, Avengers Assemble and The Hunger Games' sequel Catching Fire have been the year-end US box office winners so far this decade, suggesting this pattern of franchises prevailing over star vehicles looking unlikely to stop. All the major stars (outside of comic book/fantasy roles) are currently outside the top ten for 2014, although Edge Of Tomorrow and Malificent will currently be hoping to change that.
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol remains the one huge hit of late for Tom Cruise, during a challenging last few years that have seen Oblivion, Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages, Knight & Day and Valkyrie all fall short of a $100m total on American soil.
What the positive buzz around Edge Of Tomorrow proves is that audiences and reviewers alike are still open to the idea of popular star vehicles, but that films need something more than a star name to break through at the box office now. A movie star's name on a poster doesn't cut it in an era dominated by the likes of Marvel Studios, Pixar, sequels and big fan-favourite fantastical franchises.
This reversal, which has seen these fantastical franchises starting without household names outperforming the thought-bulletproof stars of old, doesn't mean the end for big-name stars like Cruise, Smith, Carrey or Hanks. But it does mean that it's getting harder. Edge Of Tomorrow's slow-building box office total proves that this will be a difficult process. And whilst that's a film that'll still be enjoyed for many years to come, you can't help but think it would have made twice the money already - in the US at least - had it had a Marvel logo on it rather than Tom Cruise's name.

I've been playing for four years, and especially these last few months, I've turned it up ten notches and played for at least an hour every day (with a few exceptions). Even so, I've yet to experience hand/wrist pains. Ijust be really lucky, or I might just happen to have good wrist genes or whatever, but I think it might have something to do with the way I hold the controller.Left hand: I rest my index finger along the edge of the controller, and sometimes use it to fast fall. I use my middle finger to shield and tech.Right hand: I use my index to press z (for l-cancelling and grabbing) and mostly just rest my middle finger over R.What I've noticed is that my grip is much more relaxed when holding the middle fingers on the triggers, instead of having them on the back of the controller. I'm not sure this is true for everyone, though, but maybe something to try out if you struggle with wrist issues? The transition from index finger to middle finger on the triggers isn't as hard as you might think.For those who think I'm stupid for not doing stretching before playing, I'm going to start doing it, just in case. Stay safe, kids.Edit: Forgot to add that if anyone else has unconventional ways to hold the controller they think might have a positive effect, sharing is caring ^^
Let's get ready to rumba. After Kaitlyn Bristowe claimed that Bachelor creator Mike Fleiss previously put the brakes on her joining Dancing With the Stars, fellow Bachelorette alum JoJo Fletcher is adding her own experience to the ongoing debate about whether the dating franchise's male stars get different treatment when it comes to showcasing their ballroom skills.
Fletcher, who starred on The Bachelorette season 12 last year, told Refinery29 on Monday, April 10, that she wanted to compete on DWTS after she got engaged to Jordan Rodgers on the ABC romance show, but that the powers that be prevented it from happening. This mirrors Bristowe's apparent situation, as the news in February of Nick Viall joining DWTS season 24 prompted Bristowe to write on Twitter that she had been set to appear on the dancing show after her Bachelorette run until Fleiss stepped in and wouldn't let her.
“Yeah, I would have,” Fletcher, 26, said about whether she would do DWTS. “But some contractual things kinda got in the way.” She added that she doesn't understand why there would have been a problem with her competing on the show: “If it's a decision that [the Bachelorette is] making and their partner supports it, then let them do it. …You know, if your relationship fails because of Dancing With the Stars, it's not because of Dancing With the Stars. If your relationship is strong, it's gonna last no matter what.”
So was Fletcher not allowed to compete on DWTS because Bachelor producers thought that her relationship with Rodgers should be her top priority? “You would think that, but then why would the Bachelor be able to do it?” Fletcher replied. “So I think there might be [a gender-based reason]. I don't know. You know?”
Bristowe, 31, told Entertainment Tonight on March 1, “I believe men and women should be afforded the same opportunities. That has not been the case with the Bachelorettes and the Bachelors. I had an offer to do Dancing With the Stars and was told by Mike [Fleiss] I could not.… My hope in speaking out is that future Bachelorettes are given the same opportunity as Bachelors.” (In addition to Viall, former Bachelors Chris Soules, Sean Lowe and Jake Pavelka have all strutted their stuff on DWTS; Trista Sutter is the lone Bachelorette to have entered the fray.)
DWTS executive producers Joe Sungkur and Ashley Edens spoke to The Hollywood Reporter last month about the flap, with Edens saying that “there's no rhyme or reason” to why certain Bachelor franchise alums get picked.
Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.

April 27, 2008
Almost unreported, the UK Criminal Justice Bill is slowly wending its way toward becoming law. It includes a section (Clause 63) on “extreme pornographic images” that may, or may not, affect a very large proportion of the adult population in the UK. But that – the Bill's uncertain scope – is part of the problem.
On Monday 21 April, the Bill returned to the House of Lords for further debate. Lib Dem peer Baroness Miller brought forward a set of amendments that would effectively have removed the extreme porn clause from the Bill.
She pointed out that the evidence linking pornography with violence was weak and that the new rules would be out of kilter with the Obscene Publications Act. In her speech, the Baroness commented that “the Minister is in danger of leading his Government into becoming the thought police… we do not have any evidence to justify an intrusion in people's lives”.
Further, “the Government's contention is that by viewing it [extreme porn] people are more likely to commit violent offences. Therefore, they justify walking into people's bedrooms and turning them into criminals simply for viewing something.

Obama's CIA embarrassed by another mole
March 11, 2017
January 27, 1975
In 1973, CIA Director James Schlesinger told Senate Armed Services Chairman John Stennis that he wished to brief him on a major upcoming operation. "No, no my boy," responded Senator Stennis. "Don't tell me. Just go ahead and do it, but I don't want to know." Similarly, when Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. W. Fulbright was told of the CIA subversion of the Allende government in Chile, he responded, "I don't approve of intervention in other people's elections, but it has been a long-continued practice."
Late in 1974, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that the CIA was not only destabilizing foreign governments, but was also conducting illegal intelligence operations against thousands of American citizens.
On January 27, 1975, a concerned Senate voted overwhelmingly to establish a special 11-member investigating body along the lines of the recently concluded Watergate Committee. Under the chairmanship of Idaho senator Frank Church, with Texas senator John Tower as vice-chairman, the select committee was given twelve months (later extended to sixteen) and hired 150 staff to complete its work.
Early that year, Church and Tower met with President Gerald Ford and his top national security advisors, securing a pledge of cooperation from the administration. The committee proved itself to be both responsible and cautious with sensitive materials, combing through more than 100,000 classified and unclassified documents to piece together a complicated history of past intelligence abuses. Conducting much of its work behind closed doors, the panel interviewed 800 individuals including former CIA directors, FBI officials, and counterintelligence officers and agents, and conducted 250 executive and 21 public hearings.
To educate the public about the misdeeds of national intelligence agencies, the committee held televised hearings in the Senate Caucus Room. After gaveling to order the first hearing, Chairman Church dramatically displayed a CIA poison dart gun to highlight the committee's discovery that the CIA directly violated a presidential order by maintaining stocks of shellfish toxin sufficient to kill thousands. Critics saw this as evidence that the committee's work was a vehicle for Senator's Church presidential ambitions.
Despite this criticism, the committee released its carefully documented final report in April 1976, concluding that Congress should and must provide consistent and ongoing surveillance of the intelligence community. Congress responded by creating permanent intelligence oversight committees in the Senate and House.
Historian Henry Steele Commager assessed the committee's legacy. Referring to executive branch officials who seemed to consider themselves above the law, he said, "It is this indifference to constitutional restraints that is perhaps the most threatening of all the evidence that emerges from the findings of the Church Committee."
None of the inhabitants of Bledington in the Cotswolds are 100% Anglo-Saxon, with ancestors coming from all over the world
The residents of the Cotswold village of Bledington were entitled to see themselves as the quintessential English villagers, blessed with a village green, stream, medieval church, Kings Head pub, mention in the Domesday Book, even a Victorian maypole. However, a DNA survey, one of the most comprehensive attempts to capture an entire village, has revealed their surprisingly diverse origins.
The village was classified as white British in ethnic origin from census data, but the saliva samples contributed by almost 120 of the residents – including the pub landlord, a farmer, an artist, a marketing director and the village historian – told another story: not a single individual of those tested was 100% English.
Just 42.5% of their DNA was Anglo-Saxon in origin: other ancestry derived from Europe, from Finland to Spain, the Celtic nations, including Scotland, Wales and Ireland, Native American, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Melanesia.
More than half of those tested, 56%, were convinced the results would show they were entirely English, a fact that struck many of them as very dull. “I'm really hoping to find out that I'm not as dull as I think I am,” one woman said. Most were delighted at the results: “I have got some Viking!” one happy man said.

The tests also revealed unsuspected relationships between villagers, particularly surprising those who moved there and those whose families had lived there for generations.
Sylvia Reeves, a local historian, is 93 and has lived in Bledington for more than half a century, but is still an incomer. She has now learned she is a distant cousin of Steve Tyack, slightly less than half her age, a builder and member of the village council. Both are thrilled.
“I've known Steve's family ever since I have been here,” she said. “I even watched his parents courting, so to find out we are related is amazing. I would never have dreamt it, especially because he is rooted round here whereas I came to Bledington by chance after being born in London.”
Tyack said: “Of everybody in the village, I'm really happy to be related to Sylvia. This whole experience has been wonderful – a real opportunity. It's really brought the community spirit back to Bledington.”

Six further villagers found fourth cousins or closer, and most of those tested – 61 people in all – found some relationship links.
The tests, carried out by the family history company Ancestry UK, revealed 18 different DNA regions among the villagers. Kristen Turner, a marketing manager, discovered she has south Asian ancestry and is now planning her next holiday. “It does make the world feel like a smaller place,” she said. “ I love to travel and I would like to pinpoint the exact part of south Asia my ancestors come from so I could make a point of going to visit.”
A photograph of sheep grazing on Bledington Green appeared on the BBC's Domesday Reloaded website, a project to create a contemporary version of the Norman records. The image was captioned “a typical village scene”. Typically gloriously diverse, as it turns out, with the sheep perhaps the only true natives.
CRITICAL PATHS Every week, Richard Cobbett writes about the wonderful world of story and writing in games.
What makes personal quests tricky to look back on is that they're simultaneously one of the best and worst things that ever happened to the genre. Without them, MMOs would be lesser experiences, and it's hard to imagine them being as successful. In their success though, they offered a template so easily copied and safely implemented that they largely killed the point of their genre. It's as if, say, Quake had taught the world to crave flashy 3D graphics, but in doing so decided to remove the guns in favour of a debate system where you talk the monsters out of their evil, and that rather than deathmatch had come to define what modern shooters are. Call of Reason: Advanced Diplomacy would be high in the charts. It would be madness.
World of Warcraft usually gets both the credit and the blame for the rise of personal quests, and that's probably fair on both counts. It wasn't the first to go down that road by any stretch, but it was the first to largely map out your progress throughout the entire world in an ordered way that jumped from NPC to NPC and rarely, at least until the later zones, leave you just killing monsters to level up in the way that earlier games like Everquest and Meridian 59 had often done. Pre-WoW MMOs did have quests and narrative content, but not to anything like the same degree. Asheron's Call 2 was one of the first to really plant its flag in that terrain in 2002, along with Dark Age of Camelot at around the same time. The smash success of World of Warcraft though established its method as the one that most future games would follow, with precious few daring to simply drop players in a world.
Some games make the solo thing more appropriate. In City of Heroes for instance, it made sense that you handled your own business.
The advantage of personal quests is threefold. First, the player always has something to do. Second, the pacing and difficulty is kept under the designer's control. The problem though is the third, that progress is almost never stymied if there aren't any other players around. This more than anything is why they became such a crutch. If your game relies on, say, armies clashing but there aren't enough people online and up for doing that, the game dies. If progress is reliant on players teaming up, but they either won't or can't, the game dies. If your plan was to have a deep political system but the players just act like barbarians, the game dies. These aren't casual fears either. Ultima Online for instance was set in a world devoted to the Eight Virtues and marketed to an audience well trained to be heroes, only to turn into a Darwinian charnel house. A Tale In The Desert, a very clever game that's still running, charged players with creating a perfect Egypt only for them to immediately strip-mine it.
Personal quests were insurance. No matter what else happened in that world, there would be that strong through-line - NPCs, monsters, specific objectives. There would always be someone in need of twenty bear asses, and twenty bears with asses to spare. And so, over the years, the genre calcified around a few basic pillars - a Personal Quest that would take you through the game, dungeons and raiding where group content would be played, PvP stuffed somewhere around the edge, and maybe a couple more bits. The technology likewise improved, with World of Warcraft typically leading the pack in terms of cutscenes and phasing and scripted encounters that increasingly copied single-player RPGs. In the last couple of years, Warlords of Draenor and Final Fantasy XIV have done a particularly good job of making this cool.
The problem is that in focusing on the single-player experience like this, the multiplayer side is typically wasted. It's often impossible to play with friends if you want to, since your version of the world is different, you're completely locked into your level boundary, you can't share quests based on each person being at different stages or already having completed them, and even if you do team up, every NPC addresses you personally. Now, being an antisocial jerk like I am, I'm not too saddened by being treated like a hero, and I can blank out the fact that I am not really the Commander of the Horde any more than I am Earth's first Spectre or a mighty archmage. Still, it's hard not to feel sad that more ideas haven't been tried.
Who needs friends when you have minions? Exactly.
Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration. Quite often they have, but it's not just developers who will typically follow the path of the least resistance in the name of success and keeping their jobs. Personal quests have taught players very bad habits, like eschewing most challenge in favour of just levelling up a bit and powering past it, and expecting an entire world to be presented to them on a carefully levelled out plate. Something I loved in the original World of Warcraft for instance was that early on you had things like the Level 10-20 Darkwood area right next to the super-dangerous Felwood for Levels 40-50 players. It felt more realistic that way; a brooding evil place right on the edge of safety. But now, you never see that any more because people complain about being killed. Or being asked to travel through dangerous territory to get back to safety. Where originally the progress was about blips of experience and levels, it's now as many quests completed. Anything that slows that process down is deemed a problem, not a challenge. Other players aren't potential comrades, they're assholes who steal your kills and call you noob for screwing up.
Easily the most tragic victim of this approach though has to be The Elder Scrolls Online from last year. You know that the cult of the personal quest has reached critical when it even infests a series predicated on freedom and exploration, its world being sliced up into levelled zones and being led by the nose, with just a little wandering around the side to remind you of what could have been. But there are other games too. DC Universe Online springs to mind, where yes, there's a PvP server mode, but a game that could have been built around really fun ways for heroes and villains to clash and compete just ended up with them casually following their own red string paths around the world and listening to pre-recorded mission logs. The Secret World too, as discussed here a couple of weeks ago.
Really, if that's going to be the focus, make a single-player game.
Meanwhile, back in Quonversation, Cthon contemplates Hegelian dialectic...
It's no wonder that over the past couple of years especially, the pendulum has swung away from MMOs and in favour of two genres in particular - the MOBA (please address all complaints about my using the word MOBA to someone who cares) that allows the fantasy trappings and team dynamic with far more depth, and sandbox games, be they friendly like Minecraft or brutal like Rust. Their focus on building, on community, on being part of something bigger was the original promise of the MMO genre, with its start coming from a combination of that and the magic of being able to share a world with so many people. Now, more or less any tiny company can shit an MMO out if they want to, and the generation they have to appeal to isn't impressed by such magic as 'online play'. MMOs have been left in the dirt, and a big reason for that is that they stuck with what worked, long after it became self-defeating. A few like Guild Wars 2 have tried pulling things back in the other direction, though only with limited success and little copying so far. Age of Conan had one of the strangest approaches, with a highly polished starter quest that then dumped players into a far more basic world with no idea what to do next, to which most decided that the correct answer was "uninstall this". Only Eve has really nailed the MMORPG sandbox, and even then its commercial success isn't universe shattering.
But does all that matter? After all, I said just in that paragraph that these other games exist. Well, yes, to an extent. See, I like a lot of the trappings that go with MMOs. I like the crafted worlds, I like the characters, I like the sense of story. I don't get that from most of the more freeform games, and I don't really care for the brutality of a lot of them. Sometimes, I want to be a super fucking wizard unleashing the fury of the elements on all who displease me, I want to get invested in a bigger story, and I want to feel part of a side even if the competition is tongue in cheek and completely baseless. "For the Horde!" and all that. That's something that, for now, you still need MMOs for. It just saddens me that it took a whole other genre to realise the potential, and now it's only really Everquest Next that seems to be flying their flag. Shroud of the Avatar too, perhaps, though it's too early to tell how it's going to be.
I can't complain too much, of course. I'm as guilty as any of just following personal stories and ignoring everything around, and without them, I doubt I'd have spent have as long in many of the MMOs I've played. Still, when I fire up a new MMO and am immediately thrown into a linear sequence of being told how to hit things with an axe so that a guy down the road can tell me what to do next, it's the wasted potential that most hits home. Story is great, but like everything, it's a tool. Used wrong, it can destroy an experience just as much as it can create one, especially when forced.
Image: Former-US President George Bush and King for Life of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud: "The loving parents of Al Qaeda." From the 1980's to present day, the US and Saudi Arabia have funded, armed, and directed Al Qaeda while performing propaganda campaigns to bend public perception regarding the terrorist organization - portraying them as heroes, then villains, and back again. The "War on Terror" is a fraud.
....
The stream of U.S. weapons heading to moderate rebel groups in Syria is being offset by a fresh torrent of cash for Islamist extremists, much of it from small networks of Arab donors who see the Syrian conflict as a step toward a broader Islamist uprising across the region, U.S. and Middle Eastern officials say.
The private donors, who use Twitter and other social media to collect millions of dollars from sympathetic Muslims, are providing crucial backing for Islamist militias that appear to be gaining ground in northern and eastern Syria, even as fighting stalls elsewhere, the officials said.
While radical groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have long relied on charitable giving from Persian Gulf states, the flow of private cash has enabled the extremists to retain their battlefield edge despite the loss of support from key Arab backers such as Qatar, which cut off aid to the most radical groups under pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, U.S. and Middle Eastern officials said.
The extends to which the Washington Post article strains credibility indicate an urgent desperation to bury nearly 3 years of intentional and direct aid the West has sent to Al Qaeda in Syria and documented plans by the West stretching back as far as 2007 to intentional trigger a sectarian bloodbath across Lebanon, Syria, and Iran by backing Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda militants.
September 22, 2013 (Tony Cartalucci) - In the latest, and perhaps most absurd attempt yet by the West to cover up direct aid, arms, and funding it has been sending to Al Qaeda throughout the duration of the Syrian conflict, the Washington Post now claims "Twitter donations" have somehow managed to outpace the collective resources of a 7 nation-plus axis who it claims is only backing "moderate" fighters in Syria.In its article, " Private donations give edge to Islamists in Syria, officials say ," the Washington Post actually claims:Of course, all of these networks the Washington Post claims are undermining Western efforts to bolster its army of fictitious "moderates " run through Western allied nations, including most predominantly NATO-member Turkey whose borders and the arms flowing through them are admittedly monitored and steered by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) The Washington Post article also claims:

Herta Müller (born 17 August 1953) is a Romanian-born German novelist, poet, essayist and recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature. Born in Nițchidorf, Timiș County in Romania, her native language is German. Since the early 1990s she has been internationally established, and her works have been translated into more than twenty languages.[1][2]
Müller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of the Socialist Republic of Romania under the repressive Nicolae Ceaușescu regime which she has experienced herself. Many of her works are told from the viewpoint of the German minority in Romania and are also a depiction of the modern history of the Germans in the Banat and Transylvania. Her much acclaimed 2009 novel The Hunger Angel (Atemschaukel) portrays the deportation of Romania's German minority to Soviet Gulags during the Soviet occupation of Romania for use as German forced labor.
Müller has received more than twenty awards to date, including the Kleist Prize (1994), the Aristeion Prize (1995), the International Dublin Literary Award (1998) and the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award (2009). On 8 October 2009, the Swedish Academy announced that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, describing her as a woman "who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed".[3]
Early life [ edit ]
Müller was born to Banat Swabian Catholic[4] farmers in Nițchidorf (German: Nitzkydorf; Hungarian:Niczkyfalva), up to the 1980s a German-speaking village in the Romanian Banat in western Romania. Her family was part of Romania's German minority. Her grandfather had been a wealthy farmer and merchant, but his property was confiscated by the Communist regime. Her father was a member of the Waffen SS during World War II, and earned a living as a truck driver in Communist Romania.[3] In 1945 her mother, then aged 17, was among 100,000 of the German minority deported to forced labor camps in the Soviet Union, from which she was released in 1950.[3][5][6][7] Müller's native language is German; she learned Romanian only in grammar school.[8] She graduated from Nikolaus Lenau High School before becoming student of German studies and Romanian literature at West University of Timișoara.
In 1976, Müller began working as a translator for an engineering factory, but was dismissed in 1979 for her refusal to cooperate with the Securitate, the Communist regime's secret police. After her dismissal she initially earned a living by teaching kindergarten and giving private German lessons.
Career [ edit ]
Müller's first book, Niederungen (Nadirs), was published in Romania in German in 1982, in a state-censored version. The book was about a child's view of the German-cultural Banat.[9] Some members of the Banat Swabian community criticized Müller for "fouling her own nest" by her unsympathetic portrayal of village life.[10] Müller was a member of Aktionsgruppe Banat, a group of German-speaking writers in Romania who supported freedom of speech over the censorship they faced under Nicolae Ceaușescu's government, and her works, including The Land of Green Plums, deal with these issues.[11][12] Radu Tinu, the Securitate officer in charge of her case, denies that she ever suffered any persecutions,[13] a claim that is opposed by Müller's own version of her (ongoing) persecution in an article in the German weekly Die Zeit in July 2009.[14]

After being refused permission to emigrate to West Germany in 1985, Müller was finally allowed to leave along with her then-husband, novelist Richard Wagner, in 1987, and they settled in West Berlin, where both still live.[15] In the following years she accepted lectureships at universities in Germany and abroad. Müller was elected to membership in the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung in 1995, and other honorary positions followed. In 1997 she withdrew from the PEN centre of Germany in protest of its merger with the former German Democratic Republic branch. In July 2008, Müller sent a critical open letter to Horia-Roman Patapievici, president of the Romanian Cultural Institute in reaction to the moral and financial support given by the institute to two former informants of the Securitate participating at the Romanian-German Summer School.[16]
The critic Denis Scheck described visiting Müller at her home in Berlin and seeing that her desk contained a drawer full of single letters cut from a newspaper she had entirely destroyed in the process. Realising that she used the letters to write texts,[17] he felt he had "entered the workshop of a true poet".[18]
The Passport, first published in Germany as Der Mensch ist ein großer Fasan auf der Welt in 1986, is, according to The Times Literary Supplement, couched in the strange code engendered by repression: indecipherable because there is nothing specific to decipher, it is candid, but somehow beside the point, redolent of things unsaid. From odd observations the villagers sometimes make (“Man is nothing but a pheasant in the world”), to chapters titled after unimportant props (“The Pothole”, “The Needle”), everything points to a strategy of displaced meaning … Every such incidence of misdirection is the whole book in miniature, for although Ceausescu is never mentioned, he is central to the story, and cannot be forgotten. The resulting sense that anything, indeed everything – whether spoken by the characters or described by the author – is potentially dense with tacit significance means this short novel expands in the mind to occupy an emotional space far beyond its size or the seeming simplicity of its story."[19]
2009 success [ edit ]
In 2009, Müller enjoyed the greatest international success of her career. Her novel Atemschaukel (published in English The Hunger Angel) was nominated for the Deutscher Buchpreis (German Book Prize) and won the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award.[20] In this book, Müller describes the journey of a young man to a gulag in the Soviet Union, the fate of many Germans in Transylvania after World War II. It was inspired by the experience of poet Oskar Pastior, whose memories she had made notes of, and also by what happened to her own mother.
In October 2009, the Swedish Academy announced its decision to award that year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Müller "who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed."[3] The academy compared Müller's style and her use of German as a minority language with Franz Kafka and pointed out the influence of Kafka on Müller. The award coincided with the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism. Michael Krüger, head of Müller's publishing house, said: "By giving the award to Herta Müller, who grew up in a German-speaking minority in Romania, the committee has recognized an author who refuses to let the inhumane side of life under communism be forgotten"[21]
In 2012 Müller commented on the Nobel Prize for Mo Yan by saying that the Swedish Academy had apparently chosen an author who 'celebrates censorship'.[22][23]
Influences [ edit ]
Although Müller has revealed little about the specific people or books that have influenced her, she has acknowledged the importance of her university studies in German and Romanian literature, and particularly of the contrast between the two languages. "The two languages", the writer says, "look differently even at plants. In Romanian, 'snowdrops' are 'little tears', in German they are 'Schneeglöckchen', that is 'little snow bells', which means we're not only speaking about different words, but about different worlds." (However here she confuses snowdrops with lily-of-the-valley, the latter being called 'little tears' in Romanian.) She continues, "Romanians see a falling star and say that someone has died, with the Germans you make a wish when you see the falling star." Romanian folk music is another influence: "When I first heard Maria Tănase she sounded incredible to me, it was for the first time that I really felt what folklore meant. Romanian folk music is connected to existence in a very meaningful way."[24]
Müller's work was also shaped by the many experiences she shared with her ex-husband, the novelist and essayist Richard Wagner. Both grew up in Romania as members of the Banat Swabian ethnic group and enrolled in German and Romanian literary studies at Timișoara University. Upon graduating, both worked as German-language teachers, and were members of Aktionsgruppe Banat, a literary society that fought for freedom of speech.
Müller's involvement with Aktionsgruppe Banat gave her the courage to write boldly, despite the threats and trouble generated by the Romanian secret police. Although her books are fictional, they are based on real people and experiences. Her 1996 novel, The Land of Green Plums, was written after the deaths of two friends, in which Müller suspected the involvement of the secret police, and one of its characters was based on a close friend from Aktionsgruppe Banat.[25]
Letter from Liu Xia [ edit ]
Herta Muller wrote foreword for the first publication of the poetry of Liu Xia, wife of the imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo, in 2015.[26] Muller also translated and read a few of Liu Xia poems in 2014.[27] On 4 December 2017, a photo of the letter to Herta Muller from Liu Xia in a form of poem was posted on Facebook by Chinese dissident Liao Yiwu, where Liu Xia said that she was going mad in her solitary life.[28]

Authorities searched Friday for clues in the killing of three Iranian-born Jewish men who were shot in a West Hollywood apartment.
The victims, including two brothers, were killed shortly after 9 pm Thursday, and their killer or killers got away without anyone seeing them, sheriff's Detective Bill Marsh said.
The coroner's office identified the victims as Pirooz Moussazadeh, 27, his brother, Shahriar Moussazadeh, 38, and Bernard Khalili, 27.
Residents of the Kings Road Arms apartments building heard what they thought were firecrackers going off. They called the apartment manager, who went to investigate and found the door open and a body inside.
Deputies found two more bodies in the apartment. All three men were in different places in the open-plan unit. No weapons were found, and there were no immediate clues as to why the men were targeted, authorities said.
At least two of the men lived in the apartment.
Marsh said the men likely knew whoever killed them. There was no sign of a struggle, and the door had not been forced open.
All three victims were members of the Iranian Jewish community and moved to the US as young children, said Pooya Dayanim, president of the Iranian Jewish Public Affairs Committee.
"These are three guys who happen to be Persian Jews who happen to have been murdered," Marsh said.
The victims were not wealthy, and family members told him they had no criminal pasts, Dayanim said.
"The only thing that sticks out is there was nothing significant about them," he said.
The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the killings were the second tragedy to hit the Khalili family in less than two years. In 2008, Bernard Khalili's sister, Bianca Khalili, fell to her death from a Century City high-rise. Authorities ruled it a suicide.
A cousin, who was not named, told the Times Bernard Khalili was like a brother to him.
"My cousin was always a very kind person," he said. "A very forgiving person."
The apartment building was said to be generally secure and peaceful. Investigators were seeking to speak with anyone who may have seen or heard anything.
West Hollywood is northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
The 2013 NFL Draft transformed 32 NFL rosters. Around The League will examine the aftershocks in our Draft Fallout series. Next up: The Buffalo Bills.
The Big Question: Has the Bills offense suddenly taken on the look of a track team?
C.J. Spiller was the most electric in-space tailback in the NFL last season, showcasing instant acceleration and breathtaking lateral agility, reminiscent of a 2010-11 Chris Johnson. Unfortunately, the rest of the offense was coma-inducing. There were no receivers to speak of aside from Stevie Johnson, who doesn't separate down field like a true No. 1 threat. Ryan Fitzpatrick didn't have the arm to convert those throws regardless, so defenses simply squatted on Chan Gailey's quick-passing game, cutting the field in half.
The Bills website calls the team's 2013 NFL Draft haul the fastest class in recent memory, which stems from new coach Doug Marrone placing an emphasis on speed and versatility.
"Speed is hard to coach," Marrone explained. "My coach at Syracuse, coach [Dick] MacPherson always said 'luck follows speed.'"
Marrone will oversee an up-tempo attack designed around the multiple talents of quarterback EJ Manuel, owner of a 4.64 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine. To the wide receiver mix, the Bills added second-rounder Robert Woods (4.51 40-yard dash, lightning-quick feet as a route runner), third-rounder Marquise Goodwin (4.27 40-yard dash, 2012 U.S. Olympian) and highly touted undrafted free agent Da'Rick Rogers (4.48 40-yard dash at 6-foot-3, 217 pounds). That trio is joined by 2012 third-rounder T.J. Graham, who blazed a 4.41 40-yard dash at the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine.
Along with Chip Kelly's Philadelphia Eagles, the transformed Bills could be one of the league's most exciting offenses in 2013.
Three Takeaways
1. Don't be surprised if Rogers ends up not only making the team, but having the biggest impact among the rookie wide receivers. Drawing comparisons to Brandon Marshall and Eric Moulds due to his size, physicality, post-catch running ability and lower-leg explosion, Rogers dominated the SEC as a 20-year-old before getting the boot from Tennessee's program. The Bills had a first- to second-round grade on Rogers, Nix said, via the team's official site.
2. The Bills fell for fourth-rounder Duke Williams' versatility after the safety clocked a 4.48 40-yard dash. General manager Buddy Nix has designs on using Williams in nickel packages and even at outside corner, in addition to safety and special teams.
3. Remember when Buffalo's defense was gashed for 558 rushing yards over back-to-back games against the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers last season? That won't happen again with second-round downhill linebacker Kiko Alonso joining promising 2012 fourth-rounder Nigel Bradham in Mike Pettine's hybrid scheme.

I should know better.
I know that movies and television shows are movies and television shows and contain actors who are acting and not being themselves. Again, I know this. I know Joe Morton isn't really the sociopathic head of a shadowy government agency. I know Kimberly Elise has an emotion other than "depressingly distraught." And I know that Michael Beach is something other than "aint shit."
But that doesn't stop me from making assumptions based on the type of characters people regularly play. There's nothing you can do to convince me that Taraji P. Henson wouldn't either be the best or the worst spades partner ever. Or that Nia Long doesn't smell like a candle store next to a chocolate factory next to a unicorn farm. Or that if I invited Terrence Howard to game night, he'd bring a bucket of wet wipes instead of a regifted bottle of Arbor Mist.
And, based on the characters Anthony Mackie usually plays, I assumed he'd be the type of smart, sharp, worldly, and Black-ass dude I'd invite to our baby shower just so we and the rest of my boys could sneak away to a bar while the rest of the party played Place The Baby On The Mommy. The type of dude who'd make you hate going to some company cookout a little less because you know he'll be there and you'd at least be able to entertain each other with jokes about shitty potato salad and awkward Wobbling. The type of dude who'd craft a snarky tweet about the need and relevance of #Blacklivesmatter; one so witty and pithy that I'd be slightly jealous I didn't think of it first.
But I was wrong to make those assumptions. Because, while I can't say with 100% certainty that Anthony Mackie is a hotep, he does have hotep tendencies. And I do not look forward to attending company cookouts with coworkers with hotep tendencies. Because I will eat the fuck out of some watermelon right in front of a White person. Shit, right in front of every White person. And I prefer to congregate with the type of Black person who'll eat it right with me, and wash it down with a quart of fried chicken skins.

Anthony Mackie does not seem to be that type of Black person. In fact, he seems to be the antithesis. The type who'd say something like this in response to a question about racial profiling.
“Like my nephew wanted to grow dreadlocks. I'm like fine, I'll sit you down and I'll watch The First 48 with you and everybody you see on that show, that's doing something wrong, they're black dudes with dreadlocks. So, do you want to be seen as part of the problem or do you want to be an individual?”
And the type who'd publicly endorse a bigoted squirrel monkey's presidential candidacy, while also claiming that he supports said squirrel monkey because he "worked his way up from nothing"…despite the fact that said squirrel monkey received at least a $50 million inheritance from his father.

(Mackie has since claimed he was joking about Trump. Which…well, "I don't believe you, you need…")
But, that aside, what really makes me verklempt about this isn't that Mackie has some social and political views that seem to be vastly different than my own. The world would be a much less interesting place if everyone felt the same way I did about everything. I mean, someone has to buy Big Sean albums, right? No, I'm just pissed because I was fooled by the wise and insightful angel he played in The Adjustment Bureau. And the wise and insightful part-time gigolo he played in She Hates Me. And the wise and insightful superhero with no actual superpowers he played in Captain America: The Winter Solider.
We could have been something, me and the Anthony Mackie I conjured in my head. But now I'll just stick to my assumptions about Morgan Freeman (who probably makes the world's best white bread pork chop sandwiches) and Meagan Good (who…well…I'll just keep that assumption to myself).
The White House communications team and Donald Trump have conflicting stories on the series of events leading up to the firing of FBI Director James Comey. And it comes down to one thing: When did Donald Trump decide to fire Comey?
If what Trump said in an interview on Thursday is true, that means he actively sought cover for firing Comey, the man leading the agency investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump said asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for a recommendation on Comey, knowing he would fire Comey regardless of the letter.
The timeline the White House was pushing directly contradicts Trump's story.
Both White House press secretary Sean Spicer and his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Trump hadn't made up his mind on whether to fire Comey — and that's why he asked Rosenstein for a recommendation. And this timeline comes with a slew of documents: Rosenstein's recommendation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions's recommendation, Trump's letter to Comey, and a press release from Spicer. Even Vice President Mike Pence repeated this story to the press.
But all that was shot when Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he was going to fire Comey “regardless of the recommendation,” because Comey was a “showboat” and “grandstander” who had done a poor job leading the FBI.
Regardless of what rhetorical gymnastics the White House uses to resolve these two dissonant timelines, it's important to remember that this means one (or both) of the following statements is true:
The White House purposely concocted a false narrative — with supporting documents — to give cover to a president who wanted to fire an FBI director investigating his campaign.
President Trump lied about the reason he fired his FBI director, and we don't have a real answer as to why he fired the man investigating his campaign more than six years before his term ends.
That's why it's important to investigate what really happened.
Oh, you don't like your deer sans antler and with a giant gaping hole in its stomach? Then burn it! Don't just stuff it into a trash can in Washington Heights! That's really bumming us out today.
From DNAInfo.com (which found the discarded deer):
The deer was stuffed upright into the garbage, with its front legs curled into a resting position and its haunches pressed in a seated position in the garbage can. The deer, which had visible stitches down the front of its torso and screws where the antlers used to be, was first spotted in the garbage some time before 8:15 a.m.
Maybe its viral marketing for the next season of Hannibal? Who knows, with the way advertisements seem to be working in the city these days.
It is axiomatic that if someone is sufficiently eager to disbelieve something, there is no Everest of evidence too large to be ignored. This explains today's revival of protectionism, which is a plan to make America great again by making it 1953 again.
This was when manufacturing's postwar share of the labor force peaked at about 30 percent. The decline that began then was not caused by manufactured imports from today's designated villain, China, which was a peasant society. Rather, the war-devastated economies of competitor nations were reviving. And, domestically, the age of highly technological manufacturing was dawning.
Since 1900, the portion of the U.S. workforce in agriculture has declined from 41 percent to less than 2 percent. Output per remaining farmer and per acre has soared since millions of agricultural workers made the modernization trek from farms to more productive employment in city factories. Was this trek regrettable?
[Trump is being handed a great economy. What happens when it goes south?]
According to a Ball State University study, of the 5.6 million manufacturing jobs lost between 2000 and 2010, trade accounted for 13 percent of job losses and productivity improvements accounted for more than 85 percent: “Had we kept 2000-levels of productivity and applied them to 2010-levels of production, we would have required 20.9 million manufacturing workers [in 2010]. Instead, we employed only 12.1 million.” Is this regrettable? China, too, is shedding manufacturing jobs because of productivity improvements.
(The Washington Post)
Douglas A. Irwin of Dartmouth College notes that Chinese imports may have cost almost 1 million manufacturing jobs in nearly a decade, but “the normal churn of U.S. labor markets results in roughly 1.7 million layoffs every month.” He notes that there are more than 45 million Americans in poverty, “stretching every dollar they have.” The apparel industry employs 135,000 Americans. Can one really justify tariffs that increase the price of clothing for the 45 million in order to save some of the 135,000 low-wage jobs? Anyway, if tariffs target apparel imports from China, imports will surge from other low-wage developing nations.
The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip, who reports that there are 334,000 vacant manufacturing jobs, says that when Jimmy Carter tried to protect U.S. manufacturers by restricting imports of Japanese televisions, imports from South Korea and Taiwan increased. When those were restricted, manufacturers in Mexico and Singapore benefited.
In his book “An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy,” Marc Levinson recalls the 1970 agonies about Japanese bolts, nuts and screws. Under the 1974 Trade Act, companies or unions claiming “serious injury” — undefined by the law — from imports could demand tariffs to price the imports out of the market. Of the hundreds of U.S. bolt, nut and screw factories, some were, Levinson writes, “highly automated, others so old that gloved workers held individual bolts with tongs to heat them in a forge.” A three-year, 15 percent tariff enabled domestic producers to raise their prices, thereby raising the costs of many American manufacturers. By one estimate, each U.S. job “saved” cost $550,000 as each bolt-nut-screw worker was earning $23,000 on average annually. And by the mid-1980s, inflation-adjusted sales of domestic makers were 15 percent below the 1979 level.
Levinson notes that Ronald Reagan imposed “voluntary restraints” on Japanese automobile exports, thereby creating 44,100 U.S. jobs. But the cost to consumers was $8.5 billion in higher prices, or $193,000 per job created, six times the average annual pay of a U.S. autoworker. And there were job losses in sectors of the economy into which the $8.5 billion of consumer spending could not flow. The Japanese responded by sending higher-end cars, from which they made higher profits, which they used to build North American assembly plants and to develop more expensive and profitable cars to compete with those of U.S. manufacturers.
[Trump's Carrier deal is the opposite of conservatism]
In 2012, Barack Obama boasted that “over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.” But this cost about $900,000 per job, paid by American purchasers of vehicles and tires. And the Peterson Institute for International Economics says that this money taken from consumers reduced their spending on other retail goods, bringing the net job loss from the job-saving tire tariffs to about 2,500. And this was before China imposed retaliatory duties on U.S. chicken parts, costing the U.S. industry $1 billion in sales. Imports of low-end tires from Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico and elsewhere largely replaced Chinese imports.
The past is prologue. The future probably will feature many more such self-defeating government interventions in the name of compassion as protectionist America tries to cower its way to being great again.

Following up his Palme d'Or winner Amour, it was thought that Michael Haneke was hard at work on Flashmob, even courting a major actress to lead, but it looks like that project is no more. “I had a project under preparation but I abandoned it for several reasons which I will not discuss,” he recently told Le Parisien (via The Guardian). Thankfully, he's already developing a new film that will likely be set in France, but details are scarce.
Since it seems like we'll have wait even longer for the next film from the director, if you've already caught up on all of his films, today we have a selection of his personal favorites. Dating back to 2002 for his Sight & Sound ballot, the list of 10 films certainly informs the style and themes of his filmography. Topped by two Robert Bresson films (one a revered classic and the other lesser known), his favorites also include Salo, a title he shares with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, along with classics from Andrei Tarkovsky, John Cassavetes, and Luis Buñuel, as well as some of Charlie Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock's most celebrated films.
It's an eclectic list accounting for various talents from across the world with each title well worth checking out, so see it below (with films from Chaplin and Tarkovsky in full) and for more on Haneke, watch a pair of documentaries on the director.
10. L'eclisse (Michelangelo Antonioni)
9. Germany, Year Zero (Roberto Rossellini)
8. A Woman Under the Influence (John Cassavetes)
7. Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock)
6. The Gold Rush (Charlie Chaplin)
5. The Exterminating Angel (Luis Buñuel)
4. Salò, or: the 120 Days of Sodom (Pier Paolo Pasolini)
3. The Mirror (Andrei Tarkovsky)
2. Lancelot of the Lake (Robert Bresson)
1. Au hasard Balthazar (Robert Bresson)

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the adoption of Title IX, which requires “gender equity” in higher education. To read the blogs on this subject, one might think that Title IX was exceeded only by the Emancipation Proclamation in its social importance. It is common to praise Title IX for the massive increase in the number of women who participate in intercollegiate athletics, and to note that women now number a clear majority of the students in higher education, with around 58 percent, give or take, of the total enrollment.
Notwithstanding this sunny picture, Title IX should be repealed. More concretely, there are two insuperable problems with the law, which should be fatal to these overblown claims. The first of these is that the champions of Title IX specialize in committing the fallacy of post hoc, propter hoc. Many of the changes that have happened in the past 40 years are to the better, but it hardly follows that they are the consequence of adopting Title IX. All sorts of individual and market forces have exerted their influence as well. Women are not inert. They can take, and they have taken, bold initiatives in their personal and professional lives. These actions, when summed up over many people and many years, will change the landscape in both athletic and academic disputes. Many of these trends started before Title IX was passed, including the decision of most major private colleges to go co-ed. There is no reason to think that these actions stopped dead in their tracks once Title IX was put in place in 1972.
The second difficulty with the argument is that the observed changes under Title IX have not all been to the good. In the area of athletics, there are ways to increase female participation without having to kill off male participation in sports: namely, devoting more resources to these activities. Most universities have administrations that are more than sympathetic to the claims of female athletes and there is no reason to think that they would spurn any well-conceived request for an expansion of a program, especially with the large female enrollments and the substantial number of women in high places in university administration.
Title IX, however, works in a manner far more insidious than these sensible voluntary actions done at the university level. The administrative interpretation of Title IX works to demand a parity in levels of participation by sex, which means that either many female athletes have to be added or many male athletes have to be cut out. The former becomes very expensive, given that the natural rate of participation in athletics is such that more men, wholly apart from brainwashing, prefer to participate in athletics than women. That is certainly what happens in intramurals.
It is also what happens given that football, wrestling, boxing and ice hockey are much more likely to attract male athletes than women. Female injury rates are higher than those for men in comparable sports, which helps explain their lower level of participation in activities that could prove harmful to their health. This point is acknowledged in professional sports, where women do not play five-set matches in tennis or 48-minute games in basketball. The owners and athletes know better.
Many feminist defenders of Title IX contend that this distribution is a function of some insidious form of social conditioning. They cannot accept the simple observation that men and women, given their different endowments, also have different preferences. Women are more likely to do ballet and dance than men, and no one thinks that this commendable preference indicates a fatal imbalance in our social order. But given that these preferences are in fact quite strong, the only way to force the system into equilibrium is to subsidize female athletics to the hilt and to penalize male athletes by the wholesale cutting of teams.
Thus, in the bizarro world of Title IX, it makes sense to give huge scholarships to fund a women' s ice hockey team while eliminating a men's swimming team whose eager athletes would happily clean out the pool for the change necessary to fund their program. There is no question that any given male athlete has far fewer opportunities for intercollegiate sports than any female athlete. The government manacles under Title IX have perpetuated wholesale distortions that are now impossible to remove from the system.
The larger lesson is that anti-discrimination laws do not stop discrimination. They allow the government to perpetuate the worst forms of discrimination by the use of public force. It is for this reason that one should be so worried about the mindless efforts of the Obama Administration to extend the proportionality requirements from sports in order to rectify the supposed imbalance in the sciences. There is no question that there are all sorts of gender differences in this area, but they are not evidence of any form of institutional discrimination. As Charlotte Allen writes:
When college women study science, they tend to gravitate toward biology–about 58 percent of all bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in biology go to women. In contrast, women earn some 17 percent of bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science and just over 40 percent of bachelor's degrees in physical sciences and mathematics.
There is quite simply no rational account that explains why biology departments discriminate against men and math, engineering and physical science departments take after women. The same university administration oversees all departments, and most of them work overtime right now to add women in areas where they are underrepresented. The sensible explanations for these differences all relate to differences in preferences for degrees of abstraction that can easily be sex-linked. The differential rates of participation are thus evidence that the system works well, not that it is messed up beyond repair. But it is the peculiar genius of the Obama administration to buy into every trendy cliché about discrimination.
The consequences of this change in attitude could be truly catastrophic. There is a need for more people to go into science — and those had better be the best people. This new drive toward institutionalizing a federal quota system will substitute in women and minorities with inferior skills for the current men who fill these positions. No one knows whether it will force the biological sciences to go in reverse. Subsidies for women and minorities in the form of scholarships is not ideal in my view, but they are far less costly than the current Presidential infatuation with Title IX.
There is no need for yet another mindless government effort to use Title IX as an instrument of destruction for institutions that actually work. The President has already messed up the current economy with his uninformed economic policies. Now it looks like he is intent on wrecking the long-term capability for the United States to lead in education.His spiffy Ivy League credentials notwithstanding, his presidency has already proved all too costly to the nation. He need not add yet another misstep to his undistinguished term of office.
So, you finished your new WordPress creation, fresh theme is shining in your local development environment, site is full of awesome content. Everything is ready for a migration to production server/domain. But, how to migrate WordPress site properly?
There are plenty of guides and tutorials around the internet covering migration. They suggest plugins or manual search and replace in the database.
Both ways can help you, but as WordPress stores some of the content and data in serialized way, by search/replacing stuff through PhpMyAdmin can corrupt that serialized data and cause you a lot of headache.
I am going to show you a step by step way of migrating WordPress and the content safely and flawlessly to your production server.
What is serialized data?
Serialization is a process of transforming data into a format that can be safely stored (in the memory, file or database) and can be later easily retrieved.
Serialization has become a standard in many programming languages. Problem with serialization is data portability. Let's an example of serialized data:
a:2:{i:0;s:59:"C:\wamp\www\beta/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/style.css";i:1;s:0:"";}
As you can see, data is organized in a way that it has data types and number of elements in every data type. And that is the problem.
If you have something.home as your local development domain and somethingelse.com as production domain, they don't have the same number of characters and if you search and replace domain in your database, you could get in trouble and corrupt your content data.
Migrate WordPress safely
1. Migrate files
First step of migration is to migrate all your files to production server. You can use FTP or SFTP or whatever method you see fit. After uploading files, open up your wp-config.php file and set database credentials.
2. Download and install Safe database search and replace tool
After that, go to WordPress search and replace database tool and download it. After you have done that, upload the file into the root of your production WordPress installation. You can rename it (so nobody evil can find it!) and you MUST delete it after you use it.
3. Migrate local database to production server
Go ahead, open up PhpMyAdmin (or another database tool of your choice) and export the whole database. Import it in your production server database.
4. Search and replace time
Point your browser to your production domain and the script for safe database search and replace. Then just follow the on screen instructions. In the first step, the script will ask you to pre-populate the database connection form with values from wp-config.php.
Leave that checkbox checked and press Submit.
On the next screen you can change database details (but it should be right if you correctly changed wp-config file) and submit.
On the next screen select all database table for scanning and press Continue.
Finally you get to the form in which you enter search and replace strings. After you hit the button, the tool will search and replace whatever you entered (so be careful).
EDIT: If you had WordPress install in a subdirectory locally, you need some additional steps, so read this article.
5. Test
Point your browser to production server domain and enjoy your new WordPress site with content and all. If everything works as expected, don't forget to DELETE search and replace script!
That's it, I hope that these tips will help you next time you try to migrate WordPress site to another server. Be sure to check some other tips on WordPress Codex.
“Mom” is kinda sort of but not at all really the word when Tricia Helfer returns to Lucifer as the real Charlotte Richards, no longer but a vessel for the Goddess of All Creation. Rather, after the events of the May finale, (a confused) Charlotte has recently resumed her existence as a high-powered attorney — and tonight (Fox, 8/7c) she happens to cross paths with Chloe, Lucifer… and poor Dan.
Helfer gave us a peek at what to expect from her new-ish character.
TVLINE | On a scale of 1 to 10, how patiently have you been waiting to get back into the mix of things and be back on-screen?
Oh, I'm definitely very excited about this episode. I'm nervous because I'm playing a brand-new character, basically, but in a way the harder part was actually when we started filming. The show had moved [production] to L.A., so it's a whole new crew, a whole scenario and then you come into [the season] late. You're like the kid late for school.
TVLINE | What questions if any did you have when you saw that season finale script?
Well, I had been prepped prior to reading the last script that it wasn't going to be Mom coming back, it was going to be Charlotte Richards. Originally, I was a one-season arc, right, but not “the baddie” because Mom wasn't bad…
TVLINE | She was “a wrench in the works.”
That's a good way to put it. So minus those questions when I first got picked up for another season, which I knew early on [in Season 2], I wanted to make sure that the writers had a clear vision clear for this season, so we sat down and talked about Charlotte. Coming from Battlestar [Galactica] and having played multiple characters, I looked at it as a challenge. Here you've got a character that looks the same but ultimately you're making them a different person and hopefully being convincing to the audience that they're looking at a different person.
TVLINE | You want to make her entertaining in her own right.
Exactly, because Mom had a certain flair. As the Goddess of All Creation, you could be a little grander with her and her disdain for humans. Mom wasn't setting out to be funny, but with some of her fish-out-of-water antics, there was comedy around her. And with Lucifer, obviously there are a lot of dramatic elements, but there is a lot of comedy in the show. Charlotte doesn't have a lot of comedy about her because she's coming back from, basically, a four-month blackout where she doesn't know anything that happened, but she keeps finding out about people that she's hurt and things that she's supposedly done and her life is in disarray.
TVLINE | Are we going to get any flashbacks to her first acclamation, or will we just hear her talk about it?
We don't see flashbacks just yet. Charlotte was a high-end defense attorney, a shark, basically, and where we pick up she is now going back to work for the first time.
TVLINE | She's had some time to sort things out best she can.
Yeah, and she tries to cover it up [her blackout], because she thinks she could be having a nervous breakdown. She's having flashes of this terrible kind of nightmare that she thinks is reliving. For this powerful lawyer, that is almost worse than anything because it's like you're not in control of your own mind. And then Dan starts calling her, and she has no idea who this person is, so she starts trying to piece things together. That's when she grasps onto, “Oh, somebody says I used to know Lucifer well,” and through him she finds some things out. But Charlotte is definitely dealing with identity — she remembers who she was, and now she's trying to be a better person.
TVLINE | As we see in the new promo, since Charlotte is not Lucifer's mother anymore, she's prone to pounce on him like any other red-blooded female.
Yes, absolutely, and I did talk to the showrunners about that. Lucifer has this effect on women, but [with Charlotte] it's not like where we've seen women throw themselves at him because he's irresistible. She's trying to grasp onto something and she assumes that they had a relationship because she's been told they were very close.
TVLINE | Oh, OK. She's trying to spark something, maybe a memory.
Exactly, here's there's this handsome man, so if we were close, of course we were together, right? But it's very hard for Lucifer to see this woman as somebody that's not his mom. [Laughs]
TVLINE | Does this Charlotte have the same “If you've got it, flaunt it” fashion sense as Mom?
She does. A little less grand, I would say. A little bit more business. Ella points out something about my fancy shoes and things like that. Charlotte has expensive taste, that's for sure.
TVLINE | When you were talking before about Dan and him trying to process all this, I was going to say, “poor Dan.” What is Charlotte's initial dynamic with poor Dan?
Yeah, poor Dan. Oh my God, she doesn't know him at all, and she really does just kind of push him aside. And that's not to say that that's going to stay for the season, mind you. I think Dan's “good guy”-ness, if that's a word, will ultimately possibly win her over. But definitely, in the beginning, she is just like, “Get away from me, I don't know who you are and leave me alone.”
TVLINE | Any other tease about what's to come for the new Charlotte?
Ella Lopez, Aimee Garcia's character, has an ability to kind of sense into people. Last season, she tapped into Mom and was like, “There's a lightness about you,” and now she's reading Charlotte and she goes, “That light about you is gone.” So Charlotte thinks this woman knows something about me, and so she zooms in on Ella. I had a really great episode working with Aimee, where we see Ella the first time really backpedaling and trying to get away from this person. She's usually so wonderful and lovey and huggy and whatever, and she's just like,”Ahhhhh! Get me away from her, she's scaring me!” Charlotte's then on her like a shark. She wants information from her, so that's a fun episode that I got to do.

The Vectrex is a vector display-based home video game console that was developed by Western Technologies/Smith Engineering.[1] It was licensed and distributed first by General Consumer Electronics (GCE), and then by Milton Bradley Company after its purchase of GCE. It was released in November 1982 at a retail price of $199 ($500 adjusted for inflation[2]); as Milton Bradley took over international marketing the price dropped to $150, then reduced again to $100 shortly before the video game crash of 1983 and finally retailed at $49 after the crash.[3] The Vectrex went off the console market in early 1984.
Unlike other non-portable video game consoles, which connected to televisions and rendered raster graphics, the Vectrex has an integrated vector monitor which displays vector graphics. The Vectrex is monochrome and uses plastic screen overlays to simulate color and various static graphics and decorations. At the time, many of the most popular arcade games used vector displays, and through a licensing deal with Cinematronics, GCE was able to produce high-quality versions of arcade games such as Space Wars and Armor Attack.
Vectrex comes with a built-in game, Mine Storm. A light pen was also available, and in 1984 it became the first home system to offer a 3D peripheral (the Vectrex 3D Imager),[4] predating the Master System's SegaScope 3D by several years.
The Vectrex was also released in Japan under the name Bandai Vectrex Kousokusen. In the U.S., the model number of the Vectrex is HP-3000.
Despite being a commercial failure, the console received positive reviews and has gained a devoted cult following.
History [ edit ]
Games came supplied with color overlay sheets to compensate for the limitations of the screen.
The Vectrex was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late 1980.[5] He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) and considered if a small electronic game could be made of this. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode ray tube display was made by connecting the deflection yoke in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An axillary yoke was used to keep the raster television's horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade, but as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.[5]
The system was ultimately licensed to General Consumer Electronics in 1981. After an exceptionally brief hardware and software development period, the Vectrex was unveiled June 7th of the following year at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago.[5] It was released to the public in November, just in time for the holidays. The launch sales were strong enough that Milton Bradley bought out General Consumer Electronics in early 1983.[5]
Milton Bradley's greater resources allowed the Vectrex to be released in parts of Europe within a few months of the buyout, and through a co-branding agreement with Bandai, in Japan as well.[5] However, the video game crash of 1983 turned Milton Bradley's support of the Vectrex into a costly mistake. In May 1984, Milton Bradley merged with Hasbro, and the Vectrex was discontinued a few months after. Over its lifetime, it had cost Milton Bradley tens of millions of dollars.[5]
Prior to the Vectrex's discontinuation, a successor console with a color screen had been planned.[6] After the rights reverted to Smith Engineering, the company made plans[when?] to revive the Vectrex as a handheld, but the imminent arrival of Nintendo's Game Boy put an end to those plans.[5] In the mid-1990s, Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering, allowed new hardware and software development on a fee free / royalty free basis. Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not for profit basis in order to provide a method for Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles low cost or free.

Design [ edit ]
The computer and vector generator were designed by Gerry Karr. The computer runs the game's computer code, watches the user's inputs, runs the sound generator, and controls the vector generator to make the screen drawings. The vector generator is an all-analog design using two integrators: X and Y. The computer sets the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter. The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational-amplifier based integrator circuits. Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over the face of the phosphor screen of the cathode ray tube. Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line.
The cathode ray tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 monochrome unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob on the back of the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids.
Early units have a very audible "buzzing" from the built-in speaker that reacts to the graphics generated on screen. This is due to improper production grounding of signal lines of the low-level audio circuitry, and was eventually resolved in later production models. A "ground loop" had been created by a grounding strap added in production to meet U.S. Federal Communications Commission signal radiation requirements.[citation needed] This idiosyncrasy has become a familiar characteristic of the machine.
Peripherals [ edit ]
The 3-D Imager, invented by John Ross, turns the 2-D black-and-white images drawn by the Vectrex into a color 3-D experience.[7][8] The imager works by spinning a disk in front of the viewer's eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn... and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180-degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180-degree mask.[citation needed] The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the "on" time versus the "off" time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the wheel rotation to the software's frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.
A single object that does not lie on the plane of the monitor (i.e., in front of or into the monitor) is drawn at least twice to provide information for each eye. The distance between the duplicate images and the angles from which they are drawn will determine where the object will appear to "be" in 3-D space. The 3-D illusion is also enhanced by adjusting the brightness of the object (dimming objects in the background). Spinning the disk at a high enough speed will fool the viewer's eyes/brain into thinking that the multiple images it is seeing are two different views of the same object due to the persistence of vision. This creates the impression of 3-D and color.[citation needed]
The same 3-D effect is in fact possible with raster or film-projection images, and the shutter glasses used in some 3-D theaters and virtual reality theme park rides work on the same principle.
The light pen allows the user to "draw", to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a photo-detector that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen's position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot felt-tipped marker pen. The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen's location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen's position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.
Software [ edit ]
Some of the Vectrex's library consisted of ports of arcade hits, most of them brought to the console through a licensing deal with Cinematronics.[5]
The liquor company Old Mr. Boston gave out a limited number of customized Clean Sweep cartridges, with a Mr. Boston sticker on the box. The overlay was the regular Clean Sweep overlay with the Mr. Boston name, logo, and copyright info running up either side. The game itself had custom text, and the player controlled a top hat rather than a vacuum.[1] Clean Sweep was written by Richard Moszkowski.[citation needed]
Reception [ edit ]
Byte in 1982 called Vectrex "one of the greatest game machines we have seen this year ... [Vectrex] is a good bet to score big with the consumer". The magazine praised the screen, stating that "it almost has to be seen to be believed; imagine playing games at home (or in the office) using vector graphics with three-dimensional rotation and zoom", and noted that "It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run".[9] David H. Ahl stated in Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games in 1983 that "Vector graphics really do make a difference, and the strong line-up of games helps immensely".[10]
Homebrew [ edit ]
Since late 1995, there is a Usenet Vectrex community that creates homebrew games for ParaJVE, a Vectrex emulator.[6] Today there are also several people manufacturing and selling newly made games, complete as cartridges with packing and overlays.

Twenty years ago, a literature review published by Niels Skakkebaek et al concluded that there was a serious decline in male sperm count levels, predicting a doomsday scenario and suggesting that this “crisis” was due to environmental factors (synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals or EDCs). This publication sparked controversy in part because the review used publications dating back to the 1930s when the technology for sperm counting was, well, as rudimentary as slide rulers. Since this publication, the scientific community was split on whether endocrine disruption was occurring (were sperm counts actually declining) and what was causing it (were synthetic chemicals to blame, or, as the Risk-Monger likes to postulate, did this decline coincide with the recent dramatic increase of soybeans, rich in endocrine disrupting isoflavonoids, being added to our processed foods?).
Since then, more funding was made available for scientists to perform more studies, so as long as doubt prevailed and the need for further studies persisted, many researchers were quite happy. For the environmental activists, this was manna from heaven – they could wield the sword of endocrine in their campaigns against chemicals, plastics, pesticides (the emotional uncertainty of what was going on with my kit would certainly draw regulatory attention). There is even a campaign against chewing gum as an endocrine disrupter (I suppose it must be run by school teachers!). A second generation of researchers completed their studies, under the tutelage of activist scientists like Andreas Kortenkamp or Niels Skakkebaek, learning to not trust industry researchers or government scientists (see the common thread in the affiliations of the signatories of the activist driven Berlaymont Declaration).
As the scientific evidence was far from certain, from 1996, the Danish government engaged Skakkebaek and his team to conduct large-scale longitudinal research of young Danish men (around the age of 18 and thus at the peak of their sexual prowess) entering the military from two Danish cities. More than 5000 sperm and blood samples were taken, questionnaires were filled out and data analysed over 16 years. Using the best analytical technology available, the most reliable methodology from the largest sample range ever over an extended time period, the hope was that we could know, once and for all, whether endocrine disruption was occurring, and what was behind this phenomenon. It allowed Skakkebaek to prove his theory which had led to twenty years of robust scientific and regulatory debate.
How did activist researchers cheat the evidence on endocrine disrupters?
The scientific community patiently waited for Skakkebaek to release his data – data that would inform the debate and remove doubt once and for all about the state of play regarding our risks from synthetic chemicals (or, more likely, the increased soy in our diet). And they waited some more, but still no data was released. Sixteen years of funding and access provided by the Danish government for scientists to conduct state of the art research and there was only silence. A representative from the Danish National Board of Health, within his right as the research funder, finally demanded access to the data, and upon receiving it, did what any responsible civil servant would do with work funded with public money: he released the data on-line to the public.
It should not come as any surprise that the data from 16 years of comprehensive sampling of the most relevant male cohort showed that there was no evidence of any decline in sperm counts from the thousands of samples taken. Curiously, sperm counts were increasing quite significantly in the last four years before the sampling stopped (see table). Other scientists examined this data and found it vitally important for the debate. Jens Peter Bonde et al published a commentary in Epidemiology (22:5, 2011, p 617-619) entitled Trends in Sperm Counts: The Saga Continues. The commentary sites much more plausible causes for earlier declines in sperm counts in Danish men (women drinking and smoking during pregnancy shortly after WWII). The article puts Skakkebaek et al in their place by concluding:
In searching for possible etiologies of reproductive disorders, we need to pay attention not just to environmental toxicants, but to the wide range of behavioral, medical, and other factors that have potential to damage human reproduction.
Source: Jens Peter Bonde et al, Trends in Sperm Counts: The Saga Continues, Epidemiology 22:5, 2011, p 618.
So the best scientific data (under the best conditions, cohort, methodology and duration) shows that there is no decline in sperm counts. One would expect that this would “disrupt” the activist researchers' campaign activities. Instead, they lashed out at those who dared to interpret the data they attempted to not release. I wish I were joking, but with hostile rage, Skakkebaek et al retorted, in the same journal:
Is it good scientific practice to publish other researchers' data without permission before these data have appeared in a peer-reviewed scientific journal? Is it good scientific practice to cite newspapers as a source of truth in scientific articles or to claim that other researchers have withheld data—without providing any kind of evidence for such a claim? Is it good practice for an editor of a scientific journal, in collaboration with an invited scientist, to publish editorials that contain serious and misleading accusations against another group of scientists without giving that group a chance to tell their side of the story? Source: Skakkebaek et al, Sperm Counts, Data Responsibility, and Good Scientific Practice, Epidemiology 22:5, 2011, p 620
Well, Dr Skakkebaek, is it good scientific practice to withhold data that the public has paid for because it does not support your political views? This is indicative of a narrow-minded generation of activist researchers who fail to recognise that when the public funds them to do research, they are themselves serving the public interest and not their own. Public ethics and not personal egos or ideology must be applied. By the way, to the best of my knowledge, they never did tell their story!
The mainstream scientific community is fed up with these activists. The tone of the commentary published by JP Bonde et al (referenced above) is almost snickering. Less amused are the 81 high-level endocrinologists and toxicologists who signed the letter sent to Anne Glover, begging the EU to respect proper scientific procedure on regulating EDCs. The regulators in DG Environment do not appear to be listening. Skakkebaek and members of his team did not sign the letter to Anne Glover. Instead, the EDC activist researchers are pushing for precaution on plastics, pesticides, and well, why not, chewing gum (Skakkebaek signed the activist driven Berlaymont Declaration instead). Even with bad science, their campaigning will probably succeed because the precautionary principle is bent in their favour.
The Risk-Monger himself was quite surprised to see these results as he had assumed that sperm counts were indeed declining. Not from chemicals and that silly activist campaign nonsense, but from the near sterilising level of exposure to soy beans that western societies have exposed their food-chain to over the last 50 years (found in up to 60% of our processed foods – see an earlier Risk-Monger blog). Unless young Danish men are serious red meat eaters, the high levels of exposure to endocrine disrupters from consuming soy (as well as coffee and other beans) would seem to confirm the theory that the human endocrine system is highly adaptive to outside influences. More research into human resilience should be funded, instead of imposing stupid regulations based on bad activist science.
Scientific dis-integrity
The man on the street may consider all scientists as objective, knowledgeable men in white coats whose mild, demure and bookish nature borders on grandpa-ish kindness. The man on the street has never attended faculty meetings or fallen prey to their political agenda at conferences where activist scientists can become very “unscientific”. My experience is that such academic big egos exhibited by these activist scientists are much like packs of hyenas – they don't really care whose flesh they rip into, as long as it is not their own (or their mercenary post-docs). For such characters, the moral choice between admitting being mistaken for the last twenty years versus continued funding for their fallacies to build their legacy for the next twenty is a no-brainer.
Why did Skakkebaek not publish his data and only release it under pressure from the Danish government? Why did he publish a paper on Finnish data from a much smaller sample range and weaker methodology (that showed a decline in sperm counts) and not bring in his contradicting Danish data? In the article referenced above, Skakkebaek claims that the journal editor asked him to remove the Danish data but my experience with journal editors is that they would not run from juicy scientific contradiction. I will leave these questions to Skakkebaek's conscience.
Fear and Funding
This is what we do know. Funding in the EU for EDC research has been slowly drying up (following the end of the FP6 CASCADE network of excellence programme and a cornucopia of national research projects) just at the time as the next generation of anti-chemicals researchers have finished their PhDs (under the tutelage of these activist researchers) and are now scrambling for post-doctorate peanuts. Without controversy and political imperative, those funds would not be forthcoming. In other words, the facts have to match the need for fear.
But the facts from the best available research show we should not be afraid (and that we should get over this political activism and move on). Still, the regulators in DG Environment and certain MEPs continue to cry their hormonal wolf. They are egged on by new NGO anti-chemicals umbrella groups like EDC-Free Europe (also seeking more EU funding to lobby themselves).
This has been a cute game played by interest groups and activists over the last two decades, but it is time for it to stop. Their motives are compromised, their science is tainted and their reputations are in shambles.
It is also time for our decision-makers to show some balls and stand up to these activists and their tactical games. It is quite alright for them to do this. Recently released and very reliable data from Skakkebaek et al can reassure EU regulators that they still have their manhood.

For years now, I've been a vocal critic of the Air Force's multi-million dollar traveling show choir, Tops in Blue. I've called for its cancellation for as long as I can remember, long before retiring from active duty and starting this blog.
The criticism hasn't been frivolous. In a time of declining budgets and tough choices (to include the recent revelation that three volleys will no longer be fired at veteran funerals), there's just no rationale — and no excuse — for continuing to devote resources to something that provides no discernible military advantage, doesn't enhance morale, and is somewhere between self-serving and a vanity project for senior officials.
Since starting this blog, I've tried to get beyond mere personal misgivings and effectively channel the qualms of airmen, who have overwhelmingly repudiated the show choir and called for its termination. It's been a popular nominee for the budgetary gallows ever since the service started asking airmen their opinions. Actively ignoring those inputs has earned senior leaders the ire of airmen who are watching the service get eviscerated by manning reductions and mission escalations while waste continues unchecked.
Behind the public complaints, commanders have also quietly grumbled about giving away personnel and funds, generating airlift, and providing free labor to support shows absent any genuine interest — much less demand — among the rank and file.
After years of steadfast resistance, supported by propaganda exaggerating the value and relevance of the program, the Air Force has abruptly changed course. In something of a Festivus miracle, officials announced on December 21st that Tops in Blue will play its final show in January and close up shop thereafter.
Of course, the announcement tried to downplay itself, sounding almost like a coerced concession rather than than the obvious and simple choice it represents.
Lt. Gen Gina Grosso remarked that “[t]he decision to pause and reassess the 2016 Tops in Blue season was a tough one.” Really a rather ridiculous statement. How many airmen to cut or retain in which career fields is a tough decision. Whether to prioritize modernization or recapitalization is a tough decision. Whether to conduct an airstrike on an enemy target with the possibility of civilian casualties is a tough decision. Putting the axe to a frivolous and unpopular distraction is about as easy as it gets, and begs for a clear statement from a three-star leader.
Brig. Gen. Lenny Richoux said that feedback “indicated this was not a cut-and-dr[ied] decision.” Yet the service stipulates that 81% of airmen surveyed were not in favor of maintaining the show choir. In a recent unscientific survey here at JQP, 97% of more than 2,000 respondents said they preferred a free taco to a Tops in Blue performance. “Cut and dried” being defined as “completely settled or decided” … in the minds of an overwhelming majority of airmen, this issue has been cut-and-dried for a long time.
But while the statement from the Air Force is unsatisfying, the decision is right, and while the language sounds equivocal, the decision is final. Don't be fooled by insistences that this is a “pause” to review options. Airmen made their voices heard, and literally forced the service to say goodbye to this particular frill if it wanted to maintain budgetary credibility. Now it'll safeguard that credibility because it's in the interest of the service to be free from this particular criticism.
That means the burden has shifted. Restoring the program after its canceled 2016 season would be an uphill battle requiring a meritorious argument that isn't available. Tops in Blue is not coming back, and that's a good thing.
There's something very important worth registering here. Airmen are absolutely yearning for common sense decisions like this one — so much so that when they get news like this, it's like icewater in the desert heat … they are ecstatic and cannot get enough. In the few hours after I shared this news to Facebook, I watched it go viral, rapidly reaching tens of thousands of newsfeeds. That's remarkable for a story this far into the sidelight of mainstream Air Force coverage, and it shows just how hungry people are for decisions that are responsive to their inputs and make basic sense. In an era of rampant BS, the provider of a nickel's worth of common sense is an instant millionaire.
The lesson for the Air Force here is to look for other ways to start making sense and to do so more often and more forcefully. Get the Air Force back under mission control and mission-oriented thinking. That's how you'll start to rebuild morale … one small step at a time.
Not to suggest that this is a small thing. It isn't. It represents a Secretary who broke from the status quo championed by her generals to open her ears and listen to airmen … and it represents the death of a sacred cow that was overdue for the slaughterhouse by decades. Any time we can pocket $10M and find three dozen manpower authorizations simply by slashing waste, that's a win. Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a winning streak.
For those a little nostalgic about the impending conclusion of the often sharp-edged Tops in Blue commentary here at JQP, I leave you with this compendium. Enjoy.

The Australian Greens are claiming credit for a push inside Labor to force its MPs to vote for same-sex marriage.
Deputy leader Adam Bandt believes his party and people who vote for the Greens pressured deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek into calling for a binding vote on her federal Labor colleagues.
The electoral threat from the Greens, especially in inner-city Labor-held seats, was forcing issues like gay marriage and climate change to "bubble up" higher on the agenda, he said.
"It's clearly having an impact," Mr Bandt told Sky News on Friday.
Ms Plibersek's push to scrap a conscience vote has split Labor MPs and senators, despite the party's platform being supportive of same-sex marriage.
She has called on party members to impose a binding vote on MPs at the ALP national conference in July.
Some inside Labor believe the Plibersek move is an attempt to prevent inner-city seats like hers falling to the Greens.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is not backing his deputy saying people should be convinced, not forced, on the issue.
Nor is she getting support from Anthony Albanese, who holds the inner-Sydney seat of Grayndler for Labor and is a strong campaigner for same-sex marriage.
"A conscience vote is seen, I think, as being the best way of getting it through parliament," he told the Nine Network on Friday.

This year marks 50 years since a historical protest that changed the face of Australian drinking culture.

But in Mildura it seems things took a little longer to take hold.
In March, 1965, two women chained themselves to a public bar in Brisbane, protesting the fact they couldn't be served there.
Mildura publican Liam Wood says this weekend, he will celebrate the anniversary by "locking out the blokes" as part of a charity event at his pub.
Mildura itself, Mr Wood says, has an interesting history when it comes to women being allowed to drink in bars.
Originally designed to be a dry colony, "gentlemen's clubs" were set up around the town in lieu of pubs, with women strictly forbidden.
The Mildura Club, and the Settlers Club, which was set up in 1893, were one of a handful of places in the town that served alcohol until the early to mid-1900s.
According to its website one of these, the Mildura Club, is still one of the few gentlemen's clubs left in Victoria, "and upholds the guidelines established over a century ago".
The Settlers Club, Mr Wood says, changed in the 1980s from being a men's club to allowing women through the doors, but was met with quite a lot of resistance.
Across the road from where the pub stands today is a service station, which used to be a stable for horses for the club's members and a shed for their wives to wait in.
"They built a stable where the guys could come and park their horse and buggy," Mr Wood says.
"Originally it was a stable, and there was a ladies shelter shed in the middle.
"So essentially the women had to wait outside with the horses."
The Settlers Club charge book, which dates back to 1900, also details the controversy that was caused when one member brought his wife to the club.
"[He was] requested to attend a meeting on the 8th August 1964, to give explanation as to conduct concerning an incident, in which his wife appeared in the lounge," it reads.
"He was sent a registered letter on 15/8/64. He appeared at the meeting as requested and was warned by the president of the committee of the serious nature of his offence, allowing his wife to come into the lounge. [He] apologised to the meeting and assured them there would never be a repetition of such an incident again. The apology and explanation was accepted and no formal charge was laid."
While women are now allowed through the doors of many more Mildura establishments, Mr Wood says that this weekend he's turning the tables for an afternoon in honour of those two women in Brisbane.
"The blokes can wait in the stables as such, for the afternoon."
Despite objections from the members of All Shall Perish, their management and their lawyer, Panama-based company World Digital will continue with a lawsuit against 80 illegal downloaders of the band's most recent release, last year's This is Where it Ends. The identities of the 80 U.S. downloaders being sued will soon be turned over to World Digital, and notification emails will be sent out to each of them, according to a report this weekend from TorrentFreak.
This story has been odd from the beginning; this is the first time any band has attempted to sue its fans since the whole RIAA fiasco several years ago, and having it come from All Shall Perish of all bands seemed very strange, so we weren't surprised to learn that this lawsuit was brought without the band's backing. But things just keep getting crazier: after the band's label, Nuclear Blast, claimed ignorance as to how World Digital received the rights to This is Where it Ends in the first place, it now appears as if the label is either not willing or not able to stop the lawsuit from proceeding. And World Digital is proceeding with the case despite the band's loud public objections.
How World Digital ended up with All Shall Perish's rights is still the biggest mystery in this case and no one seems to know the answer… or at least no one who does know has made the information public. But for the time being, if you live in the U.S. and downloaded This is Where it Ends illegally, all you can really do is sit back and hope you don't receive an email saying you owe $150,000.

Given how stingy some companies are with their early review access these days, we were pretty surprised to see the miniature NES Classic Edition show up on our doorstep this morning ahead of its November 11 launch (after being announced back in July ). We were even more surprised that Nintendo didn't put the usual embargo on our coverage of the new hardware, meaning we could write about it immediately.
We'll put together a more comprehensive review of the miniature NES re-release sometime next week. For now, though, here are our early impressions after a few hours with Nintendo's latest piece of game-playing hardware.
This thing is really tiny
Sure, we already knew from previous announcements and preview coverage that this wasn't an Xbox-sized system. Even so, it's striking just how minuscule the hardware is in person. The pictures in this piece don't do justice to the impression.
Part of the effect, no doubt, is the fact that I spent my youth getting used to seeing that very same form-factor in a case that's significantly bigger on the original NES. It's not a Raspeberry Pi or anything, but the overall effect still makes the physical system itself feel very cute and lovable.
Setup is incredibly simple
This is truly a plug-and-play system. There are only two ports on the back—one for USB power (a cord and adapter are included) and one for HDMI (a cable is also included). Plug those two in, turn on the TV, hit the power button, choose a language, and you're immediately in a menu to choose from 30 different games. No Internet settings to fiddle with. No accounts to manage or updates to download. It's refreshing, in a way.
The easy interface extends to the built-in save slot management. When you hit reset on the system, you're returned to the main menu with a blinking icon telling you to hit down to save your progress. Tap the button, and you can slide a screenshot representing your save state into one of four slots. It's a nice graphical interface that even a gaming neophyte can use.
The controller cord is incredibly short
I mean criminally short. Just 31 inches by my measurements. For reference, the original NES pads had a cord that measured about 90 inches.
The difference, to put it very mildly, is very noticeable. Just as we suspected
If you're sitting in a chair, and the NES Classic is sitting on the floor, the cord is already taut if you bring the controller up to your waist. If the system is on a living room coffee table, you'd better be ready for it to be perched on the edge closest to you (and be ready to run a very long HDMI cord to the TV).
The only situation where we could see a controller cord this short being workable is sitting on an office desk with a relatively small HDMI display. I doubt that's the use case Nintendo envisioned most for this system, though.
Kyle Orland
Leaning over to change games is a pain
I know, I know, back in the '80s we had to get up and turn off the system and plug in a new cartridge (and maybe even blow in it) every time we wanted to change games. Nuts to that. We live in the future now, and resetting and/or turning off a system from the controller has been standard practice for over a decade at this point.
Of course, with such a small controller cord, you're never too far from the tiny power/reset buttons on the hardware itself. Still, I would have preferred a controller with a longer cord and a power button hidden in some out-of-the-way corner. Or you could make some underutilized button combination reset the system without the need to lean over (down+select+A+B simultaneously?).
All that said, if you decide to use a wired Wii/Wii U Classic Controller with the NES Classic Edition, the Home button will in fact reset the system and let you save and/or choose a new game. Still, it'd be nice if this was standard on the included, NES-style controller as well.
The emulation (and controller) are very authentic
In a few hours of testing, I haven't seen any noticeable problems with the graphic or sound recreation on the NES Classic Edition. Even the flickering and slowdown issues that were a forced part of that original NES game design seem to be captured accurately.
Colors are rendered brightly and accurately ( unlike similar NES emulation on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS ), with big, sharp pixels by default. So far, I'm really enjoying the CRT filter, which adds a pleasant fuzziness to the edges of the sprites without being distracting.
You can stretch the game image out to the 16:9 ratio of a modern HDTV, but the games just plain look better at the 4:3 default. This aspect ratio can cause some problems in a game like Galaga, though, where it's hard to tell the edge of the black background from the black border around the game itself.
As for that short-corded controller, it should feel very familiar in the hand to anyone used to the NES pads of old, both in terms of overall dimensions and the general springiness and responsiveness of the buttons. If anything, it feels a little weird to be playing on an NES pad that's so new and unblemished after spending so much time with pads that have been broken in and worn down by years of use.
That's enough early impressions for now. We'll have more to say about this little piece of retro cuteness after we put a bit more time into it.

Le musicien de 41 ans agira comme directeur musical «désigné» dès la saison 2017-2018, et il assumera les pleines fonctions de ce poste en 2020-2021, en vertu d'un contrat de cinq ans, qui est renouvelable.
Il devient ainsi le troisième directeur musical de cette compagnie qui a 133 ans - avant 1973, il n'y avait pas de directeur musical attitré au Met.
«De toute ma vie, je n'ai jamais été plus rempli de joie, plus honoré et ému qu'aujourd'hui», a-t-il déclaré en anglais, jeudi, lors de l'annonce diffusée sur le web par le Met Opera, alors qu'il se trouvait à Osaka, au Japon, pour un concert de l'Orchestre de Philadelphie, qu'il dirige depuis 2012-2013. Son contrat avec cet orchestre a d'ailleurs été renouvelé jeudi pour quatre ans, jusqu'en 2025-2026, alors qu'il devrait quitter en 2018 la direction musicale de l'Orchestre philharmonique de Rotterdam, un poste qu'il occupe depuis 2008.
«Nos destins sont maintenant liés», a lancé, avec un large sourire, celui qui est aussi directeur artistique et chef principal de l'Orchestre métropolitain, à Montréal, depuis 2000. «J'envisage maintenant pour 2020-2021 une vie très, très nord-américaine», entre Montréal, New York et Philadelphie, a-t-il dit en entrevue téléphonique.
M. Nézet-Séguin succédera ainsi au chef James Levine, qu'il a qualifié de «héros» et d'«inspiration». M. Levine, âgé de 72 ans, aura occupé ce poste pendant 40 ans, à compter de la saison 1976-1977. Souffrant de la maladie de Parkinson, il a annoncé en avril qu'il se retirait du pupitre du Met, où il demeure «chef émérite».
«C'est difficile de dire ce que j'apporterai de différent (au Met), a confié M. Nézet-Séguin. J'ai un parcours différent. J'ai aussi plus d'affinités avec le répertoire baroque, une vision différente, peut-être, de l'oeuvre de Mozart, ou de certains autres aspects - et c'est normal (...) Je dois respecter énormément comment James Levine a hissé cette maison au tout premier rang dans le monde, et grâce à ma propre personnalité, je devrai m'efforcer d'alimenter et de maintenir ce haut niveau de qualité.»
Le «jeune» chef montréalais dirigera deux opéras par saison comme directeur désigné, et cinq une fois qu'il sera installé de façon permanente. Il participera toutefois immédiatement à la planification artistique, a indiqué le Met Opera. Il sera responsable de la «qualité musicale globale» du Metropolitan Opera - le «son» de cet orchestre. Il aura l'autorité artistique sur l'orchestre, le choeur et les musiciens, et travaillera avec le directeur général Peter Gelb pour superviser la planification et le choix des artistes pour chaque saison, incluant le choix du répertoire, les nouvelles productions et les reprises de grandes oeuvres lyriques.
L'opéra au coeur de la vie
M. Nézet-Séguin avait fait ses débuts au «Met» lors de la saison 2009-2010, en dirigeant une nouvelle production de l'opéra «Carmen» de Bizet. Sa carrière l'a notamment amené à diriger ensuite au Metropolitan les opéras «Don Carlos», «Rusalka» et «La Traviata».
Mais ses nouvelles fonctions sont encore plus qu'un rêve devenu réalité, a-t-il expliqué. Au cours des sept dernières années, il dit avoir été en mesure de cultiver et de développer des liens avec le plus grand orchestre d'opéra du monde, et d'être plus que ravi de voir cette relation se développer davantage. Il a maintenant hâte de commencer «et de mettre toute (sa) passion dans cette mission qui est de maintenir les plus hauts standards dans le monde de l'opéra avec cette maison, et de faire réaliser aux gens à quel point l'opéra est important dans leur vie».
Né à Montréal en 1975, M. Nézet-Séguin a étudié le piano, la direction, la composition et la musique de chambre au Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. Il a aussi étudié la direction de choeurs au Westminster Choir College de Princeton, au New Jersey. Il dirige régulièrement plusieurs autres orchestres prestigieux, notamment la Staatskapelle de Dresde, l'Orchestre philharmonique et la Staatskapellede de Berlin, l'Orchestre symphonique de la radio bavaroise, l'Orchestre philharmonique de Vienne et l'Orchestre de chambre d'Europe.
M. Nézet-Séguin possède des appartements à Philadelphie et à Montréal, où il vit avec son conjoint, Pierre Tourville, un altiste de l'Orchestre métropolitain. «En temps et lieu, j'aurai un appartement à New York, ce dont j'ai toujours rêvé», a-t-il confié jeudi. Il a rappelé qu'il avait assisté à son premier opéra au Met à l'âge de 17 ans - c'était le «Turandot» monté par Zeffirelli.
Il sera au pupitre du Met pour «Le Vaisseau fantôme» de Wagner en avril 2017, puis à l'automne 2018 pour une «Traviata» avec Diana Damrau.
Le comédien et grand mélomane Edgar Fruitier croit que Yannick Nézet-Séguin «est un des grands chefs d'orchestre de la génération des 40 ans - peut-être le plus grand actuellement au monde. C'est un très grand maître». Contrairement à d'autres chefs qui en imposent par leur poigne de fer, M. Nézet-Séguin n'est pas un «chef d'orchestre à crise», relate M. Fruitier. «C'est beaucoup plus par une espèce de complicité avec ses musiciens qu'il arrive à leur inculquer l'essence musicale d'une oeuvre.»
Le parcours de Yannick Nézet-Séguin

Houstonians live in a really big city. We know that people know that, but thanks to an intrepid Reddit user, we now have a succinct visual shorthand for just how big the city really is: Namely, these maps, which overlay the 88 miles of Beltway 8 on top of a number of other major world cities.
The maps, created by a Reddit user with the handle “Youllfindaway,” help explain why going from one end of Houston to another seems like a gargantuan task, while a commute across, say, San Francisco doesn't even come close to comparing. Take a look:
A trip from Northwest Houston to Southwest Houston, in other words, is the equivalent of a trip from the Pacific Ocean into the middle of the San Francisco Bay. That's a heck of a distance to cover. And it doesn't get easier in New York:
A quick jaunt to visit your friend who lives across town in Houston is the equivalent, for our East Coast friends, of dropping in on their pals who live in Paterson, New Jersey from Rockaway Park. That's not a trip that many people choose to make as part of a daily commute.
All of these helps explain why Houstonians think very little of spending hours in the car getting from point A to point B. Their city basically demands that they cross distances that, in other places, make the inconvenience of getting around more explicit by placing state lines or major bodies of water between them. That's perhaps not better illustrated anywhere than in the image of the Beltway superimposed over Honolulu:
Yup, Houston by itself is roughly the same size as the entire island of Oahu.
But Honolulu, Manhattan, and San Francisco are famously small cities, which is why they're the most expensive in the country—there just isn't a lot of space there, even if there are a lot of people. Do these maps rig the deck by picking populous, but geographically small, U.S. cities as their basis for comparison? How does Houston compare to a geographic behemoth like, say, London?
A journey that covers roughly the same distance as a trip from the airport to the intersection of the Beltway and I-69 in Houston would get a London commuter from the suburb of Watford to the suburb of Epsom. That trip would take two hours, and require a 34-minute ride on an overland train to get to an underground train, which the traveler would then take to get to another overland train, where they'd spend 20 minutes before enjoying a brisk 7-minute walk to a bus station, which would finally drop them off at their destination.
And all of this merely demonstrates the size of the city of Houston proper. If you want to get from The Woodlands to, say, League City? You're basically in Scotland now, buddy.
This is all especially relevant right now, as a city like Houston increasingly grows to the point where it's competing on its own terms with cities like London and New York, in terms of size and urbanization. As Mimi Swartz highlights in her Texas Monthly piece on local government in the city, Houston is in a bit of a flux situation right now—and maps like these demonstrate just what the city has at stake.

Pep Guardiola looked relaxed as he strolled into work on Monday morning ready for his first day at the new office. Having been introduced at Manchester City's Cityzens event over the weekend, he was immediately assailed by Noel Gallagher, there to stuff a microphone into his face, as City players of old shook his hand and the assorted entourage grabbed a quick selfie with him.
Amid the trumpeting and constant fanfare (#itbegins), Pep talked a good game trading Citizens banter with crowd-pleasing training ground anecdotes. Now things get serious as Guardiola takes charge of a club desperate to see a return on their exorbitant investments. Here we run through the size of the task at hand…
Talk of Yaya Toure leaving Manchester City is nothing new, ever since his 31st birthday celebrations two years ago were irrevocably marred by a perfunctorily tweeted greeting, below-average cake and the lack of Bugatti Veyron entirely. It'd never happen to Roberto Carlos. Just saying.
Toure is still capable of moments of brilliance – he takes a mean free-kick and his left-footed curler against Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League last 16 prove that – but it's hard to shake the feeling that the 33-year-old's best years are behind him
Toure is still capable of moments of brilliance – he takes a mean free-kick, and his left-footed curler against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League last 16 proved that – but it's hard to shake the feeling that the 33-year-old's best years are behind him. Centuries-old grandfather clocks take less time to crank into life. They're about as mobile, too.
For what it's worth, Guardiola rates the marauding Ivorian – Toure was a regular in three seasons under the Catalan at Barcelona, even as a now-unthinkable centre-back in the 2009 Champions League Final – but watching the City No.42's tokenistic trotting when the opposition counter-attack isn't the sort of high-energy pressing expected by his would-be coach.
Toure and his high-maintenance agent Dimitri Seluk might be careful what they wish for.

Report: Trump's Lawyer to File Complaint With DOJ About Comey Leak
President Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz is reportedly going to file a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey over the memo leaks.
Via ABC News:
President Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will file a complaint with the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General asking for an inquiry into James Comey over his leaking the details of his conversations with the president and the memos about those conversations, according to a source close to the Trump legal team. Kasowitz is also drafting a similar submission to be sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the former FBI director's Senate testimony Thursday and “other matters,” the source told ABC news. The plans come after Trump broke his silence on Twitter today and posted, “WOW, Comey is a leaker!”
Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017
During Comey's testimony on Thursday, he admitted that he had given contents of his Trump memo to a good friend who is a professor at Columbia Law School (later to be identified as Daniel Richman) to leak to the press. Richman has since gone into hiding.
President Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz spoke after Comey's testimony emphasizing that what Comey did was against the law and that he had lied under oath.
Comey FALSELY claimed he leaked private conversations because of Trump's tweet — which wasn't published until the following day after the leak!
Cara Lee's parents can only hope she never saw the truck that killed her. Witnesses said the Toyota Tundra was going 70 mph when it ran a red light and slammed into the car she was in, embedding its license plate into the frame near where she was sitting.
Police declared Cara dead the moment they arrived at the scene. Later, when they found the driver of the truck hiding in some nearby apartments, they saw that his gums were bleeding from the force of the crash.
He also was drunk.
Cara's parents have shared their story again and again as ambassadors for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, reliving the worst moments of their lives in the hope that it will save others from going through what they have.
“I look at my life as being over without her,” said her mother, Jackie Lee.
Around 20 people will die on California roads in the next few days in crashes that involve alcohol, if statistics from past New Year's holidays are a guide; close to 400 more will be injured. The holiday of champagne and midnight toasts also is the most consistently deadly holiday in California for alcohol-involved crashes.
As Jackie and Randy Lee of Santa Ana say now when they talk about Cara's death: It's all because someone wanted to drive and didn't think it could be his mother in the other car, his brother, his daughter. “You live your life around your children,” Randy Lee said. “There's just us now.”
‘Mom, I love you'
Cara was their only child, 20 years old, still living at home in Santa Ana, still leaving little notes around the house for her parents. “Good morning, Mom, I love you.” “Have a good day Daddy.” Her mother still has a piece of paper that Cara slipped under the bedroom door when she was very little and hurt her finger: “An update on Cara's index finger. It still hurts.”
Cara worked as a recreation leader for the city of Newport Beach, and the children adored her. She was studying part-time and wanted to work with autistic kids. Her good looks and bright smile won her car-modeling contracts on the side and a spot in a music video.
“She was just a happy-go-lucky little girl,” said her father, who called her Pumpkin. “She just took you at face value,” said her mother, who called her Baby Girl.
Cara went with friends to a Chinese New Year celebration in February 2010. Her parents didn't wait up; they knew the hum of the garage door would wake them up when she got home. Instead, a knock on the door shook them out of bed around 6:30 a.m.
Randy Lee shouted down the stairs: “Who is it?”
“Sheriff's Department.”
The parents opened the door to a deputy and a deputy coroner, who asked them to sit down. “Cara was at a party …,” the deputy coroner began.
Jackie cut her off: “A family Chinese New Year's party.”
“She's dead,” the deputy coroner blurted out, according to the parents.
Jackie yelled at them to get out. Randy sat for a few stunned minutes and then began calling family. “There's been an accident …” Later, he had to go collect his daughter's belongings – her cellphone, keys. He looked for a heart pendant that she always wore, but nobody could find it in the wreckage of the car.
Then Randy went to the accident site, on Flower Street in south Santa Ana. “That's where her last breath was,” he remembers thinking.
The driver of the truck that killed her, Gustavo Vega, 22, a fellow student at Orange Coast College, had been fleeing an earlier fender-bender when he ran a red light and broadsided the car she was in. Witnesses reported seeing no brake lights before the collision, which crushed Cara's passenger seat into the center of the car.
Not first DUI arrest
Police found Vega hiding in a nearby apartment complex. He smelled of alcohol and told an officer he thought he was in Garden Grove. He was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.17 percent, more than twice the legal limit.
It wasn't Vega's first DUI arrest. A few years earlier, he had decided to cruise around Santa Ana one night while drinking from a bottle of vodka. He was arrested after he crashed into a fire hydrant; a judge gave him probation and ordered him to write an essay about drunken driving.
He wrote about the embarrassment of the arrest, about how he felt “extremely uncomfortable” in the handcuffs. “I felt so much regret, and I made a vow to myself never to drink and drive,” he wrote.
He was charged with second-degree murder after Cara's death. A jury convicted him last year, and a judge sent him to prison for 20 years to life. He has filed an appeal.
“I wake up sick every day,” Jackie Lee said. “I am sick to my stomach every day because of this.”
After the crash, Cara's parents tormented themselves with the what-ifs. What if Cara had been in a different car? What if she had left the party just a second later than she did? What if Vega had just called a cab?
Jackie spent months inside, on the couch, unable to face a day without her daughter. She had surgery not long ago and says she prayed that she would not wake up. Randy still tries to avoid driving through the intersection where his daughter died.
They're planning to move to Hawaii, to get away from the reminders of Cara's death.
Cara would have turned 23 this year. Instead, on the 14th of every month, Jackie marks another month since she last found one of Cara's notes waiting for her in the morning. There have been 34 of those occasions; next month will be 35.
“It's another day for her not to be around,” Jackie said. “To not hear her say, ‘Hi mom, I love you.' To not go pinch her.”

About one year ago, I decided to commit to Spotify. I silently chose to leave behind my decade's worth of MP3s and go all in on streaming. Lugging around my 90GB of music and manually copying MP3s from one device to another had grown tiresome. It's been a year now, and not a terrible year either. In many ways, it was a fantastic year (the world didn't even end). But after 400 odd days of streaming an unlimited number of full albums without buying them, creating countless playlists, sending dozens of songs, and playing that music on any device I pleased (for the $10 a month premium fee), I've decided I need to quit.
I know what you're thinking: You're probably shaking your computer monitor (or iPad) violently asking why I'd possibly want to give up a service that lets you stream as much Lady Gaga, Nickelback, and Smash Mouth as you want?! I mean how can you turn down the ability to listen to Bananarama's full catalog? These are good questions. Especially considering that I'm listening to The Mowgli's on Spotify as I type this! But I never said I wasn't a hypocrite. It won't be easy and I don't know where to go – all I know is that I need to get out.
It's an illusion, Michael
Though its convenience is unmatched, Spotify is designed around an illusion. It's a lie. Not a public lie, but a lie that we're all buying into nonetheless. Spotify gives you the illusion that you have a music collection. It lets you import all of your local songs on your computer (in my case, 10,000 or so) as well as all of your iTunes and Windows playlists. Once you've let it suck in all of your data, it lets you create your own playlists, which are basically just lists of song names, or data. It gives you authorship over those playlists, control over those playlists, and provides you free access to nearly all of the music you might desire. Not to download, like an MP3 file, but to stream whenever and wherever you want. It sounds great, right?
Unfortunately, though you may think you're getting a free deal as you spend hours building playlists from scratch and Starring songs in your Spotify collection (to save them for later), all you're really building is a prison. Once you're in Spotify, you're trapped. And as I've learned in the last year, disobeying the warden can have dire consequences.
A couple months back, I was listening to some downloaded (Spotify calls it “Available offline”) tracks on the subway when I got a peculiar error. Somehow, with no connection and in the depths of the earth beneath NYC, Spotify on my iPhone decided that I had synced my playlists to more than “three devices” and completely purged all 4GB of music I had synced. All of it. Gone. Just gone. Deleted. To say I was shocked and upset would be an understatement. Some users have complained that this is a bug, but it isn't going away. It's something Spotify will do if you sync “your” playlists to more than three devices. Happen to own a computer, phone, and tablet? You've hit the limit. Don't download the Spotify app on another device or you're in for a world of annoyance and a day or two of resyncing.
It's not just multiple devices that will cause your entire downloaded collection to be erased from a device. If you accidentally leave a device's Spotify app in Offline mode (or don't turn your Wi-Fi on) for 20 days, everything on the device will be deleted. This user lost 20GB of music. It's happened to me, and even our Editor-in-Chief at DT. Not cool.
Those are not the only setbacks I've incurred. After spending a good long while creating an offline playlist on an iPad a few weeks ago, I connected the tablet back up to Wi-Fi to discover my playlist erased and overwritten with a very old, primitive version of … itself. Then there's the time Spotify erased all of my Starred tracks, deleting the playlist of songs I told it that I liked and wanted to remember.
Bugs are bugs and I'm sure there are sound technical reasons why these and other issues have occurred. The problem is that these limitations only serve to highlight the real problem with Spotify: It makes you feel like you're in control and still have a music collection when the reality is that you own and control absolutely nothing. Everything can be, and often is, taken away at a moment's notice because you've broken some rule that you didn't know existed. When you use Spotify, you're operating entirely in its walls. Everything works by Spotify's rules. You can't even share tracks you own (your MP3s) with a friend if they aren't approved and part of Spotify's library. So, in that way, it controls the music that you actually do own as well.
Give us everything, leave with nothing
Spotify demands that you create and build playlists, and encourages you to spend hours doing so, and to share your creations with others. I've made dozens of playlists that I've shared with different people. With one click of a mouse, Spotify will import and suck in all of your iTunes/Windows playlists and make copies of all of your local music that it can. It literally scans and copies every piece of music you own and every ordered collection of song titles (a playlist) you've created in iTunes or Windows. Since Spotify is so friendly with the world in what it imports, you'd think it would allow you to export a list of song names too. Wrong. It does not allow you to remove any of the data you put into it. Want to leave Spotify? You'll be leaving empty-handed. There's no playlist export function.
Google Play Music allows you to download complete MP3s of your entire music collection. Amazon MP3 allows you to download songs as often as you'd like. Now I don't expect to be able to remove actual playable songs from Spotify – because it's not a service that lets you purchase music. But what it does have an ethical obligation to do is let you export and remove the playlists (ordered lists of song names) in usable formats, including your list of Starred songs. Google allows you to export the data you put into it, and other companies like Facebook have reluctantly included the feature as well. With a service like Spotify, this kind of functionality is absolutely essential if it hopes to remain a major player. Imagine how much of a hassle buying a new phone would be if you couldn't transfer your phone numbers and contacts from one phone to the other? For people like me, our playlists and music libraries are just as important. When we try out new music services, we want to bring our progress with us.
The reason companies don't let you export is usually because they're afraid of losing users. Having an open data import and export feature doesn't let services like Spotify rely on trapping us instead of competing on their own merits. If Spotify began opening up export functionality, other services would begin to do the same and we'd all be a lot happier and sleep with a little more peace of mind.
Will you use Spotify forever?
If not being able to get your data back from Spotify doesn't sound like a problem, I have a few questions for you:
How many music services have you used in the last 10-15 years?
Can you see yourself using Spotify for the rest of your natural life?
Are you okay forgetting about every piece of music you're listening to?
Maybe some of you just don't care about your music collection. If so, Spotify is perfect. Hell, Pandora is better. If all music is just an endless radio station to you, then nothing I'm saying will matter to you. But if you form a connection to the music you listen to, then services like Spotify are an amazing development, but a troublesome reality.
Spotify could go out of business at any moment. Apple might buy it tomorrow just to shut it down like it did with Lala a few years ago. We have no idea, yet millions of us are investing tons of time creating playlist art projects that mean a lot to us, but are forever stuck within Spotify's green and black walls.
I knew getting into Spotify that I wouldn't technically own the free music I streamed, but I created these playlists and Starred these tracks. Spotify owns the actual music I'm streaming, but why does it get to own the lists of songs I create too?
I don't want to quit Spotify. It's probably the best music service I've ever used. But I value the things I create. The longer I am in Spotify's ecosystem, the greater my loss will be when it inevitably changes, falls apart, or I decide to leave. Outside of the U.S., Spotify used to sell actual music tracks. Now it doesn't even do that. Right now, Spotify is a cage, and it's not a particularly attractive one, either. If I have to live like the Gorillaz at the zoo, at least paint my walls like the jungle.
If most of our music services are indeed headed in the direction of Spotify, the music industry may have bigger problems ahead of it. Single companies like Spotify come and go, it's inevitable. Our entire music history shouldn't come and go with them.

The endless trade chatter surrounding Dwight Howard being dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers is making a lot of headlines as of late with a potential blockbuster on the horizon. It appears that the acquisition of two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash may have been the beginning of an overhaul to create another perennial NBA title contender in Los Angeles.
Despite the fact that trade talks to acquire Howard are reportedly ongoing, the Lakers' front office is addressing one of the major concerns of the off-season with upgrading the bench being a high priority.
According to Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak, the first step in bolstering the weakness off the bench is re-signing forward Jordan Hill via Elliot Teaford of the Los Angeles Daily News:
“Kupchak would neither confirm nor deny the talks. He said his immediate priority was to strengthen the Lakers' bench, which is heavy with guards and thin on forwards at present. Hill's re-signing appears to be atop Kupchak's to-do list.”
If this is true, the Lakers are definitely headed in the right direction in terms of free agency with Hill definitely proving his worth during the NBA playoffs. Hill has received plenty of interest around the league over the past two weeks, but has been rumored to be leaning towards re-signing with the Lakers with a potentially big role as a backup to Bynum and or Pau Gasol.
Hill can earn up to $3.6 million for up to five years in a new deal with the Lakers.
The Lakers have been in talks with many different free agents since the beginning of the free agency period, and appear to have some options regardless of the contract limitations.
As for the free agent options in the frontcourt, the Lakers have expressed interest in a few veteran forwards and centers. The top priority moving forward is to re-sign Hill, but they'll also consider bringing in Antawn Jamison, Jermaine O'Neal and or Anthony Tolliver.
The best option of the players list above is Jamison. Even though he's a 16-year veteran, Jamison still puts up consistently good numbers and would greatly improve the Lakers' offense off the bench. O'Neal and Tolliver are also viable options, but nothing more than backup plans at this point in time.
Clinton advisers acknowledged that the results of the primaries were far less than they had hoped, and said they were likely to face new pleas even from some of their own supporters for her to quit the race. They said they expected fund-raising to become even harder; one adviser said the campaign was essentially broke, and several others refused to say whether Mrs. Clinton had lent the campaign money from her personal account to keep it afloat.
The advisers said they were dispirited over the loss in North Carolina, after her campaign — now working off a shoestring budget as spending outpaces fund-raising — decided to allocate millions of dollars and full days of the candidate and her husband in the state. Even with her investment, Mr. Obama outspent Mrs. Clinton in both states.
For several hours, incomplete results from Lake County in Indiana — home to the city of Gary, just across the state line from Chicago — left the statewide tally in doubt. The delay meant that Mrs. Clinton did not appear on television until well after Mr. Obama, allowing him to put his stamp of victory on the evening.
With six primaries remaining on the Democratic calendar, the fight between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton now turns to Washington. The Obama campaign was poised to present a new cache of superdelegates — the party officials who may have to settle the nominating fight — as early as Wednesday to press its case that the results from Tuesday are reason enough to back his candidacy and end the torturous nominating fight.
In his speech earlier in the evening, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, congratulated Mrs. Clinton “for what appears to be her victory in the great state of Indiana.” Then, he used his televised forum to deliver a speech highlighting how he was likely to come under attack. In doing so, he made an argument for his viability in a general election, which his rivals believe has been damaged because of his association with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr..
“Yes, we know what's coming; I'm not naïve,” Mr. Obama said, adding, “The attempts to play on our fears and exploit our differences, to turn us against each other for political gain, to slice and dice this country into red states and blue states; blue-collar and white-collar; white, black, brown; young, old; rich, poor.”
“This is the race we expect” regardless of who is the Democratic nominee, he went on. “The question, then, is not what kind of campaign they will run; it's what kind of campaign we will run.”

Democrats said they expect to see more superdelegates flow to Mr. Obama in the next few days, including perhaps some now aligned with Mrs. Clinton.

Senator Claire McCaskill, an Obama supporter from Missouri, called the results “a big, big night” for Mr. Obama given the Wright episode. “This shows he can take major blows and kind of rise above it,” Ms. McCaskill said. “I think there was a sense that she has some momentum, and I think it has just ground to a screeching halt tonight.”
Despite Mrs. Clinton's performance, she pledged to take her campaign to West Virginia, Kentucky and the other states remaining on the primary calendar. And the campaign has been pushing the cause of seating disputed delegates from Florida and Michigan, states that were penalized for holding primaries before party rules allowed.
“You know it seems, it would be a little strange to have a nominee chosen by 48 states,” she told her supporters in Indianapolis. “We've got a long road ahead, but were going to keep fighting on that path because America is worth fighting for.”

The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee will convene on May 31 to settle the issue of whether to seat the delegates from those two states.
Going forward, both candidates intend to spend time in Washington, courting superdelegates and party officials.
Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, an Obama supporter, said the candidate accomplished what he needed to by outperforming expectations in both states and showing that Mr. Wright was not driving off voters en masse. “The next question will be what happens with the undecided superdelegates,” Mr. Nelson said. “Will they begin to come his way? I don't see anything to suggest they should start going her way.”
In North Carolina, Mr. Obama's performance was bolstered by a strong black vote. He captured more than 90 percent of those voters in that state, where blacks accounted for one in three voters. But over all, Mrs. Clinton continued to draw strong support among whites, particularly older women.
The voting in Indiana and North Carolina came at the conclusion of an acrimonious two-week campaign that found Mr. Obama on the defensive over incendiary remarks by Mr. Wright. Yet there was little evidence either argument caused significant shifts in electoral patterns of previous states, with most Clinton voters saying the Wright episode affected their vote and Obama backers saying it had not.

Once again, Mrs. Clinton drew most of her support from women and older voters. Mr. Obama held onto his mainstays of support — blacks, young voters and liberals — and made small gains in Indiana with lower-income white voters who have eluded him in the past.
In both states, the candidates' final arguments centered on a summertime suspension of the federal gasoline tax, which Mrs. Clinton proposed as an economic lift for voters and Mr. Obama derided as a political gimmick.
At this stage in the nominating fight, most voters seemed to have settled on their preferences before the battle intensified. Only a quarter of voters in Indiana decided whom to support in the last week, and a majority of backed Mrs. Clinton, while one in five voters in North Carolina also decided late, and most of them backed Mr. Obama.
The country's economic condition was listed as the chief concern of the Democratic primary voters. About 9 in 10 voters in Indiana and 8 in 10 voters in North Carolina said the economic slowdown had affected their family at least somewhat.
At least three in five voters in both states said the economy was the most important problem facing the country, according to surveys of voters leaving polling places that were conducted in both states by Edison/Mitofsky for the television networks and The Associated Press.
In Indiana, about 8 in 10 voters were white and about 15 percent were black. Six in 10 of the whites voted for Mrs. Clinton; about 9 in 10 blacks favored Mr. Obama.
Woodward: 'Secret government' at the root of problems
Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward said Sunday a huge “secret government” and a government on “automatic pilot” has led to many of the concerns now making headlines.
“They need to review this secret world,” he said of the Obama administration on “Face the Nation" on CBS. “You get to a point where it's what do you worry about? Secret government.”
National Security Agency spying both domestic and abroad and the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act are the results, he said.
“We have an incredibly powerful government that gets on automatic pilot,” he said. People aren't checking all of the boxes and the administration didn't properly “practice” Obamacare.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story had Woodward appearing on the wrong show.

Far be it from me to judge the decision by George Tiller's family today to "permanently close" his late abortion services clinic in Wichita, Kansas in light of the horrifying murder of their loved one.
In a statement released today, the Tiller family says, "We are proud of the service and courage shown by our husband and father and know that women's health care needs have been met because of his dedication and service." A consequence of closing the clinic is that Dr. Tiller's colleague, LeRoy Cathart, who intended to stay on and continue providing care to women, will no longer have the opportunity to do so.
Far be it from me, or anyone, to sit in judgment of the actions of Dr. Tiller's family unless we have walked in their shoes, unless we have witnessed the barbaric gunning down of a loved one, and even then, it is their call, and their call alone.
But, given that there are only a handful of other late abortion practitioners, in the country, some of whom, like Dr. Tiller, daily risk infamy, injury, and worse to dedicate themselves to protecting the lives of women, one can't help but wonder what signal permanently closing Tiller's clinic sends to those who would like to put a permanent end to choice. In the words of a Boulder late abortion provider, "this is what they want. They've been wanting this for 35 years." And, today, the Tiller family have given choice opponents what they've wanted.
For more than 20 years, George Tiller, and his clinic, have been the target of choice opponents. This was not the first time the Kansas physician was the victim of a barbaric, and heinous, act of violence, but it was the last time.
Today, too, it is fair to say that Dr. Tiller is no longer alone. Today, we're all victims as fear has triumphed and we, as a society, have taken one huge step back to the days when a mother can, once again, be allowed to die in childbirth. Only a hundred years ago, we didn't have the science to prevent the tragic loss of the mother's life; now we do. Only now, there are some who would like to take us back to the same mindset that makes procreation a woman's primary raison d'etre. So, indeed, when Scott Roeder took George Tiller's life, not only did he commit first degree murder, it was a hate crime against women.
By closing the Wichita clinic, women will be denied access to a medically-necessary procedure, and one intended to save their lives, a message that fear is the most powerful weapon of all.
A picture taken by mobile phone shows a funeral in Homs, which has become a bastion of anti-government rallies [AFP]
Syrian forces have killed at least 28 people in a massive tank-backed raid on the central city of Homs, rights activists say, while Syria's strongest ally Iran made a surprising call for President Bashar al-Assad to end the violent crackdown.
Wednesday's security operation came after 2,000 people had taken to the streets of the city a day earlier, activists said.
Most of the killings occurred in old neighbourhoods of Homs, situated on the main northern highway 165km from the capital Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based independent Syrian rights group, said.
"Military reinforcements including 20 truckloads of soldiers entered the city," it said, opening "intense gunfire in the market and governorate headquarters".
The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), which organises the anti-regime protests on the ground, said the death toll continues to increase in Homs, where communications and internet services was cut in many neighbourhoods on Wednesday.
At least two people were killed in raids and attacks on Idlib province's Sarmeen, and one other in the northern city of Hama, the LCC said.
State-run news agency SANA reported that a "terrorist group" kidnapped two Baath party officials in the town of Rastan, near Homs, on Wednesday.
"That may be the reason behind the intense raids in Homs," Al Jazeera's Omar al-Saleh reported from neighbouring Jordan. The Syrian government bans international journalists from entering the country.
Activists and residents said heavy machine-gun fire was heard in the Bab Dreib and Bostan Diwan neighbourhoods of Homs on Tuesday night after the protesters had set out for the area from Bab Tadmor.
Visit postponed
The security operations came just hours after Syria requested Nabil Elaraby, the Arab League secretary-general, to delay his visit to Damascus, "due to circumstances beyond our control", SANA said late on Tuesday.
League officials said Elaraby will now visit Syria on Saturday.
Elaraby had been commissioned by the 22-member bloc to travel on Wednesday with a 13-point document outlining proposals to end the government's bloody crackdown on dissent and push Syria to launch reforms.
According to a copy of the document, he was to propose that Assad hold elections in three years, move towards a pluralistic government and immediately halt the crackdown on anti-government protesters.
The initiative, agreed at an Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last month, calls for a "clear declaration of principles by Assad specifying commitment to reforms he made in past speeches".
The initiative angered Syria which said it contained "unacceptable and biased language".
'Crimes against humanity'
Separately on Wednesday, the French foreign minister accused Syria of "crimes against humanity" and expressed a desire for Russia's support in a UN condemnation of the crackdown.
The Syrian authorities should be sent "a powerful signal that such actions cannot continue", Alain Juppe said during his talks in Moscow with Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart.
France has urged Russia to support a UN
condemnation of the crackdown [EPA]
Lavrov did not respond to Juppe's expressions of hope for Russia to change its stance and back UN condemnation of the crackdown.
"We consider that inciting certain forces within the opposition to boycott the invitation to dialogue is a dangerous path and risks a repetition of the Libyan scenario, which neither Russia nor France wants," Lavrov said.
Syria's regime, which has promised to launch a wide range of reforms to appease the protest movement, blames the deadly unrest on foreign-backed "armed terrorist gangs".
Mohammad Jleilati, the Syrian finance minister, acknowledged on Wednesday that the violence has driven down economic growth expectations lower.
"The current circumstances, no doubt, have some negative impact on the economy. We hope to overcome it through reforms," he said on the sidelines of an Arab ministerial meeting in Abu Dhabi when asked about economic growth.
The US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, went on Facebook on Wednesday to denounce the Assad government over its crackdown on protests, which the UN says has left 2,200 people dead since March.
Our pick SimpliSafe Easy, affordable monitoring The third generation of SimpliSafe is the most affordable and comprehensive of the no-contract systems we tested. It's also easy to install and use, and it works with some Alexa and Google voice commands. Buying Options $260 from SimpliSafe
SimpliSafe is a flexible, affordable, and easy-to-use live-monitoring security option. It's one of the most reliable systems we tested, with customizable alarm triggers and consistent monitoring response times. It's also easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and you can configure your system with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. It even works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to arm and check the system using only voice commands.
We think that SimpliSafe is very appropriately priced, offering the security-focused person just what they need, and the company doesn't push more than what's necessary for basic monitoring. The $230 Foundation package includes the base station, a keypad, one entry sensor, one motion sensor, a yard sign, and two window decals. (SimpliSafe is the only no-contract company we looked at that includes a yard sign in the starter kit.) For $15 per month, you can add around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a traditional landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control via iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available separately.
SimpliSafe is a no-contract security system, which means you pay for monitoring service on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a year or more term at a time. It also means you may have to pay more up front for hardware than you would with some of the companies that want to lock you into a lengthy service agreement. However, paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. You can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you want. If you cancel, you lose the monitoring and remote access, but the sensors and sirens still work, so you'll still have an alarm you can set when you're home at night.
The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third version, with a simpler and more stylish design for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller, but the range is better, so you can place equipment less obtrusively almost anywhere in an average-size home.
SimpliSafe and Ring are the only no-contract systems to provide a standalone, wireless keypad as part of the starter package. The SimpliSafe's keypad gives you access to far more functions: Beyond arming and disarming, you can change to system settings, add devices, and enter test modes to make sure things are working. This keypad runs on batteries, so you can mount it anywhere. The soft keypad buttons provide good feedback as you press them, and the system reacts quickly along with each press. And since the keypad is separate from the base station, even if a burglar manages to break the keypad, they haven't actually disabled the system.
The base station is the brains behind the system. It includes Wi-Fi and cellular (with a subscription) connections to the central monitoring station, which means it doesn't need to be connected to a router, making it easy to place anywhere in the home. It also features a 24-hour battery backup, blue and red lights for alerts, UL certification, and an adjustable 95 dB siren—not the loudest alarm, but more than sufficient for the average-size home. (If you want to go louder, or if you have a large home and need more than one siren, you can add a standalone 105 dB siren for an extra cost.)
The base station provides voice prompts during setup, as well as when the system is arming, disarming, and triggered. When the system is triggered, the voice alerts you to enter your passcode before the system starts beeping. You can also integrate SimpliSafe into an Alexa smart-home setup, which enables you to arm the system in Home or Away mode or to check the system's status using voice commands. (For security reasons, however, you cannot currently disarm the system using voice commands.)
SimpliSafe's contact sensors for doors and windows are small enough to hide in white trim; the motion sensor is noticeable, but not an eyesore. When placed about 6.5 feet off the ground, the motion sensor was quick to respond, but it was never triggered by a 30-pound dog. SimpliSafe also sells extra entry sensors, water and freeze sensors, glass-break sensors, panic buttons, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors, and temperature sensors. It offers indoor cameras, which may not be on a par with our camera picks, but allow for Visual Verification, an opt-in feature that allows the monitoring service to look in to confirm an emergency. In 2018, the company also introduced a new smart video doorbell with two-way audio that also works in conjunction with the SimpliSafe system; these videos can be backed up and stored as part of the monthly Interactive plan as well. You can purchase additional window stickers and yard signs, too.
Although entry and exit triggers are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. The service was also always polite; and for security, it requires a safe word to restore the peace.
October 2018, SimpliSafe added the Video Doorbell Pro, which works in conjunction with the system and as a standalone doorbell. Unlike the security system, this wired doorbell doesn't need a paid plan to send smartphone alerts when motion is detected or when someone rings the bell. However, if you want to capture any sort of recording, you'll need to pay $5 per month or add SimpliSafe's Interactive plan, which includes cloud storage. We tried using the doorbell with and without a monitoring subscription. The camera uses HDR technology to deliver stellar 1080p images by day, with clear two-way audio. Nighttime images weren't as detailed, but were fine when trying to identify people approaching the house. One thing we didn't love was how the motion detection would trigger every time a truck or larger car would drive by 40 feet away from our front door, even on the lowest sensitivity setting. However, you can turn off motion sensing so it alerts when the doorbell is pressed. With the $5 plan, the doorbell will make one-minute clips, with gaps in between that varied between one and two minutes. With the Interactive monitoring plan, it will automatically record one-minute clips when any part of the system is armed, disarmed, or triggers a secret alert (private notifications sent by specific sensors). Similar to other SimpliSafe cameras, if there is an actual event, the doorbell will make a five-minute clip—or more, if the trigger continues. With the Interactive plan, the doorbell can also be tied into Visual Verification, as long as that feature is enabled.
We're not alone in liking SimpliSafe. Home Alarm Report, Tom's Guide, and PCMag all had positive things to say about this latest version of the system. The biggest gripe is limited smart-home integration options, which the company began to add only in early 2018.
Obama at the helm with the world on the brink
March 13, 2011
THE Department For Education was accused of gagging a controversial right-wing British journalist from speaking at a school in Kent.
Milo Yiannopoulos was due to speak tomorrow night in Canterbury but the school cancelled the event after concerns from Whitehall about extremism — prompting the writer to brand Theresa May “a total fascist.”
Rex 4 Milo Yiannopoulos has branded Theresa May a "total fascist" after he was banned from speaking at his old school
The gay Donald Trump supporter is a media star in America after using Twitter and Facebook to become the poster boy of the controversial “alt-right” movement.
The 32 year old provocateur was due to address pupils tomorrow at the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury — despite being expelled more than a decade ago.
But on Monday the school's head teacher claimed he had been leant on by the “Department For Education's counter extremism unit” into cancelling the talk.

Milo hit back, telling The Sun: “So everybody's worst fears that Theresa May is a total fascist have been confirmed by her sinister counter extremist goons.”
He went on: “”Perhaps they should spend a little more time stopping jihadis brainwashing British school kids and less time persecuting gays they disagree with.”
Yiannopoulos, who writes for the US right-wing website Breitbart, was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's successful bid for the White House, nicknaming the President-Elect “Daddy”.

His aggressive and deliberately offensive sense of humour have won him celebrity status among angry young men and anti-feminists.
But the self-described “internet super villain” has made plenty of enemies in recent months, resulting in a ban from Twitter in July.
Since then the former Telegraph journalist has embarked on a round of lectures at American universities, named “The Dangerous Faggot Tour”.
Rex 4 He was due to speak tomorrow evening at Simon Langton Grammar School - where he was expelled from as a pupil
At one such talk at the University of California, Santa Barbara he was carried into the lecture theatre on a golden throne by students wearing Donald Trump caps and singing “America F--- Yeah!”
His flamboyant rallies have often been marred with protests and scuffles with left-wing activists who object to his uncompromising message.
In a statement head teacher Matthew Baxter said: “This decision was taken following contact from the
Department For Education's counter extremism unit, the threat of demonstrations at the school by organised groups and members of the public and our overall concerns for the security of the school site and the safety of our community.
“We note that within 24 hours of advertising the event, more than 220 Langton sixth formers had, with parental consent, signed up for the event and that objection to our hosting Mr Yiannopoulus came almost entirely from people with no direct connection to the Langton.

“The staff and students of the school were overwhelmingly in favour.
“While disappointed that both the pastoral care and intellectual preparation we offer to our students has been called into question, we at the Langton remain committed to the principle of free speech and open debate and will resist, where possible, all forms of censorship.”
A Department for Education spokesperson said: “When concerns are raised by members of the public following media coverage in advance of an event, the department would contact the school as a matter of routine to check they had considered any potential issues. The decision to cancel the event was a matter for the school.”
Yesterday, a scarecrow made of mashed potatoes named Jamie Kirchick wrote an op-ed for the New York Times bemoaning how “transgender trumps treachery” for those who praise Chelsea Manning. Kirchick lamented the attention that Manning's lipstick color choices and fashion sense receive, despite her having “jeopardized continuing missions and disrupted American diplomacy” by leaking hundreds of thousands of military documents to Wikileaks.
It was hard not to note that the op-ed appeared in a paper that reported extensively on the contents of the Wikileaks trove, in its War Logs series. Among those reports, one from October 2010 titled “Use of Contractors Added to War's Chaos in Iraq” detailed the “many abuses, including civilian deaths” perpetrated by military contractors like Blackwater USA, and described how the documents had revealed a “lack of accountability” for contractors:
The archive, which describes many episodes never made public in such detail, shows the multitude of shortcomings with this new system: how a failure to coordinate among contractors, coalition forces and Iraqi troops, as well as a failure to enforce rules of engagement that bind the military, endangered civilians as well as the contractors themselves. The military was often outright hostile to contractors, for being amateurish, overpaid and, often, trigger-happy.
How embarrassing, to run an op-ed that decries the leaking of the very documents that the paper's reporters relied on for such useful and worthy journalism!
Not even 24 hours later, the Times has outdone itself. Today it published an op-ed by Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, the most notorious of private military contractors—so notorious it was forced to change its name, twice.
Just to remind you, Blackwater is the private military contractor, whose employees:

The paper has reported testimony from survivors of the incident:

Blackwater vehicles were there, and its soldiers were shooting at people without pity.” He added, “It was as if I was watching a horror movie.” [The New York Times, April 14 2015]

And the repercussions those victims live with:
Mr. Salman got back to his car and continued on with his day, a Blackwater bullet still lodged in his arm, another next to his heart. [The New York Times, October 23, 2014]
More recently, the paper has reported on Prince's post-Blackwater efforts, including, less than two months ago, his “proposals to rely on contractors instead of American troops in Afghanistan,” developed “at the behest of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, his senior adviser and son-in-law.”

So today the New York Times chose to use some of the most influential and prestigious real estate in the American media landscape to let Prince make his bid to run the continuing intervention in Afghanistan. It is less an op-ed than a pitch deck directed straight at the President of the United States (who, it is well known, is obsessed with the paper), promising that Prince's new firm, Frontier Services Group, would:
vigorously compete to implement a plan that saves American lives, costs less than 20 percent of current spending and saves American taxpayers more than $40 billion a year. Just as no one criticizes Elon Musk because his company SpaceX helps supply American astronauts, no one should criticize a private company — mine or anyone else's — for helping us end this ugly multigenerational war.
Among all the voices clamoring to be heard in America, with all the possible arguments on all the pressing issues of the moment, the New York Times chose to let an irredeemable war profiteer pitch his plan for More And Better War—a pitch aimed directly into the increasingly febrile mind of the president.

Astoundingly, the paper paid Prince for this, and not the other way around. The newspaper industry is in need of new revenue sources, after all, and it could simplify things to start simply selling op-eds to the highest corporate bidders. Dispense with the authors and those tricky disclosures, and just give the bylines to the companies themselves. Corporations are people, right? Let's see what Exxon Mobil has to say about climate change, or Coca-Cola about childhood obesity. Maybe they should let Google write an op-ed about why privacy is overrated, or the GEO Group pen a stirring defense of mass incarceration.
If you work for the opinion section of the New York Times, and you got into this line of work hoping that what you did would, even in some small sense, serve the public good, and you have the means to do so, resign. Run screaming from the building. Go and work on a farm. Live in the woods. Repent and be saved. There is no glory in what you do.

This takes into account the total taxes imposed in a country at all levels, national and local, as a share of GDP. In countries like France the progressive income tax rates are applicable only to the top economic half of the population. This breakdown is available only for OECD member countries (smaller than our Misery set) and uses end-of-2003 data (the latest official information). We include a column estimating total government spending to reflect the fiscal deficits being run in most nations, covered by debt, hidden taxes, profits from state-owned monopolies and the sale of government assets.

Ramadan Terrorism: 90 killed in Truck Bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan
Egregious act of terror turns the Kabul morning rush hour into a scene of carnage.
Via Breitbart News, on Wednesday morning in Kabul, a large truck bomb was detonated in the city's diplomatic district inflicting enormous casualties, with 90 confirmed dead and over 400 wounded, 11 of which were American. The suicide attack occurred in the heavily guarded and relatively secure diplomatic district of Kabul, home to several foreign embassies and other governmental buildings. The timing of the incident was imperative to inducing maximum casualties and the largest possible damage, as the crowds of morning commuters formed a prime target.
The Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, despite their history of targeting the Afghani government. It is still unclear who is to blame for this atrocity, as no terror organization has come forward and taken responsibility thus far.
President Trump met with the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss the incident. Trump's spokesperson says that the United States “strongly condemns” the attack, and acknowledges that several Americans were wounded.
The UN Security Council also condemned the attack and called it “heinous and cowardly”. The council further stated “that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.” The UN urges that all countries cooperate with the Afghan government in finding and prosecuting those responsible for organizing the attack.
Historically, incidents of terror spike during the celebration of Ramadan. ISIS has explicitly called for an “all- out war” on the West on the eve of Ramadan:“Muslim brothers in Europe who can't reach the Islamic State lands, attack them in their homes, their markets, their roads and their forums…” . If the recent tragedies in Kabul and Manchester are any indication of what is to come, then the West and the Middle East alike would be well advised to stay vigilant through the Islamic holy month.
At the centre of a storm over the protests by women students on his campus, the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is caught in another controversy. Barely a day before the government's freeze on recruitment kicks in given that he is retiring in two months, V-C Girish Chandra Tripathi pushed several faculty appointments, including one of a teacher indicted for sexual harassment, in the meeting of the Executive Council (EC) held here today.

According to HRD Ministry's order, all Central university heads are prohibited from making appointments in the last two months of their term. Tripathi retires as BHU V-C on November 27. As per the government directive, he is disallowed from making appointments starting Wednesday, that is September 27.
The proposal to regularise O P Upadhyay's appointment as Medical Superintendent of Sir Sunderlal Hospital, on the BHU campus, met with resistance in the EC meeting after a member objected to the move citing Upadhyay's conviction for sexual harassment in a magistrate court in Fiji.
“A member pointed that instead of initiating an inquiry against the person concerned, the university is urging the EC to regularise his appointment,” said an EC member on the condition of anonymity. It's not clear if Upadhyay's appointment was pushed through. “It will only be clear once the minutes of the meeting are circulated,” the member added.

Sources said that while there is a question mark over Upadhyay's appointment, most of the other appointments went through.
The EC is the highest decision-making body of the university and all candidates finalised by the selection committee of different departments have to be mandatorily cleared by it. The V-C heads both, the EC and the selection committees of different departments.

Upadhyay has been acting as Medical Superintendent of Sir Sunderlal Hospital since April 2016. In 2013, the magistrates court at Nasinu in Fiji held him guilty of sexually harassing a 21-year-old woman. The proposal to “regularise” his appointment gains significance against the backdrop of the ongoing crisis in BHU which was triggered by an alleged incident of sexual harassment on campus.
Students this week gathered outside the VC's residence to protest the incident and several women students were injured when the police allegedly used force to remove them
When asked if the university tabled a proposal regarding Upadhyay's appointment, Tripathi told The Indian Express, “Yes there was such a proposal and I recall there were objections (in the meeting). But since there is a matter regarding this pending in the (Allahabad) High Court, we will have to wait for the court's verdict.”
Asked specifically if Upadhyay's appointment was cleared, he said, “Appointments are a routine affair and I do not recall the decision regarding one specific appointment. Please wait for a day.”
When contacted by The Indian Express on Tuesday night, Upadhyay said: “The university had taken legal opinion in my matter and it was decided that the decision of a court abroad does not hold good in our country. Hence, I was interviewed and selected by selection committee. I was on study leave (in Fiji), it was a case of extortion and because I resisted it, I was falsely accused.”

Between August 22 and September 25, the BHU selection committees, chaired by Tripathi, had interviewed approximately 300 candidates for different posts over 17 days. The names of selected candidates were tabled for EC's approval on Tuesday.
Following the Obama administration's deeply controversial decision to cede U.S. control over key elements of the Internet's architecture, experts and former officials are warning that the United Nations and its largely autocratic member regimes are already plotting to tax and censor the World Wide Web. According to analysts, the UN would almost certainly start small — perhaps levying tiny “fees” on certain Web-based activities, or regulating content that virtually everybody would find objectionable — before quickly expanding the global Internet regime to raise vast sums of taxpayer cash while censoring free speech. The battle, however, is likely to be fierce.
Among the most troubling scenarios envisioned by multiple experts is the very real possibility that, by imposing taxes on Web use, the UN would finally be able to free itself from the last remaining constraint on its growth and power — the fact that it currently depends on member governments for funding. Indeed, at least one university professor is even sounding the alarm about the new “robber barons” at the UN, salivating over the prospect of imposing planetary taxes via control of the Internet. However, Prof. Karl Borden, who teaches financial economics at the University of Nebraska, warned in a Wall Street Journal column that the threat posed by UN taxers would be even more severe and hard to fight.
The original “robber barons,” he explained, were 13th century extortionists along the Rhine River who forced passing ships to pay tribute in exchange for passage. If the UN gets its way on global Internet taxes, though, the damage would be far worse than the havoc caused by powerful German thieves of centuries past. “Should the U.N. end up in charge, it would have a chokehold on the global economy and a vast stream of revenue that would make it even more unaccountable than it already is,” Borden explained, adding that global Internet taxes would start modestly before ballooning out of control, much like the U.S. income tax.
“Power follows the money, and bureaucratic appetites are voracious,” he continued. “Who will there be to stop the process, after all? Where is the elected legislative body that will answer to the world's population that finally pays these ‘fees'?... With constitutional government it becomes at least possible for citizens to say ‘No—No more!' No such checks are in place for a global bureaucracy that will have the power to reach into every pocket on earth.” With the Internet set to become the essential infrastructure for participating in the global economy, Borden said, controlling the “rivers” of the future will permit the financing of a perpetually expanding international bureaucracy.
The implications are frightening — especially because getting rid of the global extortion would be extraordinarily tough once it got going. “The robber barons of the 13th century were finally stopped only when the Rhine League, consisting of merchants and aristocrats, banded together to tear down their castles and hang them,” Borden concluded. “The robber barons of the 21st century may be much more difficult to deal with.”
Indeed, as The New American and countless critics have been warning for decades, if and when the UN gets the power to impose its own taxes, it would be able to fund its own “peace” army, police, tax collectors, regulators, bureaucrats, and global tyranny without any remaining constraints. While the outfit, often blasted as the “dictators' club,” has floated proposals to tax everything from billionaires and financial transactions to “carbon emissions” and air travel, the prospect of a global Internet tax could be even more appealing.
Former U.S. officials have also issued similar warnings in recent weeks about the potential for Internet mischief if the UN were to ever be allowed near the levers of online power. “This is the Obama equivalent of Carter's decision to give away the Panama Canal — only with possibly much worse consequences,” former Bush administration State Department senior advisor Christian Whiton told the Daily Caller last month after the administration announced the end of its constitutionally dubious ties to the California-based organization that manages crucial components of the Internet's architecture.
“While the Obama administration says it is merely removing federal oversight of a non-profit, we should assume ICANN would end up as part of the United Nations,” Whiton continued. “If the U.N. gains control [of] what amounts to the directory and traffic signals of the Internet, it can impose whatever taxes it likes. It likely would start with a tax on registering domains and expand from there.... What little control there is over the U.N. would be gone.” Also alarming, Whiton noted that under “invariably incompetent U.N. control,” a hostile foreign power might even be able to disable America's Internet access — with potentially devastating consequences.
Of course, as The New American has documented extensively, the UN and numerous “member” dictators around the world — from Communists and Socialists to Islamists — have been scheming for years to take over and regulate the Internet. Multiple ploys have been attempted, with globalists and autocrats particularly pushing an effort to have the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) seize control over the Web at a series of globalist conferences. One proposal even called for the creation of an Internet “kill switch.” Another would have created a global surveillance regime to monitor everyone's online activities. Taxes, too, have been high on the agenda for the would-be planetary Internet regulators.
All of those schemes failed at the time, partly due to resistance from the West, but the threat never dissipated. In March, though, with global outrage boiling over lawless and unconstitutional NSA spying, the Obama administration's Department of Commerce made a stunning, quiet announcement. Building on plans first developed under former President Bush, the U.S. government revealed that it would be relinquishing all remaining control over the so-called “root” or “keys” of the Internet next year to a non-profit multinational organization known as Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN.
As part of the plan to “transition” toward Internet control by so-called “global stakeholders,” U.S. officials vowed to keep online freedom alive. “I want to make clear that we will not accept a proposal that replaces the [Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration] role with a government-led or an intergovernmental solution,” said NTIA chief Larry Strickling, echoing past statements by administration officials.
As The New American reported last month, the ICANN organization has also promised to keep the Internet free. However, a statement by its current director, Fade Chehade, about “the world” wanting to “participate” in “shaping” the Web has sparked concerns — especially the notion that the “global community” would be replacing U.S. stewardship of the Internet with “appropriate oversight mechanisms.” Chehade signed an international declaration last year that also alarmed critics, saying that stakeholders, “including all governments,” would be allowed to participate in the “globalization” of ICANN on an “equal footing.”
Meanwhile, numerous experts and officials are already warning that the upcoming “transition” in Internet governance risks allowing the UN and its mostly dictatorial “member states” to seize control over the Web, as they have been plotting to do for years. Think the Communist Chinese regime's “Great Firewall of China” — but imposed on the world, eventually. Citing a wide array of concerns, however, countless critics, including many in Congress, are examining the issue and considering various options to ensure that the dictators' club and its mostly tyrannical members never get the opportunity to tax or censor the global Internet.
“While I certainly agree our nation must stridently review our procedures regarding surveillance in light of the NSA controversy, to put ourselves in a situation where censorship-laden governments like China or Russia could take a firm hold on the Internet itself is truly a scary thought,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), one of many concerned Republican lawmakers. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee and with the Commerce Department on this, because — to be blunt — the ‘global Internet community' this would empower has no First Amendment.”
The U.S. government, of course, has no constitutional authority to control, oversee, or regulate the architecture of the Internet. If online freedom is to survive, though, the Web and all of its components must be kept completely out of the hands of the out-of-control UN and its dozens of ruthless “member states.” Indeed, aside from punishing actual crimes that may involve the Internet in some way, experts say there is no reason for government to have any role at all in managing the Web.

The United Nations: On the Brink of Becoming a World Government
CHRIS Judd has inspired Carlton to a thrilling comeback victory over Richmond in the first elimination final at the MCG on Sunday.
The Blues clawed their way back from a 32-point deficit to win by 20 points before a record elimination final crowd of 94,690.
Carlton only earned its finals spot after seventh-placed Essendon was ruled out of September action by the AFL and looked set for an early exit when they trailed by more than five goals points at the three-minute mark of the third term.
But former skipper Judd, returning after a three-week absence with a knee injury, got the Blues back into the game with an outstanding 11-possession third term that sparked them to a memorable 18.8 (116) to 14.12 (96) victory.
The resurgent Blues will now play the Sydney Swans at ANZ Stadium next Saturday night.
It was a heartbreaking return to the finals for the Tigers after 12 long years, with the yellow and black army largely responsible for swelling the crowd to the biggest number for a week-one final since the introduction of the final five in 1972.
The previous highest crowd was 91,900 at the 1972 Richmond-Collingwood qualifying final.
Blues coach Mick Malthouse paid tribute to his team's ability to keep fighting despite the Tigers' early dominance. "We don't want to be chasing all day, but nonetheless, I half suspected, in fairness to the Tigers who are a side I admire, maybe a few of them played their game early," Malthouse said. "Persistence is wonderful if you keep at sides like that."
As good as Judd (25 possessions and one goal) was, he had plenty of help with late inclusion Nick Duigan a surprise star up forward with four goals straight.
Jarrad Waite was also important for the Blues up forward with four goals, while Bryce Gibbs delivered on his undeniable talent with 27 possessions (18 contested) and a game-high 12 clearances.
Blues skipper Marc Murphy (26 possessions) did more than anyone to keep Carlton in the game in the first half when the Tigers were controlling general play.
The Tigers' cause was not helped when Reece Conca appeared to suffer a severe hamstring injury a little more than 10 minutes into the game.
Substitute Shane Tuck was brought on to replace Conca almost immediately and the early substitution would have been a factor in the Tigers' inability to match the Blues' run in the second half.
Richmond coach Damien Hardwick said Conca's injury had been a factor in his team's second-half fadeout but laid most of the blame on their contested play and scoring from stoppages "The fact of the matter is we probably had two strengths that we came into the game with, one being defensive 50 contested balls and we went down by -18 in that area," Hardwick said. "The other one is scores from stoppage versus opposition. I think we were No.2 in the AFL and we gave up 30 goals for the year. We gave up 11 today. "So two normal strengths went away as two weaknesses, which cost us the game." Hardwick did not think his young team had been affected by the occasion, saying playing Carlton in a final at the MCG was always going to be a 50-50 game.
The Tigers' senior players led the way for their young team, with Brett Deledio (24 possessions) and Trent Cotchin (26) showing they belonged on the September stage.
Dustin Martin (19 possessions) was outstanding in the first three quarters but faded from the game in the final term.
Richmond showed no signs of nerves in their return to the finals, dominating general play in the first quarter. The Tigers had 19 inside 50s to the Blues' six but their inaccuracy in front of goal meant they led by just eight points at quarter-time.
The Tigers looked set to skip out to a match-winning lead early in the second term, when they rammed on four straight goals to lead by 25 points at the 10-minute mark.
But from there the Blues started to work their way back into the game, kicking three of the next five goals to get back to within 20 points late in the term.
They could have been even closer too, but gave away four costly 50m penalties in the first half, three of which resulted in Richmond goals.
And a Trent Cotchin goal after the half-time siren sent the Tigers into the main break with a handy 26-point lead.
Family of Murdered Jewish Woman Condemn Media Silence After Brutal ‘'Anti-Semitic'' Attack by Violent Muslim
Sarah Halimi, well known in the Paris Orthodox community, was brutally beaten and thrown to her death from her third-floor apartment by a ‘'radicalized'' Muslim neighbor.
It was the crime that should have shocked France – a quiet Jewish woman mercilessly beaten by a young Muslim neighbor in the middle of the night before being thrown to her death from her Paris apartment. All this to recitations of the Koran and cries of ‘'Allahu Akbar'' while police waited outside for the arrival of an anti-terrorist unit.
Yet few outside of the Jewish community heard of the crime last month, with essential elements being omitted from mainstream press reports of the horrific attack. Six weeks after the violent death of 66-year-old Sarah Halimi, her family are speaking out.
Holding a press conference on Monday, lawyers speaking on their behalf stated their belief that the crime was anti-Semitic in nature and condemned the ‘'silence of the media'' in the aftermath of the crime.
Until recently the devout family had been observing the 30-day period of mourning called for under Jewish law, lawyer Jean-Alex Buchinger explained, but now this period has ended, they were eager to work for the full emergence of the facts.
Recounting the details of the crime, the family's lawyer – who has had access to the police file on the murder – called the accused a ‘'terrorist'' that had knowingly broken into the apartment of the 66-year-old grandmother in the middle of the night in order to ‘'torture and kill her.''
The 27-year-old suspect, Kada Traoré, a Muslim of Malian origin, was arrested by police at the scene of the crime and has been hospitalized in a psychiatric ward ever since.
Traoré, who holds a long criminal record and was allegedly radicalized in prison, has not yet been fully questioned by police, the family's lawyer revealed.
Having scaled an exterior wall to enter her apartment by the balcony window, the accused subjected his victim to a violent ordeal culminating in her murder – Mrs. Halimi's lifeless body was found three stories below her Belleville apartment on the morning of April 4th. Traoré was hospitalized after reportedly telling police that the Koran commanded him to commit the act.
Rue de Vaucouleurs, in a working class area of Belleville, Paris, where the deceased was thrown to her death on April 4th. Photo courtesy of Le Parisien.
‘'He massacred her with blows, salvos of punches interrupted by recitations of surahs (verses) of the Koran and of ‘'Allahu Akbar''. How do we know this? The neighbors – although not present in the apartment – heard everything'', Buchinger continued referencing the existence of a six-minute audio recording of the attack made by one neighbor.
Dozens of neighbors were reportedly witness to the drama in the early hours of April 4th. Only six are now prepared to testify however.
Initial reports of an Islamist motive on the part of the accused had been quickly dismissed as wild rumors and dropped from the official investigation, a press conference days after the murder suggested, with some observers at the time speculating that these details were being omitted to keep the story from exploding until after the presidential election campaign.
Describing her apartment as being covered in blood following the attack, Mr. Buchinger criticized the length of time it took for authorities to intervene; the police already present – believing Traoré to be armed – are said to have waited over an hour outside Mrs. Halimi's apartment for an anti-terrorist unit to arrive. The family reserved the right to insist on an investigation if light were not shed on this aspect of the operation, the lawyer explained.
William Attal, the brother of the victim spoke during the press conference, stating that he was shocked at the inaction of police at the scene and at how the ‘'anti-Semitic and Islamist motive'' behind the crime had not been pursued.
Writing in Monday's Le Figaro, a second lawyer for the family, writer Gilles-William Goldnadel, denounced ‘'the new anti-Semitism in France'', and the cover-up of the real story; a young radicalized Muslim torturing and throwing an elderly Jewish woman to her death to the general indifference of the public.

Goldnadel, asked to represent the family by the sister of the deceased, recounted how Mrs. Halimi had feared her attacker and previously been subjected to anti-Semitic taunts of ‘'sale juive'' (‘'dirty Jew''). Her attacker, fitting the typical profile of a small-time thug turned Islamic radical, presented no previous signs of psychiatric illness, Goldnadel noted, and yet at the height of the presidential campaign, his crime was put down to the actions of a madman – the now default media response to Islamic terrorism in France.
In a television interview Sunday night, the lawyer criticized the ‘'endless psychiatrization of Islamist terrorists'', suggesting that if the murder had been committed by a white person, there would have been demonstrations in the streets.
‘'Since it involves a Muslim extremist, all of political and media France keep quiet'', he observed.
Few establishment journalists and not one candidate raised the crime in the context of the presidential campaign, a debate which largely focused on economic issues over security and immigration. Could it be that the story would have made for uncomfortable subject matter for the media's preferred candidate, President Emmanuel Macron, a strong advocate for multiculturalism and liberal immigration policy? Cover-up, politically correct black-out or otherwise, the family of the unfortunate victim are adamant that the truth be revealed and justice served.

On Monday, three days after Boston police arrested 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings, Reddit general manager Erik Martin issued an apology. It had not been the best of weeks for his online community. Law enforcement officials had explained that one of their motivations for releasing surveillance camera footage of the Tsarnaev brothers was to put an end to the wild speculation on sites like Reddit, where anyone with a backpack was being floated as a possible suspect. Redditors never came close to identifying the Tsarnaevs, instead casting their suspicions on a missing Brown University student named Sunil Tripathi. (Tripathi was found dead in the Providence River on Thursday morning.)
Martin was contrite. “[S]ome of the activity on reddit fueled online witch hunts and dangerous speculation which spiraled into very negative consequences for innocent parties,” he wrote, referring to a smaller sub-community, or subreddit, on his site that was devoted to catching the Boston bombers. “The reddit staff and the millions of people on reddit around the world deeply regret that this happened.”
Redditors have, for years, worked to use the resources of crowds as a force for good. There's an entire subreddit dedicated to Redditors ordering pizzas for families and raising money for surgeries. But Boston represents a reality check. Can Reddit harness its greatest asset—the tireless brainstorming of millions—while reining in the speculative impulse that makes the site tick? And even if Reddit could solve crimes, would it be worth it?
Reddit's powers of sleuthing didn't begin with Boston. The idea for the Reddit Bureau of Investigation subreddit came in 2012, after 17-year-old Amarillo High School senior Haley Wilson went missing. Her father, Ray, posted notices on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (where his video got 1.1 million views). A notice was also posted to Reddit by a user with the handle everhood13, with the heading, “One of my students went missing after Christmas. Please spread this. We are all worried about her.” The post received 1,594 upvotes. One week later police in Carlsbad, California, pulled over Haley's car and shortly after that, Ray Wilson was reunited with his daughter. Mischief managed.
Reddit had played a marginal role at best in amplifying the case, but it offered a glimpse of the community's approach to problem-solving. One user attempted to calculate Haley's approximate location using her estimated cash-on-hand and the gas mileage associated with the make and model of her car. Another suggested the father hack her computer. “[I] think you should get some contact info for her father and then find someone on /r/netsec to remote desktop into her pc and start digging thru her internet search tracks,” read the most up-voted comment.
That gave Redditors an idea: Why not turn the site into the world's largest detective squad?
It also gave Redditors an idea: Why not turn the site into the world's largest detective squad? So they launched the RBI, with the aim “to use the power of Reddit to solve crimes/mysteries and catch criminals.” The subreddit has 11,133 subscribers and 775 unique threads on everything from missing laptops to homicide. A hit-and-run in Northern Virginia went unsolved, with the site's big lead—”The car that hit your mother was either blue, or had a blue license plate”—failing to pin down a suspect. A decade-old murder in San Lorenzo, California, has likewise gone uncracked.
But Martin pointed to one recent example in which Redditors did come through. In December a user named Meatheaded posted a photo of a piece of a headlight he'd found at the scene of a hit-and-run, along with a question: “any idea what it belongs to?” Some 435 comments later, users eventually pinpointed it as a piece of a gray 1991 Cadillac Brougham, and Meatheaded did the rest.
“I sent a link of my findings (thanks to you guys) to the Auto Theft unit. So you guys know, on the original accident the suspect was identified after he was seen yelling out the window that the car was stolen, but we could never find the car. So not only will he go down for several traffic crimes but it looks like Auto Theft as well, assuming the damage matches. You guys ROCK!”
Prior to Boston, Reddit's most high-profile case came from within its own ranks. A user posting under the name Naratto had used a photo of a sad-looking bear (a meme known as “confession bear”) to declare that he had killed his sister's ex-boyfriend “with his own drugs while he was unconscious and they ruled it as an overdose.” When Redditors began to take him seriously, Naratto insisted it was just a bad joke, but ABC News reported that California police were investigating the matter. That investigation is pending.
If Reddit is uniquely positioned to push unsubstantiated theories, it's also well placed to cut through bullshit. Indeed, few sites do it better. As Redditors were examining photographs of Boylston street for suspicious-looking individuals (which they found in spades) and implicating an innocent, now-deceased Brown University student in mass murder, they also managed to debunk a New York Post front-page scoop. When the tabloid reported that a Saudi man seen near the finish line was considered a suspect in the bombings. Redditors noted that the teenager was a long-distance runner at Revere High School.
The best example of what Reddit could be—if it became a bit less like Reddit, that is—is a site called websleuths.com. Founded in 1999, Websleuths has become a haven for amateur investigators who spend their free time using public records to crack cold cases. It works like most any other online forum. Users create accounts and subscribe to different subject threads—in this case, relating to different cases that come in—depending on their interests.
Susan Bray, an assistant professor of counseling at Wichita State University, started using Websleuths under the pseudonym when she was unemployed and looking for work. She developed a rapport with another user, Cathy Rhodes, a car dealer from Augusta, Georgia, and realized they had a knack for connecting unclaimed bodies to their next-of-kin. Her track record has led some police departments to reach out to her directly when they need an extra set of eyes. The Department of Justice has looked to capitalize on the internet hive mind by setting up a site, claimus.org, for people to identify unclaimed bodies.
“It's not a Reddit problem. It's a public perception problem.”
The most high-profile example of Websleuth's utility was the 2009 murder of Abraham Shakespeare, a Florida laborer who won $32 million in the lottery. Police speculated that Shakespeare's financial adviser, Dee Dee Moore, might have had information about Shakespeare's disappearance. Websleuths began digging, prompting Moore to register for the site under an anonymous name to defend her actions. “She came back to me in an email and said I don't know who is posting it, that wasn't me, and I said, ‘That's funny the IP address in this email matches the number of your computer,'” recalls Tricia Griffith, who has co-owned the site since 2004. “I had a detective call me up and say this is just great.” Moore was eventually convicted.
When police were investigating Casey Anthony for the alleged murder of her daughter Caylee, a Websleuther used Florida open-records laws to obtain cellphone records for Anthony, and used the ping-data—when the phone sent a signal to the cell tower—to create a map of where she had traveled.
Websleuths can be relentless, but they also set clear limits. Users are prohibited from providing personal information unless a suspect has already been identified by media outlets. And the forums serve mostly as a place to drop in a quick update on what folks are working on; more speculative ideas are tossed out in private emails. “We don't try to solve cases,” Griffifth says. “We don't set out like Jessica Fletcher [of Murder, She Wrote] or any of those types of TV people.”
This is, at least in theory, already the case at Reddit. The site's rules note that “Witch-hunts and the posting of personal information are forbidden”—something Martin drew attention to in his written apology. But it wasn't followed after the Boston attacks.
Bad press notwithstanding, Redditors are unfazed by their handling of the Boston bombings. And at least some folks are happy to make the tradeoff that comes with posting a request at the Reddit Bureau of Investigations. One of the most recent posts on RBI right now is from James Renner, a reporter and crime novelist who's currently working on an investigation of the 2004 disappearance of University of Massachusetts student Maura Murray.
Renner sees Reddit's marathon work as a force for good. “What you're seeing…is what has always happened inside the writers' dens of newspapers,” says Renner. “We've always been able to cast suspicion on people inside our office, to bounce ideas off other journalists, in order to focus our investigations. The internet has merely brought that process of reporting to light. They've made it public. And there's nothing wrong with that.
“It's not a Reddit problem,” Renner says. “It's a public perception problem. Readers need to understand that this is part of the process of reporting and not to attach stigmas on the people identified in the posts. And I believe this will happen with time. It's just very new right now.”
For most new parents, sleep becomes an obsession, their most precious commodity. They will happily trade exercise, sex, and time with friends for just a shot at catching some Z's–kind of like how a rat with ad libitum access to cocaine will happily forgo food.
(Yep, this assumes you're not in sleep-obsession mode already. If you are currently in third trimester insomnia hell, my condolences. Sadly, the situation is unlikely to improve when your baby arrives.)
In 1943, psychology researcher Abraham Maslow mapped out his now famous hierarchy of human needs. This is reasonable approximation of what most people's needs look like before having a baby:
And this is what they look like shortly after having a baby:
This is why, when expecting my first child, one of the best pieces of advice I got was to start reading up on infant sleep before baby arrives.
Of course, just because this was good advice, doesn't mean I took it. I didn't. Instead, I focused my pre-baby sleuthing on how to avoid a C-section. Not unreasonable. But this meant I ended up frantic Google searching baby sleep while so sleep-deprived that I could barely remember my computer password. Don't do this!
Have I convinced you yet?
If so, let's move on to next question: What should you read about baby sleep? The options can feel endless and overwhelming. There are the “no-cry” solutions. There are the people who tell you that introducing solids will get your baby to start sleeping a blissful 8 hours. (It won't!) There's the co-sleep until age 7 camp.
Everyone has an opinion. Trying to wade through all the opinions to get to real, evidence-based solutions while so tired you can barely string a sentence together is less fun than dealing with a newborn blowout on a stroller walk in the dead of winter. In short, it sucks.
So let me save you the trouble. Below are two excellent books on baby sleep that do the work for you. They are grounded in real data and offer clear, practical solutions for busy, tired parents.
1. Precious Little Sleep by Alexis Dubief.
Not only is Precious Little Sleep a great sleep reference for parents who want to be able to quickly look something up, it is also a fast easy read and often laugh out loud funny.
Like so many parents, Alexis Dubief began researching baby sleep after giving birth to her first child, a boy. Her son refused to sleep without being held. This is a pretty common newborn sleep demand that works great for your baby. But for you, not so much.
Now, after years of researching and helping tired parents, helping others get their babies to sleep better has become her self-proclaimed superpower. And it really is.
Her book outlines how to get babies to sleep better using a variety of methods. She delves into both “no-cry” and “cry it out”–two terms she personally eschews, noting (correctly) that babies often “fuss” during no-cry methods and that babies experience lots of parental presence and soothing during “cry-it-out” methods. She instead calls these SWAPS and SLIPS.
Throughout her book, Dubief draws on a mix of research and direct experience to talk about which strategies work best for which babies (they're all different!) and at which ages. This is super helpful, because teaching a 4-month-old to fall asleep on their own requirements very different tactics than those used with a stubborn sleep-fighting toddler.
Although newborn sleep is what sends most parents into a deep zombie-like fog, Precious Little Sleep also covers naps and strategies for bedtime with older kids.
As a parent of older children, now 4 and 6, I appreciated her no nonsense, practical tips for ending the endless cycle of bedtime requests (more cuddles, more water, more stories): Fill their emotional bucket before bed, set firm limits, and starting an hour before bedtime, move them from high energy activities and bright light to low energy activities and low light.
Her book is full of clear guidance like that, making it a wonderful go-to reference for your baby's later years as well.

2. The Science of Mom: A Research-Based Guide to Your Baby's First Year, by one of my favorite bloggers, Alice Callahan.
With a PhD in nutrition and postdoctoral training in fetal physiology, Alice Callahan is obviously super smart, but in a totally low ego, unshowy way.
In this book, she delves deep into the scientific literature on hot button parenting topics like breastfeeding, introducing solids, and vaccines, then surfaces to interweave her evidence-based conclusions with practical experience in a clear, sensible, and nonjudgmental voice.
This means that for navigating common parent concerns, Callahan is the ultimate trustworthy guide. She provides copious references, clear examples, and lots of practical tips. Her writing on infant nutrition, in particular, is bar none.
But back to sleep… While her book covers a lot of common first year questions, her two chapters on sleep (“Where Should Your Baby Sleep?”) and (“In Search of a Good Night's Sleep”) provide the best data-based summaries I have ever encountered on how to reduce the risk of SIDS and how to help your baby to sleep better, longer and to fall asleep on their own (what Callahan calls self-soothing). Those two chapters are worth their weight in gold. (Or more to the point, worth their weight in long extra hours of uninterrupted sleep. Wouldn't you trade gold for that?)
Parents who want to know the data behind the recommendations, to get advice without being talked down to, and who want to understand why they're being told what they're being told by their pediatrician should check out The Science of Mom.

FILE - In this Jan. 26, 2016 file photo, the empty playground at Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Mo. The Supreme Court has ruled that churches have the same right as other charitable groups to seek state money for new playground surfaces and other non-religious needs. The justices on Monday, June 26, 2017, ruled 7-2 in favor of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri. The church sought a grant to put a soft surface on its preschool playground, but was denied any money even though its application was ranked fifth out of 44 submissions (Annaliese Nurnberg/Missourian via AP, File)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that churches have the same right as other charitable groups to seek state money for new playground surfaces and other nonreligious needs.
But the justices stopped short of saying whether the ruling applies to school voucher programs that use public funds to pay for private, religious schooling.
By a 7-2 vote, the justices sided with Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri, which had sought a state grant to put a soft surface on its preschool playground.
Chief Justice John Roberts said for the court that the state violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by denying a public benefit to an otherwise eligible recipient solely on account of its religious status. He called it “odious to our Constitution” to exclude the church from the grant program, even though the consequences are only “a few extra scraped knees.”
The case arose from an application the church submitted in 2012 to take part in Missouri's scrap-tire grant program, which reimburses the cost of installing a rubberized playground surface made from recycled tires. The money comes from a fee paid by anyone who buys a new tire. The church's application to resurface the playground for its preschool and daycare ranked fifth out of 44 applicants.
But the state's Department of Natural Resources rejected the application, pointing to the part of the state constitution that says “no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion.”
A recycled scrap tire is not religious, the church said in its Supreme Court brief. “It is wholly secular,” the church said.
Justice Sonya Sotomayor took the rare step of reading her dissent from the bench, saying the ruling weakens America's longstanding commitment to separation of church and state.
“This case is about nothing less than the relationship between religious institutions and the civil government — that is, between church and state,” she wrote, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “The Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church.”
More than 30 other states have constitutional provisions similar to Missouri's, though some of those already permit churches to take part in grant programs for nonreligious purposes. In the days before the argument in April, Missouri's Republican Gov. Eric Greitens changed the state's policy and said churches would be allowed to apply for grants.
Some religious groups cheered the decision, which was closely watched for the effect it may have on school voucher programs. But in a carefully worded footnote, Roberts said the ruling was limited and did not address “religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.”
Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately to say they would not have limited the ruling to playground resurfacing or related issues that involve children's safety or health.
“The general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise — whether on the playground or anywhere else,” Gorsuch said.
Proponents of school vouchers said they hope the ruling lays the groundwork for a future decision on whether states can let parents choose to send their children to religious schools through publicly funded programs.
Michael Bindas, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, said the principle of “religious neutrality” applies “whether the government is enabling schools to resurface their playgrounds or empowering parents to direct their children's education.”
Civil liberties groups called the ruling a blow to the principle of church-state separation.
“This ruling threatens to open the door to more taxpayer support for religion, which is at odds with our history, traditions and common sense,” said Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
[Update, 3/18: Saleh is vowing to carry on with open mic night, but only feature original material to avoid music rights enforcers.]
According to a tip from Hoodline reader Joe M., Cafe International (508 Haight St.) was recently threatened with a lawsuit by music rights management company BMI after a performer at an open mic night sang “Happy Birthday” to a friend.
This was far from an isolated incident, as it turns out. “They've been bugging us and bugging us, it's become a nightmare,” Cafe International owner Zahra Saleh told Hoodline.
And BMI isn't the only group that has threatened the cafe, according to Saleh. "Performing rights organization” SESAC has also come after Cafe International in the past.
Saleh said that for the past 20 years, representatives of the two organizations have frequently entered the cafe to give her notices of copyright violations, threaten legal action, and demand she pay an annual fee to continue having music in her cafe, on at least one occasion even secretly recording an open mic performance to use as evidence despite the strict “original music only” rule Saleh tries to enforce.
Even when she has played traditional music from her native Eritrea, Saleh added, BMI reps have tried to collect royalties, saying they intend to pass them along to the musicians.
“It was my uncle's music, he is a famous musician there,” Saleh said. “He says he never received any money from them.”
According to Section 110(5) of the U.S. Copyright Act, a performance or broadcast of a musical work in a food service establishment is not considered a copyright infringement if the space is smaller than 3,750 square feet. If the space is larger than that, the music usage is still not considered a copyright infringement if the performance is transmitted using no more than four loudspeakers. So even if a performer at Cafe International sang a copyrighted work like "Happy Birthday To You" (which yes, is copyrighted by Warner/Chappell music, although that's being challenged), it's doubtful the cafe is large enough or using enough amplification to violate the law.
Regardless, Saleh has decided to shut down the open mic nights, and no longer even plays CDs in the cafe. Instead she has opted for a satellite radio service to provide musical ambience, even though she has never turned a profit from having music in the cafe.
“We're not making money with this stuff,” she says. “It's just for young people to have fun, instead of being on the streets.”
Saleh tells Hoodline that Cafe International is not the only local business that has been targeted by BMI and SESAC. Calls to both BMI and SESAC for comment were not returned.
Update, 3/24:
BMI's vice president for corporate communications, Liz Fischer, reached out to provide Hoodline with the following comment, and also claimed to have no record of BMI having contacted Cafe International in "well over a year." We're continuing to investigate and will have more soon. Here is the statement from BMI in full:
"BMI advocates on behalf of songwriters and composers who are often themselves among the smallest of business owners and rely on their royalty payments as their main source of income. They are entitled to fair compensation for their work. We never want situations like this to escalate, and our goal is to work with various businesses to educate them on the importance of music licensing, which is both required by law and can also add tremendous value to their establishment."
According to BMI's website, the company "serves as an advocate for the value of music, representing more than 8.5 million musical works created and owned by more than 650,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers."
And according to its site, "SESAC currently licenses the public performances of more than 400,000 songs on behalf of its 30,000 affiliated songwriters, composers and music publishers."
We're looking into this issue more extensively. Stay tuned.
Update: a tipster has written in to help clarify the U.S. Copyright Act for us. The clause cited above, 110(5), applies to restaurants that broadcast songs via TV or radio, but does not specifically apply to live performances. However, an earlier clause, 110(4), states that live performances of copyrighted music are allowed if those performances are "without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and without payment of any fee or other compensation for the performance." Whether Saleh's claim that the purpose of the open mic nights is not to make money but "just for young people to have fun" is enough to satisfy this clause is open to interpretation.
SANTA CLARA -- The 49ers drafted two prototypical 3-4 defensive linemen, Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner, in the first round the past two years, which suggests they are married to a 3-4 scheme for the near future.
The problem is that they don't have a nose tackle -- the player lining up there now, Glenn Dorsey, isn't signed beyond this season -- or any truly great prospects at outside linebacker, the two spots that make a 3-4 defense distinct.
That, in turn, has led to questions about whether the team might switch to a 4-3 defense next season. Any conversion would depend on the coaching staff -- does Jim O'Neil, who is a 3-4 advocate, keep his job? -- and perhaps whom the 49ers add in free agency and the draft.
But moving to a 4-3 certainly is possible. Based on who is under contract for 2017, this is what a starting lineup could look like:
Sign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to The Sacramento Bee
Defensive line: LDE Arik Armstead, DT DeForest Buckner, DT Quinton Dial, RDE Aaron Lynch.
Notes: Armstead is bigger than a traditional 4-3 defensive end, but he's got enough movement skills to play on the edge of the defense. He and Buckner could pair up at defensive tackle in nickel and dime defense just as they did earlier this year. The alignment would make Tank Carradine a 4-3 defensive end, which is the position he played at Florida State and the one at which he'd be most comfortable. Eli Harold also would go from 3-4 outside linebacker to 4-3 defensive end as would Ronald Blair.
Linebackers: SAM Ahmad Brooks, MIKE NaVorro Bowman, WILL Ray-Ray Armstrong*
Notes: Brooks played inside linebacker in college (watch this and this), entered the NFL with the Bengals as an inside linebacker and dabbled at the position with the 49ers, notably in goal-line situations against the Panthers in the 2013 playoffs. In this scenario, he'd be the team's strong-side or SAM linebacker (and probably would have to lose weight to do so, something he hasn't done all that well in the past). Bowman would be the traditional middle linebacker, a la Luke Kuechly in Carolina. The leap of faith here is that Bowman will return to full strength after his second major lower-leg injury in 2 1/2 years. Who would play the 'Will,' weak-side position, which usually calls for a lighter, more athletic linebacker who can run to the ball and make plays in space? The 49ers could re-sign Ray-Ray Armstrong, who is scheduled for free agency in March. Or they could draft one. Michigan's Jabrill Peppers likely will be viewed as a safety at the NFL level because of his smaller stature (He'll likely measure 5-11, 210 pounds or so at the combine), but the Wolverines are using the aggressive, playmaker as a linebacker this season. The 49ers also could convert one of their bigger-bodied safeties (see below).
Cornerbacks: Tramaine Brock, Rashard Robinson
Notes: The 49ers should not have to worry about the spot for years. Tramaine Brock, Jimmie Ward, Rashard Robinson, Keith Reaser, Dontae Johnson, Will Redmond and JaCorey Shepherd are signed for next season.
Safeties: SS Eric Reid, FS Jimmie Ward
Notes: The question at this position is whether Ward, perhaps the team's most gifted defensive player, is best at cornerback or free safety. He started at cornerback Sunday and showed off his play-making ability against the Cardinals with four pass break-ups and seven tackles. But would that ability be better utilized at safety? And would pairing Ward with his old high-school teammate, Jaquiski Tartt, give the 49ers a faster, harder-hitting and more dynamic duo than they have now? Eric Reid, a starter since his rookie season in 2013, has played along the line of scrimmage more this season than he has in the past. Could he convert into a Will linebacker the way Thomas Davis did with the Panthers? Or maybe the safety pairing should be Ward and Reid and the team should think about using Tartt as its 'Will' linebacker.
There haven't been many fighters that have been contenders in two divisions. It's even rarer to be a contender in two divisions at the same time, but that's what Dan Henderson and Vitor Belfort have been for most of their storied careers.
The two will rematch on Nov. 9 in the main event of UFC Fight Night 32 in Goiania, Brazil. They first met at Pride 32 in 2006 with Henderson winning a clear-cut unanimous decision. UFC contender and Fox Sports analyst Chael Sonnen believes only one has improved since that Pride event in Las Vegas seven years ago.
“I think Vitor has always been good. And I just got done training with Dan Henderson and the last time I worked out with Dan Henderson is before the first time he fought Vitor. And he whipped Vitor. He dominated him. They went out and fought hard, but Dan dominated that fight,” said Sonnen during a recent question and answer session in Manchester, England.

“I can tell you Dan is better now than he was then. I don't think Vitor is better. I think Vitor was very good back then, but I don't think he's better now. I think he's just got a different haircut,” he added.
Sonnen faces former light heavyweight titleholder Rashad Evans at UFC 167 on Nov. 16. He'll then coach The Ultimate Fighter Brazil opposite Wanderlei Silva and the two will fight at the conclusion of the show. After that, he has his sights set on Belfort.
“I've been trying to fight Vitor for a long time now. And I think Vitor is awesome. I think Vitor is probably the second scariest guy in the UFC right now, right under Jon Jones,” said Sonnen. “But I think he's beatable. I think I can beat him. And I really don't care either way. I'm going to go punch him in the face repeatedly.”

Finally. Four years after Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan walked into the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, Texas, and perpetrated the bloodiest massacre ever on an American military base, the self-confessed jihadist's court martial proceedings began this week. Have you forgotten?
Americans obsessed over the O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony and Jodi Arias trials. Gun-control lobbyists turned Newtown, Aurora and Tucson into national awareness-raising, fundraising and legislation-promoting campaigns. But where are the celebrity lobbyists and high-profile advocates for the victims of bloodthirsty Muslim vigilante Nidal Hasan?
The White House, which downplayed the terrorist mass murder as "workplace violence," exacerbated national apathy for his evil acts. Our soldiers deserve better. Here are three facts you've probably forgotten—or never knew—about the Fort Hood terror spree.
His PowerPoint slide presentation to fellow Army doctors was titled: "The Koranic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military." Hasan warned: "It's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims." And: "We love death more than (sic) you love life!" As first reported by Pamela Geller, Hasan carried an official calling card with the designation "SoA (SWT)"—for "Soldier of Allah" and "Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala" (Islamic for "Glory to Him, the Exalted").
Hasan told his superiors he was not alone among Muslim soldiers who believed they "should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting/killing believers unjustly."
He reminded the Army of the fatal 2003 fragging attack on American soldiers in Kuwait by Sgt. Hasan Akbar (who was sentenced to death but remains alive while his case drags on in appeal) and the desertion case of Lebanon-born Muslim Marine Wassef Ali Hassoun.
A Joint Terrorism Task Force had been monitoring Hasan's communications with jihad spiritual leader Anwar al-Awlaki all along. But the military was not notified. Even without that information, military officers expressed concerns privately that Hasan might leak classified information to terror groups if he were deployed and that he was capable of committing a fragging.
Yet, they were prepared to deploy him anyway and did nothing to remove him from his job. One email from an Army investigator before the Fort Hood massacre fretted: "Had we launched an investigation of Hasan we'd have been crucified."
Instead, 13 soldiers and one unborn child were slaughtered and paid with their lives for our country's reckless political correctness and bureaucratic fecklessness.
Craigslist has shut down its controversial "Adult Services" section -- by replacing the link to that section with the word "censored" written in bold letters on a black background, as you can see for yourself by clicking to its flagship San Francisco website.
Craigslist is the online classified ads service, launched in 1995 by entrepreneur Craig Newmark. It maintains online communities in numerous cities, featuring free classified advertisements to consumers. It makes money by selling paid ads for jobs and apartments.
The self-censoring appears to be in response to this letter from attorneys general in 18 U.S. states to Newmark and Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster. The AGs insisted that Craigslist "immediately take down" the Adult Services section. Here's why, according to an excerpt from the AGs' letter:
In our view, the company should take immediate action to end the misery for the women and children who may be exploited and victimized by these ads. Because craigslist cannot, or will not, adequately screen these ads, it should stop accepting them altogether and shut down the Adult Services section.
TechCrunch first reported the move by Craigslist late Friday night. We're reaching out to Craigslist for comment.
Craiglist last year removed the "erotic services" section of its site and replaced it with a fee-based adult category manually screened by site employees.
Craigslist "Personals" section featuring dating classified ads remains accessible.
UPDATE AT 7:45 p.m. ET: Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, one of the attorneys general who pressed for the change, said in a statement that he welcomed the change and was trying to verify Craigslist's official policy going forward, according to the Associated Press.
Steve Jones, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois in Chicago who has studied Internet culture, told the AP that if Craigslist has left the adult services business for good, it won't likely diminish the online market for sex acts. The business will likely shift to other adult sites, perhaps based outside the United States. "I bet there are people today who are registering domain names and saying: 'Business opportunity for me,'" he said.

The K-pop star Psy's very viral Gangnam Style video has dethroned Justin Bieber's Baby as the most-viewed YouTube clip ever. (It may reach a billion views by year's end.) How much is such a modern cultural achievement worth? Neither the singer's reps nor the site would reveal terms, but using industry standards, it's possible to calculate a conservative estimate. And as the figures below show, they're not the only parties reaping a windfall.
Number of YouTube views of the Gangnam Style video (as of 1 p.m., November 30): 853,942,076
Standard rate YouTube pays to video owners forevery 1,000 views: $2
Estimated total YouTube revenue received by Team Psy: $1,707,884.15
YouTube's estimated cut: $1,366,307.32
(Based on rates provided by Jason Calacanis, CEO of Mahalo, a top YouTube partner.)
Psy's estimated revenues from U.S. digital music sales of Gangnam Style: $243,720
(Per a calculation by entertainment lawyer Steve Gordon, applying standard American royalties to the 2.7 million copies the song has sold.)
Share Price Increases of
YG Entertainment, a South Korean company that manages Psy, since the video's YouTube release: 26%
Hite Jinro, a Korean distiller, since Psy drank a bottle of its sojuat a concert on October 4: 20.5%
DI, a South Korean semiconductor manufacturer for which Psy's dad is chairman and his uncle is vice-chairman of the board, but that has no relation to Psy's music: 154%
Year-over-year increase in U.S. tourists to South Korea in October: 6,055
This June, venture to a wondrous techno-utopia, with a dark and sinister secret in ARMOR WARS #1 – a new Secret Wars series! Eisner-award winning writer James Robinson and artist Marcio Takara show you the beauty technology can bring…and the horrors it can unleash!
Welcome to Technopolis, a shining beacon for all Battleworld to see. Full of science and wonder created at the hands of rival genius brothers – Tony Stark and Arno Stark. Yet shadows fall over this armored Utopia. A unique disease forces EVERYONE to wear armor just to live and breathe!
“We've got this absolutely cool as heck city filled with absolutely cool as heck armored citizens,” says Senior Editor Mark Paniccia. “The design work that Marcio has done with both the environment of Technoplis and the armors of all the various characters deserves its own coffee table art book.
“Plus, James is delving into the kind of emotional and hard hitting story he excels at,” continues Paniccia. “He's doing some amazing world-building and bringing us a mystery that—as it's peeled back—will shock readers and make their hearts sink into their stomachs.”
But when murder strikes his domain, Baron Tony Stark must race against the clock to identify the mysterious killer. But is he too late to stop more bodies from showing up? And just who is the mysterious Iron Hand? Find out as the mechanical murder mystery kicks off in ARMOR WARS #1 this June!
To talk about decentralization I suppose it's good to first point out that generally centralized systems are vulnerable, as they present themselves as single points of failure, they are also prone to corruption by the people running them, which end up abusing those that depend on them. Think big governments, autocrat dictators in Latin America and Africa, telecommunication monopolies/oligopolies, and federal banks with arbitrary interventionist policies, etc, etc. The problem is lack of freedom, and the bigger a centralized system becomes, the higher the risks and the more devastating the outcomes when faced with failure.
Luckily we have the Internet, designed to be decentralized by arpanet to survive as a communications network in the event of war, over the decades evolved to survive and thrive for purposes unimagined. Like any good decentralized software, it only gets stronger after it's attacked, it repairs itself and becomes invulnerable to the same threat, decentralized computer communication networks are not just robust, they are what Taleb calls “Anti-fragile”.
We've all witnessed how decentralized file sharing has lead the way (with much controversy) for changes in the world of media-entertainment, and how we went from simple pseudo-centralized file-sharing networks (Napster) to next generation purely decentralized file sharing networks like BitTorrent and others, now virtually indestructible and getting stronger with each update.
Next time you are sitting in traffic, think that you are probably the victim of a centralized roadway design that has made every vehicle flow through a serial channel, if the system were decentralized you'd have a multitude of options to flow through the network and get to your destination without any delays, with decentralization you have freedom of choice, and that freedom enables every participant to move faster, more efficiently.
Decentralized systems have no place for bottlenecks, bureaucracy, or a few holding all the power, decentralization empowers the many with freedom to participate in ways that otherwise would be unimaginable.
Even centralized systems built atop of the decentralized Internet have brought forth change of epic proportions, think of the power of YouTube and how it leveled the playing field for many content producers, however, being a centralized system, it's still bound by regulations and corporate agendas that hinder it from leveling the playing field for everyone, not all legal content can be shared on YouTube, there's a lot that has been censored and will be censored for many reasons, moral police, political censorship, etc. Decentralization for media sharing still has a job to do in the world.
Another centralized system built atop of a decentralized internet is another Google powerhouse: Google Adsense/Google Ads, it completely changed the way companies advertise, without the internet it couldn't have possibly been built.
This system serves as an automated broker that has enabled millions of businesses to advertise with budgets that would've never been considered by the old advertising business models on which one guy on a marketing agency would use his rolodex to call up rich companies and then place the ads on rich publisher's ad-space. Now we have a long tail of advertisers showing ads to a long tail of consumers it has made Google mountains of money, however, it's still a centralized system which has brought forth an advertising monopoly on the internet, Google has the best inventory, Google pretty much sets the prices and the rules, and they've become bullies that dictate the norms of online advertising for many, if those rules change and your business depends on it, your ads can all of a sudden be rejected, your account could be closed and you have only a tiny little textbox to appeal your case…
You can imagine what awaits for the online advertisement industry in my vision of decentralization, an advertisement marketplace without intermediaries taking an arbitrary cut and dictating the rules of who and what can be advertised, whatever the Google's and other ad-networks are keeping as profit, this will be the immediate efficiency to be shown by the decentralized counterparty the minute it arrives, bringing advertisement costs down, and bringing together even longer tails of advertisers and publishers from all parts of the world, getting paid instantly on Bitcoin (no more 45 days waiting for your payments.)
My vision of decentralization tells me that everything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized.
The invention of the Blockchain technology by Satoshi Nakamoto has been the trigger for a peer to peer renaissance, during the last 10 years or so there have been great developments in the areas of peer to peer networks as well as all sorts of online products that have worked well for developed countries, but even though we've seen tremendous growth rates in the numbers of users joining the Internet in emerging regions, like Latin America, it hasn't been easy to monetize in those places.
In my opinion, Bitcoin has done already the hardest decentralization challenge of all, it's decentralized money, it's decentralized banking, it's a decentralized payment network, it's a decentralized commodity, and it is the missing piece to not just finally monetize those emerging nations, but it will enable those emerging nation entrepreneurs to monetize us in the developed world… it levels the playing field.
So, looking at Kurzweil's Law of Accelerated Returns, it is our duty to build upon Bitcoin so that people can use it, the bitcoins in our digital wallets are only as valuable as what they can buy and do for us, the more we can build to make Bitcoin useful, the more valuable it will become.
For the longest time some of us on the peer to peer file sharing community thought that if people could trade files in p2p fashion, they could also trade digital goods, but we didn't have a way to provide our users with a globally available and free payment network, Bitcoin came to fill that need and now the pieces are there not just to transform decentralize ecommerce, we now have the building blocks to transform commerce as a whole.
People world wide have been repurposing social networks like Twitter and Facebook to buy/sell products and services, most likely because these are the networks they know can connect them to the largest amount of people, they're looking to expand their commercial reach, I see this organic hacks as proof that there's a growing need to connect people not just for sharing baby pictures and squashing candies, but for something more useful to billions of people, trade creates empathy and peace, trade creates jobs, independence and freedom.
Imagine everyone you see out there on the street, a few years from now being able to directly trade with one another, no more information monopolies by middlemen after middlemen making trade inneficient, imagine having a global network in which any two participants can find each other, where no institution can censor who gets to find who, imagine what will happen when retailers can go directly to the sources with a simple search, what happens to huge wholesale middlemen like Costco (which charge yearly fees and only accept one kind of credit card for electronic payments, no more arbitrary rules based on centralized interests), imagine how efficient and direct trade will bring costs across all industries down when you also get rid of currency exchange innefficiencies, imagine what this network does for local trade and global trade.
These are the reasons why I've joined OpenBazaar. A decentralized trading network which builds upon decentralized Bitcoin will have a compound exponential value-creating effect, and I hope that OpenBazaar will be a platform so that others can build on top of, so that people and systems can trade with one another in ways unimaginable to us right now.
In the year A.D. 9, a combined force of deeply independent Germanic tribes led by the Roman-trained chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions of elite Roman soldiers over the course of three days. It was the event that galvanized and temporarily united chieftains from present-day Holland to Poland against Rome, which was never able to absorb the heavily forested wilderness east of the Rhine into its empire.
In 1987, researchers believed that they uncovered the spot of the legendary battle in northwestern Germany. Since then, they have dug up many compelling artifacts, but there is still no irrefutable proof that the site near Kalkriese hill was the venue of Arminius' great victory since the Romans and chieftans clashed all over the frontier. Now, Deutsche Welle reports, researchers want to get a definitive answer. Come September, the local Kalkriese Museum will undertake a major new excavation at the site as well begin a three-year project to analyze the metallurgical profiles of artifacts uncovered there.
There's lots of evidence that something took place at Kalkriese. In 2006, Fergus M. Bordewich wrote in Smithsonian magazine that archaeologists have recovered more than 5,000 artifacts in the area, including a Roman standard-bearer's silver facemask, spearheads, tent pegs, medical instruments and even human skulls split by swords. Notably, they also found coins stamped "VAR," indicating they were medals given by the ill-fated Roman politician and general Publius Quinctilius Varus, who fell on his sword during the battle rather than let himself get captured.
Still, researchers have yet to find an absolute smoking gun that this was the site of the famous battle. “We haven't got final proof; we haven't found anything with the inscription of the 19th or 18th or 17th legions,” professor Salvatore Ortisi of the University of Munich, who will lead the dig, tells DW. “We're hoping for some piece of a helmet with an inscription or a plaque with the name of a unit, or a stamped artillery bolt.”
The new dig will be on the lookout for signs of hastily constructed fortifications built by the Romans, some of which were uncovered in previous digs. “It would suggest the fortifications we have there been a Roman camp that was overrun by the Germans,” Ortisi tells DW. “That would fit in with historical accounts of the battle.”
The metallurgy tests that will take place over the next few years will contribute their own historical evidence by determining whether metal objects from the site were from Varus' legions or if they came from the later armies led by the Roman commander Germanicus, which attempted to pacify the region.
While the battle is the foundational myth of German, David Crossland at Der Spiegel reports that many Germans are unfamiliar with the actual history of the event. That's because during the 18th and 19th century a "cult of Hermann" as Arminius was later known as, developed in Germany, with fact-free legends about superior tribes of ancient Germans united by the hero helping to support the aggressive nationalism and racism that resulted in the Third Reich. Since then, Germany's "founding battle" has been downplayed, and even the 2,000th anniversary of the battle in 2009 was a subdued celebration.
Researchers are split on just how influential the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest really was. “This was a battle that changed the course of history,” Peter S. Wells, archaeologist and author of The Battle That Stopped Rome, tells Bordewich. “It was one of the most devastating defeats ever suffered by the Roman Army, and its consequences were the most far-reaching. The battle led to the creation of a militarized frontier in the middle of Europe that endured for 400 years, and it created a boundary between Germanic and Latin cultures that lasted 2,000 years.”
Crossland, however, points out that Germanicus and Roman forces were back in the area just six years after the battle, and went on to win some substantial victories, though they eventually did abandon the area. The myth of Arminius as a grand uniter is also exaggerated. Evidence suggests he convinced roughly five tribes to fight with him at Teutoburg. After that he made an effort to become king, an idea that many people in his own tribe, the Cherusci, resented. He was later murdered by political opponents.
“The battle became the big bang of the German nation in terms of myth and legend. But in terms of real history, it was no such thing." Tillmann Bendikowski, a German journalist who has also written a book about the myth of Hermann, tells Crossland. “It's typically German to say world history was shaped on German soil. We know that this was one battle among many and that there was a range of factors behind Rome's eventual retreat to the Rhine. Everyone who needed this myth regarded it as the turning point of history. For many it remains the turning point. But it wasn't.”
Wherever you stand on the impact of the battle in halting the Roman Empire's spread into the middle of Europe, new details from the Kalkriese dig are sure to add more fact to what remains an irrefutably remarkable feat.
Calling the move "outrageous and deeply troubling," consumer advocates and opponents of skyrocketing student debt spoke out Tuesday against the Trump administration's decision to end the working relationship between the Department of Education and the government watchdog tasked with helping oversee the federal student loan program and protect borrowers.
At the direction of Congress, under the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, the Department of Education has shared information with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) since 2011 in order to provide assistance to borrowers with complaints about Federal student loans. But the Department, now run by Secretary Betsy DeVos, informed the Bureau in a letter last week that it was ending the relationship.
Especially at a time when federal student loan debt has reached over $1.3 trillion, critics condemned the decision.
The National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) says, "the CFPB has stood up for students and demonstrated the urgent need for an independent watch dog over student loan servicers and collectors," fighting "to ensure that struggling borrowers can access the repayment programs they are entitled to."
The Education Department accused the CFPB of "overreaching" by "unilaterally expanding its oversight role to include the Department's contracted federal loan servicers." Republican lawmakers have opposed the CFPB's involvement in monitoring student loan complaints, and the Trump administration has sought to weaken the Bureau.
In its statement, the NCLC said the accusation of an overreach by the Bureau is unfounded:
Congress gave the CFPB authority over those servicers and collectors and directed the CFPB to establish the agreement that Education has terminated 'to ensure coordination in providing assistance to and serving borrowers seeking to resolve complaints related to their private education or Federal student loans.'
The nationwide movement to resist debt, Strike Debt, said the move would serve to help "swindlers & crooks cheat students" and issued this warning:
The Department of Education will not work with the CFPB to investigate fraud. It's open season to defraud studentshttps://t.co/mWcnUdc0gD — StrikeDebt (@StrikeDebt) September 5, 2017

Clare McCann, who worked in the Education Department under President Barack Obama and now directs federal higher education policy at New America, also condemned the decision.
"This is just another example of how collaborative, interagency work has fallen apart under the new administration, and it's bad news for borrowers," said McCann. "Ending its formal relationship with the CFPB is proof that the department is working to systematically dismantle those planned protections for borrowers."
The DOE's letter to the Bureau came days after the appointment of a former executive at the for-profit DeVry University to run the Department's unit combatting school fraud. Last year, DeVry paid $100 million in a settlement after it was accused of misleading students.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)—the leading figure in establishing the CFPB and a longtime critic of for-profit colleges and the federal student loan system—expressed shock at the DeVry official's appointment and DeVos's agenda.

Here's the cover! Thanks to you, this *will* happen now!
“Skyscrapers with sides so smooth and featureless (with vidscreens on the interior, instead of windows) that one might think they were solid granite monuments in a graveyard for dead gods. Other buildings that looked like they'd been pieced together from thousands of odd-matched parts salvaged from stripped factory machines, steam curling out of grids and grates in their complex flanks. Buildings with snake skins of multicolored mosaics. Buildings wearing an armor of riveted metal plates, like retired warships looming vertically with their sterns jammed into the street. Flat roofs upon which perched smaller buildings, symbiotically. Other structures tapering to needle points that seemed to etch the clouds upon the blue glass of the sky. Stacked apartments. Stacked businesses. On street level: shop fronts, and gang kids squatting on tenement steps, glaring insolently at the slow sludge of traffic...Ah, Punktown.”
--Jeffrey Thomas, Deadstock
The Setting:
Picture Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, Minority Report, Total Recall and the rest of the dark, not-too-distant-future genre. Now add aliens, mutants, and robots. Welcome to Punktown...now gimme your wallet.
Punktown is a city created by author Jeffrey Thomas who has written numerous books set there, both novels and short story collections. The stories depict a crazy world where anything and everything goes, but menace lurks in the shadows.
The Book:
Punktown: An RPG Setting for Call of Cthulhu® and BRP is a book that will allow players of Chaosium's famous award-winning system to explore a dark, futuristic world fraught with untold perils. If you're a cyberpunk fan, if you're a horror fan, or if you're both, you'll want to explore the pages of this book.The book will be written for the famous BRP system, compatible with Call of Cthulhu and Chaosium's many other game settings, so if you're looking to expand your world, and add options, look no further than Punktown!
The book will explore the city itself, the alien races, the weaponry, the creatures, mutations, cybernetics, drugs, sanity (and the inevitable loss thereof), and the option of adding the Cthulhu Mythos into the mix. As written in Jeffrey Thomas' work, the mythos is already there, threatening life as Punktowners know it, but whether or not to use that element is left to the individual gaming groups, and their preference.
The Authors:
Teaming up to bring you this book is the creator of Punktown itself, Jeffrey Thomas, fiction/nonfiction/gaming author Mike Tresca, Call of Cthulhu Great Brian M. Sammons, and the President of Miskatonic River Press, Tom Lynch.

Seattle defensive coordinator Dan Quinn will be a sought-after coaching candidate, with the Vikings and Browns already requesting permission to interview him for their head coaching vacancies, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Quinn is in his first season as Seattle's defensive coordinator. He took over the job after Gus Bradley departed for Jacksonville. The Seahawks were excellent last season under Bradley, but were even better this year. Seattle led the NFL in points allowed, yards allowed, passing yards allowed and interceptions. He also spent two seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Florida Gators. Although he has limited NFL coordinator experience, Quinn has been around the league with stints in San Francisco, Miami and with the New York Jets to go along with two separate stints in Seattle.
Seattle has a first-round bye in the playoffs, so Quinn will be able to interview for jobs beginning on Jan. 5. He is one of several candidates connected to the Browns. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase and others also were mentioned as possible candidates. He is the first candidate connected to the Vikings' opening.
Cleveland fired Rob Chudzinski on Sunday after one season. The Vikings fired Leslie Frazier on Monday, following a 5-10-1 season. Quinn's defensive background would be a shift from Chudzkinski's offensive pedigree in Cleveland. Quinn would follow Frazier as a defensive coach in Minnesota. He would also be reunited with defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd, whom he coached at Florida.

Chelsea have completed the signing of Danny Drinkwater from Leicester City for a fee of around £35m, after the club applied for a two-hour extension to the transfer deadline on Thursday night to complete the transfer.
The deal had been contingent on Leicester bringing in a replacement midfielder, and the Foxes are now expected to announce the signing of Portugal's Adrien Silva from Sporting. Drinkwater, 27, has signed a five-year contract.
Everton's Ross Barkley ‘changed his mind' over £35m move to Chelsea Read more
Chelsea endured a frustrating deadline day, losing out on Fernando Llorente to Tottenham and having Ross Barkley reject a switch to Stamford Bridge despite agreeing a fee with Everton. However, late in the day the club wrapped up the signing of Davide Zappacosta from Torino for an initial £23m, who is expected to provide competition for Victor Moses at right wing-back, and then added Drinkwater at the last.
“I'm delighted to be a Chelsea player and can't wait to get started,” said Drinkwater. “It has been a long journey to get here but I am very happy and am I looking forward to helping the club win more trophies.”
The England international, who started his career at Manchester United before moving to Leicester in January 2012, will link up with N'Golo Kanté in midfield once again with whom he built an impressive partnership which helped to win the 2015-16 Premier League title.
Chelsea's technical director, Michael Emenalo, said: “Danny is not only a Premier League winner but also has Champions League experience which will be invaluable for us this season. He is a typically combative English midfielder with a cultured passing technique and his arrival significantly strengthens our midfield options.”
Okay. I've been mulling this one over since Ion Hazzikostas' interview this week. And it's not going to make me a lot of friends, I expect. So best to just rip the band-aid off and go for it. I think Blizzard's analysis of the effects of flight on quest and world design is spot on. I think flying absolutely does remove danger from the world, shrinks the zones down, and trivializes a whole host of quests. I don't think any of this is in dispute — one of the reasons we like flying is because once you have it, you can fly over annoying mobs to get to the herb or ore nodes in the world, go over terrain obstacles with ease and thus avoid being channeled into exploring what we were intended to explore. It definitely and absolutely makes things feel safer and easier. Ion is absolutely right — flying detracts from gameplay in a host of ways.
But taking it away from the player base is worse.
I understand the desire to put the genie back in its bottle. As a leveling experience, Warlords has felt much better than the Cataclysm 80 to 85 with complete open world flying did, and it even tops the excellent Mists of Pandaria questing — but Mists didn't allow flying until you reached a zone you couldn't access until 77 or 78, so at most you have flying for a couple of levels. The fact remains that while not having flying until max level absolutely makes sense and provides a sense of tension and danger for players, not having flight at max level really only matters for a few daily quests and the Garrison Campaign, and it would be easy enough to simply restrict flying while completing those objectives without disabling it forever.
We have had flying mounts since Burning Crusade. They've become an ingrained part of the game for many players. Players go out of their way to acquire them, they pay extra gold to fly at maximum speed. Blizzard has actually sold flying mounts for real money. By this point, simply declaring “We think they have detrimental effects on gameplay” feels like a bit of a cop out. It's making a design choice that makes design easier — now you don't have to come up with a way to keep flying mounts from trivializing old-style questing — but one that has a negative effect on many players' enjoyment of the game.
I don't particularly care if we don't have flying in Warlords of Draenor, and I'm not particularly concerned that we won't have it going forward. But what I am concerned with is the feeling of other players who do care. Admittedly, my method is completely unscientific. I listen to my friends in game, the players I talk to on Twitter. What I'm seeing is the following: There are people who don't particularly care, and people who are very angry that flying is gone. I have seen a few players who are actually glad flying is gone. I have interacted with players who want flying gone until they reach max level, and a few who want it gone entirely, but the majority seem to enjoy everything we've listed about how flight trivializes gameplay, because they've bought into the message that World of Warcraft has been selling since Burning Crusade — namely that leveling and max level play are different worlds and they should feel different.
These players want the world to feel smaller and safer once they're at max level. They want to be able to explore the way they want to. They want the freedom to avoid all of those mobs and just open the cage and fly off. They've done the work of leveling — they've fought their way through those mobs, explored those zones, been frustrated by the unclimbable hill with that tantalizing cave at the top. At max level, they have done as the game has demanded for years and shifted their focus to dungeons and raids, and now they want their interaction with the world at large to be easier. They see hitting max level as graduation — they're big heroes now, they don't have to sweat the small stuff. This is part and parcel of the experience the game has been promising players for years now, repeated in every expansion to date save Cataclysm.
It's not fair or accurate to say that this is the biggest problem with endgame in Warlords. I find myself wondering if more players would be out in the world exploring if they felt the empowering freedom to do so – without being chained to jumping puzzles that don't work very well in WoW's current engine, for example, more might explore Nagrand or Spires of Arak. I know I'd be more inclined to revisit Gorgrond if I could feel free to just explore it, taking the time to get a good look at the lush scenery. Flying gives max level players a sense of empowerment, of finally having hit the point where the once dangerous world is less so and you can turn your focus to the big threats, the ones in dungeons and raids — the places you can't fly in.
Perhaps we shouldn't have had flying in Northrend at all — we wouldn't have gotten so attached to it, we wouldn't have gone after various flying mounts that dropped from bosses, we wouldn't have grown accustomed to it. But over the past decade, flying has grown from a nifty feature to a mainstay. It's even a druid class feature. Making flying something that is restricted I absolutely understand and support. Simply removing it from relevance entirely excuses the designers from having to design with it in mind, and it takes away from the players to accomplish this. All those things that make flying detrimental to gameplay are exactly why players enjoy it. It allows players to overcome gameplay.
That says to me that you need to design new models of gameplay that flying doesn't overcome, or accept that it's healthy for the game to allow players to avoid it after having completed it already. Flight at max level doesn't keep the world from having felt huge and dangerous when it counted, when it was actually leveling content — it simply allows players to say to that content “I'm back” and get a sense of triumph over those limitations. And that's as good as letting them come back to a zone in gear from a raid and demolish mobs that once threatened them. That's not an experience to lament, it's one to savor.
As a friend said to me on this topic, what's next? Will we disallow raid gear because it trivializes open world content? Think back to your SoO geared characters on the Timeless Isle – while players in gear available from the island struggled, players in the gear from Siege would simply gather up as many yaungol as they could and AoE them down. Is that going away next? It makes quests trivial, the world feels less dangerous. No, it shouldn't go away because it's all part of the promise the game makes – you will grow more powerful. Being able to fly is just another kind of power.
In the end I hope Blizzard reconsiders this decision. The removal of flight is the removal of a tool you can use to keep players feeling invested, motivated, and powerful. Work with it, not against it.

Harry Redknapp has admitted in court to lying to News of the World reporter.
He said he lied to Rob Beasley about the source of payments to his Monaco bank account because he did not want negative stories ahead of a cup final.
Mr Redknapp denies allegations that £189,000 paid into his account was a bonus for profits on transfers while he was employed by Portsmouth FC.
The Tottenham boss said: "I have to tell police the truth, not Mr Beasley - he's News of the World reporter."
Mr Redknapp, 64, told Southwark Crown Court the reason he gave the journalist incorrect information was to prevent a story appearing in the News of the World ahead of Tottenham's appearance in the 2009 League Cup final against Manchester United.
All my players were going to be looking at the back page of the News of the World Harry Redknapp
'Easy answer'
When asked by the prosecution why he referred to payments as bonuses he was due for the sale of striker Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa, Mr Redknapp told the court: "I wanted to make the point to Mr Beasley that it was paid by my chairman [Milan Mandaric]."
He added that he "referred to it to him [Mr Beasley] many times as my Crouch bonus" as "Crouch is an easy answer".
Mr Redknapp told the court: "I just want to get Mr Beasley out the way - I just didn't want a story in the paper.
"I was going to come down to breakfast and all my players were going to be looking at the back page of the News of the World.
"It was going to be embarrassing."
John Black QC, for the prosecution, accused Mr Redknapp of "letting the cat out of the bag" during the phone conversation with Mr Beasley.
Mr Redknapp replied: "Why would I let the cat out of the bag to the News of the World if I had done anything wrong?"
'Loved dog to bits'
He continued: "Do you think me and Mr Mandaric are going to have completely different stories. Are we that stupid?"
I've paid over £8m income tax Harry Redknapp
Speaking about the naming of his Monaco account, Mr Redknapp said he called the account Rosie after his pet bulldog because "I loved her to bits".
He told the court that he had to add his birth date to the name as there was another Monaco HSBC account called Rosie.
When prosecutor John Black QC suggested someone else might have had a dog by the same name, Redknapp said: "Or wife".
He added: "If she was as nice as Rosie they have got a good wife."
Mr Redknapp told the court he had not told his accountant about the account because "I had nothing to tell him, there was nothing in it".
'That's an insult'
Mr Redknapp told the court that the Rosie account was not a secret.
"I told all the boys at Portsmouth about it, I told Quest [the Premier League inquiry into bungs] about it, that's how secret it was.
"As far as I was concerned, it was the most unimportant thing in my life, that account."
He also said: "I've paid over £8m income tax.
"Why are we bothering over £10,000 or whatever I'm said to have saved in tax?"
At the end of his cross-examination Mr Redknapp replied to the accusation he had been "telling a pack of lies".
He said: "You think I put my hand on the bible and told lies? That's an insult."
Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson was then called by the defence team.
He told jurors that Mr Redknapp was an "amazing guy" who has always helped with his charity work.
Mr Redknapp is on trial alongside his former employer at Portsmouth, the club's ex-chairman Mr Mandaric, 73.
Both deny cheating the public revenue.
The jury has been told it will retire to consider its verdicts on Tuesday.
The trial continues.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) on Sunday declined to say that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE needs to apologize for his claims that President Obama was born in Africa and therefore not eligible to be president.
"You know, if everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing," Giuliani said on CNN's "State of the Union."

"Maybe a lot of the Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names. And it gets a little silly. Let's get down to the basic issue here."
The former New York City mayor also pointed out that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE's campaign was the first to bring up the birther argument.
"And finally it was resolved after Donald Trump raised it," Giuliani said.
"So, they maybe have a faulty memory there as to where that issue first came from and what first suggested it to them. It was the Clinton campaign."
Giuliani then touted Trump's outreach to African-Americans, saying that for years people have been criticizing Republicans for how they appeal to minority communities.
"Well, he reached out to the African-American community. Maybe it isn't the message of left-wing Democratic politics, which, in my view, having been the mayor of a city that was rotting when I took it over, on the front cover of Time magazine as the rotting of the Big Apple, because of years of liberal Democratic policies," Giuliani said.
"New York could be Detroit if I hadn't turned it around, if I hadn't lowered taxes, gotten jobs for people, gotten jobs for people on welfare, and straightened out a good deal of the education system and moved away from dependency."
How we look at things, is how we live them.
Back when I first started travelling, in the not too distant past, I never really went anywhere for a long period of time. Two weeks here, ten days there as weekend thrown in the midst of a month of heavy work.
My mum always used to say, ‘Two weeks is too long, One week isn't long enough and seven days is just about right'. Considering she was usually paying for the tickets – back when my only form of travelling was family holidays – I used to adhere to that rule a lot.
So to me, going on a three-week holiday to my Dad's house in Ireland was being away for a long time. A really long time.
By the time I was finally about to embark on a 9 weeklong trip to Australia – It was like I'd booked to go away for an eternity. I thought for sure I was going to be gone for so long that when I got back we'd have a new government, the currency would have changed and Bieber was finally retired from full time music. One can only hope, right?
When I got there, and for the weeks ensuing, it felt like I had a lifetime on my hands. Even when it got to four weeks left of the trip, I still had forever and a day to do whatever I wanted.
Fast forward 18 months to the present day, where I'm on my final four-week stint in America and it feels like I have absolutely no time left, at all. The grains of sand are passing through, the seconds are sprinting away and I'm on the verge of going home to cold, soaking, dull, boring, grey, England.
After having spent 9 months here, the last month feels like nothing at all. Like it's just slipping away.
It's been getting me depressed; ruining my mood and basically making me feel all around like crap. So, I had to do something about it. I had to flip what I was thinking.
Instead of thinking, ‘Crap, I've only got 4 weeks left, what a drag' I had to change it. I needed to refocus. So I started to think, ‘I've still got a month left in LA? Amazing. Be right back, just heading out to do something awesome.'
Since then my mood has come back, I'm enjoying my work again and, although I'm still not overly excited to be heading home – I'm making the most of my time I still have here.
The lesson in this though is simple, like I stated at the top. ‘How we look at things, is how we live them'.
Our individual worlds are made up of the perceptions that we have. Whether it be the can's and can't of what we can do, the certain types of people who can do certain things and the rules we choose to live by.
Lets say for example that you have always been an IT Technician. You've spent the last 10 years of your life working in a small air-conditioned office, telling people to turn their computers on and off again. You know the coding for all of your companies systems and you can fix just about any problem. But, it's boring. You hate it. You want out.
The first thing people are inclined to say is, ‘I want to go somewhere else, but I need to do a job in IT Still, it's all I've ever done.' You refer back to your perception that because it is all that you did do, it's all that you can do.
You still have a capacity to learn, you could still retrain to a different profession. Your brain hasn't only become a source of IT Knowledge for your peers. You could finally fulfil your dream of becoming a full time gardener. Or lawyer or go-go dancer or whatever it is. But because it's ‘all you've ever done', you'd rather go back and do the thing you hate than change your career path totally.
Another, more sombre approach comes from racism. The belief that ‘all' of a certain race or religion act a certain way. That people are thieves, that they have 18 wives or that they're ‘coming over here and taking all of our jobs'. These perceptions are wrong, but day-in day-out they affect how people approach life.
Changing the way you look at things, flipping it around and looking at the positives can make a whole new difference in your life. You have certain beliefs, limiting beliefs, which hold you back – that prevent you from being happy and in the moment.
Challenge: Find one perception or belief that is holding you back, and look at it in a new light. Instead of a countdown to a holiday, why not a list of things you can do with your time before? Don't think you can draw? Get a piece of paper and start doodling. Then work on the bigger stuff, like career changes and stuff you ‘can't afford'.

An Australian pharmaceutical company, the most recent "pot stock" to trade on the ASX, has become one of the first local players to be granted a license to grow marijuana for medicinal purposes.
MGC Pharmaceuticals, which is operated out of Israel, will be allowed to grow, process, import and export cannabis from Slovenia, where the government has legalised the practice.
Fellow Australian cannabis producer, AusCann, secured permission to grow and export marijuana on Norfolk Island in May. The difference between the two producers is MGC hopes to produce a product for the cosmetic industry whereas AusCann is targetting pain relief.

MGC Pharmaceuticals recently struck a reverse takeover deal with Erin Resources in the hopes of transforming the languishing gold-explorer into a cannabinoid resin producer.
MGC Pharmaceuticals has received two licenses from the Slovenian Government, the Ministry of Agriculture and The Ministry of Hemp and Poppy Control in the region, allowing the business to grow, process and trade Cannabis Sativa L (Hemp) and its products, including Cannabidoil (CBD) resin, in Europe.
A week ago, the internet fell victim to a thunderstorm outside of Washington D.C., taking out a chunk of Amazon's servers, which plays host to sites and services such as Instagram and Netflix. Then, on Friday; the internet died again, taking down sites such as Yelp, Reddit, and even our very own Gawker network.

But this time it wasn't because of the elements. This time it was because of a leap second. Huh?
Long story short: at 12:00 am Greenwich Mean Time, all of the atomic clocks across the world inserted a leap second (or in simpler terms, paused for a second) so that they could remain in unison with the rotation of the planet. It's happened 24 times since 1972, but we're at a point now when many pieces of technology, ranging from servers, to networks, to laptops, sync up their clocks with the atomic clocks. When a leap second gets thrown in to the mix—meaning they see the same time two seconds in a row—it does not compute. And we've all seen enough dystopian robot movies to know what that means: time to freak the frak out.
The end result was pretty ugly. Sites were down for hours, as administrators worked to clean up the havoc wreaked by one little stray second. Gizmodo crashed around 8:00pm EDT, was down for roughly 45 minutes before regaining functionality. But not everyone was affected. In fact, one site was well-prepared: Google. As Wired points out, Google had anticipated this eventuality months ago, outlining its strategy for handling the leap second threat last September with the unappealingly titled Leap Smear.
The solution we came up with came to be known as the "leap smear." We modified our internal NTP servers to gradually add a couple of milliseconds to every update, varying over a time window before the moment when the leap second actually happens. This meant that when it became time to add an extra second at midnight, our clocks had already taken this into account, by skewing the time over the course of the day. All of our servers were then able to continue as normal with the new year, blissfully unaware that a leap second had just occurred. We plan to use this "leap smear" technique again in the future, when new leap seconds are announced by the IERS.

ROCHESTER HILLS (WWJ) – Local authorities are working to solve the puzzling case of 23-year-old Rochester Hills man who hasn't been seen since last weekend.
Matthew Lyzen told his mother he was headed to the Fire and Ice Festival last weekend, but he never came home.
Police say Lyzen hasn't used his credit card since Saturday when he splashed out on two expensive meals: lunch Sumo Sushi and Seafood — where a waitress recalled he left “ridiculously large tip” — and later, dinner at the Rochester Chop House.
“The one gal was concerned because she thought that the tip he gave her was pretty outrageous, way too high,” said Rochester Hills Police Captain Mike Johnson. “It was a $17 or $18 bill, and he gave her $50 for it.”
Becky Lyzen said her son, who'd just finished up his associate's degree at Oakland Community College, never spends that kind of money on dining out. He doesn't have a job, doesn't drive, and she's worried that he's been depressed because he'd been sleeping as much as 20 hours a day.
“It's difficult to believe he'd allow me to suffer, not knowing where he is, and that triggers the worst fears,” she told WWJ Newsradio 950's Sandra McNeil. “If he doesn't wanna come home, that's fine. I just need to know that he's OK , and whatever this is, we can fix it … I love my son very much. I'm sure he knows that.”
Johnson said that because Lyzen is an adult with no diagnosed mental illness and he left home with appropriate clothes, he cannot be classified as endangered.
Matthew Lyzen is 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds. Witnesses last saw him last in downtown Rochester Sunday evening. He was wearing a leather jacket.
Police have received a tip that he may have been spotted in Sarasota, Florida, so they're sending down leaflets.
Anyone with information about Matthew Lyzen's whereabouts is asked to call 248-858-4951.

O movimento O Sul é Meu País surgiu em 1992 na cidade de Laguna, Santa Catarina, com a proposta de separar Paraná, Santa Catarina e Rio Grande do Sul do resto do Brasil. Segundo Celso Deucher, catarinense e atual presidente do movimento, contabilizando os simpatizantes nos três estados, atualmente há 6 milhões de pessoas em torno da ideia. A página oficial no Facebook registra pouco mais de 16 mil curtidas. São mais um, talvez o maior, entre os 53 movimentos separatistas que já apareceram na região. No site oficial, a organização se apresenta como "a consequência, de cujas causas não podemos ser acusados".
No encontro realizado no dia 20 de setembro em um hotel em Passo Fundo, os separatistas do grupo falaram das óbvias razões que possuem para se separar do Brasil e volta e meia recaíram sobre a crítica à corrupção e à política nacional. Disseram aceitar pessoas de todos os credos, raças e tendências políticas, desde que o indivíduo esteja “imbuído do desejo separatista”. Na fala dos líderes e palestrantes, “tudo que está errado” é traduzido em repulsa ao Bolsa Família, às cotas raciais, ao processo do Mensalão.
“A gente vê o governo abrindo mais vagas no Bolsa Família, mas não vê postos de trabalho”, reclama Deucher. “Nós queremos nos livrar, porque esse Estado, Brasília, não nos representa. Ele não diz nada para nós, o que ele diz é só coisa ruim”, conclui. A rejeição a Brasília é o mote dos panfletos que os membros imprimem com dinheiro do próprio bolso e distribuem em suas cidades. O mais recente lembrava que, em 2013, os três estados do sul arrecadaram 152 bilhões de reais, mas tiveram “retorno” de apenas 29,3 bilhões. Em letras amarelas, o movimento faz a conta: 80% “do total arrecadado não retornou aos estados”.

Eles acreditam que a distribuição das contas desencadeou um processo de “favelamento do sul”. Fundador do movimento separatista paranaense República das Araucárias, Helio Ribas Micheleto chegou a ser demitido do emprego em 1993 por sua ligação com a causa. Nem por isso se afastou do movimento ou deixou de usar na lapela do paletó o broche que carrega o símbolo dos três estados. “Hoje, os dez maiores municípios do Paraná, de Santa Catarina e do Rio Grande do Sul, municípios com mais de cem mil habitantes, estão cheios de favelas. (...) De onde é que veio isso aí? Gerado pela pobreza, pela falta de investimento federal, deixando os governadores sem dinheiro e, consequentemente, os municípios”, afirma.
Os separatistas também se creem injustiçados na representação parlamentar. Deucher reconhece que algumas das “oligarquias que tomaram conta do Estado nacional” são do Sul. Ainda assim, acredita que o cálculo do quociente eleitoral - que divide o número de eleitores pelo número de cadeiras disponíveis - faz com que o Sul nunca seja ouvido. “Como eu preciso de 17 catarinenses para valer um voto de um cara, sei lá, do Acre? De onde que saiu essa conta tão louca que um tem que ter poder econômico e outro tem que ter poder político? Num tempo em que o voto universal é um voto, como que isso continua acontecendo no Brasil, né? Essa questão aí, ela é seríssima. Por quê? Porque ela tira o valor como cidadãos que nós temos, como brasileiros. Tira a nossa força de lutar por aquilo que nós queremos”, frisa.
Na conferência, as “oportunidades” de expansão do movimento e formas de se espalhar a ideia são discutidas durante uma Oficina de Planejamento Estratégico. Um dos participantes sugere que o movimento utilize a mesma estrutura do marketing multinível – o polêmico esquema de pirâmide – esclarecendo que aqui não entraria dinheiro. Ele explica que uma pessoa seria responsável por integrar outras três à organização; essas três, outras três; e assim por diante. Outro integrante reconheceu na ideia uma estratégia também utilizada por igrejas evangélicas para arrebanhar mais fiéis: “Ah, sim, na igreja chamamos isso de igreja em células. Pode funcionar!”, exclama.

Mas a polêmica maior é o ter ou não ter participação ativa na política brasileira. Um dos participantes, Hermes Aloisio, vice-presidente do movimento em Passo Fundo, foi também candidato a vice-governador do Rio Grande do Sul pelo PRTB, o partido de Levy Fidelix. No programa de governo de sua coligação, o plebiscito pela “autodeterminação política e econômica” é uma promessa. Deucher tenta se afastar disso. Fala que alguns políticos já demonstraram interesse em apoiá-los: “Só que nós não queremos esses apoios, entendes? Porque os caras são sujos, pô”.

Celso Deucher, presidente do movimento O Sul é o Meu País, em palestra no encontro realizado em Passo Fundo
Na mesma época em que os catarinenses tentavam reunir os três estados sulistas em torno da causa com a fundação de O Sul é Meu País, em Porto Alegre, a República Federativa dos Pampas virava notícia nacional. Em 1993, Irton Marx, presidente da organização que defendia um território independente só para os gaúchos, protagonizou uma reportagem no Jornal Nacional da Rede Globo defendendo um país que falasse alemão. Acabou sendo acusado de nazista e processado pelo Estado. Uma imagem que, mesmo com a absolvição de Marx, ainda assombra os separatistas de hoje.
“O cara (Marx) criou um país inteiro. Ele sentou numa mesa e - com o perdão da palavra - se masturbou com a ideia e botou tudo ali. (...) Ele era radical, personalista, era ele que era o gostosão do negócio. Era ele que ditava as ordens, e isso começou a desagradar to-do mundo”, critica Deucher. Depois da secessão sulista, o movimento representado por ele decidiu se legalizar, registrando inclusive um CNPJ, se formalizando como pessoa jurídica.
O presidente alega que, na década de 1990, o grupo foi espionado pelo governo. Pessoas que se apresentavam como interessados na causa participavam das reuniões, gravavam conversas e, um tempo depois, aparecia um processo contra os separatistas. Outras vezes, recém-chegados pediam a palavra e revelavam um discurso fascista. Deucher conta que isso ainda se repete vez ou outra. Há oito meses, um militar da reserva gravou um dos encontros e registrou representação contra ele no Ministério Público com base na Lei de Segurança Nacional.

Ainda que Deucher critique o personalismo de Irton Marx, é difícil separar sua figura de O Sul é Meu País. Ele mesmo admite ser procurado para palestras dentro dos movimentos de Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e Amapá como referência do assunto. “Durante os anos, eu me especializei em Direito de Autodeterminação dos Povos. Talvez, assim, como professor, eu seja um dos maiores especialistas sobre isso na América Latina. Que é o quê? O estudo do significado desse direito”, conta. Um dos 27 livros que publicou (O Sul é Meu País), que estava à venda sobre uma mesa durante o encontro por R$ 25 reais, serve como referência constante nas falas dos integrantes. Na discussão sobre estratégias de disseminação da causa, impulsionar a venda da obra foi uma das questões apontadas. Um dos presentes chegou a brincar: “Bota uma Polar junto que vai vender rapidinho”, se referindo à cerveja gaúcha que usa a hipérbole do orgulho sulista em suas peças publicitárias.
Sad news: if you stay home all weekend to avoid the bitter, bitter cold, you are going to be missing out on a lot.
This weekend is packed with festivals and once-a-year stuff that is so much fun.
On the festival side we have the incredible Winnipeg New Music Festival and Big Fun, which has been underway for a few days already.
If you have $10 you can go crazy on sugary cereals and vintage cartoons at Cinematheque Saturday morning, and if you have even more money than that you can check out Art and Soul at the WAG Saturday night.
Have fun, you guys.
WHAT: FEST – Winnipeg New Music Festival
When: Saturday and Sunday
Where: Centennial Concert Hall at 555 Main St.
Cost: $26-$32 per show or $128 for a fest pass
This is my top pick for the weekend – and the one you should definitely go check out (if not this weekend, at some point this week).
The Gritty is part of the amazing New Music Festival this year. Go see it, OK? (Courtesy The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra) For the uninitiated, the New Music Festival is about contemporary classical music – but before your eyes glaze over, it's actually just a big party with food and drinks and an absolutely massive band and tons of creative, brilliant people visiting to do what they do best.
There's going to be art, food, music and fun in the Centennial's Piano Noble. There are going to be talks from people who know stuff about the music before it starts and there will be parties after.
Tickets are totally affordable (and even cheaper for students), and if you're still wary because “classical contemporary music” sounds intimidating, here's what Neil Middleton from the WSO told me about it: “You don't come knowing stuff, you come to learn … The idea is you take in this music and then hang out.”
Oh and by the way, Winnipeg has one of the most impressive new music festivals in the world. We kind of kick New York and San Francisco's butts in this regard.
WHAT: MUSIC – Big Fun Festival
When: Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Where: Various locations
Cost: $10-$15 per show or $60 for a fest pass
For a new-ish festival, Big Fun is doing some impressive things this year – and the good news is you can catch a lot of these shows after or before you check out the New Music Festival.
There are nine venues, a ton of local and not-so-local names and even a hungover breakfast show on Sunday.
Friday night it's all about West Broadway with shows at Thom Bargen (yay!), the Handsome Daughter and the Sherbrook Hotel.
My top picks for the weekend are a VERY early set by Panamax at the Handsome Daughter at 6 p.m. Friday, the Manitoba Music showcase on Saturday at The Good Will (hello Mise en Scene and Slow Leaves!) and the hungover brunch at Goodwill on Sunday with the Catamounts.
PS: KENmode is playing the Sherbrook Hotel Friday night if you're cooler than me and want to go to that.
WHAT: PARTY – Art and Soul at the WAG
When: Saturday, Jan. 31 at 8 p.m.
Where: Winnipeg Art Gallery at 300 Memorial Blvd.
Cost: $55
This was Art and Soul last year. This year, you could be one of those tiny people having fun. (Instagram @artandsoulwinnipeg) Let's get fancy, you guys. The Winnipeg Art Gallery is doing their annual super-fun thing Saturday night.
Art and Soul is basically a big fundraiser for the gallery, and you can either dress up or just dress nice and have drinks and be around art, and it's just generally lovely.
My absolute favourites Mama Cutsworth, DJ Hunnicutt and DJ Co-Op are all doing sets, and there'll be live music from Attica Riots too.
The galleries will also be open until 11 p.m. so you can check out the extended Dali exhibit if you're into it.
Oh and bring cash because it's kind of like a social where you buy drink tickets instead of paying with cash.
WHAT: FILM – All-you-can-eat cereal and cartoons party
When: Saturday, Jan. 31 at 10 a.m.
Where: Cinematheque at 100 Arthur St.
Cost: $10
I don't think I need to explain why people should go to this.
It's all you can eat sugary cereal and three hours of retro cartoons from the ‘60s through the ‘80s in a tiny theatre.
It's only $10, and you should bring all your friends. All of them.
Fair warning: lots of little kids go to this, so get yourself together and be cool, okay?
No cursing or talking about being hungover from Big Fun last night.
WHAT: THEATRE – MTC's Cowardfest
When: Friday, Saturday and Sunday
Where: Various locations
Cost: FREE to $85 for a fest pass
This is Noel Coward. What a boss. (Courtesy The Manitoba Theatre Centre) So this has a weird name, which is all the more reason to go check it out.
The Manitoba Theatre Centre is doing their annual Master Playwright Festival this weekend (and actually for the next couple weeks) and the big guy this year is Noel Coward.
Coward is mostly known for his comedy so this year's fest should be pretty good.
There will be plays, lectures, movies and all sorts of stuff to check out.
Joff Schmidtt, who knows a lot more about theatre than me, thinks you should go see Blithe Spirit at the Echo Theatre this weekend or Private Lives.
The campus for the O.P. Jindal Global University is planned in an entirely flat agricultural land, 10 km away from the city of Sonepat, Haryana on to remain of the mythical Grand Trunk Road that was going through Northern India, from Afghanistan to Burma.
As a Greenfield project with no built context, the design started on a very rigorous geometrical framework of traces regulateurs of squares and golden rectangles, dear to European architecture as well as Indian architecture.
The project is designed like a vast classical garden where the nature has been tamed by the rule of geometry. At the center is the academic square based on 6 courtyards clubbing together lines of classrooms and faculty offices, while auditoria, reception, library and cafeteria occupy the center of each courtyard.

Michael Vale (June 28, 1922 – December 24, 2005) was an American character actor famous for being the longtime sleepy-eyed mascot "Fred the Baker" for donut chain Dunkin' Donuts, with his famous catchphrase "Time to make the donuts." He was featured for 15 years until he retired in 1997, having done more than 1,300 television commercials. Vale also reprised the role for commercials for the short-lived Dunkin' Donuts Cereal. He died of complications from diabetes at age 83 in Manhattan at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and was cremated.
Personal life [ edit ]
Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Vale was dubbed "the actor" by his childhood friends because of his ability to imitate ballplayers and celebrities.[citation needed] After serving in the U.S. Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II, he studied at the Dramatic Workshop at The New School with classmates Tony Curtis, Ben Gazzara, and Rod Steiger.[1]
Career [ edit ]
One of his earliest appearances was in a summer stock production of George Bernard Shaw's Androcles and the Lion. Vale later described his modest role: "I was thrown to the lions."[citation needed]
He was a longtime spokesman for Kraft Foods' Breakstone line of cottage cheese and sour cream products, for whom he portrayed long-suffering dairy owner "Sam Breakstone".[2] The focus on those commercials is Sam's dedication to quality, usually with Sam having a comedic "eureka" moment on how to make a better product. Breakstone relatives and historians have noted that Vale's character was fictional and comedic. The Breakstone Dairy brand first started in 1882 by Lithuanian Jewish Emigrant brothers, Joseph and Isaac Breakstone, while their cousins Morris and Hyman, also sold dairy in NYC in the 1890s. The Breakstones trademarked the name in 1906. Lithuanian Jews like the Breakstones are often lighter in skin and hair color with less pronounced facial features than Michael Vale. The Breakstones did emphasize quality but through thought and hardwork rather than shouting.
Vale appeared in several television series, including Car 54, Where Are You? in the 1960s and The Cosby Show in 1987. On the big screen, he was a cab driver in A Hatful of Rain in 1957 and a jewelry salesman in Marathon Man in 1976. The actor described working with British leading man Laurence Olivier in Marathon Man as "the most wonderful experience of my life."
Fred the Baker [ edit ]
Vale got the role of Dunkin' Donuts' Fred the Baker via a casting call. He was told that another actor was to be cast in the role of the baker, but was encouraged to come to the audition anyway in case he was needed as an extra.[1] 300 actors participated in the casting call, including well-known character actor Lou Jacobi. Ally & Gargano creative director Ron Berger said that Vale got the role because of his likeability and believability: "Michael was 100% believable. He looked and talked and walked and breathed like he was a guy who got up at 4 a.m... Lou was good. But when it came to the final decision, Michael was the donut maker. After watching 300 people as Fred, Michael still made us laugh."[2]
The character was so well-liked by Dunkin' Donuts customers that when the character was retired as a result of moving the advertising account from ad agency Ally & Gargano to Euro RSCG, Dunkin' Donuts surveyed its customers on how the character. Euro decided to explicitly acknowledge the "retirement" of Fred the Baker with a campaign that included celebrity retirees such as Bob Dole, Larry Bird, and Sugar Ray Leonard providing Fred with advice on his retirement.[2]
On his death in 2005, Dunkin' Donuts released a statement, noting that Fred the Baker "became a beloved American icon that permeated our culture and touched millions with his sense of humor and humble nature."[3]

A dedicatory plaque and a plaque explaining the role played by H.M.A.S. Adelaide accompany the mast. To commemorate the end of the Second World war as part of the "Australia Remembers" year, the mast was restored and on 9 November 1995, rededicated at an official ceremony.
This mast of H.M.A.S. Adelaide was dedicated by Rear-Admiral G. D. Moore C.B.E. R.A.N.. as a memorial to the T.B Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen of the 1939 - 1945 War who died as a result of their disability. April 23rd 1950
HMAS ADELAIDE - MAINMAST
'The IMPROVED TOWN Class light cruiser HMAS ADELAIDE was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy on 5th August 1922. Built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, HMAS ADELAIDE was active with the Australian Fleet until paid off into reserve in 1928. During the ship's first commission, HMAS ADELAIDE participated in the 1924/25 world cruise as part of the Royal Navy's Special Service Squadron and in 1927 proceeded to the Solomon Islands on a peacekeeping cruise.
During 1938/39 the cruiser was modernised to meet the threat from more capable aircraft and recommissioned for service on 13 March 1939.
In the Second World War, HMAS ADELAIDE operated along the Australian eastern and western coasts. During September 1940 she proceeded to the French colony of New Caledonia to help in the transfer of formal control from Vichy to Free French forces and on 28 November 1942, the cruiser sank the German 'blockade runner' Ramses.
HMAS ADELAIDE provided gunfire support to landings in Ambon in 1944, before returning to Sydney for duties as a submarine depot ship. On 26 February 1946 HMAS ADELAIDE paid off from naval service and on 21 March 1947 was sold to be broken up in Port Kembla.
The ship's mainmast was erected adjacent to the Sphinx Memorial in Ku-ring-gai National Park in about 1950.

The Boston were always a possible solution to the Cleveland ' conundrum.
The question was whether the Eastern Conference's top two squads could sit at the same table and lend each other a hand.
The answer, as it turns out, was why not?
On Tuesday night, the two teams came to terms on a blockbuster deal, as the acquiesced to Irving's trade request and sent him to Boston in exchange for , , Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn ' 2018 unprotected first-round pick.
This was the first major move from Koby Altman, the recently anointed 34-year-old general manager. It was a deal that could have ripple effects across the league.
So, who won the deal?
"Cleveland made out like bandits," said a Western Conference scout. "To get an All-Star, a starter and a good pick, come on."
This seemed to be the consensus among the NBA coaches and scouts who spoke with Bleacher Report following the deal Tuesday night. For one, it allows the Cavs to take another shot at the Golden State while also protecting their future. They're essentially swapping a score-first, no-defense stud point guard for another. Thomas also doesn't take issue with playing alongside LeBron James, which of course helped fuel Irving's trade request, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.
In addition, they're getting a championship-level starting wing and a likely lottery pick to act as insurance in case James—and Thomas, to a lesser extent—elect to bolt in unrestricted free agency next summer.
"They improved their depth and are in a position to win the East still, while also setting themselves up for the future," said an Eastern Conference scout. "I give lots of credit to Koby Altman. That's hard to do."
By injecting Crowder into the mix, Altman has delivered James an ideal sidekick. Crowder is the prototypical three-and-D guy, exactly the type of player they were missing last year. He can defend multiple positions on defense—a must for taking on the —and drilled 39.8 percent of his treys last season.

"Crowder really helps LeBron out," said an Eastern Conference assistant coach. "He can play 4 offensively, like [Shane] Battier did for him [with the Miami , but guard the 3."
Most important, Crowder is content living outside the spotlight.
"It's a good situation for everyone. Jae's content, he has a chance to play with the best player in the world and compete for a championship," Crowder's father, Corey, told B/R in a phone interview Tuesday night. "Is he hurt that he's leaving Boston? You're in the NBA, trades happen, this is your job. But [Cleveland] is a good situation."
Thomas, meanwhile, can help carry the load on offense the way Irving did. Not being the primary ball-handler on every possession will require some adjustment, but his time in the motion offense of Celtics head coach Brad Stevens should ease that transition. Thomas connected on 39.9 percent of his catch-and-shoot triples last season, per NBA.com's tracking data, so the skill set is there. He also scored 28.9 points per game last season, which helped him earn the fifth-most Most Valuable Player votes.
"He's a good shooter. He's really improved from three," said another Eastern Conference coach. "He will definitely need a lot of pick-and-roll. He's not the isolation player [Irving] is, but I think it will be good offensively."
The issues will come on other end of the floor. Thomas' diminutive stature—he's listed generously as 5'9"—make him an easy and frequent target for opponents, especially come playoff time.
"Can Thomas even be on the floor for that series [against Golden State]?" asked the Eastern Conference assistant coach.
Still, for the the deal was a no-brainer. Imagine if Crowder is just what they lacked defensively last season. Imagine if Thomas and LeBron jell in a hurry. Imagine if Cleveland's added depth gives James a prayer in the Finals—or, more realistically, imagine an injury break going its way.
Imagine if the Cavs win the 2018 NBA title, which causes both LeBron and Thomas to re-sign. Perhaps Altman uses that pick to draft a future cornerstone.
It takes a shorter leap of faith to imagine the Cavs' worst-case scenario. The moves turn out being all for naught, as to remain invincible. LeBron leaves as a free agent, and Thomas decides to sign elsewhere too.
Sounds awful, right? Well, that scenario would have been Cleveland's fate regardless. The Cavaliers now have that Nets pick to build around.
Pinpointing Boston's motivations, however, is more difficult. The most obvious and interesting takeaway?
"The value that Ainge put on Irving," said the Eastern Conference scout. "That's what stands out here."
Ron Schwane/Associated Press
Earlier this summer, the decided neither nor merited their parting with some of their valuable assets. Perhaps this package wouldn't have landed Butler or George, but it seems like it would have, especially considering the paltry return the Indiana received.
If you look at Boston's offseason as a whole, the series of transactions becomes even more puzzling. The Celtics swapped Thomas, Crowder, Zizic, and a likely 2018 top-10 pick for Irving, Jayson Tatum and . While they signed Hayward,
Are they better today than yesterday? Perhaps. But to what end?
"A Big Three of , Kyrie and Hayward is very good," said the Eastern Conference assistant coach, "but is that a contender?"
"It's like they collected all this stuff at yard sales, and then decided to have a yard sale to afford some different stuff," added the Western Conference scout.
The offense should hum with Irving and Hayward now running things. However, losing Crowder and Bradley is going to significantly weaken the defense, which will put more pressure on youngsters like Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
That said, painting the deal as a whiff for the would be a mistake. For one, the team no longer has to worry about Thomas' upcoming free agency. The 28-year-old will likely be past his prime when Tatum and Brown come into theirs, and he plays a style that generally doesn't age well.
The 25-year-old Irving, on the other hand, fits Boston's timeline perfectly. No team in the NBA is better positioned to pounce on the ' eventual demise.
It's not like the emptied the cupboard either. They still have another high lottery pick on the way (either from the in 2018 or the in 2019) to go along with Irving, Hayward, Tatum, Brown and . If we're going to give the Cavaliers credit for threading the needle of contending in the present and building for the future, then we should praise the Celtics for doing so too.
"And in Irving, they got the best player in this deal," said the Eastern Conference scout. "The team that gets that usually wins the trade."
Will this deal follow that rule or wind up being the exception? Without the benefit of hindsight, all we can do in the meantime is enjoy the nonstop ride that is the NBA.

LOS ANGELES, CA — Documentary filmmakers needing assistance in understanding legal issues pertaining to their projects can soon turn to a UCLA School of Law clinic focusing on a wide variety of issues, including contracts, intellectual property, licensing and the First Amendment, it was announced Tuesday.
Taking advantage of UCLA Law's location in the heart of the moviemaking industry, the Documentary Film Legal Clinic will provide pro bono services to clients needing help with legal issues. The clinic, set to open in UCLA Law's spring 2018 semester, will include 14 second- and third-year students, working under the guidance of two experienced attorneys.
Dale Cohen, special counsel to the PBS documentary series "Frontline" and co-author of one of the field's preeminent texts, "Media and the Law," will direct the clinic, which is part of UCLA Law's Ziffren Center for Media, Entertainment, Technology and Sports Law.
UCLA Law alumni work as attorneys and executives at the highest levels throughout all areas of the movie business, and the school has held the No. 1 position on the Hollywood Reporter's ranking of the nation's top entertainment law programs since 2014.
"Given its geographic location in Los Angeles and status in the industry, UCLA Law is the perfect place to house a clinic specializing in the legal aspects of documentary production," Cohen said. "Through the clinic, independent filmmakers will get top-notch legal guidance, and students will work side-by-side with these journalists and artists, learning about the filmmaking process and helping to tell stories that are increasingly important to our democracy."
In the past year, UCLA Law has opened new clinics in immigration policy, human rights and services for veterans. In addition to documentary film, the school plans to launch clinics in immigration advocacy and music law in the coming year.
"Documentary films identify important issues of social justice and cultural change, and they are a proving ground for talented artists and storytellers," said Dean Jennifer L. Mnookin. "This program will propel emerging filmmakers and train the next generation of great media and entertainment lawyers."

The House today approved a bill that would block federal funds from going to Plan Parenthood for one year, unless the organization certifies that it will no longer perform abortions, something that it does not currently use federal funds for.
The vote, driven by a smear campaign from anti-choice extremists, was divided mostly along party lines, with the notable exception of Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who voted “present.” In a video statement, King explained that he didn't think the House bill went far enough in attacking the “diabolical” Planned Parenthood, taking particular issue with the fact that the bill would allow Planned Parenthood to continue offering abortions for women who have survived rape or incest:
Leading anti-choice groups have been trying desperately to stop anti-abortion lawmakers from talking about abortion rights for rape survivors after disastrous comments by Missouri's Todd Akin and Indiana's Richard Mourdock helped to sink their respective 2012 Senate bids.
The Susan B. Anthony List's Marjorie Dannenfelser, one of the most influential leaders in the anti-choice movement, held trainings to teach Republican politicians how to change the subject when rape comes up. Dannenfelser has been very clear that she opposes rape exceptions in abortion bans, which she has called “abominable,” “regrettable” and “ intellectually dishonest,” but will urge lawmakers to support a bill that has to contain such exceptions for political reasons.
But hard as Dannenfelser and her allies might try to get anti-choice lawmakers to shut up about rape, they face an uphill battle. Although most anti-choice activists oppose rape exceptions, a vocal portion of the movement believes that lawmakers should automatically reject any bill that includes such exceptions.
A 20-week abortion ban that passed in the House earlier this year and will be coming up for a vote in the Senate next week has been mired for years in anti-choice infighting about rape exceptions. Before a version of the bill came up for a House vote in 2013, Republican leaders scrambled at the last minute to add a rape exception to neutralize controversial comments made by the bill's sponsor, Rep. Trent Franks.
In January of this year, the House was planning to vote on the bill to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, but scrapped the plan after a coalition led by female Republican lawmakers objected to a provision that would have required rape survivors to report the crime to law enforcement. An exasperated Sen. Lindsey Graham told anti-choice activists the next morning, “I'm going to need your help to find a way out of this definitional problem with rape.”
After extensive negotiations, the House finally settled on a bill that includes an exception for rape survivors if they first undergo a 48-hour waiting period.
But, as Steve King's “present” vote shows, as long as they're spending time attacking abortion rights, the GOP is going to be stuck with what Graham called “this definitional problem with rape.”
We want to present to you a very beautiful house with nature around. This rustic cosy house called Kaweah Falls was built in the centre of Three Rivers, California, near the entrance to Sequoia National Park. It is the nook of paradise for those who love nature. River is usually a symbol of passing time and wildness of the nature. Living in this house reconnects man with surrounding natural environment. The dwelling seems to float over the river bank. Among the cool interior features are a dining room with a glass floor view of the river, there is a footbridge over these waters that lead to a private deck where one can sit and listen to the sounds of fresh water skimming river rocks. The 3000 sq foot area includes 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 2 kitchens and a series of private terraces and a terrace with stunning river views. It's a very natural house, giving the feeling of relaxation everyday with fresh air and sound of water flowing and crashing with stone. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright student Frank Robert.

MICHAEL Bisping will offer to throw our photographer into Sydney Harbour.
But not yet.
No, currently, this outspoken Englishman — a fighter right down to those three stitches above his left eye — is leaned so tight into the face of American rival Luke Rockhold, it's impossible to know where one beard stops and the other starts.
Reminding in that thick Manchester accent how “come Saturday, you've no f ... en idea what you're in for pal”.
But, hey, does anyone?
For if you understand only one thing about Saturday's UFC main event at Allphones Arena, let it be the following: this isn't the usual faux hostility served up to Aussie fight fans.
This rivalry nothing like the boxing razzamatazz that, in recent years, has roped in everyone from Frans Botha and Kimbo Slice to Gary ‘The Babboon' Gurr.
media_camera Luke Rockhold and Michael Bisping stared at each other intently.
Put simply, Bisping and Rockhold genuinely hate one another.
A truth proved on Sunday when, roughly 24 hours after jetting into Sydney, The Daily Telegraph brought them together for an exclusive photo shoot.
“And, look, maybe under different circumstances we'd get on,'' Bisping had told you earlier in the hotel lobby. “I mean, Luke Rockhold could be a great guy.
“Although from what I have seen, I don't think that is true. I think he's an absolute tool.”
And so arriving at Circular Quay separately, and each with security, the two fighters waited 20 metres apart until called together for pictures which had to be completed, we were told, within five minutes — or effectively one round in the UFC.
Which is exactly what we got.
media_camera ... and did the same with sunnies on.
The warring middleweights no sooner together than they were erupting into a shouting, pointing mess which, to be fair, UFC boss Dana White has already spent thousands of dollars trying to avoid.
See, while both camps flew into Sydney from Los Angeles, the company placed them on separate flights. Next, separate floors at the Mariott Hotel.
A UFC separation policy so intense, Thursday's Opera House press conference involves two shuttle buses, two green rooms — even lobby departures separated by more than a dozen minutes.
None of which our photographer was completely aware of when, with the two men eyeballing each other and spraying obscenities, he suggested, hey, why not take a quick break — then resume after that?
At which point Bisping politely explained how, should he be kept one second longer with Rockhold than necessary, “someone here is going for a swim in the f ... en sea”.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1% in the second quarter, following a 0.9% gain in the first quarter. The cumulative growth in the first two quarters of the year (+2.0%) was the strongest since 2002 (+2.1%). Household final consumption expenditure and exports of goods were important contributors to second quarter growth.
Real gross national income, a measure of the purchasing power of productive income earned by Canadian residents, advanced a more modest 0.4% in the second quarter, constrained by worsening terms of trade. Export prices increased 0.5%, while import prices rose 2.7% in tandem with a depreciating Canadian dollar.

Contributions to percent change in real gross domestic product, second quarter
Household spending increases
Household final consumption expenditure grew 1.1%, following a 1.2% increase the previous quarter.
Outlays on goods rose 1.9%, the strongest gain since the second quarter of 2007. The growth was evidenced in durable goods (+2.3%), semi-durable goods (+3.9%) and non-durable goods (+1.1%). Spending on services increased 0.5%.
Transport (+1.9%) contributed the most to the growth in household spending, as the purchase of vehicles rose 2.0%. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (+0.9%) and clothing and footwear (+5.0%) also contributed to the increase.
Housing market weakens
Investment in residential structures fell 1.2%, following a 2.9% increase the previous quarter. The decrease was due to a sharp decline in ownership transfer costs (-6.7%). A new tax on home purchases by non-residents in Ontario came into effect in April. Renovations increased 1.1% while new housing construction investment was virtually unchanged.
Exports rise
Exports of goods and services rose 2.3% in the second quarter, with an increase in the exports of goods (+2.8%) moderated by a decline in services (-0.1%).
The increase in exports was in large part due to significant growth in exports of energy products (+9.2%). Export volumes of crude oil and crude bitumen increased 7.4% in the second quarter, however prices fell, constraining the earnings of crude oil producers. Exports of natural gas, natural gas liquids and related products rose 14.4%. Industrial machinery, equipment and parts (+8.2%) was also an important contributor to export growth.
Imports grew 1.8%, led by higher imports of goods (+2.5%) and tempered by lower imported services (-1.0%)
Growth in imports was led by an increase in aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts (+13.0%) with contributions from energy products (+8.4%) and motor vehicles and parts (+1.8%). The increase was partially offset by a decline in commercial services (-2.7%).
Business investment increases
Business gross fixed capital formation rose 0.5% in the second quarter, following a 3.1% increase in the first quarter.
Investment in non-residential structures grew 2.4%, after increasing 1.0% in the first quarter. The growth was largely attributable to engineering structures (+3.2%), while investment in non-residential buildings was virtually unchanged.
Intellectual property products (+2.1%) grew for the second straight quarter. Increased investment in mineral exploration and evaluation (+17.9%), on top of strong growth in the first quarter, continued the recovery following steady declines throughout 2015 and 2016. Research and development (+0.2%) edged up while software was flat.
Investment in machinery and equipment grew 0.9%, following a 6.6% increase the previous quarter. Growth in aircraft and other transportation equipment (+13.2%) was partially offset by a decline in industrial machinery and equipment (-0.9%).
Business inventories rise
Businesses' inventories rose by $11.5 billion in the second quarter, following a $10.5 billion increase the previous quarter.
Non-farm inventories rose by $13.0 billion, as stocks in manufacturing (+$3.3 billion), trade (+$8.8 billion) and other non-farm (+$1.9 billion) inventories all increased. Farm inventory stocks were reduced by $892 million. Drawdowns in inventories of grain (-$279 million) and other crops (-$459 million) were the main contributors.
Retailers' inventories of durable goods rose by $1.4 billion, despite a drawdown in motor vehicle inventories (-$76 million). Stocks of non-durable goods increased by $2.0 billion. Wholesalers accumulated inventories in both durable (+$3.0 billion) and non-durable (+$2.3 billion) goods.
The economy-wide stock-to sales ratio declined from 0.748 in the first quarter to 0.742 in the second quarter.
Household saving unchanged
Compensation of employees grew 0.8% in the second quarter (nominal terms), following a 1.0% gain in the first quarter. Wages and salaries rose 0.8% as an increase in services-producing industries (+1.1%) more than offset a decline in goods-producing industries (-0.1%).
The household saving rate rose from 4.3% in the first quarter to 4.6% in the second quarter, as household disposable income (+1.6%) outpaced household final consumption expenditure (+1.1%).
The household debt service ratio (defined as household mortgage and non-mortgage payments divided by disposable income) was unchanged from the first quarter figure of 14.15%.
Corporate earnings edge down
The gross operating surplus of corporations edged down 0.1% in the second quarter. Gross operating surplus of non-financial corporations grew 0.3%, a fourth consecutive quarterly gain. Financial corporations' gross operating surplus fell a further 4.7% following a 0.9% decline in the first quarter.

Gross domestic product and real gross national income
Real gross national income increased 0.4% as worsening terms of trade constrained growth. Export prices grew 0.5% while import prices rose 2.7%. The implicit price of final domestic demand increased 0.3%, while the GDP implicit price index (the price of goods and services produced in Canada) declined 0.3%.
In celebration of the country's 150th birthday, Statistics Canada is presenting snapshots from our rich statistical history. Today, we look at the evolution of gross national income (GNI) since 1961. In addition to domestic production, the real purchasing power of a nation's income is influenced by three factors: the prices of exported and imported products, exchange rates and the inflow of labour and investment income from abroad less the outflow of income to foreigners. By incorporating these factors, real GNI captures a nation's true purchasing power, which is not fully reflected by real gross domestic product (GDP). Real GDP measures the volume of production from within a country's geographical boundary. In nominal terms, GDP and GNI are equal in the absence of international transactions. Real GNI takes into account changes in the terms of trade (the ratio of export to import prices) and exchange rates to reflect the purchasing power earned by Canadian-owned factors of production. From 1961 to 2016, the annual growth rates of real GDP and real GNI averaged 3.15% and 3.22% respectively, indicating that over the long term, the net impact of those factors have tended to be insignificant in Canada. In the short term, however, the two measures can diverge substantially. In 1998, for instance, a 6.8% drop in the exchange rate (CAN$1.00=US$0.67) in the aftermath of the East-Asian financial crisis, dampened real GNI growth to 2.0% compared with a 3.9% increase in real GDP. In 2008, primarily owing to the high prices of exported products including oil, real GNI rose 2.5%, whereas real GDP grew 1.0%, implying that the country could purchase more goods and services than it produced in that period. In 2009, real GNI fell 6.2%, but real GDP declined by only 3.0%. The sharper drop in GNI captures the loss in purchasing power due to a sudden drop in commodity prices in the wake of the global financial crisis, while prices of major import items (including motor vehicles and parts) were relatively stable. The divergence indicates that the nation was worse off than indicated by the drop in real GDP. In 2010, 2011 and 2013, real GNI grew faster than real GDP, as international factors were favourable for the income of Canada. In 2013, for instance, a 10.6% decrease in net-income outflow contributed to real GNI, which grew by 2.7% compared with a 2.5% growth of real GDP. From 2014 to 2016, with the fall in oil prices again, the reverse occurred. By combining domestic and foreign factors, real GNI provides a distinct signal in periods of volatility in exchange rates, prices of traded products, and net-inflow of incomes. Consequently, to undertake informed economic analysis, real GNI should be considered in conjunction with real GDP.
Note to readers For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Percentage changes for expenditure-based statistics (such as personal expenditures, investment, exports and imports) are calculated from volume measures that are adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based and flow-of-funds statistics (such as labour income, corporate profits, mortgage borrowing and total funds raised) are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not adjusted for price variations. There are two ways of expressing growth rates for gross domestic product (GDP) and other time series found in this release: Unless otherwise stated, the growth rates in this release represent the percentage change in the series from one quarter to the next, such as from the first quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2017. Quarterly growth can be expressed at an annual rate by using a compound growth formula, similar to the way in which a monthly interest rate can be expressed at an annual rate. Expressing growth at an annual rate facilitates comparisons with official GDP statistics from the United States. Both the quarterly growth rate and the annualized quarterly growth rate should be interpreted as an indication of the latest trend in GDP. Revisions Data on GDP for the second quarter of 2017 were released along with revised data from the first quarter of 2017.

Living just off the main pipeline to the Eve Gate, I'm used to seeing a certain amount of traffic fly by on a regular basis. Capsuleers making their pilgrimage to the Gate, capsuleers hunting down the pilgrims, research vessels, and a fair amount of Blood Raider activity really round out the area. It is perhaps not the quietest area in game, but for the past few years now I have called it home quite happily. Being in low security space was an added bonus, as I was able to get away from the increasingly worrisome oversight of CONCORD and its many, many regulatory heads. When you add in the bonus of more lucrative loot from exploration than you might find in high security and being able to check in on a number of significant New Eden historical sights on a regular basis, I find that choosing to live in my little corner of New Eden was a smart choice indeed. And while I may have moved on temporarily at different points in time, the area is always there to welcome me home when I'm done with my latest adventure.
When settling into the area, however, I quickly discovered something odd. This was shortly after Sansha Kuvakei had started rearing his ugly head in New Eden once again. At the time, CONCORD essentially abdicated defense responsibilities when incursions by the Sansha occurred, preferring instead to coordinate with the empire navies and focus on protecting civilian populations while leaving it to the capsuleers to rid the constellation of Sansha's space-based presence. I, along with many others, were very vocal at the time, criticizing CONCORD for not taking a more proactive response to the clear threat. However, as time went on, it became clearer that CONCORD was at least gathering significant intelligence on the Nation, and a number of classified reports were eventually leaked, suggesting that CONCORD's response to the Nation was centered in something called Operation ISHAEKA. This, along with clear evidence that capsuleers were able to handle the Sansha threat, eventually lessened the calls for a coordinated CONCORD response to the incursions beyond what they were already providing.
But back to the story at hand. As I was first settling into my new home, I quickly became aware that there was a heavier CONCORD presence than I would normally encounter in low security space. Generally, low security space should be beyond the reach of the Directive Enforcement Division, the part of CONCORD that most directly interacts with capsuleers (not to mention the part of CONCORD that seems to have the most anger issues…), but there was a suspiciously high amount of CONCORD activity throughout my local constellation, Monalaz. They didn't seem to act like the CONCORD fleets in high security space, reacting to capsuleer aggression and the like, but they were there nonetheless. Within a few weeks, I discovered that Operation ISHAEKA was more than just intelligence gathering when my probes managed to dig up the ISHAEKA Tactical Headquarters.
Eager to see what kind of response CONCORD had planned, I grabbed the Professor and warped to the site. Although cloaked, my comm system pinged with an automated warning for all capsuleer vessels to stay away lest we be met with lethal force. I came out of warp near a large taskforce of combined CONCORD and Amarr vessels, along with heavy fortifications. Cruise missile batteries, stasis towers, and a large array of ships ranging from lowly frigates to the fearsome standard-issue CONCORD battleships. To say that it was a little intimidating would be, shall we say, an understatement. But your intrepid travel guide was intent on seeing all that there was to see. On the far end of the landing area, I could see an acceleration gate leading deeper into the complex. I maneuvered the Professor around the various fortifications, quickly decloaked, activated the gate and-
Died. Quite quickly.
I gathered one or two close friends to try again a few weeks later. The site had moved to another part of the constellation but it was still fairly easy to track down. We managed to take a few larger, better armed ships in. Needless to say, CONCORD and the Amarr agents, apparently a division of the Amarr military called the Justiciars, were not happy with our arrival, and scrambled a large reaction force. However, we managed to fight them off and even cleared out the fortifications of the landing area. Triumphant, we gathered up what loot we could and activated that heretofore elusive acceleration gate to take us deeper into the complex. Our small flotilla quickly dropped out of warp and then-
Dead. Again. Quite quickly.
Thankfully, CONCORD didn't seem willing to attack our pods. Although we couldn't progress past the second area, we were able to see the sizeable fleet that had so quickly and effectively destroyed us. The fleet's core was a set of 16 battleships who locked us almost immediately upon warp-in, screened by lighter forces of frigates, cruisers, and battlecruisers. Clearly, something was here that CONCORD wanted to protect. Unfortunately, at the time I was not quite in a position to replace my losses. My interest drifted to other, more accessible locations and despite the fact that I still lived in Monalaz, I quickly stopped giving the Headquarters much more than a second glance as I saw what else the Cluster had to offer.
That is, until a few weeks ago. For what should be obvious reasons, I have been on pretty friendly terms with the Evesploratory Society, a group dedicated to exploration. Indeed, the members of the Society were kind enough to name an Astrahus-class citadel after Eve Travel as a tribute to my work (I was admittedly tempted to profile the citadel here but it seemed oddly self-serving to do so, though that hasn't stopped others from talking about it). In any case, while chatting with members of the Society and some other explorers, the topic of the ISHAEKA Headquarters once again came up. After I explained my prior difficulties getting into the complex, a number of pilots agreed to challenge CONCORD and their Amarr allies yet again. A week or two later, we formed up in a fleet and headed off. Although some of the local pirates decided that our forming fleet was an ideal target, we eventually got in a ragtag fleet consisting mainly (though not entirely) of Stratioses. And so we brought the fight to CONCORD and warped in to the ISHAEKA Tactical Response HQ.
As before, the initial area surrounding the warp-in point consisted primarily of heavy fortifications for the rest of the complex. It was clear that CONCORD didn't want anyone poking around (and we were once again threatened with lethal force if we tried to breach the rest of the complex). However, with the help of my fellow fleetmates, who called themselves the Misfits, we quickly cleaned up the initial fleet, and made our way deeper into the complex. As we worked our way through the defensive forces, it quickly became evident that although the forces were formidable, they apparently did not have authorization to utilize the classic anti-capsuleer technology that capsuleers rightly fear. Instead, the CONCORD forces appeared to be restricted to classical weapons. After the fighting had finished, I was able to pause and examine our surroundings a little more closely. The initial area was fairly bare beyond the defensive fortifications, as you might expect. On the other side of the area from the warp-in point, an acceleration gate led deeper into the complex. With some amount of trepidation given my prior history, we activated the gate and were flung deeper in.
As I remembered, upon dropping out of warp in the Justiciar Haven portion of the complex, we were immediately pounced upon by over a dozen battleships and another dozen smaller vessels waiting at the warp-in point for us (undoubtedly warned by their compatriots in the landing area of our impending arrival), and they opened fire almost immediately. As you might expect, they were cold and methodical in their attempts to eliminate us. Most, if not all, of the ships would target one person in the fleet in hopes of wearing us down. When it became clear the fleet member wouldn't break or the fleet member had to warp out to repair, they calmly selected their next target. Eventually, however, we managed to eliminate the resistance, and I managed to get a good look at the second area. I had plenty of time to poke around after the fighting ended as we waited for our ships to repair themselves. The haven area of the complex seemed to be a central loading area for the allied forces. A number of landing pads and administrative centers were arrayed between two acceleration gates, both leading deeper into the complex. Notably, although there were plenty of pads to receive freighters and sort out cargo, they didn't seem to be in use at the time. Since this was undoubtedly a mobile site, perhaps this site was where the construction ships were based out of, but that is only speculation. Finally, after everyone's ships were back up to fighting status, we moved deeper into the complex, and on to the ISHAEKA Fleet Staging Area. As we activate the gate, a general broadcast goes out to all ships in the area:
We are under heavy attack! Capsuleers are breaching our staging area! All local files are to be transferred immediately from the archives to a secure location offsite. Initiate burn protocols for all hard data. DED forces will delay the capsuleer incursion at the staging area until we can secure all intelligence. Give 'em hell!
Once again, our ragtag fleet was met with heavy resistance. While there were 5 fewer battleships waiting for us, those missing battleships were more than made up for by the 20 smaller ships flitting between the battleship behemoths. But once again, our fleet kept its collective cool and we calmly worked our way through the various vessels. I only hoped we were giving the CONCORD crews enough time to evacuate their vessels: I only wanted to see what CONCORD had hiding here, I had no desire to cause mass destruction unless absolutely necessary. Eventually, however, all that was surrounding us were cooling wrecks and I had a chance to examine the area once again. As a fleet staging area, I was not surprised to find a large array of shipyards waiting for us, along with quite a few landing pads filled with freighters in various states of loading and unloading. Most of the drydocks were empty, but a few held various CONCORD or Amarr ships nearing the end of construction. Surprisingly, one of the drydocks also held the shattered remains of an Archon-class carrier that had clearly undergone heavy fire. Why had they bothered dragging it back to the shipyard for analysis? Perhaps it had been damaged by Sansha forces and they were studying it for purposes of developing countermeasures. It was at this point that I was startled to realize that I had seen few, if any, indications that the forces here were in fact organized to fight Sansha's Nation. Indeed, I had seen few indications at all of any relation to Sansha. This struck me as very odd.
However, before I had time to ponder the mystery, it was time to move on yet again. We activated the acceleration gate, which somewhat unexpectedly took us back to the Justiciar Haven. However, the second acceleration gate, previously locked to us, had become active, and we headed to the final area: the Justiciar Archives. Although I was hopeful that our answers would be found there, another general broadcast shattered that hope:
The information you have come for is gone. All that awaits you now is the cleansing light of Amarrian laser fire! All pilots engage!
Not exactly the welcome I was hoping for. But we were quickly once again fighting for our lives against a combined CONCORD and Amarr onslaught. But we once again managed to prevail through sheer force of will (and the timely arrival of two logistics ships to help us repair). As soon as we were once again surrounded by cooling wreckage, I took a look at this last area of space. Clearly, this was the central administrative area of the complex. A large, though now abandoned, station formed the backdrop of the area, while a multitude of communications and other equipment could be found arrayed nearby. A quick scan confirmed that there was no information salvageable; the CONCORD technicians had done their job quickly but thoroughly.
As the rest of the fleet celebrated their conquest and rare victory over CONCORD, I couldn't help but notice that once again, CONCORD was raising more questions than answers. Absolutely no reference was found to Sansha or combating the scourge of his forces throughout the cluster. What, then, is Project ISHAEKA actually concerned with? Their last message to us especially made it clear that they clearly thought we were after specific information. What were they afraid we'd find? What could force CONCORD to enact such drastic measures? I couldn't help but feel that, as usual, if CONCORD were just more open with the capsuleer community, more willing to treat us as equals rather than rabid animals to be contained, we'd be able to help CONCORD achieve whatever goals they had… assuming it wasn't something directed against us.
Whatever unanswered questions I had, however, certainly weren't going to be answered that night. Those were worries for another day. Instead, I chose to revel in the feeling of finally overcoming something that had mystified me for years, and to do so with a group of good friends. Although we left a trail of destruction in our wake (and it is rare indeed that a group of capsuleers leaves behind anything else), successfully completing our mission in a group of friends is a feeling that can't easily be described or replicated. As I set a course back for home, I felt happy that after five long years, I had finally met the neighbors.
Basic Information:
Justin Morgan, the Warriors' new assistant coach, shown with the ball in his playing days for the club, against the Canterbury Bulldogs in 2001.
Former Warriors forward Justin Morgan is returning to the rugby league club as an assistant coach to Andrew McFadden.
His appointment, announced by McFadden on Sunday, comes as the club hires another former star in Tony Iro as recruitment and development manager.
Brendan Inkster is also joining the Warriors from Manly as strength, power and rehab manager.
Morgan made 28 appearances for the Warriors in 2001-2002 after earlier playing for Parramatta and Canberra. He and McFadden were teammates at the Raiders in 2000 and then again as NRL assistant coaches in 2012 before McFadden joined the Warriors.
Morgan retired at age 26 to turn to coaching, initially in France before he had seven seasons with Hull Kingston Rovers, whom he guided back into the Super League.
He returned to Australia as an assistant coach at Canberra in 2012-2013 and has been defensive coach for the Melbourne Storm for the past two seasons.
"This is a great opportunity to come back to Auckland to work with Cappy, the rest of the staff and the players," said Morgan.
"I have great memories of my time with the club in 2001 and 2002 and really look forward to this opportunity to help take the Vodafone Warriors to the heights everyone expects of the club."
McFadden said it was exciting to sign a coach of Morgan's calibre and experience.
Stuff.co.nz revealed Iro's appointment on Sunday.
McFadden last week confirmed the wider NRL squad for 2016 was almost complete. So far five new players have been signed – Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, Issac Luke, Ligi Sao, Blake Ayshford and Henare Wells. There are a few spots still to be filled.
Apart from players involved with the Kiwis in England, the rest of the squad is scheduled to start its 2016 offseason training programme on November 2.

On March 4, 1933, in his inaugural address, President Franklin Roosevelt told an anxious nation that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”
On April 12, 2017, in response to a question from a Norwegian reporter at a press conference with the NATO Secretary General, President Donald Trump told an anxious world that they would soon have nothing to fear as soon as he fixed all the problems, because it's better when there aren't problems:
Reporter: What do you think European countries have to fear from Russia if this tension continues to escalate?
Trump: Well, I want to just start by saying hopefully they're going to have to fear nothing, ultimately. Right now there is a fear and there are problems, certainly problems, but ultimately I hope there won't be a fear and won't be problems and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation. It's crazy what's going on, whether it's the Middle East or you look at no matter where, Ukraine, you look at – whatever you look at, it's got problems. So many problems. And ultimately, I believe that we are going to get rid of most of those problems and there won't be fear of anybody. That's the way it should be.
So there you have it. Trump also said, in reference to deterring North Korea's nuclear program, that “if we go it alone it will be with other nations.”
Megyn Kelly on Good Morning America in February.
When Gretchen Carlson filed her sexual-harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes on July 6, the explosive allegations surely did not surprise Megyn Kelly. Fox News' biggest star has since told lawyers hired by parent company 21st Century Fox to investigate Ailes that she experienced similar unwanted sexual advances from the Fox News chair in the mid-2000s when she was a young correspondent in the Washington bureau.
According to a source briefed on the investigation, Kelly has helped at least one colleague speak out, too. In recent days, Kelly has called a former Fox female anchor and encouraged her to share her experience of harassment by Ailes with the corporate investigators. The former Fox anchor had described to Kelly being kissed against her will by Ailes during a private meeting. According to a person briefed on Kelly's thinking, Kelly decided to speak to Paul, Weiss attorneys and encourage others to do so because she felt that a parade of Fox women marching to Ailes's defense was presenting a distorted public account of the company's culture. “Megyn thought the other side of the story needed to be told,” the source said.
Kelly has so far declined to comment. Her lawyer told the New York Times that “she has cooperated with the inquiry fully and truthfully.”
Ailes has responded by launching a counteroffensive against Kelly. Earlier today, Fox spokesperson Irena Briganti emailed reporters a list of glowing remarks Kelly has made about Ailes through the years. Meanwhile, Ailes's lawyer, Susan Estrich, denied the allegations, telling The Hollywood Reporter: “Roger has spent the last 10 years helping Megyn Kelly become the star that she is.” And tonight, Breitbart News reported that more than 50 Fox on-air personalities will walk if Ailes is forced out. One Fox source says the article is spin, and that there's no talk of mass exodus among anchors. “This is being made up,” the person said.
The problem for Ailes is that the Murdochs, who control 21st Century Fox, are siding with Kelly. Wednesday's New York Post — a Murdoch-owned paper — features Ailes on the front page:
The end is near for Roger Ailes https://t.co/gfAYnjqx7V pic.twitter.com/mWUx7Yi9uC — New York Post (@nypost) July 20, 2016
It's widely seen as a message from the Murdochs that Ailes should accept their severance agreement or face further public humiliation.
The North Korean military issued a statement on Saturday threatening to attack activists should they fly leaflets into the North as planned.
“All the firepower strike means of the frontline units of the KPA will launch without prior warning indiscriminate operations to blow up balloons carrying those leaflets,” said the “open notice” of the Korean People's Army (KPA), carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Earlier this month, the defector activist group Fighters for a Free North Korea announced that they would send leaflets and DVDs of the film The Interview into the North around March 26, the fifth anniversary of the sinking of the South Korean Cheonan naval vessel.
Although Pyongyang has been warning against the plan, the group's leader Park Sang-hak said they would fly out the leaflets and DVDs as planned.
However, Saturday's warning was particularly strident, even by the standards of North Korean state media.
“Any challenge to the DPRK's just physical countermeasures will entail (second) and (third) merciless retaliatory strikes,” it said.
The notice also recommended that South Korean residents along the Military Demarcation Line area should evacuate in advance for their safety before the flying out begins.
Last week, the South Korean government said it would do what was necessary to ensure residents' safety, indicating that it was willing to rein the balloon launches.
“Announcing the scattering of leaflets in public is not advisable since it raises the danger to our citizens' safety, including that of the border area residents. The government will take necessary measures if there occurs an evident danger to the residents' safety,” Ministry of Unification spokesperson Lim Byong-cheol said last Friday.

Another alternative is to do whatever everyone else is doing, even though the price of a stock appears high; this is the so-called greater fool theory. This theory is applied on the basis that "I know I am a fool to pay such a high price for a stock but I know that a greater fool will come along and pay me an even higher price."
You could take all the gold that's ever been mined, and it would fill a cube 67 feet in each direction. For what that's worth at current gold prices, you could buy all -- not some -- of the farmland in the United States. Plus, you could buy 10 Exxon Mobils, plus have $1 trillion of walking-around money. Or you could have a big cube of metal. Which would you take? Which is going to produce more value?

The Department of Energy on Thursday awarded a key permit for a Northern Pass project.The transmission project would carry hydropower from Canada to more than a million homes in southern New England.The granting of what is called the Presidential permit allows for the $1.6 billion project to take hydropower across an international border and connect to the United States grid.First conceived in 2010, the Northern Pass project calls for building a 192-mile electricity transmission line from Pittsburg to Deerfield in New Hampshire, carrying enough Hydro-Quebec energy to power about a 1.1 million homes.The permit approval is the latest sign of progress for a project that has sparked angry protests and heated debates at scores of hearings. It has pitted supporters who argue it will create jobs and cut energy costs against those who fear the transmission lines will destroy scenic views, reduce property values and hurt tourism."We are pleased to see the DOE permitting process for Northern Pass draw to a close, and appreciate the years of diligent work done by the federal agencies in reaching this critical project milestone," Bill Quinlan, president of the utility Eversource New Hampshire, said in a statement."With the New Hampshire and Canadian permitting processes also nearing completion, and considering we have all major contractor, equipment and labor agreements in place, Northern Pass is on track to begin construction by mid-2018," he said. Quinlan added the progress is "good news" for customers and other interested parties "who support this project for the many benefits it will bring to the state and the region."Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who has long favored the project, said it would be a "home-run for small businesses, rate-payers, and clean energy advocates.""Today, New Hampshire is one step closer to lowering energy rates across the Granite State," he said in a statement.Opponents said they were not surprised by the decision and are putting their hopes on a state group that also must weigh in on the transmission project. The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, is expected to announce its final written decision on the project by March 31, 2018.Along with the state approval, the project also is awaiting a permit from the U.S. Forest Service allowing the project to pass through parts of the White Mountain National Forest and a wetlands permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is expected by the end of the year."They have a permit to cross the international border but they don't have a permit to site the project on 192 miles of New Hampshire landscape. That is what the SEC will determine," said Will Abbott, the vice president for policy with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, which opposes the project."Their exuberance may be a bit premature," he said. "We believe the evidence makes a clear argument why the permit should be denied. We feel very confident that there is a very compelling argument for the SEC to get a decision not to issue a permit."
Global warming has already increased the risk of major disruptions to Pacific rainfall, according to our research published today in Nature Communications. The risk will continue to rise over coming decades, even if global warming during the 21st century is restricted to 2℃ as agreed by the international community under the Paris Agreement.
In recent times, major disruptions have occurred in 1997-98, when severe drought struck Papua New Guinea, Samoa and the Solomon Islands, and in 2010-11, when rainfall caused widespread flooding in eastern Australia and severe flooding in Samoa, and drought triggered a national emergency in Tuvalu.
These rainfall disruptions are primarily driven by the El Niño/La Niña cycle, a naturally occurring phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific. This climate variability can profoundly change rainfall patterns and intensity over the Pacific Ocean from year to year.
Rainfall belts can move hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometres from their normal positions. This has major impacts on safety, health, livelihoods and ecosystems as a result of severe weather, drought and floods.
Recent research concluded that unabated growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the 21st century will increase the frequency of such disruptions to Pacific rainfall.
But our new research shows even the greenhouse cuts we have agreed to may not be enough to stop the risk of rainfall disruption from growing as the century unfolds.
Changing climate
In our study we used a large number of climate models from around the world to compare Pacific rainfall disruptions before the Industrial Revolution, during recent history, and in the future to 2100. We considered different scenarios for the 21st century.
One scenario is based on stringent mitigation in which strong and sustained cuts are made to global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes in some cases the extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
In another scenario emissions continue to grow, and remain very high throughout the 21st century. This high-emissions scenario results in global warming of 3.2-5.4℃ by the end of the century (compared with the latter half of the 19th century).
The low-emissions scenario - despite the cuts in emissions - nevertheless results in 0.9-2.3℃ of warming by the end of the century.
Increasing risk
Under the high-emissions scenario, the models project a 90% increase in the number of major Pacific rainfall disruptions by the early 21st century, and a 130% increase during the late 21st century, both relative to pre-industrial times. The latter means that major disruptions will tend to occur every four years on average, instead of every nine.
The increase in the frequency of rainfall disruption in the models arises from an increase in the frequency of El Niño and La Niña events in some models, and an increase in rainfall variability during these events as a result of global warming. This boost occurs even if the character of the sea-surface temperature variability arising from El Niño and La Niña events is unchanged from pre-industrial times.
Although heavy emissions cuts lead to a smaller increase in rainfall disruption, unfortunately even this scenario does not prevent some increase. Under this scenario, the risk of rainfall disruption is projected to be 56% higher during the next three decades, and to remain at least that high for the rest of the 21st century.
The risk has already increased
While changes to the frequency of major changes in Pacific rainfall appear likely in the future, is it possible that humans have already increased the risk of major disruption?
It seems that we have: the frequency of major rainfall disruptions in the climate models had already increased by around 30% relative to pre-industrial times prior to the year 2000.
As the risk of major disruption to Pacific rainfall had already increased by the end of the 20th century, some of the disruption actually witnessed in the real world may have been partially due to the human release of greenhouse gases. The 1982-83 super El Niño event, for example, might have been less severe if global greenhouse emissions had not risen since the Industrial Revolution.
Most small developing island states in the Pacific have a limited capacity to cope with major floods and droughts. Unfortunately, these vulnerable nations could be exposed more often to these events in future, even if global warming is restricted to 2℃.
These impacts will add to the other impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification and increasing temperature extremes.
The Sheriff, District Attorney and a judge in Huntingdon County, PA may have stretched the law and infringed on individual civil rights in assisting a gas transmission company to get a wildlife sanctuary cleared for pipeline construction.
Sunoco Logistics Partners is in the midst of eminent domain proceedings in Central Pennsylvania to construct the Mariner East 2 pipeline. A court order favorable to the company, punitive bail set for activists resisting the clear-cut for the pipeline, plus allegations of endangerment and arbitrary arrests–one allegedly ordered by the District Attorney–point to local courts and law enforcement looking out for Sunoco's interests.
A judge issued an emergency injunction on March 28 to allow Sunoco to proceed with clear-cutting three acres of the Gerhart family's land, even though they are still pursuing litigation. Their supporters took to the trees on March 29-31 in an attempt to stop or delay the chainsaw crew. Three tree-sitters were backed up by a support team in a civil disobedience action “of last resort.”
Sheriff's deputies arrested one of the property owners and two of the liaisons between the tree-sitters and law enforcement officers. For the activists, the judge set bail out of proportion to the misdemeanor charges. In one case, bail was set at $200,000.
The pipeline resisters say that the safety of the three tree-sitters was threatened, and law enforcement officers refused to stop crews from cutting down trees near them. With high wind speeds, there was danger of creating a wind tunnel by clearing a long path for the pipeline. “They told us the people should get down if they didn't want to be cut down,” said Megan Holleran.
Liz Glunt was arrested when she crossed into the right-of-way to warn tree-cutters that they were getting too close. She met the $100,000 bond and was released the next day.
Property owner Ellen Gerhart says she wasn't near the right-of-way when she was arrested, although she was alarmed that a tree had been felled so close to the one her daughter perched on that it brushed it on the way down. The deputies said she had been arrested because she was “in the danger zone.”
Alex Lotorto said he had been asked to come to the Gerharts' and take on the role of police liaison. He assists landowners around the state who are facing pipeline easements with things such as getting attorneys to negotiate for them. He called a civil disobedience action like this one a last resort for landowners to consider only when nothing else has worked. “It's a piece of leverage they have in these one-sided negotiations,” he said.
At the Gerharts', he said he spent 3 1/2 hours discussing everyone's intentions with police officers and rules and regulations pertaining to the right-of-way and wetland boundaries. His aim, he said, was to make sure that everyone remained safe. The state police, however, ran a background check on him and discovered that he had participated in protests like this one before.
Sheriff's deputies arrested him and said they did so on the orders of the Huntingdon County District Attorney, according to Lotorto. (The District Attorney had not returned calls by press time.) Lotorto maintains that he never stood in the right-of-way, raised his voice or refused to answer a question.The official grounds for the arrest were that he was carrying a two-way radio. Lotorto says he used it only to communicate with others on the ground, and he was not involved in the tree-sit.
Lotorto spent a total of three days in jail, during which he refused to eat. On the day he was arrested, he was charged with indirect contempt of court. Huntingdon County Judge George N. Zanic wrote the court order so that any violation would result in a mandatory sentence of six months. At arraignment, the same judge set bail at $100,000. Lotorto did not have representation, although he requested a public defender.
After sleeping an hour in his cell, he was woken up and told he was being taken somewhere but they wouldn't tell him where. Aware of such things as police black sites, he described being taken somewhere at night without knowing where he was going as a “terrifying experience.” Ultimately, he was escorted to the courthouse for a second arraignment with a different judge. He was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and bail was doubled to $200,000. He again did not have access to legal counsel, and he wasn't allowed to change into street clothes for the hearing. With the additional charge, he faced up to 18 months in jail plus fines.
His bail was so high with respect to the charges that, Lotorto says, a man held in the jail with him who had been charged with child molestation had his bail set much lower at $75,000. He speculates that bail was meant to keep him in jail until the court order allowing Sunoco to clear-cut on the Gerharts' property expired on March 31.
He believes that he and the protesters had taken adequate precautions to ensure safety and make sure everyone was familiar with rules and regulations, including handing out leaflets to workers, having a safety plan and medics on site. In spite of his arrest, in the end no one was hurt and no one lost their job, he said.
However, he was critical of law enforcement on the scene. “They didn't want to understand what was going on,” he said. “They were there as security for the company, you know. They were serving the company's interest, not the landowners'. And the company doesn't pay them, the taxpayers do.”
With companies continuing to build pipelines all across Pennsylvania, Lotorto believes that strategic, nonviolent approaches to resist eminent domain ought to be respected, else the situation could deteriorate. “The danger is that there are people out there who won't be as nice as us. And I don't want people to get hurt doing this stuff,” he said.
“There are a lot of military families in the state, people who won't come to protests or community meetings, and they only know violence in a lot of situations. That's how people settle things.”
Lotorto was released on April 1 on his own recognizance and has a hearing scheduled on April 6.
Note: Previously this article incorrectly stated that Lotorto was released on March 31.

For a group of Regina soccer players, Wednesday night was about more than just hitting the pitch for a game of footy.
Some fleet feet took part in the final game of the Muslim Champions League. The special four-day soccer tournament is put on by the Rahmah Centre of Regina, an Islamic organization in the city.
Amar Mohamud, one of the tournament organizers, believes events like this will help newcomers feel welcome in the community.
"In the Middle East, the number one sport — especially for youth — is soccer and we have a lot of Syrian refugees coming in," Mohamud said. "If this is a success going on in the future, we would hope that they would participate with us and enjoy."

Osman Salad Hersi, president of the Rahmah Centre of Regina, said such events are even more helpful as the Muslim population grows.
"This will be some kind of hub for them to associate with people of the same creed and people of the same background, same culture," Hersi said. "We are here to welcome all of these newcomers and to be a good start for them to see that the Muslim community here is thriving."
The organizers of the event said they are planning to hold another Muslim Champions League tournament in the spring.
It is all too easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of thought, but visualising your inner critic can help
Psychologists use the term “automatic negative thoughts” to describe the ideas that pop into our heads uninvited, like burglars, and leave behind a mess of uncomfortable emotions. In the 1960s, one of the founders of cognitive therapy, Aaron Beck, concluded that ANTs sabotage our best self, and lead to a vicious circle of misery: creating a general mindset that is variously unhappy or anxious or angry (take your pick) and which is (therefore) all the more likely to generate new ANTs. We get stuck in the same old neural pathways, having the same negative thoughts again and again.
Happily, increasing evidence of the brain's plasticity suggests that we can disrupt this poisonous cycle and put in place something much more healthy. Brains don't stop developing in childhood, as was previously believed: studies of London cabbies doing “the knowledge” of the city's layout have found a redistribution of grey matter, and individuals who sustained massive brain damage have been shown to develop workarounds using undamaged parts. So we can learn to stop our thoughts travelling down the well-trodden neural pathways by creating entirely new ones.
The first step is to become aware of your automatic negative thoughts – and for me, anyway, that's much easier (and more fun, actually) if I personify the inner critic, with a sketch, and give him/her a voice. By doing that, I externalise the thoughts: they're no longer coming from me. And it seems I'm not the only one who likes working that way.
Personal negativity
I don't know what yours is like, but I imagine my inner critic as small with a shaved head, and dark shadows under his bulging eyes. He generally looks worried, and avoids eye contact, but sometimes he stares boldly, his face contorted into a disbelieving sneer.
The description is based on drawings I've made of him. And having determined his appearance, I gave him a name: Uriah, because like the Dickens character my inner critic is “ever so ‘umble”.
He's determined to keep me that way, too. Whenever I'm about to do something exciting – that's when Uriah pops up. And in the privacy of my own head he says things like this: You're not ready. Nobody wants that anyway. You're too old. It's not going to make any difference. Nobody is listening to you. You will never be successful. You don't work hard enough. It is painful.
I knew nothing about my inner critic until a couple of years ago, when a friend was training as a life coach, and asked me to be her guinea pig. At the time, I thought life coaching sounded a bit odd and – well, Californian. I didn't expect much. But I trusted my friend, and found the experience so helpful that I decided to train as a life coach myself – not a therapist, any more than a football coach is a therapist, but a conversational partner who uses insights from psychology occasionally to be supportive and challenging at the same time. (The company that trained us both, Coaches Training Institute, did indeed turn out to be Californian.)
Until then I had assumed – like most people, it seems – that when a negative thought popped into my head it was just an accurate reflection of the way things really are. But I've since come to see that the inner critic only ever promotes a point of view. And there's always another point of view available if we choose to look for it.
Finding your inner critic
Not long ago, I was running a workshop on creativity for a group of about 30 adults who, for a variety of reasons, had lost the free spirit of creativity they'd had as children.
So I decided to show them my drawing of Uriah, with speech bubbles coming out of his head to show the specific, shameful thoughts that trouble me. I have to tell you that it made me extremely uncomfortable to hold up that picture in front of these strangers, and to read out those horrible specimens of self-criticism. (“Tell them I'll never be successful! I'm too old! I can't do that!”)
But as I did it, I looked around at the faces before me and I realised that they weren't especially interested in my inner critic – they were much more interested in uncovering their own. (What's more, my own anxiety about this shameful secret substantially disappeared as soon as the words left my mouth.)
So, having shared my own self-critical thoughts, I invited everybody else to take a pen and paper and write down the kinds of thoughts that pop into their own heads.
The room went very quiet.
Then I asked them to imagine about the kind of person who might say those mean-spirited things, and to draw him, or her. (It doesn't have to be a “good” drawing.) Some drew a picture of their old headteacher, others drew a parent, or somebody at work. I asked them to give the character a name, and to draw speech bubbles containing all those horrid sentences.
When working with people like this, I ask them to notice, in future, whenever these characters come into their heads. To be really curious. How often does it happen? What's the trigger? What emotional state does it leave you in? How strong is that emotional state, from one (low) to 10 (high)?
And after noticing, I invite them to argue back with their inner critic. “If it helps,” I might say, “think of somebody you admire for whatever reason, and imagine that person is beside you now, offering support. If they were arguing for you, what might they say?”
Answers don't always come easily. Some people are just too afraid of the negative thoughts. But that usually passes. Others might think the exercise is silly. So I lay it on thick about the science: psychologists, automatic negative thoughts, and neural plasticity. But either way, it basically comes down to the same thing: moving beyond the negative chatter in your head, and putting your inner critic back inside his box. And as many coaches, and cognitive behavioural therapists, can confirm – getting acquainted with your inner critic can be remarkably helpful.
Categories
We all have our own particular set of automatic negative thoughts, but they tend to fall into broadly similar categories.
Black and white thinking, with no grey areas: “I've completely failed.” “Everyone else can do it”.
Mind reading other people:“They think I'm boring.” “People must think I'm stupid.”
Crystal-ball gazing: “There's no point in trying. It won't work.”
Over-generalisation: “This relationship ended, so I won't ever meet anybody.”
Disqualifying the positive: “I may be a good mother, but anybody can do that.”
Drama queen: “I can't find my purse. I'm going senile.”
Unrealistic expectations: “I should keep going, even when I'm tired.”
Name calling, to self an other: “Silly fool.”
Self-blame: “She looks cross. It must be my fault.”
Catastrophising: “Nothing is ever going to work for me.”

Ever since Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin kinda sorta threatened to bench him, Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill has looked like a new man. I don't know if Philbin's words truly inspired him to play better or not, but I can say for sure that a subtle new offensive direction has helped him tremendously. Now, Tannehill looks a lot more like Alex Smith than Aaron Rodgers but perhaps that is for the best, for all involved.
Throttle down on the deep-passing game
First off, it appears that the Dolphins have cut down on the passing plays meant to push the ball down the field in favor of more short route combinations, allowing Tannehill to get the ball out of his hand a lot quicker. In hindsight maybe the big free agent addition of Mike Wallace had the team trying to force the ball down the field even though Tannehill and Wallace never could seem to gain any chemistry together on those deeper throws.
It makes sense that the Dolphins would want to get their moneys-worth out of the speedy Wallace, but it turns out Wallace has pretty good route running ability and can get open just as easily on shorter routes as well. Quietly, he has already posted five touchdown receptions, including one in each of the last three games. That would equal his touchdown output from last season and is exactly half of his career high of 10 touchdowns back in 2010 with the Steelers.
Let Tannehill be an NFL rushing threat?
The Dolphins also seem to be featuring much more of the read option type of plays that you would see a team like the Chiefs or the Eagles run. It isn't just the running game, but also the passing game that has benefited from some of those schematic changes. Tannehill looks to be particularly adept at using the read option run fake to help set up quick "pop" passes up the seam.
Now that's good and all, but really the most noticeable change the last three weeks has been Tannehill's ability to pick up a lot more yards rushing the ball. He isn't pulling it on read option plays just to "keep them honest," he is looking to break off a big one every time.

Check out this contrast -- in the first three games, Tannehill ran eight times for a total of 18 yards ... combined. In the last three games, he has rushed for 35, 49 and 48 yards, while averaging over four carries per game. His 30-yard scamper on a 4th-and-1 late in the 3rd quarter put the Dolphins on the Bears 2-yard line, and lead to their third touchdown of the game two plays later. Tannehill is not just a gimmick in the running game, he is now a weapon.
★★★
I get the sense having watched Tannehill over these last three games that the changes on offense have helped him finally turn the corner and he actually has me believing in that team now. I keep saying this is the year some team in the AFC East might finally be able to knock the crown off of the Patriots' head. And if Tannehill can keep playing this well, that team just might end up being the Dolphins.
On another note, I wonder if Prisco still thinks this read option stuff is just a "fad." LOLz
The Rams crazy turnaround from the worst offense in a decade to one of the best in the league continues to mystify and impress us. Through the first three games of the season, the Rams are ranked 7th in total offense with 1,123 yards.
Even more astounding is the fact that they're No. 1 in the NFL in points per game, averaging a ridiculous 35.7 after their shootout with the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday Night Football last week. In the history of the Rams franchise, only the 2000 “Greatest Show on Turf” team every averaged more points per game through Week 3 of the regular season.
Related Kurt Warner thinks Isaac Bruce should already be in the Hall of Fame
Even their efficiency on downs has been elite. According to ESPN's Bill Barnwell, they're just ahead of the Patriots in yards per play on first down thus far this season – behind only the red hot Chiefs.
Yards per play on first down so far this year: 3) Patriots, 7.47
2) Rams, 7.64
1) Chiefs, 10.39 — Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) September 27, 2017
Jared Goff's consistency and improvement is a huge factor in the Rams ability to give themselves such an advantage on first down this season. His 118.2 passer rating is third best in the league right now, and because Todd Gurley is playing at the highest level of his career, the offense is more diverse than it's been in a long time.
My biggest criticism of our culture – both in and outside of sports – is our tendency to overcompensate for something we didn't like in a previous administration. We, as a society, swing on a pendulum from one side of an issue to the other when, in reality, the solution tends to sit somewhere in the middle.
For many in the Los Angeles Dodgers fan base, this might be the largest criticism of the Andrew Friedman administration.
ICYMI: Greinke, Kendrick Opt for Free Agency
No one would argue Ned Coletti did a good job as general manager. The huge contracts the Dodgers have to shed so as to create financial flexibility can all be traced back to his tenure. Interestingly enough, though, I'd be much more comfortable predicting Zack Greinke would be back with the previous administration.
Mark Saxon of ESPN seems to agree.
The Dodgers are looking to get younger, and another mega-contract makes that more difficult. Also, team president Stan Kasten has a blanket policy against extending pitchers beyond a certain number of major-league pitches and Greinke, who has been durable throughout his career, has thrown more than 33,000. Also, most people assume Greinke wants to come back, but his distaste for a culture that let Yasiel Puig ignore team rules for several seasons is believed to be a factor in his thinking. It will be painful to break up one of the greatest one-two pitching combinations in recent baseball history, butClayton Kershaw probably won't have Greinke as a teammate next season.
Having a “blanket policy” on almost anything seems borderline ridiculous. Allowing that blanket policy to get in the way of bringing back one of the best pitchers the Dodgers history is actually ridiculous.
Running this team like a small market team would be a mistake seeing as, you know, Los Angeles is the second largest (and might pass up New York when it's all said and done) market in the country. If the Dodgers have more resources than everyone else as we keep hearing, this would be one of those times to use them.
To be fair, though, I don't want to overreact to one report as the vast majority of the others still has Greinke returning in 2016. If this is how the Dodgers do feel, though, as Saxon reports earlier in the article, the stance would be disappointing to say the least.
When the firm folded, Ms. Filatova's once-respectable salary for Ukraine of about $750 a month turned to dust. She now earns a paltry $85 a month keeping the books for a public school.
But the new job came with a catch. Ms. Filatova was required to join a separatist youth group, the Young Republic, where she has been expected to volunteer her free time for Communist-themed activities, like marching with flags on holidays.
“It's all very morose,” she said of her experiences over the past two years. “All the young people left. It's mostly older and middle-aged people. Life left this piece of land.”
If history is any guide, this frozen state of affairs in eastern Ukraine could linger for a long time.
The war between the Russian-backed so-called People's Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk and the Ukrainian government broke out in April 2014 and quickly escalated in cruelty and intensity, killing nearly 8,000 people, according to the United Nations. About 1.3 million have been displaced.
The guns went quiet in eastern Ukraine in September, wrapping up with a cease-fire but with no final settlement. This is a common arc of post-Soviet conflict, visible in the Georgian enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in Transnistria, a strip of land on Moldova's border with Ukraine.
In each case, the Kremlin intervened or provided arms on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians or local allies, then it installed pro-Russian governments that it has used to manipulate events in the host countries. The contested borders of frozen zones also effectively guard against any further expansion of NATO, since no country with an unresolved border conflict can join the alliance.

Mamadou Sakho has promised more “beautiful football” as Liverpool prepare for their biggest league match in 24 years.
The Reds face Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday in a game that will have a massive say in where this year's Premier League title goes.
And French defender Sakho said: “Of course this could be the biggest match Liverpool have played in 24 years.
"You win three points but it's worth a lot more. It is a match that will place the winner in the best position to win the title.
“I hope we win. In any case we are ready for combat. We play at home and have our fans behind us. We will give everything.
“Ever since I arrived at the club, I said it. I told my team-mates that we are capable of winning the title.
“We have the quality and we just have to believe it. And – voila! – as the season progressed we saw Liverpool grow in strength playing such beautiful football.
“We've not stolen the position where we are today. We deserve to be where we are. We are confident about facing their strikers. City score a lot of goals but so do we.
“It will be two beautiful attacks against two strong defences. It's a top match pitting two top teams against each other fighting for the title.
“I have not spoken a lot about matches before we play them. We will see on D-day who is better prepared to take the points.”

Sakho, who joined Liverpool from Paris Saint-Germain for £15million last summer, says manager Brendan Rodgers has given the players the belief they are ready for the biggest game of their lives.
Liverpool have not won the title since 1990 but Sakho added: “Rodgers manages to get the maximum out of every player. It's hugely important and not every coach has that charisma.
“He must keep all the players interested and each time he calls up a player they respond with a performance. Like I did at West Ham.
“It's been four months and I haven't played with injury. I had the chance to express myself, and I was there. I felt like a lion before the match. It had been four months and I was hungry to come back strongly.
“The last time Liverpool won the title I was four months old and now I am 24 - I had just been born. Honestly, we will give everything until the last second of the last match.”

In Syria today, the unmitigated violence is what generates attention grabbing headlines and disturbing images seen around the world. Mortar blasts, sniper fire, fighter jet sorties and, maybe even, chemical warfare are only the most spectacular of the threats to civilians throughout the country.
But amid the terror and tragic loss of human life, there is another burgeoning crisis – the total breakdown of the country's medical system. On a recent visit to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, the countries that, together with Iraq, are receiving the refugees of the Syrian civil war, it became clear to me that this crisis is different from most others to which the humanitarian community has responded. Preparations for a less visible crisis need to be taken now, in advance of conflict eventually ending in the region.
It is important to keep the Syrian situation in proper perspective. Until the beginning of the war, Syria had a relatively well-developed economy, a large middle class and a high-level, functioning health care system. But with the kind of tragic irony that only war can produce, these factors have been perverted into one of the biggest humanitarian liabilities facing Syria today.
Like the rest of the developed world, Syria's medical system devoted a large proportion of its resources to treating the high burden of non-communicable diseases, "diseases of the rich," from which large swaths of its population suffer. What clearly distinguishes the Syrian refugee crisis from most others, from the health perspective, is that it is characterized not by malnourished babies, not by children suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases and not by diseases caused by poor hygiene and sanitation, but rather by patients requiring treatment for diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, cancer and other chronic conditions.
According to the U.N., one-third of Syrian hospitals have been shuttered since the conflict began and a staggering two-thirds of medical personnel have either fled or been unable to continue working. The repercussions of this breakdown on the health of the population are impossible to overestimate, and cannot be dealt with effectively until safe access for medical and public health personnel can be assured.
During my recent visit, I observed the the thousands of people with chronic conditions stranded in the region's refugee camps. Unlike children with acute illnesses that can be treated relatively easily and inexpensively in the short term, these patients need on-going care with relatively expensive medicines or procedures. Because treatment in Syria may have been different from what is customarily done in their new host countries and because the cost of that treatment may be too much for those countries to absorb, given the large number of refugees, those who manage to survive the physical violence of the war will find themselves facing the irreversible advance of chronic illnesses without adequate medical care.
The humanitarian community has encountered similar catastrophes in the past. During the Balkan and Kosovo wars of the 1990s, the situation was the same. But, as is so often the case, problems were identified, but lessons were not learned, and the world remained unprepared for another humanitarian health crisis in a middle-class country.
What needs to be done? Decisions need to be made by host country authorities and the international community as to how to guarantee continuity of care for Syrian refugees currently suffering from chronic conditions. Decisions need to be made as to how to ensure that new cases of chronic diseases will be properly diagnosed in a timely manner and that treatment, once initiated, can be continued for a lifetime. U.N. agencies, especially the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organization, must develop and implement policies and protocols that provide medical coverage for those in Syria and in other countries at risk of suffering the same fate if their health care systems should be destroyed.
One day, the war in Syria will end. The question at that point will be what kind of society, what kind of life, will the people of Syria have? What kind of health care system will be rebuilt? Careful planning, ideally undertaken by health care professionals working on both sides of the current conflict, will be required.
That planning needs to start now. If it does not, the carnage that we are currently witnessing could, unfortunately, be only the tip of the iceberg – shorter life and high mortality could be prominent features of Syrian society for many years to come and may, in the long run, be as far-reaching and devastating as the war itself.

Washington held its annual Pro Day this morning. And to be frank, it was probably as quiet and uneventful as any in recent memory.
There was no Jake Locker and accompanying ESPN cameras, and only one player sure to get drafted in Desmond Trufant, who did little since he had already been timed and tested often at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine.
Trufant took part in a couple of drills but did not run the 40 or lift. He also was not available to the media as he was whisked away to a meeting (apparently for lunch and apparently with the Jacksonville Jaguars).
Only six other Huskies took part — Jonathan Amosa, Justin Glenn, Anthony Gobern, Drew Schaefer, Semisi Tokolahi and Devin Aguilar, who graduated a year ago and is currently a free agent.
Here are the official heights and weights for each:
Aguilar, 5-11.6, 201;
Amosa, 5-11.3, 247;
Glenn, 5-10.1, 210
Schaefer, 6-4.3, 302;
Tokolahi, 6-2.4, 341;
Trufant, 5-11.5, 192.
Here are the reps on the 225-pound bench press:
Amosa 34;
Glenn 23;
Gobern 27;
Schaefer 19;
Tokolahi 26.
Glenn went 34 inches in the standing jump, Gobern 34.5 and Aguilar 33.
We did not get reliable 40 times.
I'll have some video interviews of a few of the participants to pass along later.
For now, here are a few scenes of what it looked like:
First, some of the DBs, including Trufant, going through a drill:

Implementing mobile solutions that target the needs of your field workforce, that leverage your investment in the ArcGIS platform, and are available on the most modern and cost effective device platforms is critical when defining your mobile strategy.
Location is important and depending upon what you are mapping, locational accuracy can make or break a GIS. When considering the use of smartphone and tablet platforms one of the first questions you may ask is – how accurate is the GPS?? The answer to this question will shape the decision you make on device platforms. Or will it??
Cellular-enabled smartphones and tablets include an integrated GPS chip-set manufactured by companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, CSR and others. These chip-sets are designed first for power consumption, second for time to fix and third for locational accuracy. What we found in our testing is that locational accuracy is pretty much the same regardless of manufacturer. In the open sky, mapping with several devices approximately 90% of all positions collected fell within 3m of our baseline. These results were not too shabby really! In canopy conditions where we encountered significant multi-path interference from the receiver, results were considerably worse.
Most of the chip-sets support GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) which means they support both the United States NAVSTAR GPS satellites and the Russian GLONASS satellites. That means you have a better constellation of satellites to draw from when you are in the field.
Next we connected our smartphones to external GPS receivers that were considered “consumer grade”. These chip-sets are designed first for locational accuracy, second for time to fix, and third for power consumption. Here we found that you can purchase a variety of receivers that connect either directly to the device or via Bluetooth and most with SBAS capabilities! In the open sky, virtually all positions captured (99%) were within 3m and almost 70% were within 1m of our baseline! As expected, positions degraded in canopy conditions but overall were much better!
Finally we connected an iPhone 4s to a high-accuracy, dual-frequency, survey-grade receiver from Altus Positioning Systems using a commercial product called GPS Cable from Aman Enterprises Inc. The GPS Cable will create an external connection to virtually any external GPS receiver using RS-232 and stream NMEA to the location manager on your smartphone. This replaces the location source in the same fashion as the external “consumer grade” GPS device does. Not to embarrass the other receivers we tested, and to ensure that we were only using the receiver itself and not supplementing our source using NTRIP (which we could have done), we chose to only map using SBAS and not fully leverage the true capabilities of the receiver. Even so we found that virtually all positions (over 92%) were within 1m!!
A couple of additional points worth mentioning – PPP (Precise Point Positioning) is becoming a reality and with it you can achieve centimeter level positioning directly from a satellite lock! This is a great solution for mapping efforts that require high accuracy, do not want to post-process positions, and do not have access to RTK networks.
So before you consider spending a fortune on mobile devices from hardware vendors that promise sub-meter accuracy with a complicated field to office workflow, consider your field needs and the possibilities of using a smartphone instead! Couple your hardware decisions with the Collector for ArcGIS app and implement a great low cost field data collection solution for your field staff that have not been trained in the underpinnings of high accuracy GPS positioning and want to collect data on a modern device!
To look at some of our tests, check out this web map. Let us know what you think and what you would like to see regarding device testing from Esri.

The Flash honored its hero's live-action legacy by casting 1990s Flash star John Wesley Shipp as the father of Grant Gustin's modern Flash, and Supergirl—which also comes from Flash executive producer Greg Berlanti and will join the speedster on The CW next season—features 1980s Supergirl Helen Slater and Lois And Clark's Superman Dean Cain as the adoptive parents of current Supergirl Melissa Benoist. Now, Deadline is reporting that Supergirl will continue running (flying?) with this trend by casting former Wonder Woman star Lynda Carter as the President Of The United States.
Carter's casting has apparently been in the works for a long time, and though we don't know how big her role will be in Supergirl's second season, it does open the door for more fun with multiple universes. After all, The Flash introduced the concept of alternate realities (“Infinite Earths,” if you will) in its last season—which is how it justified the Supergirl crossover episode—and its recent season finale revealed that Shipp's character was an alternate version of a different reality's Flash, so President Lynda Carter could easily be a different reality's Wonder Woman. Unless, she's also really the Wonder Woman of the Supergirl universe, which is exactly the sort of fan-service treat that Berlanti's shows have occasionally been known to pull off. (We're assuming that the laws are different on Supergirl's Earth, of course, otherwise a Themysciran like her wouldn't be eligible for the presidency.)
Public opinion of Congress is already on the rocks, but if its designated debt "super committee" cannot devise a bipartisan deficit-reduction plan in the 10 days remaining until its deadline, congressional standing is likely to drop further – and barometers of economic confidence could slide right along with it, a new poll warns.
A Gallup poll released Monday afternoon shows congressional approval ratings at a record-low 13 percent. Failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to meet its mandate – to craft a plan by Nov. 23 to reduce the US deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years – could drive that approval rating even lower, says Frank Newport, Gallup's editor-in-chief.
“This deficit reduction deal has symbolic importance above and beyond trimming $1.2 trillion,” he says. “It's symbolic of how well Congress can get its act together in the eyes of the public. Failure would hurt not only the image of Congress, if it could go any lower, but also hurt consumer confidence, which would in turn have an impact on the economy.”
Already, at least 2 in 3 Americans say they expect the 12-member debt panel to fail to strike a deal, according to a separate poll released Monday, from Politico/George Washington University. Just 21 percent said the panel would succeed.
The 12-member panel has already missed its own soft deadline to get a deficit-reduction package to the Congressional Budget Office at least two weeks before Nov. 23 – the time frame that CBO director Douglas Elmendorf told the panel is needed to assess the fiscal impact of the plan.
Whether public opinion is acting as a spur for the debt panel to come up with something is hard to tell. Lawmakers from each party are busy calculating whether their ranks will take it on the chin in next November's elections if congressional wrestling over debt and deficit ends – again – in gridlock.
But another prime example of deadlock certainly won't help – either Congress's image or the economy. As Congress took its pitched battle over raising the national debt limit right up to the point of default on Aug. 2, consumer confidence plunged 20 points in July and August.
“If the debt committee doesn't succeed, it can be negative for many aspects of society, including consumer confidence,” says Gallup's Mr. Newport.
The tanking approval ratings are shared evenly across the political spectrum. Whether survey respondents are Republicans, Democrats, or independents, Congress's approval rating falls between a paltry 11 and 15 percent, according to the Gallup poll. Other polls show low public confidence in the honesty and ethics of members of Congress and low satisfaction with the way the nation is being governed.
In July, Congress's debt-limit negotiations were summarized by nearly 3 in 4 respondents – from liberal Democrats to tea party Republicans – in words such as ridiculous, disgusting, stupid, frustrating, childish, and a joke, according to a survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
Last week, Sen. Charles Schumer (D) of New York, who is not a member of the super committee, predicted that the panel would fail, because Republican will refuse to consider tax increases.
Since then, Sen. Pat Toomey (R) of Pennsylvania, a debt committee member, proposed a plan that includes at least $250 billion in tax hikes, to help close on a deal.
“If I were king, this is not the plan I would put on the table,” he told "Fox News Sunday." “But if we both went into our respective corners and had no flexibility at all, then we wouldn't get anything accomplished.”
Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R) of Texas, cochairman of the super committee, told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that he could support a two-step process favored by Democrats that specifies by Nov. 23 spending cuts and some tax hikes, but that mandates the tax-writing committees of the House and Senate to find others by a fixed date.
“We haven't given up hope, but if this was easy the president and the speaker of the House would have gotten this done themselves,” he said.
In a press briefing Monday, House majority leader Eric Cantor (R) of Virginia declined to take a position on the Toomey offer. “I know how difficult it is and how much pressure they are under,” he said. “We have got to let them do their work. I'm hopeful that there will be a good result come the Nov. 23 deadline.”

In the history of great fights, the names of a few truly stand out.
Muhammad Ali vs Joe Frazier. Evander Holyfield vs Mike Tyson. Sugar Ray Leonard vs Tommy Hearns.
And now entering the ring: Matthew Perry vs Justin Trudeau.
The Friends star and the Canadian prime minister have suggested they might soon be exchanging blows after Mr Trudeau challenged the actor to a rematch to a fight that took place in a school playground more than 35 years ago.
Image copyright Twitter
The tweet - which the politician wrote on 1 April, his tongue firmly in his cheek - came after Perry admitted he once "beat up" Mr Trudeau.
Perry told American talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that the pair were at primary school together in Ottawa when he and a friend decided to beat the younger boy up - motivated, he thinks, by jealousy.
But there may have been another reason.
"I think he was the only kid in school that we could beat up," he conceded.
Things have changed somewhat in the intervening years. Perry has become one of most famous actors in the world, thanks to his success as Chandler Bing on Friends.
Mr Trudeau, who counts boxing among his hobbies, has followed in his father's footsteps to become prime minister of Canada.
And that has made Perry think twice about Mr Trudeau's invitation.
Hans Zimmer is as prolific as he is innovative. The 59-year-old German composer began his career playing in bands, transitioned to advertising jingles, and moved on to movies in the late ‘80s. A lucky break led to work on Rain Man, and since writing the score for Barry Levinson's Oscar-winning drama, Zimmer has written music for over 150 films in just under 30 years.
Zimmer's accomplishments — which include an Academy Award for his score on The Lion King — are even more impressive when you consider that he received all of two weeks of formal musical training. And to this day, even after scoring huge hits like the Dark Knight trilogy, 12 Years a Slave and Gladiator, Zimmer likes to joke about his unconventional arrival in the industry.
“Backdraft was the first movie where somebody let me loose with a huge orchestra, and I didn't really know what to do with them,” Zimmer admitted in an interview with Inverse this week. “I had overheard the producer say that the composer on Ron Howard's previous movie had used 101 people on the orchestra, so I booked 101 players, because I thought that's what you should do.”
The composer definitely figured out what to do with all those musicians in the subsequent two decades, and he's now offering up his expertise to aspiring musicians in a new MasterClass, available online now. Zimmer spoke with Inverse about becoming a teacher, his embrace of technology, and why he retired from superhero movies.
How did the way you learned influence the way you teach people through MasterClass?
One of the things that seems to get lost a lot in teaching music is when you have a band in a room and we start playing together, the main thing is we're listening to each other. Because that's the only way we can go and make the other person sound great. You figure out how to support them. And you really quickly figure out how, when somebody plays a C, you just know it's a C. You don't have to have perfect pitch, you train yourself to have relative pitch. You know what sounds good and what doesn't sound good.
The other side of this was, when I was growing up, it was just the time when technology started to come around. Friends of mine were playing with their little processors, and I thought, this is really interesting, I could go and pervert this new technology to become a musical instrument. So I got into electronic music and all that stuff. People forget that every musical instrument is a piece of technology of its time. Violin is about as cool a piece of technology from the 16th century as you can get. And when you get to the church organ — this is the stuff I learned on Interstellar — the church organ is the most complicated piece of technology of its day. And it didn't actually get beaten as far as technological complexity goes until the telephone exchange. By the 17th century, we already had these amazing pieces of technology at the service of art and music.
Then something happened where people were going, “Oh, synthesizers are not instruments. Electronics aren't music.” And now everybody's working on their laptop and making music on their laptop. I'm not saying I was ahead of the curve because I was smart, I was ahead of the curve just because I didn't want to go and have piano lessons.
You said last year that you were retiring from scoring superhero movies. How's that going, and why did you decide to do it?
Well the retirement is going pretty well because I'm not doing a superhero movie; I'm working on something completely different with Chris Nolan. I'm also going on tour because all my musician friends said to me, “Time to stop hiding behind the screen. Time to actually look the audience in the eye. Time to do things in real time.”
I keep thinking about new styles of music and new ways of using technology, new ways of figuring out how to make everything that we do an experience for other people. And I just couldn't do it anymore with the superhero movies, it's as simple as that. If you take the three Chris Nolan Batmans, that's three movies to you, but to you and Chris, it was 12 years of our lives. So sometimes you just have to say, “I don't know where I'm heading, but I'm going to jump off this cliff.” As soon as I said it, there were a lot of phone calls coming my way going, “Are you crazy?” But I've never written music for money; money isn't inspiring. And I didn't want to get into it where it became a job.
Ron Howard actually said something very smart to me. He said, “Don't say you will never do a superhero movie again. Wait for somebody to turn up with an amazing script for a superhero movie.” And I suppose that's what I'm saying: Can I please have the amazing script?
It just did my brain in to have written Christian Bale as Batman, and suddenly it's Ben Affleck [in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]. And it felt like I was betraying everything Christian had done. So there's a certain amount of loyalty attached to those movies, as well.
It's interesting that the actor changes the way you do the music when it's the same character but a different person under the cape and cowl.
I spent months trying to come up with something for Ben. The Batman that I know and the one I learned is the one that Christian did, and Ben plays it differently. And I can't quite shake that off. For me, the Christian Bale character was always completely unresolved. It was always about that moment at the beginning of the first movie, where he sees his parents getting killed. It was basically arrested development. The Ben character is more middle-aged; he seems to be grumpy as hell, but I didn't feel the pain that I felt in Christian's performance. And it was that pain that made me interested.
So you handed Batman off to Junkie XL?
Well … nearly. We did it together. Well, you know, honestly, thinking about it, we really did do it together. And it was great having a partner in crime on this thing. And you can't have a better partner than Junkie. The guy is on fire constantly. He's one of the most creative people I know, and plus, he's as geeky as me.
What do you think the next big trend in movie composing will be?
I think the next big trend — and it really is happening already — is just people writing far more individualistic scores and breaking new ground constantly. If you listen to people like Johan Johansson, the borders between film music and popular music and classical music, all those walls are just coming down. And the walls between technology and people who went to music academy as opposed to people who are just incredibly passionate about music, all those walls are coming down. Look at what Johnny Greenwood is scoring. He's in Radiohead, but he's one of the greatest film composers out there. He's a composer-in-residence at the BBC. There's a guy who is comfortable in all fields.
Are filmmakers getting more comfortable letting composers experiment?
I think the good filmmakers always did. There's that famous story of Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann in Psycho. He only gave him one rule: The shower scene must have no music, otherwise you can do what you want. So, of course, the first thing Herman did was written an amazing thing for the shower scene. Music is inherently indefensible. If I play you a piece of music, and you don't like it, I can't explain to you why you should like it; it makes no sense. Herrmann took a risk with a very volatile director, writing that piece, and obviously, Hitchcock saw it and it was brilliant and he went “absolutely.” I think it's always been a composer's job to — in a funny way — not do what the director tells you to do because you're supposed to listen to the subtext. People used to have the saying that we are supposed to serve the film, and I've used that myself, I said that many times. But really, the job is to go and enhance the film and bring something new to the table.
Looking back on your work, are there any scores or cues you would like to do over?
No, because otherwise you don't move forward. I don't watch them because I know that this is exactly what would happen. I'll give you an example of something I'd love to do over: As Good As It Gets, the Jim Brooks movie. When we previewed it, there wasn't music over the first scene, so people didn't know it was a comedy. And Jack's outrageous performance, like putting the dog down the garbage chute, all that stuff, you could just hear a collective jaw drop from the audience because they didn't know if it was funny or just the most brutal thing they'd ever seen. And I put a little bit of music at the beginning, just to let them know it was a comedy, and I wish I hadn't. It was great when it was unmitigatingly tough.

Since its introduction in 1968, electron tomography has been primarily used to determine the 3D structure of biological samples7,9. In the past decade, electron tomography has been increasingly applied in materials science and nanoscience through the use of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)8,10,11. The highest resolution at present achieved by STEM tomography is around 1 nm in three dimensions10,11, although slightly higher resolution has been obtained in a study of fullerene-like nanostructures with bright-field electron tomography21. A general electron tomography method with atomic-scale resolution, however, has not been demonstrated for several reasons. First, aligning the projections of a tomographic tilt series to a common axis with atomic level precision is technically challenging. Second, radiation damage limits the number of projections that can be acquired from a single object13,22. Last, specimens cannot usually be tilted beyond ±79°, preventing acquisition of data from the ‘missing wedge'7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome or alleviated by applying a novel alignment approach and an iterative tomographic reconstruction method to a tilt series obtained via annular dark field (ADF)-STEM23,24.
The conventional alignment approach used in electron tomography either relies on fiducial markers such as colloidal gold beads or is based on the cross-correlation between neighbouring projections7,9. To our knowledge, neither of these alignment approaches can achieve atomic-level precision. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a method based on the centre of mass, which is able to align the projections of a tilt series at atomic-level accuracy even with noise (Methods). To address the other two difficulties mentioned above, we have implemented a data acquisition and tomographic reconstruction method, termed equally sloped tomography16,18,19,20,25 (EST). Compared to conventional tomography, which reconstructs a 3D object from a tilt series of projections with constant angular increments, EST acquires a tilt series with equal slope increments, and then iterates back and forth between real and reciprocal space (Methods). In each iteration, constraints such as the sample boundary (that is, the support) and positivity of the Coulomb potential are applied in real space, while the measured projectional slices (that is, the Fourier transform of the projections) are enforced in reciprocal space. Each iteration is monitored by an error metric, and the algorithm is terminated after reaching a maximum number of iterations.
To test the feasibility of achieving a high-resolution tomographic reconstruction by the centre-of-mass and EST methods, we conducted numerical simulations on an ∼5-nm gold nanoparticle with icosahedral symmetry and a total of 3,871 atoms (Supplementary Figs 3a, 4a, c, e). A tilt series of 55 projections was obtained from the particle using multislice STEM calculations26 (energy, 300 keV; spherical aberration, 1.2 mm; illumination semi-angle, 7.98 mrad; defocus, 48.6 nm; detector inner and outer angles, 13 and 78 mrad). To minimize nonlinear intensity contributions caused by dynamical scattering and electron channelling27, projections along zone axis orientations were avoided. The tilt angles range from −72.6° to +72.6° with equal slope increments. To more closely approximate realistic experimental conditions, several additional modifications were made to generate the simulated data. First, the tilt angles were continuously shifted from 0° to 0.5° over the process of the tilt series and the magnification of the images was continuously changed from 0 to 0.2%. Second, each projection in the tilt series was arbitrarily shifted along the x and y axes, where the electron beam direction is parallel to the z axis. Last, Poisson noise was added to the projections of the tilt series with a total electron dose of 6.1 × 106 e Å−2. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a linear projection of the model at 0° and the corresponding multislice STEM projection. The apparent increase of the atom size in the multislice projection was mainly caused by the nonlinear and diffraction effects in the nanoparticle.
The 55 projections were aligned to a common tilt axis with the centre-of-mass method, and were then reconstructed with the EST algorithm. Supplementary Fig. 4b, d, f shows three 2.5-Å-thick central slices of the 3D reconstruction in the x–y, z–x and z–y planes. Although the missing wedge problem is not completely solved (the top and bottom parts in Supplementary Fig. 4f) and the size of the reconstructed atoms is increased mainly due to the nonlinear and diffraction effects, the atomic positions and grain boundaries in the 3D reconstruction are consistent with the model. The simulation results indicate that the centre-of-mass and EST methods can be used to achieve an atomic-scale resolution reconstruction from a tilt series of 55 projections with a missing wedge, nonlinear effects, Poisson noise and experimental errors.
Next, the centre-of-mass and EST methods were applied to experimental tilt series acquired from gold nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are an important class of materials with properties different from either molecules or bulk solids13,14,15, and nano-gold is among the most widely studied of this class of material owing to its broad applications in chemistry, biology, materials science, nanoscience and nanotechnology28. In this study, we imaged gold particles with a diameter of ∼10 nm because smaller particles are not as stable under an electron beam13,22. To reduce the electron dose, we used a low-exposure data acquisition scheme with a 300-keV ADF-STEM (Methods). When focusing an image, a nearby nanoparticle was first viewed (not the particle of interest), thus reducing the unnecessary radiation dose to the particle under study. Using this scheme, we acquired several tomographic tilt series of gold nanoparticles. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows a tilt series of 69 projections and their Fourier transforms, with a total electron dose of ∼7.6 × 106 e Å−2. Supplementary Fig. 6 shows three 0° projections and their Fourier transforms measured during the acquisition of this tilt series to monitor the effects of radiation damage. Although some minor shape changes occurred, the crystal lattice structure of the particle remained consistent throughout the experiment.
To investigate the nonlinear effects in the experiment, we simulated an ∼10-nm gold particle with icosahedral symmetry and performed multislice STEM calculations on an 11.5-Å-thick slab of this particle26 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although the atom size was increased, mainly owing to the nonlinear diffraction and dynamical scattering effects, the multislice STEM projection exhibits a crystal lattice structure consistent with the model. We then calculated a tilt series for a 2.5-Å central slice using the multislice simulations. The tilt series consists of 69 projections with a tilt range of ±72.6°. Supplementary Fig. 8 shows the model and reconstructed slices. The atomic positions and the internal grain boundaries are resolved, except in a very few places owing to the nonlinear effects in the projections.
After investigating the nonlinear effects, we performed post data analysis of the experimental tilt series (Methods), and aligned the projections with the centre-of-mass method. To reconstruct the 3D structure, we first estimated a loose 3D support, defined to be larger than the particle boundary. After 500 iterations of the EST algorithm, the reconstruction was used to determine a tight support (that is, close to the true boundary of the particle). Using the tight support, we ran another 500 iterations and obtained a final 3D structure. To examine the quality of the reconstruction, we calculated 69 projections from the final 3D structure and found the average normalized discrepancy with the measured projections to be 6.7% (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Representative measured and calculated projections at different particle orientations are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 9. Although there are some minor differences between the two projections, the overall shape and lattice structure agree well. To more rigorously examine the accuracy of the reconstruction, an EST reconstruction was performed from 68 experimental projections by removing the 7.1° projection. The 3D reconstruction was then projected back to calculate the projection at 7.1°, which is consistent with the experimentally measured one (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Insets in a and c show the projected atomic positions inside the blue square in the main panel. The overall shape of the nanoparticle and the location of the Bragg peaks agree well, indicating a good quality 3D reconstruction. This gold nanoparticle is the same as studied in Figs 2–4.

To estimate the resolution achieved in the reconstruction, we chose a 3.36-Å-thick central slice in the x–y plane. Figure 2a, b shows the slice and its Fourier transform, in which the distance between two neighbouring atom columns and the location of the Bragg peaks indicate that a resolution of 2.4 Å was achieved in the x and y directions. To estimate the resolution along the z axis (beam direction), we selected a 3.36-Å-thick slice with the horizontal axis along the z axis (Fig. 2c, d). The resolution close to the z axis was determined to be 2.4 Å. Individual atoms are visible in some regions of the slices, but not all atoms can be identified in the slices. Supplementary Fig. 11 shows two 3.36-Å-thick slices of the nanoparticle in a different orientation, exhibiting crystal lattice structure that is not present in Fig. 2a and c. The apparent flattening of the particle along the beam axis was also observed in the 3D reconstructions (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Movie 1), and was probably caused by the interaction between the nanoparticle and the Si substrate.

The resolution in the z axis was estimated to be 2.4 Å. Individual atoms are visible in some regions of the slices, but not all atoms can be identified in the slices.

To visualize the internal structure and the morphology of the gold nanoparticle, we generated 3D volume and iso-surface renderings of the reconstruction, in which both surface and internal lattice structures are visible (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Figure 3a, b shows volume renderings of the nanoparticle and their Fourier transforms (insets) at the two- and three-fold symmetry orientations. The corresponding iso-surface renderings at the same orientations are shown in Fig. 3c and d. The overall 3D shape and facets of the nanoparticle are consistent with an icosahedron (insets in Fig. 3c and d). To identify internal 3D grains, we applied the 3D Fourier transform to the reconstruction. By identifying the Bragg peaks of each major grain and applying the 3D inverse Fourier transform to the selected Bragg peaks, we determined four major 3D grains inside the gold nanoparticle (Methods). Figure 4 and Supplementary Movie 3 show a volume rendering of the four grains in three dimensions, in which grains 1, 2 and grains 3, 4 are related by mirror-reflection across the horizontal interfaces marked by dotted lines. The angle enclosed by close-packed planes across these interfaces was measured to be 69.9° ± 0.8° between grains 1 and 2, and 71.3° ± 0.8° between grains 3 and 4, both of which are consistent with the angle for a face-centred-cubic twin boundary (70.53°). By applying the same method to some other Bragg peaks, we identified 3D grains in the top and bottom parts of the particle (Supplementary Fig. 12). The surface morphology and the internal lattice structures suggest that this is a distorted icosahedral multiply twinned particle, typically found for nano-gold in the size range above 10 nm (ref. 29).

By combining the centre-of-mass alignment technique and the EST reconstruction method with an ADF-STEM, we have determined the 3D structure of a ∼10-nm gold nanoparticle at 2.4 Å resolution from a tilt series of 69 projections with a missing wedge. Several grains are identified inside the nanoparticle in three dimensions. Although individual atoms are visible in some regions of the nanoparticle, we cannot definitively locate all of the atoms inside the particle. In order to identify all the atoms in the particle (estimated to be ∼23,800) without using atomicity and bond information, a resolution higher than 2.4 Å is needed, which requires future developments. With aberration-corrected STEM4,23,24, better 3D resolution and image quality should be achievable, but extended depth-of-field techniques may have to be applied to the tilt series before the EST reconstruction can be performed. Compared to atom-probe tomography30, this non-destructive technique can not only handle isolated nanoparticles, but also provide the 3D local structure of complex nanomaterials at high resolution.
Commission withdraws DG Enlargement promo video Decision follows complaints of racist content.
The European Commission has taken down a video clip promoting its enlargement policy following complaints that the clip was racist.
The clip, which was uploaded on YouTube last week, shows a European woman wearing a yellow tracksuit looking like she is about to be attacked by three martial arts experts from China, India and Brazil.
The woman surrounds herself with eleven doubles to form an image to suggest the stars on the European Union flag. The three would-be assailants then drop their aggressive stances, suggesting that they are all to sit down together for a peaceful discussion.
Stefano Sannino, the director-general of the Commission's enlargement department, which commissioned and published the clip, issued a statement today saying: “We have received a lot of feedback on our latest video clip, including from people concerned about the message it was sending.”
Martial arts plot
The statement says that the clip was meant to target “through social networks and new media, a young audience (16-24) who understand the plots and themes of martial arts films and video games”. Reactions of these target audiences to the clip were positive, according to the statement.
“The clip was absolutely not intended to be racist and we obviously regret that it has been perceived in this way. We apologise to anyone who may have felt offended. Given these controversies, we have decided to stop the campaign immediately and to withdraw the video.”
The statement said that the clip featured “typical characters for the martial arts genre” including practitioners of the Chinese martial art kung fu, capoeira from Brazil, and kalaripyattu from India.
Saninno said that the clip “started with demonstration of their skills and ended with all characters showing their mutual respect, concluding in a position of peace and harmony”. He said the genre had been chosen to “attract young people and to raise their curiosity on an important EU policy”.
While the video has been removed from the Commission's YouTube channel, a copy can still be watched here.

Steve Jobs. Bill Gates. Mark Zuckerberg. Richard Branson. What do they all have in common, aside from wealth?
They all succeeded without the right kind of prior experience. Apparently they knew how to figure out what they needed once they started. I'll bet they are all systems-thinkers, not goal-thinkers.
If you see the world in terms of goals, you might think President Trump has failed at every important goal so far. He didn't get what he wanted on immigration. He hasn't gotten his Supreme Court nomination confirmed. He hasn't replaced Obamacare. He hasn't defeated ISIS. He hasn't done a lot of things he said he would do. He even had to fire General Flynn. President Trump is a big ol' failure when it comes to goals.
Maybe that's because Trump just started on the job. Success generally comes after you start. If you think success comes before you start, the world probably looks confusing to you.
But in any case, as I often say, goals are for losers. Systems are better. As I describe in my book, a good system is something you do every day that leads you to better outcomes, not specific objectives. For example, going to college is a good system even if you don't know what job you might later want. Any time you learn something valuable, that's a system. Networking with important people is a system. And so on.
Trump seems to be a systems thinker. I doubt he knew he would jump from real estate developer, to author, to reality TV star, to president. At least not in that order. Instead, he systematically accumulated money, persuasion skills, and personal connections until he had lots of options. Being president was one of them.
Now the world watches as an entrepreneurial systems-thinker with no government experience takes over the White House and tries to learn on the job. How did you expect that to go?
I expected some broken dishes, some firings, some chaos, and some rookie mistakes. We got all of that. But I also expect a systems-thinker to tame the chaos over time as he learns on the job. For example, the leaks will stop as soon as Trump fires the right people. He'll figure out which meetings he can skip. He'll know who to trust. He'll learn where all the buttons and levers are. It's a process.
If you are comparing the incoming Trump administration to the smooth transfer of power that defines our modern history, that's an irrational comparison. If the country wanted a smooth ride it would have elected Hillary Clinton. Instead, voters opted to “drain the swamp.“ And you can't drain the swamp without angering the alligators and getting some swamp water on your pants. That's what we're watching now.
My liberal friends are gleefully scouring the semi-fake news and sending me articles that show Trump is “incompetent.” That's the new narrative on the left. The Hitler illusion is starting to fade because Trump refuses to build concentration camps as his critics hallucinated he would. And Israel likes Trump, which is making the Hitler illusion harder to maintain. So the critics are evolving their main line of attack from Hitler to “incompetent,” with a dash of “chaos.” You'll see those two word all over the Opposition Media's coverage. It isn't a coincidence.
Persuasion-wise, focusing on incompetence and chaos is a strong play by the anti-Trumpers. One would expect the new Trump administration to have lots of growing pains. That means the Opposition Media will have plenty of fodder that they can frame as incompetence and chaos. Confirmation bias will make it all seem to fit the narrative. This is the same persuasion play that Trump used when he assigned to his opponents nicknames such as Lyin' Ted and Crooked Hillary. He depended on future news cycles to serve up lots of confirmation bias to make his labels more credible over time. Trump's opposition is running the same persuasion play on him. Now everything he does will be seen through their frame of “incompetence” and “chaos.” Even if it isn't. That is strong persuasion.
If you step out of the Opposition Media's framing of Trump, another frame that fits the data is that he's learning on the job, just like he learned every other field that he entered and eventually mastered. I don't know what you expected when Trump went to Washington, but it isn't too different from what I imagined. I assumed there would be broken dishes. And I assumed it would take him months to get his systems in place.
When I worked in corporate America, I was usually involved in setting goals for the department. When we didn't meet those goals, I always pointed out that the problem could be on either end. Either the goals were unrealistic or the performance was bad. Both explanations fit the data. Likewise, Trump's first few weeks do look exactly like “incompetence” and “chaos” if you are primed to see it that way. But they also look like a systems-thinker simultaneously draining the swamp and learning on the job.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
The National Football League has been in the new recently for how it handled allegations that Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson abused his young son.
Now, one of the league's best players, Jason Witten, has come forward to talk with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap about what it was like to grow up in an abusive household and how he has been able to overcome it and thrive while helping others with his SCORE Foundation.
"It was tough," Witten said in the piece. "It was like a nightmare. But some of the greatest qualities that I have as an individual are things that I learned through those experiences."
The star tight end was abused by his father.
"You just didn't know which man was going to come home," the athlete said. "More time than not it was going to be the dad you loved, but on some situations it was someone you wished would never come back."
The athletes father, he said, had an alcohol and drug problem. "Sometimes it got a little physical," he said. "I saw him abuse my mom."
While Witten himself was not abused, he saw what was happening to his mother and his siblings. His mother said that she and her two older children (Jason is the youngest) were physically abused.
In 1993, when Jason was 11, his mother fled 400 miles away to her parents' home. Once that happened Witten's grandfather entered the picture and became a male role model, plus his football coach.
Witten, who is now a father to three children, is considered a very tough player, something which an array of former and his current coach talked about.
The tight end said that his experiences growing up in an abusive home is what made him tough and has shaped how he plays.
Now, he's something different for his children than his father was to him. He's an involved, caring dad, who spends endless hours playing with his children despite his busy schedule as an NFL player.
"He's the best," said his wife Michelle Witten of Jason as a father. "He's just their hero."
Witten scores off the field
The player's SCORE foundation has launched numerous outreach programs and funded several new building projects in Texas and his native Tennessee.
Five years ago, the foundation launched the Jason Witten SCOREkeepers program, an initiative which places full-time, trained male mentors in battered women's shelters throughout Texas.
The mentors seek to demonstrate positive male behavior to the children living in these shelters in an effort to break the cycle of violence that plagues families affected by abuse.
In 2010, the foundation launched a domestic violence prevention program called "Coaching Boys Into Men" in high schools across Arlington, Texas. The program trains coaches to educate their players on the dangers of dating violence.
In addition to his work in the battle against domestic violence, Witten also built a Jason Witten Learning Center, complete with a state-of-the-art recording studio, at the East Dallas Boys & Girls Club center in March 2008.
A month later, he dedicated another one at the Boys & Girls Club in his hometown of Elizabethton, Tenn.
Then, he dedicated a third such center at the Halls/Powell Boys & Girls Club in Knoxville, Tenn., where he played college football at the University of Tennessee.

District 5 candidate Kimberly Kaplan held her official campaign launch party at a pizza shop in her neighborhood of Squirrel Hill.

District 5 residents and university students attended city council candidate Kimberly Kaplan's campaign kick-off in Squirrel Hill. Sarah Pesi at middle.
Pittsburgh City Council District 5 candidate Kimberly Kaplan talked politics over pizza at her official campaign launch this past weekend.The event drew a small crowd to Pastoli's restaurant in Squirrel Hill, formerly Mandy's Pizza. Though she's drawn recent criticism, her campaign will continue."I've always liked the challenger," said Matthew Hughes, 44, Greenfield. "Everybody loves a good story, and she's the underdog."Friday, the endorsed District 5 incumbent Corey O'Connor, calling Kaplan's platform vague and citing O'Connor's experience. In an early-April article on Kaplan's campaign, thecited O'Connor's work on land-bank legislation, the HIV/AIDS commission and the redevelopment at the Almono site in Hazelwood."I think we've proven we can get things done," O'Connor said in the article.However, Kaplan called the endorsement "weak.""It was frustrating to me," Kaplan says. "They said he inherited good politics and that it is basically lucky that good things are happening in his district. I wish they'd been more specific about my policies and where we differed [in the endorsement]."Kaplan says she has been specific about her ideas, particularly about how to "streamline" the city's budget and get out from under Act 47.Despite the criticism, Kaplan and her new campaign manager, Michael Thompson, are planning more events and canvassing. Thompson met Kaplan when she knocked on his door while campaigning."It's a very young, very enthusiastic campaign. I'm the oldest person here at 32," Thompson, who is also a Lyft driver, says. "There's a lot of idealism, but it's pragmatic idealism."Over free pizza, Kaplan explained to those who attended that she's learned the diverse priorities of District 5 residents while door-knocking — that residents in Squirrel Hill express concerns for safe traffic patterns while residents in other District 5 neighborhoods want more public safety and jobs."I'm a social-services minor, and I'm really concerned about social issues," said Sarah Pesi, who's studying public policy at Chatham University. She said she attended to learn more about Kaplan's policy ideas."There are big differences between the neighborhoods in [the] district."Kaplan, a Chatham graduate, told last month that if elected, she would focus on food and housing security as well as employment issues in the "underserved neighborhoods" in District 5, including Hazelwood, Glen Hazel and Hays. She also spoke about plans for better police-resident relationships, education and transportation.On transportation, "My big issue is they [the city] are going to blow up the bridge between Greenfield and Oakland," said Hughes, the Greenfield resident. "I'm curious what they're doing to do for the bus routes. I'm hoping she can force them to look at it."With less than 30 days until the May primary, Kaplan says she'll continue to campaign."I hope to be able to knock on every single door in [the] district."
Photographers Janet Russek and David Scheinbaum both grew up in Brooklyn, and regularly spent time on the Lower East Side, shopping in the Orchard Street stores for new school shoes, or picking up bagels, lox, and knishes. Although they later relocated to New Mexico, they still returned to visit family. When, in 1999, they took their son to the Lower East Side to buy a tallit prayer shawl for his bar mitzvah, they realized that the Jewish heritage seemed to be disappearing from the neighborhood.
“That's when Janet and I first noticed that the place was changing very rapidly, a lot of the old businesses were starting to close, and new high-rise buildings were being built,” Scheinbaum told Hyperallergic. “We took some photographs that trip, but it wasn't until a few years later that we really set out in earnest to photograph and capture the flavor of the Lower East Side that we grew up with before it's gone.”
Remnants: Photographs of the Lower East Side, recently released by Radius Books, features these images, which highlight businesses still open like Russ & Daughters, Economy Candy, and Katz's Delicatessen, as well as those now shuttered due to escalating rents and shifting demographics. “Since we started working on a book, I'd say about a third of our book is gone,” Scheinbaum said. For instance, Streit's Matzo Factory was replaced with luxury condos; the formerly thriving district of Judaica stores on Essex Street has faded.
“We were trying to photograph the Lower East Side that we knew before it disappeared,” Scheinbaum stated. “We didn't photograph much of the new, we really concentrated on photographing much of the old, the traditional places, the traditional stores, not only the synagogues and the food purveyors, but the fabric store and the shoemaker and all the local places where many New Yorkers would go and get their needs met.”
This is the third book on which the husband-wife duo has collaborated, following Ghost Ranch: Land of Light (1997) and Images in the Heavens, Patterns on the Earth: The I Ching (2004). For Remnants, Russek photographed in color, and Scheinbaum in black and white, giving the sense of shifting time as viewers flip through the book. Some images frame details like a hand slicing cold-smoked salmon at Acme Smoked Fish (now operating in Brooklyn), or take in whole street scenes, such as an elderly man wearing a fedora pushing a grocery cart by a window, which displays a historic image of the neighborhood when it was a hub for new immigrants.
“Unlike the photographs of their predecessors that underscore the overcrowded streets and bustling activity of a vibrant community, Russek and Scheinbaum focused their lenses on the remaining vestiges of the Jewish enclave, from historic landmarks, museums, and synagogues to family businesses including bakers, candy shops, delicatessens, eateries, and haberdasheries,” writes Sean Corcoran, the curator of prints and photographs at the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY), in a book essay.
MCNY recently had an exhibition on the photographs of Jacob Riis, who documented the 19th-century squalor of the tenements, including those on the Lower East Side. Because of Riis, and later photographers like Weegee and Helen Levitt, the crowded streets of the Lower East Side are familiar.
“For many American Jews, the Lower East Side is a place of origin, a Plymouth Rock, the neighborhood where it all started,” writes Amy Stein-Milford, deputy director of the Museum at Eldridge Street, in Remnants. “So deep is its lure and lore that this vision of the Lower East Side resonates, regardless of whether or not they — or their ancestors — have ever stepped foot there.”
There is no reversing the changes that have already altered the character of the neighborhood, yet the photographs are reminders that all of this history is not gone, and can be preserved. Notably, the back cover of the book features a photograph of the Essex Street Market, seen through a translucent dust jacket that gives the building a ghostly quality. The Essex Crossing development now underway will relocate the old food hall, with sleek glassy architecture rising where once there was low brick.
“The book kind of serves as a memory,” Scheinbaum said. “It honors the past, it honors the people who came and the people who were there, it honors a time, and I think as you move forward in time and you look back and reflect upon a place, it becomes a visual record of what was, and it's not necessarily a statement about destruction. We try to make a record of things that we feel are important, and in a way our photographs might help to preserve their memory before they're totally gone.”
Remnants: Photographs of the Lower East Side by Janet Russek and David Scheinbaum is out now from Radius Books.
I liked this story because it was different. There are a lot of Christmas stories out there for young readers, but this wasn't like any that I had run across before. The ideas are very creative and interesting and the characters are the kind that will be able to go on for future books easily.
I did find a few editing mistakes, but nothing major. Some of the sentence structure was a bit awkward in places, but it didn't take away from the enjoyment of the story. My only real criticism, would be that I felt this book could use a dash more humour for the younger kids. There are a few funny places, but a lot of the book is descriptions of actions and the main character thinking out loud about those actions.
The imagination of the author really does come to life in this book, and I would encourage parents to give this a read with their kids. It has a few really strong messages in it that make it worth the time to enjoy. This could easily become a film for the holidays.
This review is based on a complimentary coy from the author in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
Get 2000 Arcane Dust? Blizzard Makes Up for Pity Timer Bug
Just over a week ago, Blizzard announced that there was an issue which led to some players getting one fewer Epic or Legendary card than they should have from packs. If you were hurt by this bug, you have been sent an email letting you know and 2000 dust has been credited to your account which will let you craft a Legendary card and an Epic card!
No idea what you should craft? You should save it for the upcoming Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion and either spend it on something that looks cool or use it a few days into it once we have a good idea what Legendaries are going to be solid.
No official post has yet been made on the resolution, and it's possible that dust hasn't been finished being distributed. We expect an official response shortly.

SURREY, England, March 18 (UPI) -- Researchers in England and France are watching paint dry -- for science.
Specifically, the research team wanted to understand how particle size affects the mechanics of drying paint and other coatings. Their research showed that coatings with differently sized particles solidify spontaneously into two layers.
By manipulating the size of the particles in paint, researchers were able to change the qualities of each distinct layer. The findings -- detailed in the journal Physical Review Letters -- have implications for a variety of coatings and industries, from beauty products to pharmaceuticals.
"When coatings such as paint, ink or even outer layers on tablets are made, they work by spreading a liquid containing solid particles onto a surface, and allowing the liquid to evaporate," lead study author Andrea Fortini, a material scientist at the University of Surrey in England, said in a news release. "This is nothing new, but what is exciting is that we've shown that during evaporation, the small particles push away the larger ones, remaining at the top surface whilst the larger are pushed to bottom. This happens naturally."
Particles could be manipulated to improve sunscreens, Fortini said.
"Most of the sunlight-blocking particles could be designed to push their way to the top, leaving particles that can adhere to the skin near the bottom of the coating," he explained. "Typically the particles used in coatings have sizes that are 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair so engineering these coatings takes place at a microscopic level."

I mean wash my hair, not drink the martini... I can do that myself...So after heading outside and kicking some homeless men so I could steal their change cups for cash, I popped into a Starbucks and ordered a non-fat soy chai latte, then had the barista stir it with her tongue. You didn't know Starbucks did that? Well you've probably never asked. Try it next time.I sat down and fired up my laptop, first browsing a couple porn sites to see if my sister was getting any work... then opened up Craigslist and started to write.So by this point of my profile, you probably want to shoot me in the kneecap with a small girly handgun... Let me give you some more ammunition...* While surfing in Africa last winter, I lied to my friend about which beaches had shark sightings then went to the worst one. I smeared his board with fish guts. Once he was attacked, I pulled him from the water... I'm a goddamn hero!* I've never stolen a car without returning it with a full tank of gas, two tickets to a hockey game, and a gently used handgun in the trunk. Juuuuuust kidding.... who can afford hockey tickets these days? Come to think of it, who can afford gas?* I know the difference between a fine kilo of pure Columbian yay, and a shopping bag full of icing sugar, so don't try and double cross me like my first four wives.* Everyone hates mimes... but not me. I respect someone who knows when to shut the fuck up. If we all did that, there'd be less war. Then again, if there was less war, Hollywood would start making more movies about teens trying to lose their virginity before college. I lost mine in grade 8 to my parent's chubby Greek cleaning lady... how come no one makes a movie about that?* My agent thinks I'm an asshole. Partially because I never pay her, partially because I keep getting her name wrong. I'm bad with names. If we sleep together, and I wake up and call you Betty, Sally, or Billy-Jo, don't be offended. I have the same problem with phone numbers, so if you wonder why I don't call... it's cause some nice family in the 'burbs is getting non-stop booty calls at 2am in your place.* Don't worry about that though, as I never sleep with the same girl twice. You wouldn't ask DaVinci to paint another copy of the Mona Lisa, would you?* I get mistaken for Tom Cruise almost everywhere I go. Not Tom Cruise the actor, Tom Cruise the assistant pottery teacher at Langley Highschool (go RiverRats!)Now, since guys online dating all seem to like to tell YOU what YOU should be like (don't you love that?), I'll do the same.* Don't be blonde. I'm bored of blondes in this town (like any of you are really blonde anyway... pfft... Grow some self-confidence and go back to your natural colour.) Sure blondes have more fun... but brunettes try harder, and I respect a woman who puts some effort in, and blondes just have it too easy.* I don't care where you live. I have a car. I like driving. Have some ice cream and pie waiting for me and I'll drive to Brossard (well... it'd have to be homemade pie if you live in Brossard.)* I'd prefer if you ARE married or have a boyfriend.... Look... I'm not going to sit around picking out new cutlery from a catalogue with you, or help you walk your tiny little dog. You should have a steady boyfriend or husband for that. I'm like a roller coaster, fun to ride by yourself (or preferably with your best friend!)... but terrible for trying to have a dinner party on!Well... that's it for me.Smell ya later...PS. If I've piqued your curiosity, you should know that it's Ok for you to email me. I won't tell your friends, family, husbands, or boyfriends that you've been browsing Craigslist's personals... and don't you want to know if I just talk the talk, or walk the walk?PPS. Please include a photo of yourself, preferably in a dress, but failing that, underwear. And failing that, track pants and a dirty t-shirt always work.PPPS, Both my parole officer and my therapist have given me the thumbs up to date since "the bank incident".
Sigma Nu Fraternity Inc. and Purdue University announced Tuesday the suspension of the fraternity's Purdue Beta Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu for two years, effective immediately. The chapter will be eligible to return to the campus for the fall 2017 semester.
The suspension stems from reported incidents of hazing, including servitude, calisthenics, activities between midnight and 7:30 a.m., and scavenger hunts, as well as providing alcohol to minors and reported drug use during functions. The incidents occurred during the fall 2014 semester and were reported at the conclusion of the semester.
The suspension follows university and national fraternity investigations that concluded such activities took place. The fraternity and the university then took joint action to suspend the chapter. The General (national) Fraternity's decision was made in consultation with Beta Zeta alumni leaders and Purdue officials.
“Sigma Nu regrets the loss of the Beta Zeta chapter," said Brad Beacham, executive director of Sigma Nu Fraternity Inc. "However, in keeping with our mission to develop ethical leaders, the Fraternity cannot tolerate such violations of its law, policies and principles. For more than 124 years Sigma Nu Fraternity has supported the growth and development of students at Purdue University. We will work with Beta Zeta alumni leaders, university officials and student leaders to re-establish this legacy of leadership at Purdue in the future. We are grateful for our strong partnership with Purdue, and we appreciate the university's continuing support.”
The Fraternity's suspension of the charter means that the chapter will cease to function until recolonization. The approximately 25 student residents of the privately owned chapter house must find new accommodations, and Purdue's Office of the Dean of Students is working with them to find housing options both on campus and off. Once the suspension period is complete, the chapter house, which is in the 1300 block of Tower Drive, will be available for the chapter to recolonize.
"Our Fraternity, Sorority and Cooperative community offers many positive contributions to the overall student experience at Purdue University," said Jeffery Stefancic, Purdue associate dean of students. "It is disappointing that this particular organization could not uphold the reasonable behavioral expectations placed upon them. I look forward to working with the organization's national office after the suspension to assist in their return."
Purdue's Sigma Nu chapter was placed on probation during the fall 2014 semester for hosting unregistered social functions. It was placed on probation during spring semester 2013 for making alcohol available to minors and trying to prevent Purdue EMTs and police from entering the house to check on a person's well-being.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA said on Monday that a 20 billion reais ($5.7 billion) civil lawsuit seeking environmental and property damages for last year's deadly Samarco mine disaster has been dismissed.
The mine is operated by Samarco Mineração SA, a joint venture between Vale and the world's largest mining company, BHP Billiton Ltd. Vale said the judge did not rule on the merits of the case.
A tailings dam burst at the mine in November and unleashed 60 million cubic meters of mud and mine waste that devastated a village, killed at least 13 people and polluted a major river valley.
The National Humanitarian Society (Sohumana) filed the lawsuit before a federal judge in Rio de Janeiro in December.
Brazil's federal and state governments also threatened to sue Samarco and its owners for 20 billion reais in compensation for the disaster and a settlement was reached in March to cover the damages.
Under the agreement, Samarco, BHP and Vale will pay the 20 billion reais over 15 years to cover and repair damages. Vale, however, has outlined it expects to pay less than that due to the way the deal is structured, calculating future payments depending on how much work remains to be done.
The settlement was approved by a Brazilian judge in May, which potentially reduced the threat of a separate $44 billion lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors in the states of Minas Gerais, where the mine is located, and neighboring Espírito Santo, who based their claim on the clean-up costs of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
While “Downton Abbey” is seemingly the most successful British import since the Beatles, other shows from the U.K. are enjoying their share of Stateside success.
Foremost among This is Emmy-nominated miniseries “Sherlock,” the ultra-modern update of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic investigator, created by “Doctor Who” scribes Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. Though not quite the water-cooler staple “Downton” is, the PBS “Masterpiece” detective drama has garnered critical acclaim — and some of the highest ratings in public television history — by steadfastly refusing to dumb down its material.
Unlike the regrettable pair of Guy Ritchie-helmed Sherlock Holmes films, which share little more than a title with Conan Doyle's stories, the Moffat and Gatiss version is a love letter to the source material, staying true to the original text in every way that matters while still oozing modernity. Their Sherlock is a habitual texter who uses gadgetry like iPhones and GPS to solve crimes, all while Dr. Watson chronicles the pair's adventures on a blog.
Related Claes Bang to Play Dracula in New BBC, Netflix Series ‘Dracula' Series From ‘Sherlock' Team to Launch on BBC and Netflix
“One of the features of the original stories is that he wasn't a period piece character; he wasn't a fussy old uncle,” Moffat says of Holmes. “He was a young man and he was a scientist who was up-to-the-minute on forensics … cutting-edge and modern.”
That modernity is enhanced by the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch (“Atonement”), who embodies Holmes so completely that he was the only actor ever considered for the role.
“I look weird,” Cumberbatch says. “I look like I'm slightly of another era, but I'm obviously in the 21st century, so I kind of fit the bill of being slightly Victorian in a weird way.”
Cumberbatch's Holmes is selfish, arrogant and socially inept, yet charming and witty enough to win over audiences. He's a man of smoldering intelligence whose rapid-fire dialogue is delivered at a breakneck pace, forcing the viewer to pay close attention or else get lost in the twists and turns of the story.
“The amount of detail, the amount of plot that can be contained in one moment of him diatribing about a crime scene, is a thrilling bit of theater, really,” Cumberbatch says. “His thought process is like a stream of consciousness.”
For all its verbal alacrity, “Sherlock” also has a distinct visual style developed by Paul McGuigan, who has directed two-thirds of the episodes. Much of the plot exposition is delivered via text messages, which appear not in cutaway insert shots, but instead float and dance across the screen in visually arresting subtitles.
Holmes' own internal thoughts frequently appear as subtitles too. It's a lot for viewers to keep up with, but both Moffat and Cumberbatch say challenging the audience intellectually is what sets the show apart from the usual primetime fare.
“It doesn't matter if you don't get every single bit of all of his deductions. Who ever does?” Cumberbatch says. “I think people like not being insulted, I really do. We've gotten far more sophisticated as audiences because we see media in such different ways, and yet still in our mainstream output on television it's all about people being patronized.”
With each 90-minute episode based on a different Conan Doyle tale, Moffat and Gatiss are busy working on scripts for the third season, which begins filming in January. In the meantime, the cast and filmmakers are reveling in the unexpected buzz.
“None of us had any idea it would become this sort of phenomenon,” Cumberbatch says. “We're just touched and delighted about the whole thing. It's certainly taken us by surprise.”
There is a time and a place for everything -- except perhaps urinating out of the back of a sheriff's car.
Devin Langford allegedly didn't realize that simple truth and ended up pissing off officials in Indian County, Fla.
Langford was pulled over last month for speeding, and the arresting officer noticed that not only did he have slurred speech and “red, glassy, and bloodshot eyes," but there were also “a plethora of empty beer cans” littering Langford's truck, according to the police report.
Langford allegedly failed a series of field sobriety tests and was placed into a squad car and taken to the county jail. On his way, he suddenly felt nature's call and told the officer he needed to pee, The Smoking Gun reports.
Although the arresting officer, Brian Bell, told Langford to wait until they got to the jail, the suspect said he couldn't hold out that long and asked if he could urinate in the car.
Amazingly, Bell told the suspect he understood if he couldn't wait.
Langford was so touched that he decided to avoid whizzing in the car by attempting to aim his stream out the window by kneeling out the backseat and aiming his urine out the window, according to the police report.
Although Bell said he'd prefer that Langford just pee his pants, the suspect went ahead with his plan. In the process, he splattered urine all over the passenger seat and floorboard of Bell's cruiser.
Later, when they arrived at jail, Langford told Bell, "I might be a little drunk, but I'm not a lot of drinks," the Daily Mail reported.
The breathalyzer said otherwise: Langford blew .138 percent on one test and .141 percent on another.
Langford was booked for a misdemeanor DUI, but he was not charged for urinating all over the patrol car, The Smoking Gun reported.
He's not the first guy whose bladder got the best of him.
Back in November, Roger Alvin Henderson was pulled over by a police officer for a window tint violation and asked to get out of the car.
Then the Florida man allegedly relieved himself all over the police car when the cop's back was turned.
That same month, a Pizza Hut employee in Des Moines, Iowa, was so ticked off after being denied a tip that he allegedly pulled down his pants and urinated on the customer's front door.
Last August, New Zealand's Ryan Scott Thompson put the "wee" in "Kiwi" after urinating on 300 breathalyzer tubes during a sobriety test.

The golden age for bullion coin choice continues with an unexpected new release commissioned by large and respected Austrian/German bullion dealer Philoro Edelmetalle. Available in a one-ounce silver and in 1 / ½ / ¼ ounce gold formats, this new coin has a theme very rarely found in bullion – the arts. Depicting one of the world's greatest composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, this would be a fine companion piece to the Austrian Mints Philharmonic.
The first thing that strikes you about this coin is the high level of detail for bullion. The reverse face depicts a portrait of Mozart surrounded by a quill to the left and a flurry of musical notation around the rest. The inscription ‘WOLFAGANG AMADEUS MOZART 1756-1791' is well placed and sympathetic to the artwork. The notes, Mozart's hair, and the feather all retain a huge level of detail, actually giving up little to a proof coin in that regard. It helps that the artwork is of a very high standard, designed by the artist Tom Pohnert.
The obverse, often an afterthought on a bullion coin, is also covered in custom artwork much like Euro coins in general. Depicting a view of Salzburg, Mozart's birthplace, it's also full of detail. The shield emblem of Palau, the issuing country, sits centre-bottom with the denomination below it. Palau actually uses the US dollar for currency, so it has value in that regard as well and may have enhanced appeal in the United States as a result.
The silver is struck in four-nines silver (99.99%), which while it seems to be appearing on more and more bullion coins lately, still remains a relative rarity. The gold is even rarer, coming in at five-nines in purity (99.999%). All things considered, this is a very interesting coin with lots of appeal. If it's successful we understand that it might develop into a series, but there's no further information yet. It's available to buy now, we have a silver one here that we'll photograph and video shortly. Prices look pretty reasonable, especially for the quality, no doubt aided by the unlimited mintage. The Philoro link is in our usual blue-button at the end of the article where you can buy the coin.
For many years the windmills of my mind turned very slowly when it came to preparing a will. Partially deluded about my own mortality, it would have seemed rather distasteful pondering over who I should divvy up the cappuccino machine and my 15 year old Camry to. Thank heavens common sense caught up with me... before any random bus ran me over.
Yet I'm no great oddity when it comes to delaying the scribing of one's will. Latest statistics show that 45% of the adult population in Australia still haven't bothered to testate.
For most of us that do see the light, we worry about fairly similar things. Naturally, our attention turns to our spouse or partner; children; close relatives and friends and how to best to take care of them. Our wills become that final stated endeavour of our benevolence and love for those we cherish.
Of course there are those outrageous exceptions that defy belief with their eccentricity, meanness or just plain craziness.
Here are my all-time favourites:
William Shakespeare
A reading of the Bard's will suggests a rather generous fellow. His daughters Judith and Susanna, granddaughter Elizabeth, sister Joan and nephews are all left generous gifts of cash. Numerous friends are left smaller amounts of money so they may buy rings. He even left his godson William Walker 20 shillings in gold. All the rest of his goods and household stuff he left to my son-in-law, John Hall and his daughter Susanna.
However, snubbing his wife Anne Hathaway from beyond the grave, he leaves her the second best bed and the furniture.
What a cad indeed! It's a shame Anne couldn't claim under the Family Provision Act that Will's will failed to make ‘reasonable financial provision' for her, and ask a court to award her more.
Leona Helmsley
Billionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley was renowned throughout her life for her penny pinching and mean spiritedness to family, staff and friends. Despite an earlier draft of her will leaving her fortune to the poor, the final will, amounting to $8 billion dollars, was left in trust for the care and welfare of dogs.
Her own dog, a 9 year old maltese named ‘Trouble' was left $12 million. The poor pooch's inheritance was later cut to $2 million on appeal. Apparently Trouble's lap of luxury was often interrupted as the executors had to hide him to avoid kidnap threats!
In keeping with her meanness, Ms Helmsley's grandchildren were either cut out of the will or ordered to visit their father's grave annually in order to inherit their share. Provision was made in the will for them to be docked of their allowance if they missed a visit.
Luis Carlos de Noronha Cabral da Camara
As the illegitimate and unloved son of an aristocratic woman, Mr da Camara was rich, but had few friends and no offspring of his own. When it came to writing out his will, he asked a Portuguese notary for a copy of the Lisbon phone book and plucked out 70 names at random.
"He was determined that nothing should go to the state, which he thought had been robbing him of money all his life," said Anibal Castro, a former friend who witnessed the will. One newly minted heiress on receiving her inheritance stated, “I thought it was some kind of cruel joke ...I'd never heard of the man.”
Wellington Burt
Michigan lumber tycoon Wellington Burt used his will to put his enormous wealth out of reach of his family for almost a full century. A sour old man who wanted to wreak his revenge beyond the grave, he proclaimed in his will that his vast fortune would not be passed on until 21 years after the death of his last surviving grandchild.
As a result of this, none of Burt's six children, seven grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and 11 great-great grandchildren received a penny. The 21-year countdown ended on November 2010 with the death of Burt's last grandchild. It was a countdown descendants and lawyers likely charted for years and within weeks 30 people had applied for a piece of the pie. Genealogical research later determined only a dozen were eligible to share in the $100 million dollar estate. Thus ending what has been described as “The Legacy of Bitterness”.
Lang Hancock
Iron ore magnate Lang Hancock's passing heralded one of the most acrimonious fights over an estate that Australia has ever seen. In one corner was Mr Hancock's second wife of 6 years Rose Porteous, and in the other his daughter Gina Rinehart.
An 11 year battle ensued over the estate with Rose claiming she had been denied the valuable iron ore royalty rights Lang had owned, after a last-minute change to his will. Gina in reply claimed the $50 million worth of assets given to Rose by her father had been handed over under duress.
There was an inquest, sought by Gina, to investigate Lang's death because she believed her father's end was a result of foul play by Rose. However it quickly degenerated into a circus with WA Attorney-General Jim McGinty complaining it was an abuse of public resources and had come about only because Ms Rinehart and Ms Porteous had so much money.
The inquest was dominated by claims and accusations that Rose had literally nagged Hancock to death and that Gina was paying big money for her witnesses.
Despite this, the coroner forged ahead and found that Hancock had died of natural causes which was consistent with the findings of the original autopsy.
The pair finally agreed to a truce, reaching a secret settlement that saw all legal actions dropped. Rose kept her assets and Gina retained the enormous iron ore royalties.
Robert Louis Stevenson
Robert Louis Stevenson, author of classics Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, throughout his life cherished his close friend, Annie Ide. Ide's was born on Christmas day and had often complained to Stevenson about the misfortune of having a December 25th birthday. I imagine no double prezies was the jist of her sulk.
Stevenson was so sympathetic to this, that he gave her his own birthday when he died.
In his will Stevenson bequest that the “rights and privileges in the thirteenth day of November, formerly [his] birthday are now, hereby, and henceforth, the birthday of the said Annie H. Ide, to have, hold, exercise, and enjoy the same in the customary manner, by the sporting of fine raiment, eating of rich meats, and receipt of gifts, compliments, and copies of verse, according to the manner of our ancestors.”
It's not known whether Annie took him up on this odd ‘gift'.
Heinrich “Henry” Heine
German poet Heinrich “Henry” Heine left his estate to his wife Matilda on the condition that she remarry, so that “there will be at least one man to regret my death”. His last will and testament providing a last chance to insult his wife one final time.
But in essence this would backfire today. Because Henry left no children, Matilda would under law inherit Henry's whole estate, absolutely and without the condition of an ‘insult clause'. An unconditional touche you could say!
The short and the long of it
Frederica Cook obviously had a lot of time on her hands. Her will was 1066 pages long and occupied four leather bound folios. Aside from the pages containing the introductory clauses, the will also listed a priced inventory of laces, jewellery, furs, embroideries, dressing bags and objets d'art. A large number of these articles are further explained in the endless footnotes.
The will was in Mrs Cook's own handwriting and among the many, many things mentioned in the document, the one that caught my eye was that her age not be inscribed on her tombstone!
Mrs Cook would have been shocked to find that the shortest will ever record amounted to a measly 3 words, “All to mother”. However, this was challenged when the deceased's wife and mother both claimed to be ‘mother'.
Dear oh dear!
Fredric Baur
Baur was a chemist who invented among other things Pringles potato chips and it's iconic can. He was clearly a touch anally retentive and orderly in needing his chippies stacked neatly in a column.
But aside from this, he also demanded in his will that he be cremated and buried in a Pringles can. And in 2008, when he passed away, his children happily obliged.
Baur's eldest son Larry told Time Magazine that "When my dad first raised the burial idea in the 1980s, I chuckled about it,". However his son quickly worked out that dad was serious. On the day of his cremation, the sons stopped at a 7/11 for the ‘burial can' of Pringles. They debated what flavor to use but the answer to Larry was obvious, “we must use the original”.
Charles Vance Millar
In saving the best for last, I really was rather impressed by this fellow's will. Millar was a King's Counsel practicing in Toronto, and a lifelong bachelor. He also was a man of considerable means owning a company that specialized in the delivery of mail to British Columbia.
His will left no doubt as to his sense of humour. A property in Jamaica was left to three lawyers Millar knew despised each other. He also gave stocks in a brewery to religious leaders known for their prohibitionist views.
However, the pièce de résistance was to leave the residual of his estate to "the mother who has, 10 years after his death given birth in Toronto to the greatest number of children as shown by the registrations under the Vital Statistics Act". The will noted that if one or more mothers have an equal highest number of children the moneys and accumulations must be divided equally between them.
And so began a rather (re)productive period in Toronto's history. In the end the bounty was split among 4 eligible women who had 9 children each in the 10 year period.
Mr Millar certainly managed to create quite a stork derby!
Our collective jaws may drop at crazy, mean or eccentric wills, but a person's will is after all their final wishes, whether heartfelt or mean of spirit. There are naturally stop gaps under family provision when things become ridiculously unfair.
Nevertheless, Sir Owen Dixon did note that it was never intended, by legislation, that the freedom of testamentary disposition should be so encroached upon that a testator's decision expressed in his will have only a prima facie effect.*
So with that in mind, best I now get to that codicil about being buried in the old Camry with the cappuccino machine by my side.

Not too long ago, locals and tourists in Varna, a city on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, came face to face with one seriously weird creature: a perfectly green cat. No, they did not have to follow a long and windy yellow brick road to find it. It sort of found them.
By the looks of it, the cat just showed up on the streets of this city in Bulgaria. It behaves just like any other feline of its kind and is quite friendly. Thus, locals say that they have often seen it play with other cats in the area. Apparently, these other felines don't mind their friend's weird fur color.
Not an alien cat seeking to destroy mankind
Contrary to what some might assume given its bright green color, this stray cat in Varna is not some alien's former pet. It's not even the result of a freaky science experiment gone horribly wrong or a feline version of the Hulk.
Long story short, it's a cat just like any other. The reason its fur turned emerald is that, as of recently, the feline has been sleeping in a garage, nestled on top of a heap of synthetic green paint. Otherwise put, the cat did this to itself.
This also explains why, until not very long ago, the creature's fur was not bright green, but instead only displayed a hint of emerald. As detailed by locals and tourists in Varna, the feline gradually progressed to its current downright bizarre fur color.
Interestingly enough, it was first assumed that the cat had fallen victim to some vandals who saw fit to have some fun dying its fur. Mind you, locals even went as far as to set up a Facebook group looking to bring the creature's abusers to justice, DM informs.
Dying pet animals is never a good idea
Animal rights activists say that, although some might be tempted to dye their own pets green or some other odd color after reading about the emerald cat in Bulgaria, the fact of the matter is that animals should not be abused in this manner.
To begin with, chances are that, during the dying process, a pet will experience tremendous stress. Besides, it's important that people keep in mind that, despite being our pets, cats, dogs and other animals have rights of their own.
“Pets could potentially find being held and restrained whilst the dyeing process is undertaken very stressful,” the UK's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said in a statement earlier this year.
“Our pets are living creatures and dyeing them in this way sends out an extremely worrying message that they could be viewed as novelty accessories rather than as intelligent, sentient animals,” the organization went on to detail.
If you have about a minute to spare, check out the video below to get a better idea of what Bulgaria's green cat looks like. Entertainment guaranteed.
The numbers echoed gains made in Los Angeles County, where light rail (13.7 percent), heavy rail (.57 percent), commuter rail (5.56 percent) and bus ridership (.12 percent) have all seen increases in the ridership over the first three quarters of 2012 compared to the same time span in 2011. The big gains in light rail here are partly attributable to the first phase of the Expo Line, which debuted in late April and fully opened to Culver City in June.
Here's the news release from APTA:
More Than 7.9 Billion Trips Taken On Public Transportation As Ridership Increased by 2.6% in First Three Quarters of 2012
Seven Consecutive Quarters of Ridership Increases Show Growing Demand
More than 7.9 billion trips were taken on U.S. public transportation in the first three quarters of 2012 as ridership increased by 2.6 percent over the first three quarters of 2011, according to a report released today by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). This report shows that 201 million more trips were taken in the first nine months of 2012 than in the same time period in 2011.
“With seven consecutive quarters of ridership increases, it's obvious that public demand for public transit is growing,” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy. “As Congress works to resolve our country's deficit problem, it also needs to work to resolve the transportation deficit. Otherwise public transit and highway funding will be facing an annual $15 billion shortfall in the next 10 years.”
Mobility is an important reason to have a strong public transportation system. However, public transportation also has a critical connection to the economy. For every $1 billion invested in public transportation 36,000 jobs are created and supported. Additionally, public transportation plays an important role in providing access to jobs.
“We continue to see that in areas where the local economy is improving and new jobs are being added, public transportation ridership is up,” said Melaniphy. “This makes sense since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes. Public transit service is an important resource for employees and employers as it is instrumental in helping people travel to their jobs.”
Some of the cities experiencing economic improvements and public transit ridership increases in the third quarter of 2012 include: Grand Rapids (MI); Seattle (WA); St. Petersburg (FL); Phoenix (AZ); San Francisco (CA); Los Angeles (CA); and Riverside (CA).
All major modes of public transportation increased from January through September this year. Light rail and heavy rail saw the largest increases in the first nine months with increases of 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent respectively.
January – September 2012 Ridership Breakdown
Nationally, heavy rail ridership increased by 3.6 percent and 12 out of 15 heavy rail systems (subways and elevated trains) experienced ridership increases in the first nine months of 2012. The heavy rail systems with the highest increases in ridership for the first nine months of 2012 were in the following cities: Cleveland, OH (10.8%); San Francisco, CA (7.4%); Chicago, IL (4.9%); Baltimore, MD (4.4%); and New York, NY (4.4%).
Light rail ridership increased by 4.2 percent from January through September, as 22 out of 28 light rail systems reported increases in ridership. Hampton, VA experienced a triple digit increase due to new service. Light rail systems saw double digit increases in the first three quarters in five cities: Memphis, TN (33.7%); Salt Lake City, UT (19.7%); Los Angeles, CA (13.7%); Pittsburgh, PA (13.5%); and Seattle, WA (11.2%). Other light rail systems with increases were in the following cities: Sacramento, CA (6.8%); Boston, MA (6.2%); Houston, TX (6.1%); and Seattle, WA (5.5%).
Nineteen out of 28 commuter rail systems reported ridership increases and commuter rail ridership grew by 2.4 percent in the first three quarters of 2012. Commuter rail ridership saw double digit increases in the following cities: Austin, TX (15.6%); San Carlos, CA (12.3%); and Seattle, WA (10.2%). Other commuter rail systems showing high increases were located in the following cities: Stockton, CA (9.7%); Portland, OR (8.0%); Baltimore, MD (6.9%); Harrisburg-Philadelphia, PA (6.1%); Portland, ME (5.9%); Los Angeles, CA (5.6%); and Newark, NJ (5.2%).
Nationally, bus ridership rose by 1.8 percent from January through September of 2012, with 28 out of 37 large bus systems reporting increases. Some of the highest bus ridership increases in large cities were reported in: Saint Louis, MO (8.6%); Arlington Heights, IL (5.3%); Newark, NJ (5.2%); and Oakland, CA (5.0%).
Demand response (paratransit) increased by 3.6 percent.

How I Built TinyMusic.js (part 1)
Kevin Ennis Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 22, 2015
About a year ago, a few co-workers and I decided that we'd all participate in js13k. If you're not familiar, js13k is a game competition where each entry has to be smaller than 13 KB.
Being a musician, it felt important that my game would have music. After looking around a bit, I wasn't able to find any libraries that really did what I wanted without totally blowing the 13 KB budget. So I decided to make my own.
This post is the first of two parts. In it, I'll explain the Note class in TinyMusic. We'll dig in to a little bit of light music theory and math.
In part two, I'll cover the Sequence class, and talk about the Web Audio API.
TinyMusic
Before I start digging in, here's a link to the final product: TinyMusic. You can also check out a small demo here.
Keep in mind that this is a fairly bare-bones library. It was really purpose-built for something like js13k, so the idea was to deliver the minimum useful feature set for basic music synthesis.
Notes
The first thing I started work on was a Note class.
var note = new Note(‘A4 q');
This was the API that I wanted. Basically, it accepts a string containing a note name and a time value (q = quarter, h = half, etc.), separated by a space.
In order to translate the note name into a frequency, you need two things:
1. A known frequency for a given note.
2. A formula for moving between your known frequency and the target note.
Choosing a starting frequency
Most musicians probably know that A4 = 440Hz, so that seems like a good choice for our target frequency. But since numbered octaves actually begin at C, we really want to use middle C (C4) as our target.
Knowing that C4 is 9 half-steps below A4, we can get its frequency like this:
var middleC = 440 * Math.pow( Math.pow( 2, 1 / 12 ), -9 );
I won't dig too far into the math here, but hopefully you recognize the 12 (number of semitones in an octave) and the -9 (the distance between A4 and C4).
We'll be using the same formula later on to derive all of our other frequencies.
Converting note names to frequencies
Now that we have our target frequency for middle C, we need a way to translate other note names into frequencies.
The first thing I did was create a string of every note and then use that to populate an offsets hash.
var enharmonics = ‘B#-C|C#-Db|D|D#-Eb|E-Fb|E#-F|F#-Gb|G|G#-Ab|A|A#-Bb|B-Cb';
var offsets = {};
enharmonics.split(‘|').forEach(function( val, i ) {
val.split(‘-').forEach(function( note ) {
offsets[ note ] = i;
});
});
The groupings in that string are kind of important to understand. The basic idea is that in music theory, sometimes there are actually multiple names for the same note. So B# and C are equivalent. Fb and E are equivalent. You get the idea…
Anyway, what we end up with at the end of that process is an object where each key is a note name (A, F#, Db, etc.), and the value is the distance between that note and C (in half-steps).
From there, we just need a little bit of math.
var num = /(\d+)/;
// the octave number of our known frequency, middle C
var octaveOffset = 4;
Note.getFrequency = function( name ) {
var couple = name.split( num ),
distance = offsets[ couple[ 0 ] ],
octaveDiff = ( couple[ 1 ] || octaveOffset ) — octaveOffset,
freq = middleC * Math.pow( Math.pow( 2, 1 / 12 ), distance );
return freq * Math.pow( 2, octaveDiff );
};
// usage:
Note.getFrequency(‘F3'); // 174.61
So we're doing a few things here. The first line just creates an array that looks like [ ‘F', ‘3' ].
From there, we get the note's distance from C by looking it up in the offsets object. In this case, it's 5.
octaveDiff end up being -1, which means that our target frequency is in the octave below our known frequency.
Next, we calculate a frequency as if our target note was in the same octave as middle C. This is the same basic formula you saw earlier.
Finally, we shift our frequency to the correct octave.
Durations
In addition to frequency, each Note also needs a duration.
In this case, duration isn't actually measured in seconds or milliseconds. It's really just going to be a ratio of the note's time value to one beat length.
In other words, for a quarter note, duration would be 1 (because it's exactly one beat long). For a half note, it would be 2. An eighth note is 0.5, etc.
Dotted notes
If you read music, you're probably familiar with “dotted” notes.
If not, it basically means that when a note is dotted, you add 50% to its duration. So a dotted eighth note is really like an eighth note plus a sixteenth note.
It was pretty important to support this in TinyMusic, so this is how I did it:
var note = new Note(‘A4 es');
Here, the e stands for “eighth” and the s for “sixteenth”. When I parse that string, I simply add the two durations together.
Numeric values
There are so many possible values for note duration that I couldn't realistically support all of them with short-hand strings (e.g. “q” = quarter, “e” = eighth, etc).
So the Note constructor also accepts numeric values, like this.
var note = new Note(‘A4 0.75');
Putting it all together
This is the actual function I ended up with.
var numeric = /^[0–9.]+$/;
Note.getDuration = function( symbol ) {
return numeric.test( symbol ) ? parseFloat( symbol ) :
symbol.toLowerCase().split(‘').reduce(function( prev, curr ) {
return prev + ( curr === ‘w' ? 4 : curr === ‘h' ? 2 :
curr === ‘q' ? 1 : curr === ‘e' ? 0.5 :
curr === ‘s' ? 0.25 : 0 );
}, 0 );
};
I know, the nested ternary thing is gross. But in my defense, I wrote this a while ago and I was trying to save bytes. So whatever.
Anyway, here's how this thing works:
1. If we got a string that looks like a number, just call parseFloat and return the number.
2. Otherwise, loop through each character in the string and try to get a time value for it — then add them up.
The second step is accomplished with Array#reduce. This is what gives us the ability to support strings like 'es'. We just get the value for e and add it to the value for s.
Wrapping up
Now that we've got our Note class, we need a way to group them together and play them. I accomplish this with a class called Sequence, which I'll be covering in part 2 tomorrow.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syria on Monday said a United States-led coalition had bombed a Syrian military base in the east of the country, killing three soldiers, wounding at least 13 and destroying vehicles and equipment. The United States denied the Syrian accusation and said a Russian warplane appeared to have been responsible.
The Syrian accusation, in a statement carried by the official news agency, was the first time that President Bashar al-Assad's government had held the Americans responsible for bombing a Syrian military facility since the United States began airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria more than a year ago.
The statement said that the bombing had been conducted Sunday evening in Deir al-Zour Province, and that Syria had sent letters of protest to the United Nations calling it “a heinous aggression by the coalition.”
American military officials said the coalition had carried out airstrikes in the province on Sunday, but they said no Syrian military positions had been struck. The Americans seemed anxious to avoid an escalation of tensions with Mr. Assad's government.

note Not really. Pogs were introduced in Mexico and South America as Tazos in the 90s and new ones continue to be released and be somewhat popular to this day. Thankfully they are now Deader Than Disco ... Or are they?

Throughout human history, people have become obsessed over the darndest things, especially in the consumer-driven economy that sprung up during the 1950s. Hula hoops, pet rocks, disco, pins, breakdancing, various child stars, One-Hit Wonder bands, fidget spinners, and of course, pogs were all once insanely popular, but like most fads they faded away, and these days most of us look back on all the hooplah and laugh.
Thus, comedies can generate laughs simply by making an off-hand reference to a fad that was once wildly popular, but is now considered ridiculous. Sometimes this takes the form of a pointed comparison between a current fad, or a thinly-veiled parody of it, and one that used to be popular but is now Deader Than Disco, with the implication that the current fad is headed the same way.

If the show is about Remembering Pogs (humorously or seriously), we have I Love the Exties. If it's a character who just can't leave his pogs behind, he's Disco Dan. If it's so ridiculous that the today's kids don't believe it was actually real, it's Aluminum Christmas Trees. When the use of a widely popular fad ends up dating a work to a specific time period, it's Unintentional Period Piece. When the fad in question later manages to withstand the test of time, that's It Will Never Catch On.

ANNAPOLIS, MD — Maryland law enforcement reported 516 murders in 2015 up from 362 in 2014. Motorists discovered 13,151 cars stolen — 36 vehicles each day, but not a significant increase over the previous year. It's just two data points in the FBI's annual crime report, released this week.
Agencies around the country provide data to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, and that information is released annually in the "Crime in the United States" report.
Nationally, law enforcement reports violent crime (murders, rapes, robberies, assaults) were up 3.9 percent in 2015, but property crimes (burglaries, thefts) fell by 2.6 percent. The FBI notes the increase in violent crime year-over-year is still far below the rate in 2006: 16.5 percent.
Maryland's totals saw a similar pattern, with an increase in violent crimes and a decrease in property crimes.
Here are Maryland's 2015 totals, along with the 2014 totals.
Violent Crime: 27,462
Murder and non-negligent manslaughter: 516 - up from 362
Rape: 1,666 - up from 1,632
Robbery: 9,863 - up from 9,565
Aggravated Assault: 15,417 - up from 15,208
Property Crime: 139,048
Burglary: 25,678 - down from 28,134
Larceny-theft: 100,219 - down from 109,140
Motor vehicle theft: 13,151 - up from 13,116
Firearms were used in an estimated 75 percent of murder cases in Maryland, according to the FBI data. Nationally, the FBI report notes that firearms were used in 71.5 percent of the nation's murders.
FBI Director James Comey noted the data is released to promote more transparency and accountability in law enforcement.
"We also need better, more informed conversations about crime and policing in this country," he said in a statement. "Information that is accurate, reliable, complete, and timely will help all of us learn where we have problems and how to get better."
Robberies nationwide resulted in a loss of $390 million and thefts included an estimated $14.3 billion in stolen property.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds landed in the Cradle of Naval Aviation on Monday for a rare joint training with the Navy's Blue Angels.
"I feel like a little kid right now, standing out here with the Thunderbirds flying overhead, watching them park their jets and getting to shake their hands," Navy Cmdr. Ryan Bernacchi, the commander of the Blue Angels, said after welcoming the Nevada-based Thunderbirds to Pensacola.
The eight Air Force F-16 pilots and more than 50 other officers and support staff from the Thunderbirds will join the six F/A-18 Blue Angels pilots and support staff at Naval Air Station Pensacola through Wednesday.
The U.S. military's two elite fighter jet demonstration teams are seldom in the same place at the same time. Under Department of Defense guidelines, the two teams are not allowed to perform at the same air shows because the military wants to cover as much recruiting territory as possible by using both teams in different locations throughout the year. The two teams haven't been in Pensacola together for more than 15 years.
"I love being here, it is so very cool," said Air Force Maj. Alex Turner, one of the Thunderbird pilots. "You can see how I'm smiling about this."
Even though the two teams do not get to perform together during the season, they have a strong bond, said Air Force Lt. Col. Jason Heard, commander of the Thunderbirds.
"There has always been a lot of respect between the two teams," Heard said. "We have a lot in common and we are looking forward to the week."
The joint training came about after Bernacchi and Heard met during a Las Vegas air show conference in December.
"We exchanged some thoughts and ideas and have been in touch since then. As two flight leaders, commanding officers, we communicate back and forth and send texts like 'Hey, great Superbowl,' or whatever," Bernacchi said.
During the training, Bernacchi will fly in the backseat of an F-16 piloted by a Thunderbird and Heard will fly in the backseat of an F/A-18 piloted by a Blue Angel. The two demonstration teams hope to fly together on Wednesday afternoon.
"We will take off together and fly down the coast," Bernacchi said. "If you are out the beach, you will definitely want to see it."
Heard is familiar with the skies above Pensacola. He trained as an Air Force navigator at Naval Air Station Pensacola and lived in Perdido Key for about a year and a half.
"It's like being back home," said Heard, who recalled watching the Blue Angels fly when he was a young officer.
The pilots weren't the only people excited about the unusual joint training. Dozens of Blue Angels support staff members stood outside the Blue Angels hangar, cameras in hand, and waited for the Thunderbirds to land.
From the public affairs office to aircraft maintainers, staff from both teams will share ideas and get to know each other during the three-day joint training.
Blue Angel pilot and Navy Cmdr. Frank Weisser said the entire team was excited about the training.
"Everyone out here is smiling and hope that's the same reaction our fans have," he said.
The Blue Angels will hold a closed practice from 9-10 a.m. Tuesday followed by a public practice by the Thunderbirds at 1:30 p.m., according to a release from the base's National Museum of Naval Aviation.
Bernacchi said the Blue Angels will hold a public practice at 11:30 Wednesday. Both teams hope to fly together at around 3 p.m. Wednesday.

Controversial legislation to avoid a major taxpayer funded payout to the East West Link consortium has begun to be drafted by top Victorian officials.
Leader of the Government in the upper house Gavin Jennings confirmed that department officials had been instructed to draw up a bill to limit the amount of compensation the state will have to fork out to the consortium contracted to build the road tunnel.
In question time on Wednesday, Mr Jennings was asked if the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Department of Treasury and Finance or parliamentary counsel had been given instructions to draft legislation to limit compensation "liabilities" around the cancellation of the East West Link contracts.
Mr Jennings confirmed officials had been asked to draft legislation.
Premier Daniel Andrews has never ruled out the use of legislation to avoid a huge compensation bill.
Breaking: After yesterday's report that rattail-coiffed Koran savior Jacob Isom's dream was to be featured in High Times, the doobie denizens agreed to feature our rattail-coiffed hero in the pages of their vaunted magazine.
On its website, High Times thanks Jacob for his "bravery in the face of intolerance" and promises him a place in an upcoming issue. By phone, Jacob told me that he talked to a representative from the magazine today who said they'll be overnighting him a package of High Times merchandise. He will then take pictures, and High Times will post them on their website. A comic-book-style summation of his harrowing defeat of Amarillo, Texas' wannabe Koran burners may also be in the works.
We will let you know about this most glorious turn of events as it happens. When we spoke, Jacob was en route to work at a local pizzeria. Fame, it seems, has not slowed our hero's humble, delicious calling: cooking pizza. [High Times]

The Cleveland Browns are set up for what could be a solid opening week to free agency -- and a solid first round in the draft at the same time.
And they could do it by acquiring only one player in March.
The Browns simply have to convince the New England Patriots that they should trade quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, then they should take their shot with a legitimate offer -- which would start with the 12th pick in the draft. It might take more. It might take another pick in 2018. It might even take another first-round pick or a second-rounder, but the Browns owe it to themselves to do the work to see if they can complete the deal.
As free agency arrives, the Browns are staring down the barrel of a 2-14 season with their current roster. The only thing they've done at quarterback is cut one player.
Yes, there is time to stock the roster, but if they can't improve at the most important position, they'll be spinning their wheels for another year and this same discussion will be taking place in 2018.
2017 NFL DRAFT Round 1: April 27, 8 p.m. ET

The other option after Garoppolo appeared to be Tyrod Taylor, but news broke Wednesday that the Bills are going to re-sign Taylor.
A deal for Garoppolo would combine with the knowledge that they garnered on Myles Garrett at the combine to make for a successful week. They could then look forward to the rest of the draft and know that they are adding a premier pass-rusher and a quarterback to a roster that needs both.
Imagine adding a player at each of the two most important positions on the team with the capital from one first round. Garrett and Garoppolo would be something to strut about coming out of the draft and free agency.
One decision is totally in the Browns' control. They can say today that they are going to draft Garrett, though it's prudent to wait and ensure he doesn't step on a rake between now and the end of April.
Garoppolo is more of a challenge. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported last week that New England is unlikely to trade him, and that's a logical position. Tom Brady will be 40 before the 2017 season, and at that age even he might give in to Father Time.
The Patriots would be wise to have a backup ready, and the reviews for Garoppolo around the league are positive. If he's that good, it would make sense for New England to figure a way to keep him.
But if there is any wiggle room on New England's part, the Browns owe it to themselves to check into the possibility. It's possible that even the Patriots have a price. The Super Bowl champs might relish the idea of starting the 2017 season with the 12th pick. The rest of the league might not be thrilled, but all's fair in love and quarterbacks, and the Browns have to get one.
At some point, the Browns have to take their shot at a signal-caller.
They have to be decisive in their evaluation and bold in their actions.
If they look back and realize they got Garrett and Garoppolo to go with all the other draft picks they'll have, the vibe about the 2017 season changes for the better.
It has been a long time since those words applied to the early part of a NFL offseason in Cleveland.
President-elect Donald Trump named a fast-food chief executive to be the next labor secretary Thursday. If confirmed, Andrew Puzder ― the head of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains ― would be responsible for enforcing the country's labor laws and holding unscrupulous employers accountable.
Puzder apparently has some experience when it comes to wage law enforcement, albeit on the other side. According to a review of Labor Department records, Hardee's Food Systems Inc., a subsidiary of CKE Restaurants, agreed to pay $58,000 in back pay to a group of 456 workers after a wage-and-hour investigation by the agency in 2006 and 2007. At the time, Puzder was head of CKE, which fully controlled Hardee's Food Systems, according to financial disclosure forms.
Records indicate all the money was owed for overtime. Asked for more information on the case, the Labor Department would provide only limited details. The investigation was company-wide, and Hardee's Food Systems had failed to include workers' incentive bonuses when it computed overtime pay, making the payouts smaller than they should have been. The department does not say whether an investigation was initiated by the agency or resulted from a worker's complaint.
A Hardee's spokeswoman referred questions to an official with the Republican National Committee on Friday. That official could not immediately be reached for comment.
Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, hourly workers are due time-and-a-half pay for any hours they work over 40 in a week. If he becomes labor secretary, one of Puzder's top responsibilities would be enforcing the overtime standard. In addition to the Hardee's Food Systems case, several Hardee's franchisees have been investigated over wage theft allegations in recent years.
In one case in Tennessee, a franchisee agreed to pay 29 workers more than $7,600 in back pay. In a case out of Michigan, a franchisee was found to have shorted seven workers nearly $5,000. And a Missouri franchisee agreed to pay four workers nearly $4,000 for failing to meet the minimum wage. In each of those cases, the franchisee, rather than CKE Restaurants, was held responsible for the violations.
The Hardee's investigations should underscore why advocates for low-wage workers are concerned with Trump's choice. Puzder would be coming to Washington directly from the top of an industry that the Labor Department is responsible for policing. Wage theft is a widely documented problem in the fast-food business, which pays some of the lowest wages in the country. Labor Department investigators often find that restaurants have failed to follow minimum wage and overtime law.
Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images If Andrew Puzder is confirmed as labor secretary, he would be coming to Washington directly from an industry his department would be responsible for regulating.
As the nation's workplace watchdog, Puzder would be the top official responsible for potentially suing Hardee's restaurants ― the very franchisees he has worked with as the head of the Hardee's brand ― when they don't pay workers what's due them.
Christine Owens, director of the National Employment Law Project, said a fast-food executive should not be charged with enforcing wage laws. “Puzder will be there for his low-wage-industry CEO buddies, who are now salivating over the prospect of rolling back the Obama administration's efforts to raise pay for low-wage workers, improve workplace safety, and increase corporate accountability for wage theft and other violations,” Owens said.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a fast-food brand that hasn't been cited or sued for breaking wage laws over the years. During the 2016 fiscal year alone, the Labor Department found that 10,300 fast-food workers were owed more than $5.4 million in back wages. Investigators discovered violations in 86 percent of their fast-food cases.
As with other companies like McDonald's, CKE Restaurants itself is typically not the target ― its franchisees are. For example, in 2013, a Hardee's franchisee in Michigan agreed to pay nearly $10,000 to a group of workers after being taken to court by the Labor Department. Roughly half of that sum was for wage violations, the other half for damages, according to settlement records.
The franchisee, Ishaan Enterprises, had been paying workers in a way that avoided having to pay them overtime. When workers logged more than 40 hours in a week, they didn't get time-and-a-half pay on those extra hours ― they only got paid “straight time.” One worker alone was owed nearly $2,700 in back wages.
Obama's Labor Department has made a point of targeting the fast-food industry for enforcement because they say they find so many violations there. Meanwhile, the Fight for $15, a union-backed campaign to raise the minimum wage and bring collective bargaining to fast food, has brought a host of lawsuits against companies like McDonald's over alleged wage theft and discrimination.
Trump has made clear through his nominations that he wants business-friendly Cabinet members who've criticized Obama's policies. His choice for health secretary, Rep. Tom Price, has fought to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and his pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has sued the very agency he would be leading.
Labor watchdogs worry that enforcement would be far more lax under someone like Puzder.
Investigations into wage theft or workplace hazards are carried out by career civil servants at the Labor Department, who keep their positions regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican occupies the White House. But, as at all federal agencies, priorities are set by the political appointees at the top. Enforcement can be strong or lax, depending on the administration and its deputies.
Puzder has been a public critic of the labor reforms championed by the Obama administration, including the White House's attempts to raise the minimum wage and grant overtime protections to more salaried workers. Puzder himself has penned opinion pieces and made television appearances criticizing the sitting president's reforms as job killers.
Earlier this year, the Obama administration tried to overhaul the nation's overtime rules to make them more generous to workers. Under the changes, which are currently blocked in court, an additional 4.2 million salaried workers would be guaranteed time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours in a week. The overtime changes would be the most significant labor reform of the Obama era.
Writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2014, Puzder said the rules would hurt the workers they were intended to help, like the fast-food managers who work for Hardee's and Carl's Jr. Many of those managers would be newly entitled to overtime. “Overtime pay has to come from somewhere, most likely from reduced hours, reduced salaries or reduced bonuses,” Puzder wrote.
For a very long time now I've wanted to utilize some volcanic rock as glaze. In much of my research here at Utah State I've been looking at iridescent phenomena, both in glazes and in the natural world. It was quite fortuitous, then, when geology grad Doug Jones asked me to accompany him on an excursion just over the border into Idaho to look for Xenoliths, which at this site are very deep mantle rocks that have been blasted quickly to the surface in younger volcanic flows.
While we were poking around looking for Xenoliths, I started picking up some rather remarkable chunks of iridescent vesicular basalt. Vesicular basalt is characterized by it's frothy, bubbly matrix… if you don't know what I'm talking about, think red lava rock. It's one in the same. Here's an example:
After picking up a good pile of this stuff, we went on to find about 40 Xenoliths, as well as some other interesting stuff.
Once I got back to the studio it was time to figure out if this stuff was even viable. My standard go to for this is to break off a small chunk, put it in a dish, and fire away.
After putting theses samples in a cone 10 reduction kilns and a cone 10 oxidation kilns, it became quite evident that I had something useful.
After deciding that this was a good road to go down, the hard work of crushing and processing this stuff began. I started by breaking the boulders down into gravel sized pieces. These then went into out ball mill. I could have shaved down the time it took to mill this stuff by using intermediate crushing equipment (an impact mill, or hammer mill) but I found it easier in the long run to load up our ball mill and run for about 24 hours, sieve out the useful material, add in more course material, and repeat. By the end of 4 days I'd run all the material through and was left with tumbled lava rock:
Larger basalt mixed with porcelain ball milling medium.
With my material milled down fine enough to pass easily through a 100mesh sieve, I then let it sit for a few days, pouring off the water each morning, until gradually the material became thicker and started to resemble a glaze. Because it was ball milled, the particles were quite small, and suspend really well. The next step was to take this glaze material and see what happens in the kiln. I was quite pleased:
Now that I knew I was dealing with a viable glaze, I couldn't wait to get this stuff in the kiln and firing it in a weird, experimental reduction cool cycle. Last year I discovered some really incredible surfaces by cooling a kiln in reduction, and holding at certain temperatures. In this case, the geologists have told me that basalt solidifies at about 980C, so I've been crash cooling the kiln to around this temperature, holding in a reduced environment, and letting the metallic compounds crystallize in reduction. My speculation is that I can somewhat re-create the conditions in which iridescent phenomena occur. Lo and Behold:
This result is remarkably similar to effects you can achieve in Raku, or Lustre firing… but it's a different phenomenon, and relies on totally different elements; namely, Iron. Whereas raku usually derives rainbow iridescence from Copper and Cobalt, and lustres from Silver, and Bismuth, these colors are coming from Iron with trace amounts (less than .5% Manganese and Titanium). It's very interesting on the ceramics side, and the geologists are quite interested too, because the phenomena is not wholly understood. One of the perks of being a graduate student with STEM funding is that I have access to fancy analytical equipment. This analysis has allowed me to build a material profile in Insight Glaze Software.
To that end, my future plans with this research will involve more experimentation with the firing process. In fact, I'm currently working on a piece that will exhibit between 10 and 20 wall hanging tiles that all feature the exact same clay and glaze with different firing schedules. At the same time, I'll also continue to tweak this material by adding other oxides to end up with brand-new flavors of glaze.

Put another way, only Westville offers an alternative to driving. Look how many houses and small streets surround Westville. This makes it at least possible to leave the bar without getting in a car at all. You could conceivably walk to Buffalo Wild Wings just like you could conceivably walk through barbed wire or a swamp. My point is that it is far from practical. As I point out in a moment there are multiple barriers to getting home safely without a car. There is little you would be likely to walk home to unless you were staying in the Hampton Inn. Even if you did walk you would have to deal with car spaced distances and poor infrastructure. Take, for example, the brambles that surround the site like a barb-wire fence and lack of sidewalks.
If we Do The Math and try to put numbers to this comparison we can start to see the difference. As a simple metric we can take the relative Walkscores of the two sites. Wild Wings is a modest 52 (somewhat walkable) while Westville is 82 (very walkable). I, once again, call out to MADD to consider the inverse of bar Walkscores a measure of drunk-driving potential. In reality, the disparity is far greater than Walkscore is able to process. This is the composite score which under-weights things like terrain and infrastructure and assumes that any address you type in is residential.
Another way to compare the sites is to consider how many people could walk home in half an hour. In theory Buffalo Wild Wings could get you as far as downtown or Kenilworth in half an hour but this is unlikely. The travel time fails to take into account the kind of dangerous roads you would be walking (e.g. no sidewalks, lack of light), the mountain you would be climbing, or the tunnel you would be walking through. Furthermore, as you can see in a wider aerial view, there are few non-commercial areas within range. Most of what you can walk to, ironically, is more surface parking. Westville's compact, gridded (comparatively) design, by contrast, gives it access to basically all of West Asheville.

Seit Beginn der Schuldenkrise in der Europäischen Union hat die Bundesregierung nach Ansicht zahlloser Kommentatoren oftmals zu langsam und widersprüchlich gehandelt. Kritiker sind der Ansicht, dass dieses Verhalten und dessen Wirkung auf die Finanzmärkte die Situation nur noch verschlimmert habe.
Nach langem Hin und Her und zahllosen Aufstockungen des Hilfsfonds wurde dann am 21. Juli, zumindest nach Stellungnahmen der Protagonisten, ein entscheidender Durchbruch erzielt. In den Wochen vorher wurde die seit Monaten währende Diskussion um den richtigen Weg zur Lösung der Krise wieder aufgewärmt. Mit bekannten Standpunkten.
Eine Seite der Argumentation betonte wiederholt, ein Schuldenschnitt für Griechenland sei früher oder später unvermeidbar und deshalb jede neue Finanzhilfe verlorenes Geld. Kritiker dieser Sichtweise warnten jedoch vor den nicht absehbaren Konsequenzen einer solchen Maßnahme. Zum einen, weil ein sogenannter "Hair-Cut" Griechenland nicht wirklich helfen würde. Zum anderen aber auch, weil dieser Schritt dazu führen würde, dass auch anderen EU-Staaten das Vertrauen der Finanzmärkte entzogen werden könnte. Das Drama Griechenlands könnte sich in Volkswirtschaften wie Spanien, Portugal oder Belgien wiederholen. Die Währungsunion an sich und auch die EU würden ernsthaft infrage gestellt werden. Nicht absehbare Konsequenzen für die wirtschaftliche und politische Stabilität Europas sowie der gesamten Welt wären die Folge.
Statt Griechenland pleitegehen zu lassen, müsse die EU endlich Nägel mit Köpfen machen und die strukturellen Ursachen der Krise beseitigen. So sollte z.B. die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) durch die Ausgabe sogenannter Eurobonds die Staaten der Union mit bezahlbaren Krediten versorgen. Schuldzinsen von bis zu 18%, die Griechenland aktuell noch gegenfinanzieren muss, würden der Vergangenheit angehören.
Daneben müsse Europa endlich seine Kleinstaaterei im Inneren aufgeben. Eine europäische Wirtschaftsregierung könne eine Art Marschallplan für die strukturschwachen Staaten auflegen. Dadurch würden diese Staaten im innereuropäischen Wettbewerb konkurrenzfähiger werden. Laut zahlreichen Experten und dem Europäischem Parlament wäre dies ein wichtiger Schritt. So führten gerade die Ungleichgewichte innerhalb Europas dazu, dass die schwachen Staaten immer mehr Güter importieren werden, als sie exportieren können. Die Staatsdefizite dieser Länder füllen somit die Kassen der starken Staaten. Ein bedeutender Teil des aktuellen wirtschaftlichen Erfolgs Deutschland basiert auf diesen strukturellen Ungleichgewichten. So wird laut Zahlen des Statistischen Bundesamtes der überwiegende Teil des deutschen Handelsbilanzüberschusses innerhalb der Europäischen Union erwirtschaftet.
Dilemma für die Bundesregierung
Folglich stellte die europäische Finanzkrise für die Bundesregierung ein schwer zu lösendes Dilemma dar. Einerseits war es nicht im deutschen Interesse, wie zahlreiche Beobachter zutreffend feststellten, den Fortbestand der Europäischen Union aufs Spiel zu setzen. Allerdings wehrte sich Berlin andererseits mit Händen und Füßen auch gegen die zweite oben beschriebene Variante.
Zwei Gründe lassen sich dafür ins Feld führen. So weist das CSIS (Center for Strategic & International Studies) darauf hin, dass die Ausgabe von Eurobonds zur Konsequenz haben würde, dass Deutschlands Kreditwürdigkeit durch die vermeintliche Misswirtschaft anderer EU-Staaten in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden könnte. Überdies hat Deutschland bisher wenig Interesse gezeigt, eine wie auch immer geartete Form einer europäischen Wirtschaftsregierung auf den Weg zu bringen. So könnte ein von diesem Gremium initiierter Aufbauplan für die strukturschwachen Regionen deutsche Wettbewerbsvorteile und somit auch das exportorientierte Wirtschaftsmodell in Gefahr bringen.
Als der Europäische Rat am 21.7. seine Beschlüsse veröffentlichte, war die Erleichterung zunächst groß. Mit einem neuen Hilfspaket von 109 Milliarden Euro und einer Beteiligung des Privatsektors von ca. 37 Milliarden Euro wurde die erneute Zahlungsunfähigkeit Griechenlands abgewendet. Darüber hinaus wurden die Laufzeiten der Kredite Griechenlands zu Zinsätzen von 3,5% verlängert.
Ein starkes Zeichen sollte von diesem Treffen ausgehen. Politiker, zumindest von CDU, FDP und Grünen lobten die Beschlüsse. Skeptisch zeigte sich jedoch unter anderem das DIW, welches die Ergebnisse als "überraschend großzügig, überraschend unkonkret" bewertete. Dass die Resultate des Gipfels vom 21.7. nicht der Weisheit letzter Schluss waren, wurde deutlich, als José Manuel Barroso am 3. August in einem offenen Brief die 17 Staats- und Regierungschefs Europas zu mehr Anstrengungen und Entschlossenheit aufforderte. Zusammen mit den Finanzproblemen der USA hat dies wieder einmal zu nervösen Reaktionen der Finanzmärkte geführt.
Auf den ersten Blick wirkt das europäische Krisenmanagement trotz der eingesetzten Milliarden stümperhaft. Auch scheint die Kanzlerin auf europäischer Ebene den Kürzeren gezogen zu haben. So musste Deutschland erneut aller Rhetorik im Vorfeld zum Trotz Europa mit einer erneuten Finanzspritze aus der Klemme helfen. Daneben soll es der EZB und später einem flexibilisierten EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility) nun auch möglich sein, Staatsanleihen verschuldeter Staaten anzukaufen. Auch wenn Angela Merkel dies nicht so sehen will, warnt das DIW vor einer Einführung von Eurobonds durch die Hintertür.
Sicherlich ist es richtig, dass Deutschland als wirtschaftlich stärkstes Land in Europa finanziell den Löwenanteil am Rettungspaket für Europa trägt. Allerdings ist der Preis, den Deutschland für sein Engagement verlangt ein Vielfaches höher und nicht allein in Euros zu bewerten.
Der EFSF und die machtpolitischen Konsequenzen
Denn bedeutender als die Milliarden, die erneut für Griechenland zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, ist die sogenannte Flexibilisierung des EFSF und die damit in Zusammenhang stehenden machtpolitischen Konsequenzen. So weist der US-amerikanische Thinktank STRATFOR darauf hin, dass der EFSF nun frei entscheiden kann, welche Maßnahmen er ergreifen möchte, um einen drohenden Staatsbankrott abzuwenden. Er wird dabei in Zukunft nicht mehr an das Votum des EU-Ministerrats gebunden sein. Dabei ist zu berücksichtigen, dass der EFSF keine Institution der Europäischen Union, sondern eine private Bank mit Sitz in Luxemburg ist. Laut Selbstdarstellung beschäftigt der EFSF nur 12 Mitarbeiter. Organisatorisch bedient er sich dabei den Strukturen der EZB (Europäische Zentralbank) und einer deutschen Institution, der Finanzagentur GmbH.
Dieser Sachverhalt und die Tatsache, dass der Chefposten des EFSF mit Klaus Regling, einem Deutschen besetzt ist, gibt Berlin in den kommenden Jahren die faktische Kontrolle über das europäische Krisenmanagement, so STRATFOR. Damit wird in Zukunft Deutschland unter Berücksichtigung der eigenen Interessen darüber entscheiden, welche Sozialleistungen in die Krise geratenen Staaten streichen oder welche Sektoren der Wirtschaft privatisiert werden müssen. Lästige Einwände andere Staaten müssen nun nicht mehr berücksichtigt werden. So ist zu erwarten, dass das einen Tag nach dem Krisengipfel veröffentlichte Eckpunktepapier des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums einer "Investitions- und Wachstumsoffensive für Griechenland" die Interessen der deutschen Wirtschaft nicht unberücksichtigt lassen wird.
Angesichts der Tatsache, dass neben Griechenland, Portugal oder Irland auch weitere Staaten wie Spanien und Italien Unterstützung benötigen werden, wird das wahre Ausmaß der Entscheidungen vom 21.Juli deutlich. So hat es Deutschland am Ende geschafft, eine Art europäische Wirtschaftsregierung zu etablieren. Dabei müssen die Entscheidungen jedoch nicht in einem mühsamen demokratischen Prozedere in Brüssel getroffen werden. Stattdessen hat Berlin freie Hand, die Wirtschaft Europas nach eigenen Vorstellungen zu gestalten.
Ob sich Deutschland, wie STRATFOR analysiert, damit als unangefochtene Großmacht an die Spitze Europas setzen wird, bleibt abzuwarten. So soll 2013 der EFSF einen Großteil seiner Aufgaben an den ESM (European Stability Mechanism) abgeben. In diesem werden die meisten Entscheidungen mit einer qualifizierten Mehrheit von 80% der Stimmen getroffen. Der Stimmanteil der einzelnen Staaten ergibt sich gemäß der finanziellen Einlage in den Fond. Auf den ersten Blick mag der Anteil von Deutschland mit ungefähr 27% nicht übermäßig erscheinen. Überlegt man jedoch, dass dies einem Vetorecht gleichkommt, wird deutlich, dass auch nach 2013 keine wirtschaftspolitisch relevante Entscheidung Europas gegen den Willen Berlins getroffen werden kann. Lediglich Frankreich, welches ungefähr 21% der Anteile hält, kann noch als Gegengewicht gewertet werden. Die kleinen Staaten werden fast zur Bedeutungslosigkeit degradiert.
Somit macht es den Anschein, dass der Gedanke von Freiheit, Gleichheit, Brüderlichkeit zunehmend in Vergessenheit gerät. Stattdessen feiert eine neue Variante der preußischen Idee des Klassenwahlrechts in den Institutionen der Europäischen Union ihre Wiederauferstehung. (Samuel Weber)
AN AMERICAN man has been arrested for sending an animated GIF on Twitter to an epileptic journalist causing him to have a seizure, in a case that has taken cyber harassment laws into new territory.
The intentionally harmful image was sent to Newsweek journalist Kurt Eichenwald in what was reportedly an attempt at revenge for his critical coverage of Donald Trump.
The 55-year-old reporter was at his home office in Dallas on December 15 when he clicked on a Twitter message which prompted a blinding strobe light to begin flashing on his computer screen.
Mr Eichenwald — who has openly discussed his condition — was later found by his wife convulsing on the floor.
John Rayne Rivello, 29, of Maryland has since been arrested and charged with criminal cyberstalking with the intent to kill or cause bodily harm. He faces a possible 10 years in prison if convicted.
An investigation into the matter found Mr Rivello had bragged to other users on the social media platform about his plan to send the flashing image, saying “let's see if he dies”.
An affidavit filed with the complaint said a search of Rivello's Twitter account showed he had sent other messages about Eichenwald saying “I know he has epilepsy” and “I hope this sends him into a seizure”.
Authorities also found an altered Wikipedia page in Rivello's iCloud account that showed a fake obituary for Eichenwald with a death date of December 16 — the day after the image was sent.
Mr Eichenwald's wife responded to the initial tweet, telling the sender that she had “called the police to report the assault”.
Eichenwald was incapacitated for days, lost feeling in one hand and had trouble speaking for weeks after the seizure, his lawyer said.
Cybersecurity experts in the US said the incident was not the first instance in which people had used online technology in a bid to expose medically vulnerable people to injury, however it is believed to be the first case of its kind to involve criminal charges.
“This is a new era,” a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, Kevin Fu told The Washington Post.
We can go to jail for GIFs now? This is completely insane. https://t.co/OROJCfzAgz — Gavin McInnes (@Gavin_McInnes) March 20, 2017
Notorious crowd-funding website typically dedicated to alt-right causes, WeSearchr, has launched a campaign to raise money for Mr Rivello's defence.
“If this goes to trial, it will redefine “trolling” and what it means to troll online. John can't go to prison for tweeting a GIF at Eichenwald,” the campaign organisers wrote.
Mr Eichenwald's lawyer Steven Lieberman said the use of a strobe light against a known epileptic was “no different than a bomb sent in the mail or anthrax sent in an envelope,” according to The New York Times, where Eichenwald spent years as an investigative reporter.
Since the attack, the Newsweek journalist, who has been highly critical of Donald Trump, said that 40 additional accounts have since sent him strobe light images. He said he has passed their information to the FBI.

This feels like a big one. Given that I've not been this excited since I discovered the little-known toffee-chocolate HobNob, there must be something in it. And it's a very specific set of circumstances. Each of these three cars has been driven by Top Gear magazine (and every other big motoring outlet on the planet), but all three have never been in the same place, at the same time, for dissection by the same minds.
I say ‘minds'. This might lead you to believe that somehow we're in the company of intellectual heavyweights - really its just Top Gear on tour, rank freshly pulled, meetings duly cancelled. We are hopelessly, joyously over-staffed. Nobody - I mean nobody wanted to miss this one.
It's not been easy: Charlie has spent the last few weeks on the phone, and now that the time is nigh, just looks as if he's about to give birth. Literally give birth. Oliver is fretting about having to compete in the Wales Rally GB tomorrow, and I fell over putting my trousers on this morning. Dates have shifted several times. Flights have been booked, and cancelled, and re-booked. Private owners have offered their cars, but never - quite - at the same time. And yet they are here, together.
The Big Three. Fully supported by the manufacturers involved, with full disclosure. I think McLaren, Ferrari and Porsche are as interested as we are …
Yes, pairings have been seen in the same room - not least the 918 and P1 on TG's own Speed Week 2014, but never this triumvirate, After all, both the McLaren and the Ferrari are both sold out - they have nothing to prove and all to lose. For this, we salute the manufacturers - to be truly proud of your product is to allow comparison with the best. And, to immediately ignore any assumed prejudice, these three really are teetering on the top tier. It's like having a lion, a tiger, and a leopard all prowling around the same territory: you're not sure which one might come out on top, but fairly convinced that it will involve a lot of roaring, and someone losing an eye.
A bit of a baseline to explain why we're here, and why to see these three together is to gently electrify the tiny hairs on your nape. This is about each company throwing down a technological and ideological gauntlet to the rest of the World, inviting response, and awe. I'm just not sure anyone was expecting three companies to call each other's bluff so completely in the same 12 months. Yes, these are dream hypercars, and you're about as likely to pull up next to a P1 in a LaFerrari at the traffic light grand prix as you are to find unicorns giving free rides on Brighton beach, but that doesn't mean we can't create the improbable so that you don't have to.
All three are hybrids. All three use an electric motor as a large part of their drivetrain make-up, albeit deploying said electrification in very different ways. All three are hysterically fast, probably worryingly in excess of the talents of ninety-percent of the individuals who can afford to buy them, and yes, all three cost enough to buy you a big house somewhere nice. Although as a great man once said: “You can sleep in your car, but you can't race your house”.
So which is best? We're going to do our damndest to find out. We'll be live-updating our roadtest and photoshoot of these three cars over the next 48 hours on various channels, including right here on TG.com, our Facebook page and Twitter accounts.
Fancy coming with us for the ride?
Our gallery will be updated regularly over the next two days - check back for more!

MS Amlin Andretti has revealed a tweaked colour scheme ahead of this weekend's New York City ePrix, “peeling away” part of its existing livery to reveal more turquoise and white.
The change in look comes following title sponsor MS Amlin's integration into parent company Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, whose logos are well known in Japan, a country in which Formula E is highly popular.
The livery will grace Antonio Felix da Costa and Robin Frijns' cars for both races of this weekend's round in New York, and featuring in the Montreal season finale later this month.
“Our business enables people, businesses and communities to overcome adverse events such as those brought about by extreme weather,” said Adrian Britten, MS Amlin's brand director. “Providing continuity and creating resilience around the world is simply what we do. Championing alternative fuel transport solutions shows our commitment to mitigating risks that threaten us all. That's why MS Amlin committed to the Formula E series before the first cars ever hit the streets. It's why we are still racing on landmark city streets around the world.”

Venue: Outdoor practice fields
Format: Full pads
Nobody walked off the practice fields Wednesday on a bigger high than true freshman receiver Malik Lovette. On the final rep of the Ducks' last practice before Thursday's scrimmage, Lovette got behind the secondary in an overtime drill and hauled in a “game-winning” touchdown pass from Jeff Lockie.
That was just the latest standout moment for one of the most consistent true freshmen so far in preseason camp. Lovette has had notable highlights just about every day, owing to his talent as a receiver, his usefulness on various special teams and his durability.
“We practice so many situations; knowing that was the last drive, to win the game, it felt good,” Lovette said afterward.
For as solid as Lovette has been, though, he plays at perhaps the deepest position on Oregon's roster. With the likes of Byron Marshall, Bralon Addison, Dwayne Stanford and Charles Nelson on hand, Devon Allen and Darren Carrington looking to return in the coming weeks and Jalen Brown, Kirk Merritt and Alex Ofodile also hoping to contribute this season, is there room for Lovette on the travel squad?
Ditto a guy like Jake Hanson; he proved so adept at picking up the offense, offensive line coach Steve Greatwood has been playing Hanson at center, a position he never played in high school. But has Hanson been so good he could crack a rotation in which veterans such as Haniteli Lousi, Elijah George and Braden Eggert are fighting tooth and nail for the few available spots in the two-deep?
On Thursday, Hanson spent time snapping with the No. 2 offense. That speaks volumes about his progression in camp – although Lovette was able to win the overtime drill for his team because Hanson's group was unable to score, in part because the timing of a couple running plays was upset by low snaps.
Again, it's Hanson's understanding of the offense that makes him a candidate to play center, which is so crucial for coordinating the offense prior to each snap. As for the snaps themselves, “I'm still working on that, but I'm coming along,” said Hanson, who flattened a defensive back as a pulling blocker for Lockie during an earlier team period Wednesday.
For players like Lovette and Hanson, Thursday's scrimmage is perhaps the last best chance to make a case for playing time in 2015.
“I think all of us young guys, we're going to play the best we can,” Hanson said. “We have a way better grasp of the offense now than we did the first scrimmage, and we've learned the techniques we've been taught since then. Now we're trying to put it all together and show whether, when we do know all that, if we're good enough to play.”
Other highlights: Another bit of awesomeness from DeForest Buckner today: As the overtime drill started, his defensive group was on the field and he turned to cornerback Ugo Amadi to shout, “Let's get the ball back and score, Ugo!” Three plays later it was fourth-and-one; Kani Benoit took a handoff; Buckner tackled him for no gain. On the next play, Royce Freeman scored on a 25-yard run. Damned if Buckner didn't get the ball back so they could score …
The drill was then reset, since it ended so quickly. A couple nice runs by Tony Brooks-James set up a 29-yard Aidan Schneider field goal, which Matt Wogan matched by making a 39-yard attempt. That set the stage for another stop by the defense – Jimmie Swain and Ivan Faulhaber teamed for another stop on fourth-and-one – prior to Lovette's touchdown grab from Lockie. … Brooks-James was particularly explosive during team drills prior to the overtime periods, while Matt Mariota had a sack and Tyson Coleman had a big tackle for loss. … In the first team period of the day, Coleman had a really solid tackle in space against Freeman, while Benoit cut back against the grain for one of the longest runs of the day.
In 7-on-7 drills in the red zone, Vernon Adams hooked up with Johnny Mundt a couple times. … An earlier 7-on period offered chances to convert second-and-long situations. Lockie had third-down completions to Zac Schuller and Jarret LaCoste, while Adams had a one-play conversion that Merritt took all the way for a touchdown. … In 1-on-1 drills near the goal line, Lockie and Adams each had TD passes to both Marshall and Allen, and Merritt caught balls in the end zone from Lockie, Travis Jonsen and Morgan Mahalak. Tyree Robinson got the best of three straight matchups against Jalen Brown, who finished well by reaching up and catching a pass over the top of a different defensive back.
Other observations: After Thursday's scrimmage, the Ducks have scheduled a very light workout for Friday before kicking off Eastern Washington preparations on Saturday. … Among the visitors to practice today were NFL Hall of Famer Dave Wilcox and two fellow lettermen from the 1963 Sun Bowl team, Doug Post and Rich Schwab.
The proposal by Braintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan would ban recreational marijuana retailers and production facilities in town.
BRAINTREE – Mayor Joseph Sullivan plans to ask the town council to enact a ban on recreational marijuana retailers and growers in the town.
Sullivan said he plans to submit the measure in the next week.
“It's an opportunity for us to take the right step,” the mayor said in an interview.
Meanwhile, the town council's ordinance and rules committee has been looking at putting a question on the Nov. 7 town election ballot which would do the same thing.
The committee is expected to decide on its recommendation at a meeting scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.
District 6 Town Councilor Dan Clifford, who chairs the committee, said they could either decide on action by the council or a voter referendum.
“That will be part of it,” Clifford said after a committee meeting Monday night.
He said the committee is pretty much agreed on prohibiting recreational marijuana facilities in town.
“It's the medical marijuana that we're struggling with,” Clifford said.
In the November election, the town's voted 10,689 to 8,023 against legalizing recreational marijuana.
Sullivan said that a second referendum is unnecessary under the state marijuana law signed by Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday and only town council action is needed.
“There was a referendum in November that the voters of the town very convincingly said they didn't want to participate in recreational marijuana,” Sullivan said.
During Monday night's meeting, the committee heard from Braintree Police Chief Paul Shastany, Stoughton Police Chief Donna McNamara and Walpole Police Chief John Carmichael who all oppose recreational marijuana, feeling it would increase, rather than reduce, problems.

We have very reliable information that the images below represent how some of the Imperial Forces will appear in JJ Abrams' Star Wars film.
The sequel Stormtrooper helmet feels like a natural continuation from the original, but there are distinct differences. The helmet is not symmetrical – there's only one breather/vent on the bottom near the mouth, on his left side. The black “mouth” area under the white nose plate appears to be a cloth/mesh (which you can better see in the detail shot below). The eye lenses are still separate, but set into a black frame to connect them and give the illusion of one single piece.
A couple people have referred to this as a “Jungle Trooper,” but I have a few good reasons to believe that this is actually an update to the Empire Strikes Back's Snowtrooper. This new helmet has a flared dome and a single thin horizontal eyepiece to it (as we first saw described at Making Star Wars) and appears to have a removable face mask.
As with the X-Wing that was highlighted in the Force for Change commercial, they're borrowing heavily from the original trilogy production concepts of Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston with these designs.
They've slowly won me over more and more with each piece of information. Shooting on film instead of digital? I like it. Rumors that Drew Struzan is doing the poster? I'm listening. John Williams scoring? Keep going. Bringing back Han, Luke, Leia and Chewie? That has to make everyone as happy as it's made me. After seeing these designs I am even more hopeful. It genuinely feels like Abrams is approaching Episode VII in way which respects both the fans and the original films themselves.

UPDATE: We've gotten a lot of referral clicks from the RPF – a site dedicated to replicas of movie props and costumes – and naturally, they have an additional prop image in their thread mentioning our story:
Here you can see that the vent is only on the left side of the face, and a slotted vent on top of the dome. These helmets feel like Star Wars in a way that the clone troopers never did. It's an exciting time to be a fan – and who thought we'd ever be able to say that again?

A guest post by Nichole Rae
“Create Each Day.” These three words I carry with me. I have been creative as long as I can remember though I have gaps along my journey where making beautiful creative messes are no where to be found. When these gaps happen I know it is time, time to begin again, slowly.
Along our journey we all have things that come up that fill our days, our moments faster than we can count. After relocating to Nova Scotia a month ago, I find myself in a new area, living in a cottage on a two lane highway near the sea. It is beautiful here and I can feel my creative energy wanting to create a beautiful mess here. Where do I begin? A question I still have after moving 15 times in 9 years. Here is what I have given a try.
Over the last month I have started small art journaling projects that allow me to inspire and nurture my creative spirit. I am preparing myself for a larger book project by first starting small. These projects I work on in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee. Depending on how much time I have, I may work on it for 10 minutes, creating 1 page or if I have more time I will work on it longer. One of my favorite projects is working in books (fiction, nonfiction, self- growth themed books) and finding words within the text to journal with. I have been working on this for 20 days now, creating one 2-page spread each morning. Day-by-day I am creating as I go along.
Here is how to start your own.
To Create Your Own Found Words Art Journal You'll Need:
old book {that you want to use for words, inspirational/self-growth books work well, also fiction or non-fiction.)
blank paper or journal pages {to cover the front and back of book}
black ink pen
masking tape
oil pastels, crayons, colored pencils {to use to highlight text}
little bits of blank paper {color of your choice}
I have a love for the supplies above and found that this project allows me to be creative while enjoying my morning cup of coffee. Waking up to creating has been a great way to start my day.
First start with the book you have chosen to be your “journal” that you will use to create in. Then, using blank pages from a journal you have or blank paper in a color of your choice, cover the book's front and back to be able to create your own custom cover. I used masking tape and taped around the edge of the book adhering the blank page to the cover.
Below you can see the how I folded over the masking tape around the cover. I also added my own custom title to my journal.
Then I used masking tape to cover the books binding that I then could add my own title using a black permanent ink pen. Allow a few minutes for the ink to dry on the tape.
After creating my custom front and back and binding of my book I am ready to start creating on the pages inside.
Starting with the inside cover, I decided to customize my own title using parts of the books original title. Note: If you make a mistake while writing you can use masking tape to cover over and write on top of it.
After completing the front inside page I then will create on pages throughout the book. I will flip through the book and stop on whatever page I feel resonates with me. I will use my black ink pen and begin to box in words on the page that I want to use for my “journaling.”
I will also then add my own text in. I will let the found words or the pages theme inspire this text. I also date each page.
The beautiful thing about working in a book is that the words can often inspire your creativity. You can also cover the pages layout to then add your own text in. I find that when I have something existing to work with I can overcome that blank canvas feeling.
After adding my own text I will then use oil pastels to highlight my boxed in words, adding color to the page. You can be also used colored pens instead of a black pen to highlight your found words by boxing it in.
If you do not have oil pastels you can also use colored pencils or crayons to highlight the word.
Once I have completed this, I finish the page by adding a paper tab to the side. This then marks the pages I have completed and I can find them easily among the others.
Here you will need little pieces of blank paper, masking tape and a pen.
Begin by tearing a small piece of paper into a rectangular shape. The size is about a 1/2 inch wide. You will need to have space to write your page's title and space for the masking tape to adhere the edge to the page. Then tear a small piece of masking tape off ( thinner than the full-width piece) and adhere the edge of the tab to the side of page where you would like. You can see in the above image that will stagger them as I create them to add variation.
For the page's title I will choose a word or phrase from the page and have that be my title for that page. See images below for an example.
Once I add the tab the page is complete.
I have been enjoying setting the words “create each day” into motion with this art journaling project. I am learning to begin small to inspire my creativity. Page-by-page, day-by-day we create our lives and live our journeys. Keep creating as you go! I would love to connect with you, find me at nicholeraedesign.com and connect with me via facebook or instagram.

In what appears to be a major breakthrough in the long, tortuous effort to solve the problem of agunot, or “chained wives,” an international religious court is in formation, headed by a highly respected Orthodox rabbi, with the goal of freeing women trapped in broken marriages.
Blu Greenberg, a longtime activist on this issue and founder of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, announced at the group's international conference this week that Rabbi Simcha Krauss, former rabbi of the Young Israel of Hillcrest and now living in Israel, has agreed to serve as the head of an independent rabbinic court in formation seeking “systemic halachic solutions” to the problem.
A major figure in centrist Orthodoxy who was president of the Religious Zionists of America, Rabbi Krauss made aliyah in 2005 and is affiliated with Yeshivat Eretz HaTzvi in Jerusalem. He is well respected for his Torah knowledge and integrity by a wide swath of the Orthodox community.

But the key to the new court's success may well rest on one of the two leading Israeli rabbis associated with the haredi community who have given their imprimatur to Rabbi Krauss. Most significant is Zalman Nechemia Goldberg, a rosh yeshiva, posek, or religious decisor, and chief justice of the rabbinical high court in Jerusalem.
The other is She'ar Yashuv Cohen, former chief rabbi of Haifa and president of its rabbinic courts. A third prominent Israeli rosh yeshiva has also signaled his support for Rabbi Krauss but prefers to remain anonymous at this time.
Highly respected by all segments of the Orthodox community, Rabbi Goldberg was the first to sign on to the Rabbinical Council of America's pre-nuptial agreement program, to prevent agunah cases, and helped give it credibility.
“As long as Rav Zalman Nechemiah is on board with Rabbi Krauss,” the new venture is “untouchable,” noted an expert on the issue. But he added that haredi elements opposed to the new bet din could put strong pressure on Rabbi Goldberg to retract his support.
“Most of all,” the source said, “it must be truly independent.”
Rabbi Krauss, in an exclusive interview, said on Monday that while he is somewhat concerned about the criticism sure to be leveled at the new court from those on the right, he is prepared to go forward and hopes the court, which at least initially is slated to be based in the U.S., will begin its work by next summer.
“I am not a revolutionary, and I understand that halacha [Jewish law] moves slowly,” he said, “but it's been too slow. It's time.”
He noted that in his extensive experience as a pulpit rabbi in America, he saw too many cases where small bet din courts were subject to “corruption, bribery and utter falsification” in championing the husband and refusing to free the wife from broken marriages.
“The numbers [of agunot] are real, and big, and they are tragic,” he said.
While precise numbers are hard to come by, the North American Study of Agunot, released two years ago, said there had been 462 agunot in the previous five years in the U.S. and Canada. Jeremy Stern of ORA, Organization for the Resolution of Agunot, says his New York-based group receives about 150 calls a year from women seeking help, and is working on about 50 cases at any given time.
Rabbi Krauss said he hopes to bring six to 10 dayanim, religious court judges, on board to his bet din. The first two named are Rabbi Yosef Blau, longtime mashgiach ruchani, or spiritual advisor, at Yeshiva University, known as a champion of victims of abuse, and Rabbi Joseph Polak, who served for many years as director of the Hillel at Boston University and chairs the halacha committee of the Boston bet din.
The problem of agunot is a major one in the Orthodox community for two key reasons. It leaves the woman in religious limbo, unable to remarry and have a child (who would be considered a mamzer, or illegitimate). And it represents a moral and theological challenge to the notion that halacha is based on ethics and human rights.
How can it be, ask critics of the status quo, that halachic Judiasm can tolerate a situation where a woman is trapped in a marriage, at the mercy of a husband who can, and often does, use his power for purposes of extortion, making demands — such as child custody or large fees — to consent to release his wife?
The most recent effort in this country to solve the agunah problem, based on the halacha that the husband has the absolute right in religious divorce cases, began in the 1990s. It was the bet din of the late Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, a major figure in Modern Orthodoxy and president of Bar-Ilan University.
Concerned about the moral injustice of Jewish law as it was being practiced, and sympathetic to the plight of women who were trapped in marriages, he issued divorces on the basis of kiddushei ta'ot, a Talmudic concept for annulment. Its reasoning was that if the woman had known before the wedding what she later came to learn about her husband — that he was abusive, for example — she would not have married him.
Though Rabbi Rackman was deeply respected in the Modern Orthodox community, his approach was sharply criticized by his rabbinic colleagues as too lenient. The practical result was that many refused to officiate at the subsequent weddings of women who had been freed by the rabbi's bet din.
Rabbi Rackman died in 2008.
Some observers believe the new effort may be more successful for reasons both halachic and political, with Rabbi Goldberg, the Israeli posek, as the key to both elements — a top halachic authority connected to the haredi community.
In Blu Greenberg's talk on Sunday (full disclosure: it was sponsored by my wife — a member of JOFA — and me, though we had no knowledge of what she would discuss), the JOFA founder described how the bet din came to be. She said it was the outcome of an Agunah Summit held this summer, which sought to widen the issue from a narrow religious one to one of social justice and human rights. The clear goal was to find a “systemic solution” to agunot based on halachic sources and precedents. And that led to the formation of the new bet din.
In addition to kiddushei ta'ot, Greenberg said that several other halachic solutions that have been used historically by prominent rabbis, going back centuries, are under consideration. They include hafka'at kiddushin, permitting an annulment under extreme circumstances of a husband's refusal to grant the divorce, and giving a bet din the right to force a recalcitrant husband, even physically, until he willingly gives his wife a get, a divorce. (The latter solution, which combines coercion and free will, has led to headline-grabbing cases of hired thugs beating men up or threatening them until they agree to give the get.)
Rabbi Krauss said that while he could not guarantee, on principle, that every agunah who approaches the bet din would be freed, he believes that in practice, “99.9 percent” could be.
He implied that he may follow some of the practices and interpretation of Sephardic sages, which have resulted in far fewer cases of agunot.
“I won't make a joke of this,” he said, noting that his bet din would take each case on its merits. He said he has told the rabbis who endorsed his efforts that he would never issue a divorce where subsequently they would be uncomfortable officiating at the wife's next wedding.
The Rabbinical Council of America, which is affiliated with the Bet Din of America, for whom the planned court is a potential competitor, responded cautiously for now.
While noting that Rabbi Krauss is “a respected member of the RCA and Talmid chacham [scholar]” and that the issue is important, Rabbi Mark Dratch, executive director of the rabbinic body, said, “we don't know enough about the situation.” He added: “In any halachic matter, it's not just the rabbinic personalities at issue but the reasoning behind it.”
Elaborating on the work of the planned bet din, Rabbi Krauss said its work would be timely, avoiding long delays, and that while there would be standard legal fees, no woman would be turned away for lack of ability to pay. He said the bet din would call on mental health professionals for their expertise; incorporate input from women and divorce mediators; have an ombudsman; be transparent in recording its findings (but without names of the couples); pay the judges salaries comparable to Israeli judges; support pre-nuptial agreements; and also handle divorce cases that did not involve agunot.
Greenberg, emphasizing the independence of this enterprise, said that while JOFA supports the planned bet din, the women's group was not a sponsor, and that funds were being sought to support the new bet din from foundations and others.
“Our goal,” she said, “is to free agunot and self-destruct,” meaning to put an end to the need for rabbinic courts adjudicating agunah cases.

Dr Rajan says economic fundamentals do not justify the selloff in emerging markets
Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said that "we are in a world of make believe," and wondered "what exactly are the fundamentals?"Acknowledging that we may now be experiencing the darker side of the massive monetary stimulus of past years, Dr Rajan said, "With many central banks with their foots firmly pressed on the accelerator, the variety of new aggressive monetary policies, it's not clear that we've really benefited tremendously.""To some extent we may have reduced the room for other policies or reduced the incentives for other policies. We're not quite sure what the fundamental value of any asset is." ( Read "And I would suspect that this is probably what is going on today, that as there is some anticipation that central banks will start reducing the accommodation, asset prices are trying to find the appropriate level."His comments came on a day when markets across the globe tumbled amid a sharp selloff. The Sensex crashed below 24,000 levels to a 20-month low, while the rupee slipped past 68/dollar for the first time since September 2013, when Dr Rajan took charge of the RBI. ( Read Rejecting the suggestion that emerging markets such as India were falling due to weakness in their economies, Dr Rajan said, "I think it is markets' problem and the market problem can hit the real economy too".Asked if the fundamentals justify the decline in markets worldwide, he said, "Broadly, no.""Of course, it's hard to tell what the right levels for asset prices are, but is there something that changed dramatically over the last few weeks that would say the world economy is heading downwards? I don't think so. In fact, there is a fair amount of sense that, yes, we're trudging along more slowly than we should, but it's not the abyss that we're looking at," he said. ( Read Stating that there were lots of things happening on the ground in India, he said, "Things are moving, actions are being taken.""I think if we persist in this, and I have no doubt that we will, this will amount to something much bigger. My sense is we are something like we were in 2001-02, when we did a lot of work but didn't show up in the growth numbers." "We were laying the stage, and after that we had ten years of very strong growth. So my hope and my expectation is that, (and) that is what we are doing now. A lot of little, little reforms that combine together to make a big reform," he said.
Get caught running a red on your bicycle and you risk demerit points on your driver's licence,
Yup, you read that right — it's not supposed to happen but it does. Demerit points have been registered against law-breaking cyclists in Toronto, which can then affect driving status and insurance costs.
It appears there's a lot we don't know about the rules of the road for cyclists. Information is peddled everywhere when it comes to wearing a helmet, what to wear, where to shop, how to lock your bike, and where to ride, but few of us know that any ticket a driver can get under the Ontario's Highway Traffic Act, a cyclist can get too. Break the road rules and risk getting pulled over and fined, says Anne Marie Thomas, insurance expert with Kanetix.ca.
So think twice before barreling through a stop sign. And stay off the sidewalk. The Ministry of Transportation actually keeps track of cycling offences — even if you don't have a driver's licence.
Pulled over by the police — now what?
If you're pulled over, you are obliged by law to identify yourself and cooperate. “It's a common thought — if I'm on my bike, can't I just tell them I'm not carrying my license? Wrong. You need to be truthful, whether you have your licence on you or not,” says Thomas. “If you don't give your real name and address, you risk escalating things — meaning you could face an arrest, a $110 fine or both.”
Demerit point dilemma
There's a lot of conflicting information on whether a cycling infraction impacts your driving record. For the record, if you get a ticket while riding your bike, you're not supposed to get demerit points on your Ontario driver's license. Make sure the ticket notes it as a cycling infraction at the time that it is written. Be sure you know what you are getting a ticket for and what is being included on that ticket, says Thomas. “Write down what happened as soon as possible after receiving your ticket – location, direction of travel, what happened, etc. Sign and date it. If there are any witnesses get their contact information, ask them to make a signed and dated statement of what they saw.”
Nothing fine about this
• Count on an $85 fine for disobeying a stop sign or failing to signal when turning.
• No proper lighting and riding without a bell can also get you an $85 ticket.
• Running a red light – a $260 ticket.
• Ride your bicycle on a sidewalk and that'll be $60 – that's if you live in Toronto, and you are age 14 and older.
• Carrying a passenger on a bike designed for one – $85 fine.
• Pass a stopped school bus with red lights flashing and that can cost you a whopping $400.
• Under 18 without a helmet – $60 ticket.
• Riding on the wrong side of the road – a $35 fine.
Ignore it and it won't go away
A cycling ticket may seem inconsequential but the amount due would increase the longer the ticket goes unpaid. Plus “if a cyclist hasn't made sure that the ticket they received states ‘cycling' on it, then they risk having their drivers licence suspended if they don't pay the fine,” says Thomas. Like any other outstanding payment, it's possible that it could end up in collections and may impact your credit rating.
Smooth ride on an e-bike
You don't need a driver's licence, vehicle permit or licence plate to ride an e-bike, but you do need to be 16 or older, wear an approved bicycle or motorcycle helmet, and keep your e-bike in good working order. Follow the same rules of the road as regular cyclists, and penalties are the same as a non-electric bike.
A Royal Flush - an ace, king, queen, jack, and ten all in the same suit. The hand of the highest possible value in a game of poker. The aptly named Royal Flush tournament this weekend will indeed also contain the best, the 'creme de la creme.' But rather than poker, players at Tropicana Atlantic City will be competing in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Wii U for a juicy combined 10K pot bonus.
Summer is coming. And if you follow the Smash scene, you know that summer is the time of year where the largest and most prestigious tournaments take place. Events on its cusp will likewise grant attendees an opportunity to kick off the new season with gargantuan momentum. Royal Flush this weekend is one such tournament, and professional players will be fighting tooth-and-nail as they try to assert their dominance.

Aces
On the Melee side of things, titans such as Adam "Armada" Lindgren, Juan "Hungrybox" DeBiedma, and Joseph "Mang0" Marquez will be duking it out for first place. Equally skilled players on the Smash Wii U side include uncontested number one player Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios, Elliot Bastien "Ally" Carroza-Oyarce, Samuel "Dabuz" Buzby, and Nairoby "Nairo" Quezada, among others.
Armada has placed first at every major tournament since early October. Tournaments like Genesis 4, Dreamhack Winter 2016, Smash Summit Spring 2017, and more, have been his domain. He's the strong favorite to win unless Hungrybox and Mang0 can figure out how to dethrone the current ace. For Smash 4, ZeRo is almost unanimously favored to take the cake given his ten-tournament victory streak and overall consistency. It's safe to say that both Armada and ZeRo have the hot hands right now, but that's not to say that there aren't competitors of similar caliber who won't take their shot.
Mang0 vs Mang0
Mang0 is a phenomenal Melee player. When he's feeling himself, he has the potential to beat anybody and everybody, even number one ranked Armada. But when he's not, he's... not. As of recently, he has placed relatively low, occupying spots such as 9th, 13th, and 7th at national tournaments.
Subsequently, there's been talk of 'The Kid' falling off recently, and maybe his placings show this. But Mang0 has been through lulls in his career before only to quickly snap out of them and place well again. That's just the player Mang0 is. Besides Hungrybox, Mang0 has the best chance of ripping first place from the favorite to win, Armada. Will we see him break his three-month dry spell this weekend? Interestingly enough, he hasn't dropped a tournament on Mother's Day for the past three years. Only time will tell if his streak is indefinite or not.
Kings and queens
Jason “ANTi” Bates' entrance at the CEO 2016 arena was quite the spectacle as he began flinging money at the fans. Provided by Robert Paul
In poker, maybe kings and queens can't beat Aces. But in Smash Bros., it's entirely possible. In fact, those on the edge of the Melee big three pose one of the biggest threat to them. William 'Leffen' Hjelte and Zack 'SFAT' Cordoni, both skilled Fox specialists, seek to finally break through the mold and defeat their higher-ranked demons. They will want to use a new strategy against them and others considering their respective 7th and 9th placings at Dreamhack Austin earlier in late-April.
Placing second at the very same tournament was Daniel "ChuDat" Rodriguez, who, after taking down both Mang0 and Mew2King, has shown the world his ability to slay gods and take names. Falcon main Justin "Wizzrobe" Hallot is on a similar boat after placing an impressive 5th at Dreamhack.
On the opposite side of the spectrum, the story is not so different. There are so many fierce players on the Wii U that we can expect some unforeseen upsets and wonky placings all across the board. Coming hot off second place finish at CEO Dreamland after a close 3-2 set against ZeRo, Ramin "Mr. R" Delshad is seeking to put the final nail in the coffin of the Chilean beast.
In late March, Samuel "Dabuz" Buzby" won 2GGC: Civil War, widely considered to be one of the most notable and difficult Smash 4 events of all time. With such a momentous victory, Dabuz has proved himself more than capable of taking a tournament with all of the toughest talent present.
Jason "ANTi" Bates, James "VoiD" Tyson are also top-ten ranked contenders whose recent decent placings are nothing to trifle with.
A real royal flush
The real kicker for the Smash 4 storyline this weekend -- beating ZeRo. The Diddy main from Chile hasn't dropped a single tournament since late March. And if everything pans out how it should, he could be adding another title under his belt. If past Wii U tournaments tell us anything, though, it's that things rarely go as expected.
There are five players who have the best chance at taking down ZeRo: Ally, Nairo, Mr. R, ANTi, and Dabuz. All five have the capacity to defeat him -- but to get there, they'll inevitably run into each other. That's where we expect to see the most chaos.
Nairo can consistently beat his fellow top five players, but cannot do the same against ZeRo. ANTi has been placing shaky lately but has the same 'make-or-break' factor Mang0 has, and so is nowhere near out of the picture.
Ally poses the biggest threat to ZeRo this weekend, having sent him to losers last week at Dreamhack and having shown to be able to consistently beat him in the past. Mr.R is a close second, and Dabuz also has a solid chance if he's playing like he did at Civil War. All in all, the competition is so dense and talented that trying to make predictions is near impossible.
The trading floor of the stock exchange in Frankfurt. MICHAEL PROBST AP/Press Association Images LONDON - Germany's financial centre, Frankfurt, is set to grab a huge chunk of the City of London's business post-Brexit, aided by themerger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.
According to a research paper commissioned by Deutsche Boerse, and published by Professor Dirk Schiereck of the Technische Universität in the German city of Darmstadt, Brexit "will make Frankfurt the clear European centre for financial market regulation and simultaneously, Frankfurt might indeed become the European centre for supranational risk management."
Frankfurt could steal billions of pounds worth of business as a result of the merger, which may allow Deutsche Boerse to move significant portions of the LSE's derivatives trading from the UK to Germany.
"Deutsche Börse has a good chance of winning significant long-term market share in the areas of interest rate and currency trading and relocating trading from London to Frankfurt if the market participants in London are given unrestricted access to superior trading platforms in Frankfurt," Schiereck writes in the paper, titled "Why the merger between Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange will strengthen Frankfurt as a financial centre."
Schiereck's paper cites the example of Bund trading in the 1990s as reason to believe trading can move from London to Frankfurt. "The migration of Bund futures trading from London to Frankfurt in the 1990s can serve as an example here," he writes.
The paper is just the latest in a series of threats to the City's role at the heart of European financial markets. Almost all major banks are thought to be considering moving jobs away from London after the Brexit process formally begins, with HSBC's chairman Douglas Flint saying last week:
"We would take pre-emptive action in order to ensure that we have the capacity in place in order to be able to continue to deliver what we deliver today from a different set of arrangements."
The bank currently expects to move roughly 1,000 jobs to "France, or indeed to Ireland or Holland or any other place within Europe that we have operations."
Financial centres across Europe are battling it out to take business from London, with Frankfurt and Paris currently seen to be in poll position. French lobbyists have made frequent trips to London to meet with business leaders and market participants in recent months.
There are two big areas of concern when it comes to London's role at the heart of European finance — financial passporting, and the clearing of euro-denominated trades in the City.
Current EU law allows European banks to operate branches in the UK that do not need to be separately capitalised from the parent company abroad. Similarly, non-EU banks, such as those from the US or Asia, can use their London subsidiary to sell services to clients across the EU. This has allowed London's financial centre to act as a hub for global firms looking to do business in the EU.
The use of this bank "passport," which allows banks in London to access the EU single market of 28 nations (including the UK), could be one of the rights the UK loses in the British exit from the EU.
It is now looking increasingly likely that the UK could lose the passport should Britain opt for hard Brexit, although over the weekend a story in The Guardian suggested that the one of the EU's most important Brexit negotiators, Michel Barnier, wants a "special" relationship with the City of London after Britain has left the bloc.

One More Time: Here Are 4.6 Billion Reasons to Support Bike Infrastructure
Cyclists may only account for 1 percent of all trips taken in the U.S., but that's still good enough to save the American people a total of $4.6 billion per year, according to research recently released by the League of American Bicyclists, the Sierra Club, and the National Council of La Raza. The announcement coincided with National Bike to Work Day, observed last Friday as part of Bike Month.
It gets even better, as a recent article in Forbes pointed out:
The average annual operating cost of a bicycle is $308, compared to $8,220 for the average car, and if American drivers replaced just one four-mile car trip with a bike each week for the entire year, it would save more than two billion gallons of gas, for a total savings of $7.3 billion a year, based on $4 a gallon for gas.
The Forbes story made it into our headline stack on Monday, but as congressional Republicans seem poised to make another run at eliminating the Transportation Enhancements program (a major source of funds for bike infrastructure), the numbers bear repeating.
Especially these numbers: Biking and walking put together make up 12 percent of trips, but bike-ped funding accounts for less than two percent of transportation spending. Furthermore, though the U.S. had 40 percent more bicycle commuters in 2010 than in 2000, efforts persist to gut what few bike-ped programs remain in favor of increased highway spending.
And yet, here's a list of bicycling facts that have emerged (or re-emerged) in recent research:
Bike path and trail projects create more jobs per million dollars spent than highway projects.
Building bike paths and trails encourages more people to ride more often.
Cycling is not a purely urban phenomenon.
Add to that the knowledge that transportation is overtaking housing as the single largest household expenditure in America, especially among low-income households, and it should be a no-brainer: Funding bike-ped infrastructure is a bargain.
That's what makes it so hard to take seriously the argument, trotted out repeatedly by the likes of apparent heir to the T&I chair Bill Shuster, that programs like TE or Safe Routes to School don't have a sufficient federal interest to be included in the surface transportation reauthorization bill. As far as I can tell, investing in cycling serves at least three different federal interests: Controlling health care costs (by promoting good health), reducing the deficit (by ensuring that federal investment generates the maximum economic activity possible), and reducing dependence on oil imports (duh).
If it's not a federal concern, then whose is it? Is it local communities, who would be given more control over bike-ped funding under new rules proposed in the Senate's two-year transportation bill? Apparently not, since those very same rules are the ones some House Republicans find objectionable.
Why else oppose federal investment in bicycle infrastructure — because the founding fathers had never heard of bicycles? (That sure doesn't bode well for the Federal Aviation Administration.) Back at the TRB Annual Meeting in January, Shuster pointed to the post roads clause in Article I of the U.S. Constitution as the justification for a tradition of federal surface transportation spending that dates back to the Cumberland Road (1806) and the Gallatin Plan (1808).
However, the irony seems lost on Shuster that at its inception, the Cumberland Road (now U.S. Highway 40) was almost literally a road to nowhere, and that all transportation was at that point non-motorized. Couldn't one argue that the true “strict constructionist” approach would be for the federal government to only support non-motorized travel?
Whatever their reasoning, opponents of bike/ped funding — vested though they may be in the status quo — probably can't hold up forever against the cold, hard cash that stands to be saved by millions of Americans deciding to ride a bike.
Alexis Ohanian, one of the co-founders of the self-described "front page of the internet," Reddit, will speak at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst this weekend. He will discuss online entrepreneurship, and his new book, "Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed."
In a video uploaded to YouTube, Ohanian spoke to the UMass community. "It seems I'm going to be attending your beautiful, concrete campus in the very near future on my 'Without Their Permission' book tour."
Ohanian's life path is one that often appeals to college students. During his senior year studying history at the University of Virginia, Ohanian attended a lecture by venture capitalist Paul Graham on “How To Start a Start-up,” according to a profile by Financial Times. Soon after, 22-year-old Ohanian and friend Steve Huffman convinced Graham's firm Y Combinator to provide the pair with funds to start Reddit.
Now, less than nine years after it was started, 55 million people across the world visit the site every month. Active users, known as Redditors, submit links or ask questions. The site is broken into "subreddits" narrowed down by location, such as Massachusetts, or topics including humor. A popular category known as Ask Me Anything has allowed Redditors to ask musicians, CEOs and even the President of the United States frank questions.
Through this online community, Ohanian organized his 100-stop college book tour to promote his new book that was released in October.
While the tour is inspired by his book, Ohanian told the Financial Times he has no plans to simply read from his book. “People can get the audio book if they want to hear that. I'm going to sit down with an alum from that university who's done something cool online. Whether it's a company, a successful Kickstarter campaign, who knows? Hopefully, my story can be inspirational.”
For the Amherst event, Ohanian will sit down with UMass alumnus Steve King, one of the first 15 Facebook employees. According to his CrunchBase profile, while at Facebook "he directed Media Sales in several key verticals and was responsible for landing landmark relationships such as Panasonic and Microsoft that paved the way to unprecedented revenue and market share growth."
Of the discussion, Ohanian said he's going to bring the class he wishes he could have attending in college; on internet entrepreneurship. "What I'm most interested in doing is making sure everyone of you knows what kind of power there is online for you to take your ideas to the world."
He added, "You don't have to be a startup founder; you can be a philanthropist, a comedian, a singer. This internet thing is not a fad. It's sticking around and it's changing the world and I want to make sure you all have the blueprint."
The discussion will be held Sunday, Feb. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Commonwealth Honors College Events Hall on the UMass Amherst campus. The event is free, though organizers request attendees register here.
Wrapping up his video attendance pitch, Ohanian speaks to UMass students, asks attendees to bring friends along. "I want this to be better attended than one of your football games."

Allison Wohl is executive director of the Association of People Supporting Employment First, which advocates for employment and career opportunities for people with disabilities.
The American Health Care Act scares me. I'm scared for all Americans with disabilities. I'm scared for my family. And I'm particularly scared for my son, who has Down syndrome, because it would take away many of the supports he needs to live his life as a free and independent American citizen.
This month, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) wrote an op-ed for The Post explaining why she voted for the AHCA. McMorris Rodgers and I have a lot in common. We both have young sons with Down syndrome, and we both are involved in policy issues affecting them — she as a member of Congress, where she is chair of the House Republican Conference, and me as an advocate for full inclusion of Americans with disabilities. I have worked with her and her office for several years on issues that will affect our boys. To be sure, she wants very much to improve services for people with disabilities.
Where we diverge is on the AHCA. She says it is a good policy for her son. But it scares me to death.
Given the bill's many other controversial provisions, few in Congress or the media talk much about how the AHCA would cut Medicaid by $839 billion over 10 years.
The bill proposes to place new per-capita caps on Medicaid funding, a structure that over time would have a huge impact on service providers and families. At first blush, this approach might seem reasonable, even fiscally responsible. But consider this scenario: One of my closest friends has a brother in his late 30s with Down syndrome. His life is the very life that I want someday for my own son. He works full time at a job he loves, lives independently, and participates in his local theater and synagogue. He has a long-term girlfriend and is a beloved member of his community. The Medicaid services that he receives support him in his independence. Those services help him to budget and pay bills, shop for groceries and cook, use transportation and succeed at his job. Because of Medicaid, he is a taxpayer, a consumer and a good neighbor.
Currently, those who qualify for Medicaid and a certain level of support can receive such services through a state home and community-based services program (HCBS). The alternative is a nursing home or institution — for decades, the only option for families like mine — which too often have been places of abuse, neglect and segregation.
Stripping almost a trillion dollars from Medicaid would decimate services such as those my friend's brother receives. Without that money, people with disabilities will go without employment supports, durable medical equipment, personal care attendants, transportation and case-management services. More important, they will not have the liberty and independence they deserve.
How do I know that these services will be cut? Because, under Medicaid law, they are optional. Faced with such a huge funding reduction, states will face impossible decisions, and they can be expected to choose to cut anything not required — denying help to people who desperately need it.
For many disabled Americans, HCBS programs are not “optional”; they are a matter of life or death. People have fought for a generation to receive services in their homes rather than institutions. Without help, many will face a choice between going without and living in an institution. For those who rely on HCBS assistance to bathe, dress and eat, employment may no longer possible. Their roles as taxpayers, and consumers, will cease, and they will become reliant on — substantially more expensive and isolating — government benefits for their survival.
HCBS services are not available outside of Medicaid. There is no private, market-based health insurance product to cover for the needed services for my friend's brother or, eventually, my son. Over a lifetime, those supports cost an estimated $2 million to $3 million, enough to bankrupt even affluent families.
So this is what scares me: that my son, and all disabled children, who have such potential, will not have what they need to flourish in adulthood because a bill gutting today's health-care supports becomes law. McMorris Rodgers and I dream of the same thing for our children — a happy, fulfilling life. If it passes, the American Health Care Act will make it virtually impossible for them to fulfill that dream.
World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers criticises laws which could result in journalists being jailed for 10 years
The world's leading newspaper body, representing more than 18,000 publications in 120 countries, has singled out Australia's national security laws as a “threat to the future of journalism” and called on Tony Abbott to protect press freedom more effectively.
The board of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers has called on the Abbott government to revise the first tranche of national security laws, which criminalise reporting or disclosure of “special intelligence operations” and could result in journalists being jailed for up to 10 years.
The resolution on Sunday was one of only three made during the world publishing expo in Amsterdam, along with a statement about protecting journalists in conflict zones and a call for Venezuela to end limits on imported newsprint.
The statement raises particular concern about the “unprecedented” powers that grant the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) access to computer networks, as well as the offences for reporting on special intelligence operations.
The statement says the legislation “poses a real threat to the future of journalism, reducing the media's ability to report on matters of public interest and fulfil its important institutional role in maintaining public accountability and scrutiny”.
It calls on the prime minister “to seek further advice and consultation to better protect the work of journalists, to listen to the numerous concerns of media professionals, academics and civil society organisations, and to ensure media freedoms are fully guaranteed before the law is enforced.”
World press freedom organisations have roundly condemned the laws as unnecessary restrictions.
On Sunday, senior Labor figure Anthony Albanese broke ranks on the laws – which the Labor party supported in parliament in September – and described the restrictions on journalists as “draconian”.
What do we gain? Hmm. The status of singletons is that of awkward but currently necessary workaround, and the sooner we can do away with them, the better.
Let me see if I can clarify the picture. We have a data type Nat :
data Nat = Zero | Suc Nat
(wars have been started over even more trivial issues than the number of 'c's in Suc )
The type Nat has run-time values which are indistinguishable at the type level. The Haskell type system currently has the replacement property, which means that in any well typed program, you may replace any well typed subexpression by an alternative subexpression with the same scope and type, and the program will continue to be well typed. For example, you can rewrite every occurrence of
if <b> then <t> else <e>
to
if <b> then <e> else <t>
and you can be sure that nothing will go wrong...with the outcome of checking your program's type.
The replacement property is an embarrassment. It's clear proof that your type system gives up at the very moment that meaning starts to matter.
Now, by being a data type for run-time values, Nat also becomes a type of type-level values 'Zero and 'Suc . The latter live only in Haskell's type language and have no run-time presence at all. Please note that although 'Zero and 'Suc exist at the type level, it is unhelpful to refer to them as "types" and the people who currently do that should desist. They do not have type * and can thus not classify values which is what types worthy of the name do.
There is no direct means of exchange between run-time and type-level Nat s, which can be a nuisance. The paradigmatic example concerns a key operation on vectors:
data Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where VNil :: Vec 'Zero x VCons :: x -> Vec n x -> Vec ('Suc n) x
We might like to compute a vector of copies of a given element (perhaps as part of an Applicative instance). It might look like a good idea to give the type
vec :: forall (n :: Nat) (x :: *). x -> Vec n x
but can that possibly work? In order to make n copies of something, we need to know n at run time: a program has to decide whether to deploy VNil and stop or to deploy VCons and keep going, and it needs some data to do that. A good clue is the forall quantifier, which is parametric: it indicates thats the quantified information is available only to types and is erased by run time.
Haskell currently enforces an entirely spurious coincidence between dependent quantification (what forall does) and erasure for run time. It does not support a dependent but not erased quantifier, which we often call pi . The type and implementation of vec should be something like
vec :: pi (n :: Nat) -> forall (x :: *). Vec n x vec 'Zero x = VNil vec ('Suc n) x = VCons x (vec n x)
where arguments in pi -positions are written in the type language, but the data are available at run time.
So what do we do instead? We use singletons to capture indirectly what it means to be a run-time copy of type-level data.
data SNat :: Nat -> * where SZero :: SNat Zero SSuc :: SNat n -> SNat (Suc n)
Now, SZero and SSuc make run-time data. SNat is not isomorphic to Nat : the former has type Nat -> * , while the latter has type * , so it is a type error to try to make them isomorphic. There are many run-time values in Nat , and the type system does not distinguish them; there is exactly one run-time value (worth speaking of) in each different SNat n , so the fact that the type system cannot distinguish them is beside the point. The point is that each SNat n is a different type for each different n , and that GADT pattern matching (where a pattern can be of a more specific instance of the GADT type it is known to be matching) can refine our knowledge of n .
We may now write
vec :: forall (n :: Nat). SNat n -> forall (x :: *). x -> Vec n x vec SZero x = VNil vec (SSuc n) x = VCons x (vec n x)
Singletons allow us to bridge the gap between run time and type-level data, by exploiting the only form of run-time analysis that allows the refinement of type information. It's quite sensible to wonder if they're really necessary, and they presently are, only because that gap has not yet been eliminated.
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, evidence began to emerge of failed attempts by the Iraqi government to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution.

Saddam's attempts [ edit ]
In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, Gen. Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former CIA counterterrorism head Vincent Cannistraro, stating that Saddam "knew there was a campaign to link him to September 11 and prove he had weapons of mass destruction." Cannistraro further added that "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all "killed" by the Bush administration because they allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in power - an outcome viewed as unacceptable.[1]
Shortly after, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's national security advisor, Osama El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda.[2] Iraq also attempted to reach the US through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services. Nothing came of the attempts.[3]
Imad Hage [ edit ]
In January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the DoD's Office of Special Plans. Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the War on Terrorism. He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary. Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with Richard Perle, head of the Defense Policy Board.
In February 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence's foreign operations, Hassan al-Obeidi. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad didn't understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs; he then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to ascertain this. He additionally offered oil concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.
Later that month, Hage met with Gen. Habbush in addition to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He was offered top priority to US firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, US inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give "full support for any US plan" in the Arab-Israeli peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking US officials. On February 19, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jamie Duran. The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan.
On February 21, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded "Mike, working this. Keep this close hold.". On March 7, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle's response was "that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go"). Perle told the Times, "The message was 'Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad."[4]
Throughout March, Hage continued to pass messages from Iraqi officials to Maloof. At one point, Maloof wrote a memo stating "Hage quoted Obeidi as saying this is the last window or channel through which this message has gone to the United States. He characterized the tone of Dr. Obeidi as begging." Maloof contacted Perle, stating that Iraqi officials are "prepared to meet with you in Beirut, and as soon as possible, concerning 'unconditional terms' ", and that "Such a meeting has Saddam Hussein's clearance." No action was taken.
According to an Arab source of the Guardian, Perle sent a Saudi official the following terms for Iraq to fulfill to prevent war: "Saddam's abdication and departure, first to a US military base for interrogation and then into supervised exile, a surrender of Iraqi troops, and the admission that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
Hage has since become embroiled in a situation involving an earlier incident involving airport security that many have viewed as payback similar to the case of Valerie Plame.[5]
Exile proposal [ edit ]
It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.[6] On February 22, at a meeting in Crawford, Texas, George Bush told Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar:
"The Egyptians are speaking to Saddam Hussein. It seems he's indicated he would be prepared to go into exile if he's allowed to take $1 billion and all the information he wants about weapons of mass destruction."[6]
The same month Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his representative, former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, to Saddam Hussein. Primakov's mission was to convince Saddam to abdicate as Iraqi president, which could prevent US invasion of Iraq. The debates failed, though. "Saddam just tapped me on the shoulder and went out of the room", Primakov recalled.[7]
In late October 2005, the son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (the late president of the United Arab Emirates) stated that Saddam Hussein had in fact accepted the offer of exile in that country. Under the deal, Saddam and his family would have fled, been granted immunity from prosecution, and elections would have been held in Iraq within six months under UN and Arab League auspices. However, according to him, the Arab League did not bring up the issue at their emergency summit, citing rules preventing interference in the affairs of their member states, thus preventing it from being accepted. Anonymous officials in the UAE have confirmed the report.[8]
There was also speculation that Saddam would go into exile in Belarus.[9] After the invasion, there was concern that members of Hussein's regime were trying to flee to that country.[10]

Scramble! RAF warplanes are intercepting Russian nuclear bombers at least once a month
Streaking across the sky in front of a rising sun, the huge Russian jet heads towards Britain.
Capable of carrying nuclear weapons at supersonic speeds, it is a potential threat the RAF must tackle - and fast.
Tornado fighters are scrambled. They intercept the Blackjack bomber and shadow it until the Russian pilots turn for home.
Intercepted: A Tornado, bottom, shadows a Russian Blackjack bomber off the Outer Hebrides
But this is no isolated incident. Astonishingly, such high-stakes games of cat and mouse are being played out in the skies off Britain at least once a month.
State-of-the-art British warplanes have taken to the air 64 times since 2006 to head off Russian aircraft, figures reveal.
They are being scrambled to repel the 1,380mph Tu160 Blackjack and Tu95 Bear bombers.
The RAF's elite 'Quick Reaction Alert' force is being called into action following the Kremlin's growing tendency to flex its muscles and test Western response times to its increasingly aggressive incursions.
Tornado F3 fighters from 111 Squadrons based at RAF Leuchars in Fife and Typhoon F2s - also known as Eurofighters - from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire are on 24-hour standby.
The revelations come after the RAF was forced to axe the number of Tornado training flights in a bid to save £80,000 a month on fuel and other costs.
Defence chiefs admitted in March that RAF warplanes were scrambled no fewer than 20 times last year to warn off Russian bombers.
But the latest statistics, revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, uncover the true extent of Russian premier Vladimir Putin's sabre-rattling.
International experts believe the missions are an attempt by Russia to re-assert itself as a superpower after crippling budget cuts forced it to scrap the flights in the 1990s.
The supersonic Tu160, nicknamed the White Swan by its pilots, can carry up to 40tons of weapons including cruise or short-range nuclear missiles.
Mr Putin, himself a former Blackjack pilot, is suspected of ordering the training missions to the fringes of UK airspace.
Now the RAF has released a series of dramatic pictures taken by British airmen who tracked a Blackjack warplane for four hours as it snaked along the Outer Hebrides.
British fighter pilots intercepted the Russians in international airspace near Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis, and took photographs of the planes in the dawn light.
The two Tornados shadowed the bombers for hundreds of miles before they turned away.
An RAF spokesman said that the revival of the training runs was not seen as a threat.
But Matthew Clements, Eurasia analyst of Jane's Defence News, said: 'Although ostensibly these are for training purposes they also provide Russia with a symbolic show that it is able to project its power beyond its own borders.'
Defence aviation analyst Mike Gething said: 'Each side is doing what it's supposed to do: they're training.
'The Russians have got a bomber force that they need to train, and they like long flights to this part of the world.
'But make no mistake - when those aircraft meet one another each side is taking pictures and monitoring radio conversations, and other emissions, from each other's aircraft.
'It's an intelligence-gathering exercise as much as a training exercise.'
A spokesman for the Russian Embassy said: 'It's just training flights - nothing more than that.
'As any other country, Russia has the right to conduct patrol flights in the international airspace-strictly abiding by the corresponding international regulations.
'Russian strategic aircraft have never entered into sovereign UK airspace or that of other states.'
I have a laptop that I use on my home LAN, my work LAN and my work VPN via my home LAN through OpenConnect. In addition, I also sometimes use TorGuard, which is a OpenVPN connection. All of these are configured via NetworkManager in nm-applet.
If on my work LAN or work VPN, I must have the private DNS server and search domain because there are a number of servers that only resolve to hostnames within my network and have a standardized DNS suffix. This is set in the nm-applet settings for my work VPN and I have a separate ethernet connection profile for the work LAN.
I am in a situation where regardless of what network I am currently on, I find that at seemingly random but often times I am unable to resolve hostnames and lose my search domain suffix if on my work VPN/LAN.
To fix the problem, and this fix works every time, I have to manually perform a sudo service dnsmasq restart . This resets my DNS servers and search domain to what they are supposed to be and everything works correctly again, for a few minutes.
I keep having to restart the dnsmasq service to fix the domain resolution problem.
Using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in a Dell Latitude E6540. The ethernet controller is Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I217-LM (rev 04) and the wifi card Intel® Centrino® Advanced-N 6235.
I've been asked to provide my network devices. I highly doubt hardware is the problem here, but I will humor you. There is one network card and one wifi card. Both work perfectly with the exception of having to restart the dnsmasq service repeatedly to get DNS resolution working.
I sometimes use the wifi, the bluetooth does work but I don't use it for networking. I usually am using ethernet.
1 Moussa Sissoko wants to leave Newcastle
Hamburg have tabled a bid for wantaway Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko, according to reports in his native France.
Sissoko revealed last week that it would be his ‘dream' to join Arsenal this summer but the Gunners are not understood to be interested in the French international having already snapped up Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka.
Chelsea and Liverpool are also possible destinations for the 26-year-old as he vies to find top-flight football next season.
But, according to L'Equipe, Hamburg have offered Newcastle £9.5million for Sissoko and the Championship club are apparently seriously considering selling to the Bundesliga club.
Sissoko is one of the players Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez is keen on offloading this summer as he prepares his squad for life in the Championship.
The Frenchman joined Newcastle for a shade under £2m from Toulouse three years ago and has made over 100 appearances for the Tyneside club.
Two weeks ago, Deadline Hollywood announced that Anne Hathaway was going to star in the sci-fi thriller O2. Echo Lake will produce the film that IM Global will finance and CAA will represent domestic rights. The script is from newcomer Christie LeBlanc. The article mentioned that she was a single mother from Gatineau, Canada. The screenplay had been sent unsolicited to Echo Lake producers Adam Riback and James Engle. It impressed enough to make it on the 2016 Black List. I decided to reach out to my fellow Quebec writer and ask her how she made it all the way to Hollywood…
JF: What made you want to become a screenwriter?
CL: It was never a want. It's a need. I'm a story addict. I remember being a little kid, and this lady from down the street was yelling at my mom because I was giving her kid nightmares with the stories I made up… and I couldn't understand why that was a problem. Stories expanded my then very small world to infinity. Why would anyone not want to explore every nook and cranny, even the darkest of parts? And I never grew out of believing that.
That explains my story addiction, but why screenwriting in particular? I blame my brother Norm one hundred percent. He was older, and a rabid cinephile, and he'd drag his baby sister to way too many movies – sometimes the same ones over and over again. He was my first supplier. He got me hooked on the magic. And every scene I craft, every character I bring to life, every set up and reveal; they're all simply my desperate need to tap into this magic. And when I do, I need to keep it going, so I live it, breathe it, try to become one with it, and on a good day, shape it and create something cool.
Concerning your story addiction, did you try becoming a novelist?
CL: I tried, and I failed miserably. I have a few unfinished manuscripts buried deep in the bowels of my computer that will never see the light of day. I was young, and hadn't yet found my voice, so I fumbled around trying desperately to be the next Margaret Atwood, but unfortunately, everything that came out sounded more like a really bad Stephen King ripoff.
What pushed you to start TheSingleScreenwriter.com website?
CL: The website was my way to keep myself writing and focused on the industry, sharing my thoughts and observations as I tried to figure out the maze that is Hollywood. It was never meant to be anything more than that, but it did get a little bit of a following, so it morphed into a vehicle for me to give advice and/or to rant to fellow aspirants. We're not talking mind blowing revelations here. More along the lines of common courtesy and proofreading. Pretty basic stuff, but it's shocking how many writers ignore these business basics and undermine their careers before they even get out of the gate.
Did the website help you grow as a screenwriter?
CL: It absolutely helped me grow as a screenwriter because it shifted my focus from simply writing to looking at it as part of a larger industry. Writing is the easy part. Getting your work out there, making connections, finding representation, making sales, landing gigs – this stuff is the hard stuff, and if I hadn't spent time learning the ins and outs before I found some success, I wouldn't have been ready, and would have crashed and burned in spectacular fashion.
Did it help you make connections?
CL: It didn't open any Hollywood doors for me. I doubt it was big enough to even show up as a blip on anyone's radar. It did, however, connect me with some up and coming writers that became my peer group. And for a writer just starting out, a good peer group filled with writers you respect, whose opinions you trust – that's worth its weight in gold.
How did you manage to balance working and writing?
CL: Some days, not very well. But you do what you have to do. The way I see it, people can do only two things well at any given time. When you add more to that list, everything suffers. My kids always came first. Writing was a close second. Everything else barely scratched my priority list. We had to eat, but I freelanced so I controlled my schedule, and always made sure there was time for writing. That meant a lot of late nights, and a good deal of sacrifice. I haven't had a social life in years.
As a single mother, how did you even manage to find the time to write?
CL: It's amazing what you can get done huddled in the car in the middle of winter while your kids are at various activities. And did I mention no sleep? As I said, two things is the maximum a person can do well. My house is a disaster. And dating? I can't even remember what that is. But I'm lucky. I have an amazing family, and I know without their support, I wouldn't have been able to go after this crazy long-shot career.
Your last post on TheSingleScreenwriter.com was in 2015, what happened?
CL: That thing I mentioned about sacrifice? My poor little web site was a victim to that. Time is the most valuable resource I have, and any time not spent on my career is lost time.
How many completed screenplays had you written before O2?
CL: I have a few learner scripts tucked away, scripts I took through several drafts as I was learning the ins and outs of the craft. I would never call them finished though.
How long had you been working on O2 before sending it out?
CL: O2 wrote very fast. It poured right out of me. Two weeks to outline, then the first draft took just over a month. At that point I sent it out to a few trusted friends, then spent another two weeks rewriting. This was exceptional. My normal best is nowhere near that fast.
Had you been sending unsolicited material for a while?
CL: Mostly I was using contests to gauge how close my work was to being at the level it needed to be to make a leap to the pros. I tested the query waters with a previous script and got some reads, and wasn't at all sure O2 would attract any interest.
When did you decide to send your O2 script to Echo Lake?
CL: I finished O2 in June 2016, but I'm extremely obsessive. I spent a month researching reps, making a list of the ones who had set up similar projects, tracking down their contact information, and finding out everything I could about them. I then embarked on my query campaign, targeting the ones I most wanted to work with. Echo Lake responded with a read request, and I sent my baby out.
Were you surprised they responded?
CL: No. I write killer loglines, and I knew I had a good concept, so I knew I'd get some reads. I was, however, very surprised when they followed up with a meeting request. I don't think I ever sweat so much in my entire life.
For that meeting request, was it on the phone? Did you fly to LA?
CL: Remarkably, I have yet to step foot in LA. We Skyped for that initial meeting.
How much did they help you develop/polish O2?
CL: The development process on O2 with Echo Lake before sending it out to the town was surprisingly painless. Adam and James really believed in my vision. We aged the character up to attract an A list star and made a few other changes, but it was a really fun process.
How did it get on the 2016 Black List? and how much exposure did that give you?
CL: Echo Lake set me up with meetings at various agencies, and I signed with CAA. Between my new agents and my guys at Echo Lake, I think they must have gotten it to every executive in Hollywood. And it resonated with enough of them to land me on the 2016 Black List. I still haven't picked my jaw up off the floor over that. As to how much exposure it gave me? The words that come to mind are huge, life-changing, and epic, but those don't even come close to encapsulating the impact it has had on my life.
What's next?
CL: I'm currently juggling two scripts, and I'm very excited about them. I'm working on a cool studio project and am I fleshing out a dystopian sci-fi spec.
For our fellow screenwriting enthusiasts, we'll get down into the nitty-gritty details of writing. What's your brainstorming/story building process like?
CL: When it comes to brainstorming and story building, I'm a big believer in getting the hell out of my own way. I wade through thousands of mediocre, and sometime downright awful ideas, in order to find that rare flash of brilliance. I recognize it because it's the one that sets my soul on fire. I then brainstorm story directions, making copious notes on any and every idea that comes to me without judgment. That, for me, is the key. At this stage any and every idea is worth exploring because what seem like the best directions at the beginning, often end up only okay when explored, while the goofy, cringe-worthy ideas sometimes lead to mind blowing brilliance. If these sessions don't end in tears of laughter, I'm not doing it right.
I'm also a big believer in outlines, so I then take all the good stuff and switch on my critical brain. I take the raw ideas and flesh them out into a basic outline, being very critical at this stage to make sure it works as a whole story, but I keep my outlines to broad strokes, giving myself plenty of room when writing the first draft to get from point A to point B, and so on, using instinct and inspiration. For me, that initial bare-bones framework keeps me on track, but doesn't stifle the magic of discovery. It's an organized chaos.
At what pace do you write your first draft?
CL: I write my first drafts fast, making sure as I mentioned, to get the hell out of my own way. If I slow down at this stage, I switch from instinct to judgment, and second-guessing before it's fully formed means I stop taking risks. There's plenty of time for a critical eye during revisions, but if I do it too soon, I cut myself off at the knees and don't' truly expand the concept to its full potential. That's why I believe in taking the time to craft a solid outline. It keeps me on track and gives me a rough map to follow, but lets me take some detours and explore some cool ideas along the way.
How much do you rewrite?
CL: As much as it needs! Really, it depends on the project. I tend to do several revisions passes on my first drafts while wearing my critical hat, focusing on different elements each time (character, set-ups/pay-offs, beats, pacing, tone, etc.) but I still consider it my first draft. When I've taken it as far as I can without getting feedback, only then do I consider subsequent revisions second and third drafts, and so on. That familiar saying, ‘writing is rewriting', it's absolutely true.
What advice would you give to all amateur screenwriters?
CL: I feel ridiculous giving advice when just a few months ago I was reading pro advice myself! But I guess I could talk from my research as well as my limited experience. I think I'd have to say write 'til your fingers bleed. Then write some more. Read every script you can find, immerse yourself in film, be your own worst critic and biggest champion. Never stop taking risks, and most of all, trust your gut. At the end of the day, it's just you and the page. Your gut is what will separate you from everyone else.
Special thanks to Christie for answering all my questions. What a wonderful success story!
No release date is set for O2.
Ottawa is becoming a hub for stem cell research thanks to a collaborative approach that allows scientists to easily turn research into clinical trials, said scientists at a Stem Cell 101 forum held Tuesday evening at the Ottawa Hospital's Civic campus.
The city only has 25 stem cell scientists compared to Toronto's 115 but is on par with places like California, which spends billions of dollars in the field, according to the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine.
Lisa Willemse says it's really incredible to watch what's happening here in Ottawa. (CBC News)
"They're doing it right here. They're putting all the right pieces together to make Ottawa a real powerhouse in stem cell research," says Lisa Willemse, a senior communications advisor.
​Canada has long been considered a world leader in stem cell research — in part because the field was pioneered here in 1961, when Dr. James Till and Dr. Ernest McCulloch discovered the existence of stem cells at the Toronto-based Ontario Cancer Institute.
Stem cell research success
In Ottawa, researchers recently used stem cells to treat septic shock, and a study at the University of Ottawa found that duchenne muscular dystrophy affects stem cells.
Clinical trials are also underway in other areas including multiple sclerosis and heart attacks.
"Sometimes when science gets too big it becomes siloed," said Dr. Bill Stanford, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa.

Stanford was one of three physicians who spoke at a public forum Tuesday night.
It was the fourth and final in a series of similar events across the province that aimed to answer a series of questions for those who attended, including what kind of stem cell treatments are being developed and which ones are likely to be delivered in the future.
Dr. Harry Atkins, a physician at the Ottawa Hospital's blood and marrow transport program, calls the city a fertile ground for research.
"Things like muscle stem cells to repair problems with the muscles, or problems with the heart… I think that's going to be the next big thing that goes on in Ottawa," he said.
The following is an attempt to stomp out the seemingly endless FUD that circulates about Web Components, most of which is purely manufactured by attacking tangential, opinionated choices of frameworks that happen to use Web Components in a way that differs from the opinions of other frameworks.
Level Setting
Don't let me catch you claiming a Web Component is anything but the following, or I'll send Kam Chancellor to lay you out:
Web Components are an amalgam of APIs from two W3C specs (Custom Elements and Shadow DOM) that enable the creation of encapsulated, declarative, custom elements, which serve as standard, reusable, interoperable vehicles of discrete, stateless functionality.
Myth 1: “Web Components are at odds with Framework X”
This is probably the most fallacious statement about Web Components.
As long as a framework writes to the DOM (which all major ones do), there is no reason it can't include Web Components or update a Custom Element with data and state changes (as opposed to an amorphous tree of rando divs).
Let's say I have a single page React app that's a clock, where you select a timezone and the clock UI reflects the right time – here's what I would do:
Write the actual clock element as a Web Component. All this <x-clock> element needs to do is understand one attribute, for example data-zone , that specifies which timezone to display, and print out a clock UI showing the correct time. It shouldn't be aware of anything else about the app – this shit just tells time, yo. From here you can Reactify the living hell out of everything else (your route handling, how you save the state of the selected timezone, etc.) without ever having to hard-bind the <x-clock> element's definition code to a framework.
When you follow this pattern, you end up with elements of discrete functionality that can survive a change in framework, data/change management library, storage adapter, etc., and still develop your app with the framework or library of your choosing. Oh, and you also get to feel like a good Web Citizen, because that <x-clock> component you made is now available for use across the entire web, without requiring someone to have advanced programming experience or worship at the Church of Framework X.
Myth 2: “If I want to use Web Components, I have to use HTML Imports”
I'm not going to spend much time on this because it's so blatantly false.
HTML Imports is a proposed standard for importing an HTML document and its includes into a parent context. If you want to bundle your JS and CSS files into an HTML Import, go ahead, but Web Components are just JS and CSS files that have no dependency on how you include them in an app.
Myth 3: “Web Components require me to change my packaging system”
As previously stated: Web Components simply provide you two JS APIs (Custom Elements and Shadow DOM) with which you can define new elements and register them for use in your app. This means all a Web Component requires is a JS and CSS file; for multiple components you can concatenate them together, like you would any other includes (note: if you choose to write your CSS in JS, you obviously wouldn't need a CSS file)
Because this is just regular ol' JS and CSS, don't go chasing new packaging waterfalls on account of Web Components, you can stick to the packaging rivers and lakes that you're used to.
Myth 4: “Web Components aren't declarative”
This is perhaps the most mythstifying of all, given Web Components literally enable the end user to write declarative HTML markup extended with Custom Element tags. Frameworks like React (w/ JSX) are great if you prefer them, but in terms of categorization, something like JSX is a non-native, pseudo-declarative DSL with embedded logic hooks, vs the native, purely declarative markup of Custom Element tags written in regular ol' HTML.
Myth 5: “Web Components aren't compatible with JSX, they only accept string values!”
If you're using a DSL markup layer like JSX, there's no technical reason why a system like that can't interoperate with Web Components. A conversation on Twitter with various folks in the ecosystem prompted me to address this myth. During the conversation someone noted the basic flow of JSX to React imperative code and asked how it would look with a Web Component. Here's the pure JSX/React we started with:
// This JSX Markup: // Turns into this imperative React code: React.createElement(Foo, { bar: 1 }),
The question was how the above code would look if JSX was to support and interoperate with Web Components. The key requirement is any object type must be able to be passed to a Web Component. This isn't an issue, as Web Components (and HTML elements in general) natively support methods and getters/setters, in addition to attributes. This means that you could route any type of object to a Web Component from a JSX context as follows:

Up to 3.6 million customers in south-east England have been told to save water, because of a lack of rainfall.
Affinity Water, which supplies parts of the home counties, north London and Kent, says many rivers in the region are low on water.
It said that since July last year, the region had received just more than half of its average rainfall.
Farmers across the country have also been affected by low moisture levels.
Affinity has asked its customers to save water to minimise the possibility of restrictions - such as hosepipe bans - later in the summer.
Among the ideas being suggested are:
Stopping the use of sprinklers in the garden
Taking a four-minute shower instead of a bath
Turning off the tap while brushing teeth
Only running dishwashers and washing machines with a full load
Hosepipe bans have not been seen in the UK since 2012, when seven water companies introduced restrictions.
Farming impact
Farmers in the south-east and eastern England say they have had just 10% of the expected rainfall since the beginning of March.
Crops such as spring barley and sugar beet have been hit, because a lack of moisture in the ground has hindered germination.
The National Farmers Union said there was also concern about some fruit and vegetable farms.

The low rainfall has affected some livestock farmers as far north as the Midlands, where there has been a shortage of grass to feed beef and dairy herds.
A spokesman said it was too early to say whether agricultural production would be down, as that would depend on the weather over the next few weeks.
However, prices are unlikely to be affected, as they are determined by global markets.
Free devices
Concern appears to be restricted to areas of the South East. Thames Water, which supplies nine million households in the region, has no problems at the moment.
It draws its water from rivers and reservoirs, while Affinity relies on ground water.
But Water UK, which represents the industry, said everyone should consider using water carefully.
"Following a dry winter, some rivers, groundwaters and reservoirs are lower than normal for the time of year," a spokesperson said.
"We always advise that everyone use water wisely - especially during a period of dry weather - and to follow the advice of their water company should water saving measures be required."
Customers of Affinity Water are being offered some free devices, such as economical shower heads, devices to save water in toilets, and shower timers for children.

Manchester City are weighing up a £25million move for Everton's England ace Ross Barkley using Jack Rodwell as bait.
The champions are interested in attacking midfielder Barkley, 20, who excelled last season.
Barkley proved his pedigree while with England's World Cup squad, and started the final match of their group against Costa Rica.
City are aware they need to build up the number of ‘home grown' players after a summer clear-out that will see Gareth Barry, Joleon Lescott, Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and, possibly, James Milner leave.
City's unsettled former Everton midfielder Rodwell, 23, is keen to return to Goodison Park after becoming frustrated by a lack of first team opportunities, and that is something Barkley would need to consider.
He played a key role in Everton's fifth placed finish last season, making 38 appearances in all competitions.

Rodwell has several Premier League clubs eyeing him including also Sunderland and Newcastle and wants a move after only making seven league starts since joining City in August 2012 for £12m.
But Rodwell favours a permanent switch back to his local club Everton where he believes Roberto Martinez can revive his career.
City feel they may tempt Everton into selling prized asset Barkley if they throw Rodwell into the deal.
The media has been reporting on a recent meeting between presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) as evidence of Corker being screened for the job of vice president on Trump's ticket. Certainly a number of other Republican lawmakers jumped on the possibility with some enthusiasm, although Sen. Corker himself was typically politician-coy about the subject of the meeting afterward.
This latest speculation follows earlier chattering from weeks ago that Trump might be considering failed presidential candidate Marco Rubio as his running mate — which Rubio quickly quashed, saying he wasn't interested. Trump has also allegedly considered Scott Walker and John Kasich, Republican governors and, like Rubio, failed candidates this election season.
It's perhaps too early to take the Corker speculation any more seriously than the earlier hot air, but it is worth a quick comment or two. Corker, like Rubio, Walker, and Kasich, is part of the more-immigration-is-better camp. To pro-enforcement types such as myself, Corker's name is indelibly tied to the miserable, deceptive, and ultimately doomed Gang of Eight amnesty bills from a few years ago (see here, here, and here).
One wonders whether this latest duck-and-feint is something that came out of the meeting a few weeks ago between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who famously said he was not ready to support Trump with the flimsiest of prompting (speaking of politician-coy). This faux reticence seems to be the go-to ploy for Ryan, who used a similar tactic when protesting (much too loud methinks) that he didn't want, really didn't want, to be elected speaker when John Boehner was unseated. We're left to ask: Is Ryan trying to squeeze Trump into the "proper" mold before he gets the blessing of Republican elites at the upcoming convention by encouraging him to choose an acceptable open-borders running mate to take the edge off of Trump's earlier tough talk about immigration?
Ryan himself is notoriously open-borders minded, although like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and many other elites, how he lives and what he preaches for the rest of us are in stark contrast.
Many people in the pro-enforcement/less-immigration camp are understandably nervous Trump supporters. They're wondering whether he'll walk the walk, as well as talk the talk. They are not unaware of his own business flirtations with use of "H" visa workers at his Mar-a-Lago resort and elsewhere.
Right now, polls show him surging against Hillary Clinton (another "do what I say, not what I do" type, where immigration and lifestyles are concerned) in any head-to-head matchup. My guess is that could change in an instant and his support among key groups, including independents, would quickly fall away, if Trump falls into Ryan's trap in a foolish effort to lure establishment conservatives. It would be proof of the worst kind that he was simply pandering all along.
If, as the pundits suggest, the key issue for Americans voters is the economy, then let's hope that Trump and his advisers are smart enough to know that ordinary Americans do link their economic well-being to the ability to get and keep decent jobs, which inevitably leads us into the discussion of how to curb the overabundance of cheap foreign labor, legal or otherwise. There is just no escaping that connection.
So the question, vis-a-vis Trump vs. establishment conservatives such as Ryan, many of whom are squishy on the question of rolling back immigration, is: Will Mohammed go to the mountain or will the mountain come to Mohammed? And which is the mountain? The presidency hangs in the balance.
On the cover of the daily "Incident Action Plan" for the Station fire is an unusual warning: "No energy drinks."
Even though firefighters expend a tremendous amount of energy, officials said high levels of caffeine in many energy drinks can be dangerous.
"It's been a concern," said Nathan Judy of the U.S. Forest Service. "When they drink those things, it dehydrates them."
Judy said that during a previous fire some years back, a firefighter consumed four cans of Red Bull in one day and went into diabetic shock. Since then, fire officials have warned crews to re-energize in other ways, he said.
"Drink water, drink water, drink water," Judy said. He also said that the meals served to firefighters each day are high in calories because firefighters are "going through calories like crazy on the line."
Breakfast this morning at the Hansen Dam fire camp included scrambled eggs with cheese, sausage, hash browns and grits. Judy said lunches are hearty, sometimes consisting of two sandwiches, and that dinners often include lots of pasta, chicken and other meat.
Instead of energy drinks, officials ask firefighters to think about replacing salt, sugar, water and calories as a way to gain a boost. Posters bearing an outline of a slim, energy drink can with a big red strike through it are scattered around the camp.
Mark Whaling of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters do other things in preparation for work on wildfires as well. They include keeping their socks dry and sanding, oiling and reshaping the wooden ends of their hand tools so they are comfortable for long stretches of labor.
[Updated at 6:22 p.m.: Paul Yoffee, a spokesman for Red Bull, said there are no medical findings that connect someone drinking four cans of Red Bull and going into diabetic shock.
"There are no dangers or drawbacks associated with the consumption of Red Bull, and we are confident in the safety of our product.... We absolutely agree that people need to hydrate themselves, as Red Bull is a functional drink and not a thirst-quencher. Thus, individuals should make sure that they drink lots of water when engaging in physical activity and drinking Red Bull."]

— The Coast Guard is searching for an overdue French sailor who was last known to be in Beaufort, North Carolina.
The Coast Guard received a mayday call at 11:20 p.m. Sunday from Joseph Calland, 73, who is traveling about a 39-foot sailboat. Crews searched the waters in the area where the distress call originated Monday, but did not locate Calland.
At 7 a.m. Wednesday, Coast Guard officials received a tip that Calland was overdue for his arrival in New York City, which was his intended destination.
The Coast Guard search has encompassed 2,063 square miles as of Wednesday night.
Anybody with information about Calland's whereabouts is asked to call the 5th District Command Center at 757-398-6390.
Imagine what happens when electricity is cut off nationwide in a country of 160 million people. In Bangladesh, everyday life was brought to a standstill on Saturday as factories, hospitals, and homes plunged into darkness or had to rely on generators.
Even the prime minister's official residence was left with no electricity, as the small but extremely densely populated South Asian country experienced one of the worst blackouts in world's recent history.
“The national grid collapsed so the whole country lost power,” Reuters quoted Mohammad Saiful Islam, a director of the state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board, as saying. “Our repeated efforts to restore electricity across Bangladesh failed repeatedly.”
Local media reported that the blackout was caused by the failure of a transmission line transporting electricity from India. India's Power Grid Corp, however, said there were no problems on their side of the border.
“I can't run my shop without power and no one seems to care,” Mohammad Ripon, owner of a grocery store in the capital of Dhaka, told the agency. “It has been about eight hours now and still there is no word on when the power will come back.”
The airport and main hospital in Dhaka are running on emergency generators.
Garment factory owner Anwarul Alam Chowdhury said he was able to get 2-3 hours' worth of power out of his generator, but then had to halt the factory's output.
“This is a big slap for my business,” he said, explaining that many other factories were forced to shut down production as well.
Bangladesh's plunge into darkness provides a glimpse into a recently debunked hoax about NASA confirming six days of ‘total darkness' in December.
The hoax went viral on Twitter, leaving many people shocked and bewildered as to how the experience would feel.

The man accused of shooting six people, one of them fatally, in Mesa, Arizona, is a 41-year-old neo-Nazi skinhead named Ryan Elliot Giroux with a long prison record, police and human rights activists said Wednesday.
Giroux, whose identity Mesa police confirmed Wednesday night, has done several stretches in Arizona prisons for a variety of crimes, including assault, burglary and theft. He also racked up a list of violations while in prison. His last sentence ended in 2013, and he was released from parole supervision in October of last year, records show.
Mark Potok, editor of Hatewatch, a bulletin on hate crimes published by the Southern Poverty Law Center, reported that the many tattoos on Giroux's face and torso were associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Specifically, Potok wrote, the number 88 on his left temple is neo-Nazi code for "Heil Hitler," since H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.
Potok quoted a retired Mesa police detective who identified Giroux as a member of a skinhead group called Hammerskin Nation.
When the Coachella Valley Music Arts and Festival announced its 2017 lineup, New York punk trio Show Me the Body were surprised to find their name on the poster. They tweeted, “We never agreed to play Coachella. We were offered but we said no.” Now, the band has announced that they will play the festival in April after “Coachella amended their offer.” In a new tweet, they write that they “will play on day three at 4pm for 25 minutes.” In addition, they've said that they will play a pair of shows in Los Angeles prior to the festival: One will support homeless LGBT youth, and the other is “in support of California climate advocacy efforts.” Their compensation for the Coachella show, they added, will go to the same efforts. See Show Me the Body's tweets below.

One Gear, One Goal: Bike Is 'Good To 100 MPH,' Builder Says
What does it take to ride a bicycle at 100 miles per hour? That's the question being explored by Britain's Donhou Bicycles and frame builder Tom Donhou, who has mounted a mammoth chainring onto a custom bicycle. He says the steel machine has already hit 60 miles per hour on the open road.
Update At 3:30 p.m. ET: No Record At Stake. As our readers remind us, bicycles have previously reached 100 miles per hour. For instance, Jose Meiffret passed that mark in 1962, paced by a car on Germany's Autobahn. And in 1995, Dutch cyclist Fred Rompelberg reached 167 mph while using a top-fuel dragster to pace him at Bonneville Salt Flats.
While our original post didn't report that Donhou was trying to set a new world record, we've revised parts of the text to emphasize that it is his use of fairly common materials, on a hand-built bike, that captured our interest. Our original post continues:
The project began as a daydream, says Donhou, in notes accompanying the bike's display at the recent Bespoked Bristol show.
"Where I come from there's a lot of old air fields and air bases from the Second World War — long flat straight pieces of tarmac," he says. With an interest in land speed racing, he decided to build a fast bike, take it to an airstrip, "and see what kind of motorpaced speeds we could reach."
In motorpacing, a cyclist rides closely behind a lead vehicle, often a motorcycle, to benefit from the draft the motorcycle creates in its wake as it moves through the air. As a vintage Pathe newsreel video shows, the practice was once common in bicycle races held on outdoor tracks.
In contrast to the streamlined, low-lying recumbent bikes that have been clocked at more than 80 mph, Donhou's bike has more in common with millions of bicycles around the world: It's made of steel, and its frame geometry is based on a triangle.
But the similarities end there. To enforce an aerodynamic position, the bike's handlebars have been dropped down so low that the rider's hands are nearly on opposite sides of the front tire.
And at the heart of it all is a huge 104-tooth chainring, with a diameter of nearly 17 inches (for comparison, most road bikes have about 50 teeth in their largest ring). It was made by Royce, a British firm that engineers high-end bike parts — or in their words, "specialist cycle components using aerospace technology."
As Bike Radar's Oli Woodman, who spotted the beast of a bike in Bristol, says, "I certainly wouldn't want to try and turn that chainring myself!"
In his notes — which have the title "Good to 100 mph" — Donhou concludes that "what started as just a bit of fun started to get a lot more serious pretty quick and now we're gunning for a 100 mph" run.
He says the bike has been "tested to 60 mph on the road," and that it's stable at high speeds, thanks to the bike's design and the use of oval-shaped Columbus Max steel tubes, which help increase the frame's stiffness.
Donhou's dream of hitting 100 mph brings to mind American Charles Murphy, who faced ridicule when he promised to ride his bike at 60 mph. As his nickname — "Mile-A-Minute" Murphy — implies, Murphy reached that mark back in 1899.
A cyclist who lived in Brooklyn, Murphy accomplished his feat by drafting behind a Long Island Rail Road train — similar to Donhou's plan to "motorpace" his bike. Murphy rode on a 10-inch-wide stretch of wooden planking that had been specially built onto a three-mile section of flat railroad track. And it all started with a brash statement.
"I declared that I could follow a railroad train and that there was not a locomotive built which could get away from me," he recalled, according to a Sports Illustrated article written a few years after Murphy died in 1950. "I immediately became the laughing stock of the world."
But he was timed covering one mile at 57.8 seconds — and in one stretch that day, Murphy blistered a quarter-mile at 15.6 seconds, according to a story on the Bike Reader site.
As the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame notes, Murphy "won League of American Wheelman titles from one to five miles setting 17 national records. Through his career, he broke seven world records in distance up to ten miles."
Elsewhere, we've seen Murphy's epic ride mentioned as the inspiration for the old phrase, "going to beat 60." But web searches aimed at confirming that connection are complicated by the popularity of comedian Charlie Murphy. If there are any cultural historians out there with insights, we'd love to hear from you in the comments section.
Just in case you forgot.
As the War in Iraq winds down remember…
The entire cost of the Iraq War was less than Barack Obama's failed stimulus bill.
Nice work, champ!
FOX News reported:
As President Obama prepares to tie a bow on U.S. combat operations in Iraq, Congressional Budget Office numbers show that the total cost of the eight-year war was less than the stimulus bill passed by the Democratic-led Congress in 2009.
According to CBO numbers in its Budget and Economic Outlook published this month, the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom was $709 billion for military and related activities, including training of Iraqi forces and diplomatic operations.
The projected cost of the stimulus, which passed in February 2009, and is expected to have a shelf life of two years, was $862 billion.
The U.S. deficit for fiscal year 2010 is expected to be $1.3 trillion, according to CBO. That compares to a 2007 deficit of $160.7 billion and a 2008 deficit of $458.6 billion, according to data provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
SPOILERS THAT PERTAIN TO THE CLIMATE OF STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS BELOW:
If you're like me, you watch Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and when the ending comes, you wonder what happened in the days after. You wonder what the galaxy knows about Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, the Emperor, and what happened on Death Star II. Today we have some small answers to some of those questions.
A little before the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, See-Threepio and Jessika Pava encounter one another at the Resistance base where her X-wing resides. She cannot believe how old the droid is and that he's still functional, as he is so messed up with a replacement red arm.
Threepio realizing he has Jessika Pava's attention begins to complain about his counterpart, Artoo-Detoo and how Master Luke also heard his complaints. Jessika puts it together that Threepio is referring to Luke Skywalker and she can barely hide her excitement.
Threepio seems stunned Jessika Pava knows who Luke Skywalker is. Jessika gushes about how Luke Skywalker is the best pilot the galaxy has ever seen!
Threepio suggests she speak to Artoo about such matters as he doesn't enjoy space travel, even though Artoo is prone to exaggeration, in his opinion.
That's when Jessika Pava figures out that Threepio is talking about the little astromech that assisted Luke in blowing up the first Death Star. Jessika is excited and mentions that Luke Skywalker defeated the Emperor!
As far as Jessika Pava is concerned, everyone knows the legend of Luke Skywalker and that he defeated the Emperor and as a pilot, Skywalker is a hero of hers. It would seem the rest of the galaxy has this knowledge like Jessika, but if not, at least the Resistance aligned people of the galaxy do.

Russell Tice, the National Security Agency whistleblower who blew the lid open on warrantless wiretapping conducted by the federal government on U.S. citizens post-9/11, says that he took between 12 and 15 polygraph tests during his nearly 20-year-long government career.
The tests mellowed over time, Tice says, and they may have also gotten easier to beat.
Tice, who is no longer at the NSA, says he, along with those still in contact with at the agency, marvel at how easy it is to beat the lie detector.
The federal government currently administers polygraphs to government employees in a number of agencies, including the NSA and CIA. The polygraphs work by measuring and recording a person's physiological responses—changes in a person's pulse, breathing and blood pressure—to lying versus telling the truth.
Tice, who is now working on a Ph.D. in global security studies, says the NSA "routinely uses polygraphs to terrorize the rank and file of NSA employees" and to "gather very personal information on them that they can use to blackmail them into participating in illegal and unethical conduct."
The whistleblower's view is supported by AntiPolygraph.org, a nonprofit that seeks to abolish polygraphs from the workplace. George Maschke, a U.S. army reserve captain who was rejected from the FBI for failing a polygraph and now runs AntiPolygraph.org, tells Whispers he believes the NSA's polygraph is intended to be a "psychological tool of coercion."
"Polygraphs are detrimental to individuals and to national security," says Maschke, "because federal agencies are relying on technology that is unreliable... that is junk science." A number of studies from the scientific community have also said polygraphs rely on pseudoscience.
AntiPolygraph.org has a number of tips on how to manipulate physiological responses to beat the test. Tice shared some of his own tips on Monday with Whispers.
First, Tice says, a person can trick the tester on "probable-lie" questions. During a polygraph's pre-test interview, the tester usually asks a person to answer questions they are likely to lie about. These include questions like: 'Have you ever stolen money?,' 'Have you ever lied to your parents?,' or 'Have you ever cheated on a test?'. Most people have done these at least once, but lie about it. So the tester uses a person's response to a likely lie as a way to establish how a person physically reacts while lying.
Tice says to trick the tester, a person should lie in response to these questions like most other people would, but also bite their tongue hard while doing so, which will set off other physiological reactions in the body. The tester's "needles will fly everywhere," says Tice, "and he will think, 'This guy is a nervous nelly. He has a strong physical reaction when he's lying.'"
"And you're skewing the test," he says.
Tice says it's also easy to beat a polygraph while telling a real lie by daydreaming to calm the nerves.
"Think of a warm summer night... or drinking a beer, whatever calms you. You're throwing them off," he says. "The needle might nip a little [because you're lying], but not off the charts." And since the person has already convinced the tester that they have off-the-charts physiological reactions while lying, Tice says, a small reaction likely won't tip the tester off.
The tests have also simply gotten easier, with the questions being less likely to shock an individual. "They used to say things like 'I bet you have sex with dogs,' just to initiate a reaction to see how that needle jumps if you've been insulted," Tice says. "[But they] have mellowed down a lot... Polygraphs are easy to beat."
Update, 3:20 p.m.:
NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines says that the polygraph "is one of the vetting tools" used by the NSA and other federal agencies "to assess an individual's eligibility for access, and continued eligibility access, to highly sensitive intelligence information."
"In making these eligibility determinations, NSA complies with the personnel security investigative standards and procedures as outlined in various Intelligence Community directives and policy guidance memoranda."

NAIROBI, Kenya — The Eritrean Embassy in Kenya sent a text message alert Monday morning: The Ethiopians had attacked. Fighting on the border. Situation unfolding.
The jagged line separating Eritrea from its former ruler, Ethiopia, has been one of Africa's most combustible flash points. Tens of thousands of soldiers died from 1998 to 2000 in a war that had been called as pointless as two bald men fighting over a comb.
As the news of renewed clashes in the rocky, barren frontier began to spread on Monday, many Ethiopians and Eritreans feared the worst. Witnesses said both sides were rushing troops to the Tsorona border area, and heavy artillery was apparently fired from both sides. On the Eritrean side, several people were reported to have been killed. The reports of fighting and the lack of solid information raised fears that the two countries could be sliding once again toward all-out war.
But by Monday afternoon, the extent of the fighting was unclear. The Ethiopian government said Eritrea started it. Getting more information out of Eritrea is like trying to see into a pitch-dark room: The government is one of the most secretive, isolated and repressive nations in the world.
WASHINGTON ― Immediately after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) walked offstage at the GOP convention in Cleveland last month without endorsing Donald Trump, the Texas conservative and former presidential primary rival appeared to have made a grave miscalculation.
The latter part of his speech, in which the senator pointedly urged delegates to “vote your conscience,” was completely drowned out by angry boos and chants in Quicken Loans Arena. Trump, the party's nominee who had seen an advance copy of the speech, made a surprise appearance in the stands, stepping on Cruz's big moment and whipping supporters into an even bigger frenzy.
Pundits and politicians quickly pronounced that Cruz's gambit had failed and that he had done serious damage to his political career. A CNN poll released after the speech showed his favorability rating within his own party cut nearly in half. Even his longtime billionaire benefactors, Robert Mercer and daughter Rebekah Mercer, said they were “profoundly disappointed” with his decision not to support the GOP nominee.
Carlo Allegri/Reuters People wave placards during senator Ted Cruz's speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
But after a week of Trump repeatedly setting himself on fire (declining even to wait for the previous fire to go out), politicians who endorsed Trump, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have found themselves feeling the heat, while Cruz's decision is starting to look like the better long-term bet. The panic within the party spread so much last week that several high-profile Trump supporters reportedly began contemplating staging an “intervention” with the candidate.
And Cruz, in rare fashion, has let the fire rage without adding his own gasoline. “He's doing a remarkable job staying quiet and letting people come to that conclusion on their own,” said Amanda Carpenter, a longtime adviser to Cruz.
While those close to Cruz were confident the decision not to endorse would be the right one in the end, the quickness with which it's panning out has been a bit of a surprise. “Trump blew his own convention. While predictable, it still boggles the mind it happened,” Carpenter said. “Trump is like a tornado. You know it's going to be devastating when it rips through your house but the aftermath is still shocking.”
Cruz is well-positioned for a 2020 presidential bid should he succeed in resuscitating his image ― he took home nearly 600 delegates this cycle with the aid of an impressive grassroots organization. But he must first win re-election in 2018, and Trump has threatened repeatedly to try to take him out in a primary. CNN reported on Monday that some GOP donors have urged Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) to jump in the race. Rep. Joaquin Castro (Texas), a prominent Democrat who represents San Antonio, has also signaled interest in running for the seat.
Cruz's anti-Trump stand got some backup on Monday, after a little-known GOP staffer announced an independent bid for president. Evan McMullin, 40, a former CIA agent and House Republican Conference policy director, isn't expected to mount a serious candidacy ― but he could cost Trump some votes in Utah, a state that has been uniquely resistant to the brash businessman.
In 1945, when world leaders boldly committed to save future generations from the scourge of war, their pledge led to the foundation of the United Nations and to modern international humanitarian law.
The turmoil that ensued was a far cry from the picture of peace and diplomacy they had in mind. In the decades that followed, civilians experienced devastation caused by conflicts that played out completely differently to the two world wars – marked by proxy conflicts and fierce battles of ideology fought in the name of religion or regime change. But the consequences of these conflicts were all too familiar: civilians injured or killed; children and women raped and abused; towns and cities razed to the ground; and whole communities forced from their homes, bringing mass displacement up to post-world war two records, at well over 60 million people.
Today's civil wars involve a greater number of factions making them even more complex to bring to resolution. They are characterised by shocking levels of brutality meted out on civilians and an all-pervasive impunity for perpetrators. People in besieged areas are deliberately starved, intimidated and deprived of essential goods – sometimes for years at a time, with impunity. Homes, schools, hospitals and places of worship are bombed at alarming levels often with patients, staff, families, worshippers and students still inside.
Siege is a barbaric tactic of war that has no place in the 21st century

Many of today's conflicts lack a clear frontline and are more likely to take place in densely populated urban settings with civilians in the crossfire. When populated urban areas are attacked with explosive weapons, 90% of the people killed or injured are civilians.
We stand at a critical juncture: 150 years of achievement in signing up to international laws and agreeing to international norms to protect civilians in conflict zones, are unravelling before our eyes. To reset the international system to better meet the needs of the millions of people whose lives are torn apart by violence, three areas at the core of the humanitarian enterprise must urgently be addressed – access, principles and protection. In May, states will gather for a humanitarian summit in Istanbul, where they will have a unique chance to commit to concrete changes in each of these areas.
First, access. All over the world – and at a staggering scale in Syria – warring parties deny or obstruct access to aid organisations trying to reach communities in need. This barring of access may be blatant: attacking and killing aid workers, looting their supplies, outright denying safe passage, or it may be more subtle, coming in the form of burdensome bureaucratic measures.
Siege is a barbaric tactic of war that has no place in the 21st century. Harrowing images of starving children in Syria's besieged town of Madaya at the beginning of this year have shaken us all, but all over the world there are hundreds of Madayas: in Sudan, in Yemen, in Myanmar, in Nigeria – people are barred from accessing assistance while aid workers engage in difficult, dangerous and complex access negotiations with warring parties, sometimes with success, often with none.
Secondly, at the summit, leaders must come prepared to renew their commitments to the core humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence – that guide our work. Preserving our neutrality and our refusal to take sides in conflict, as well as our independence from political agendas, are essential to achieving our mission to protect and provide assistance to affected populations based on needs alone.

Abiding by these principles allows us to build acceptance with fighting parties and communities and to reach the frontlines of crisis. The politicisation of aid leads to suspicion of our mission, undermining our work and putting in danger the lives of our staff and the people we are supposed to protect and assist.
Third, protection is at the cornerstone of humanitarian action. Over the past 150 years, and in the past two decades in particular, we have put unstinting efforts into strengthening international legal frameworks governing the rules of war. Yet we are witnessing a brazen and brutal lack of respect for these rules. Warring parties must abide by the rules of distinction, proportionality and precaution.
We can no longer stand by as families are deliberately and indiscriminately bombed in their homes, while the bombers go unpunished. It is heart-rending to provide food and water to families only for them to risk being shot as they come to get aid, or if humanitarian workers are targeted. It is hopeless to build hospitals if we cannot guarantee the safety of patients and healthcare staff. Counter-terrorism and asymmetric warfare do not justify the loosening or dismissal of the rules that aim to protect civilians in conflict. Enough is enough. Even wars have rules.
In his report One Humanity, Shared Responsibility and his agenda for humanity, the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon calls for global leadership to prevent and end conflicts, and on global leaders to uphold the norms that safeguard humanity. Governments must commit to setting up of a watchdog to track, collect data and report on violations of international humanitarian law. He also calls for greater support for national justice systems and international judicial bodies, such as the international criminal court, to bring an end to impunity. We look forward to commitments on each of these and many other initiatives at the world humanitarian summit.

The vision set in the UN charter after world war two remains relevant, but global leaders must now reinforce the foundations that make up the humanitarian system. The world humanitarian summit will be a turning point in how states, international organisations, the private sector, civil society and individual leaders, come together to confront the major challenges of our time. Leaders have shown what they are capable of when they commit to change. Last year in Paris on climate change, in New York on the 2030 sustainable development agenda, in Sendai on risk reduction, leaders demonstrated the power of political leadership to make progress on some of the most difficult issues all of us, across the world, are facing. We must harness this level of political momentum to deliver this success in May in Istanbul and ensure necessary protection of civilians and access to humanitarian assistance for the generations that succeed us.

Schizophrenia is actually eight different genetic disorders rolled into one, according to a new study released Monday.
The study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, found that there are different gene clusters that contribute to eight different classes of the usually hereditary disease. The researchers at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed the genes of more than 4,000 people with schizophrenia, and tallied the symptoms of patients against the DNA of people with and without schizophrenia in order to identify the gene clusters.

In patients experiencing hallucinations and delusions, the researchers found that the interaction between genetic variations created a 95% chance of schizophrenia, while disorganized speech and behavior in another set of patients revealed a set of variations associated with a 100% risk. The hereditary risk of schizophrenia is known to be about 80%.
“What we've done here, after a decade of frustration in the field of psychiatric genetics, is identified the way genes interact with each other, how the ‘orchestra' is either harmonious and leads to health, or disorganized in ways that lead to distinct classes of schizophrenia,” said Dr. C. Robert Cloninger, one of the senior researchers in the study.
Another researcher, Igor Zwir, said that identifying groups of genetic variations and matching them to symptoms may lead to enhanced treatment by targeting specific genetic pathways.

Southland farmer Warren MacPherson has told Winston Peters at a public meeting that Environment Southland failed to report a 23,000 litre oil spills into Sharks Tooth Creek, Spring Hills, Southland, in late October, 2015.
Environment Southland "covered up" a massive oil spill into a Southland waterway following a truck accident, a public meeting in Invercargill heard.
Farmer Warren MacPherson made the claim during the public meeting on Monday morning.
MacPherson, who is himself being prosecuted by Environment Southland, claimed 23,700 litres of oil was spilt into the Sharks Tooth Creek, Springhills, on October 30, 2015.
NICOLE JOHNSTONE/STUFF Warren MacPherson claims oil from the spill ended up in the Makarewa River.
A truck carrying the oil had crashed and tipped over, he said. The oil had flowed into the Makarewa River, MacPherson said.

Environment Southland, in a long statement on Monday afternoon, confirmed the oil spill had occurred, but said it did not routinely publicly notify incidents and it had been "assumed" the spill would probably be reported to the media via the emergency services.
When an Environment Southland compliance officer arrived at the site after about 40 minutes, most of the oil had escaped the scene, Environment Southland senior staffer Vin Smith said.
A small tributary was dammed with dirt and baleage, which had captured some of the oil and, soon after, the remaining oil was removed using several sucker trucks.
The truck company took full responsibility for the cleanup, and the company's estimated cleanup costs were more than $250,000, Smith said.
"Southern Transport spent over 1000 hours of Southern Transport's and contractors' time cleaning up the initial spill and subsequent releases from captured oil from the plants and banks of the river," Smith said.
"The company ended up using over 120 oil absorbent booms, 600 oil absorbent pads, diggers, tankers and vacuum trucks in its response."
MacPherson earlier told NZ First leader Winston Peters at the packed public meeting: "I am prepared to state here and now there was a monstrous oil spill in October 2015 where 23,700 litres of highly toxic transformer oil from the Roxburgh hydro dam was being transported to Invercargill ... 23,700 litres went down the Sharks Tooth Creek and eventually into the Makarewa River."
MacPherson, the chairman of the Makarewa River liaison committee, complained that Environment Southland had not done enough."All of that oil went down, right out to sea. No ratepayers were notified."
No-one had been notified the oil was potentially highly toxic to animal health, so people taking water out of the river for stock or for human consumption may have run the risk of illness, he said.
MacPherson said he worked with Environment Southland after the spill and they tried to work out a system to put measures in place to contain any other spills in future.
After the meeting, MacPherson said he was being prosecuted for a "minor spill" himself, understood to be farming related, and he believed there were different sets of rules for some, compared to others.
Smith confirmed the Southern Transport Co Ltd truck that crashed was carrying about 23,700 litres of transformer oil.
The "skin" of the truck was compromised and the oil escaped into Sharks Tooth Creek, a tributary of the Makarewa River, he confirmed.
The police and fire service were called and were on the scene in very short time frames, and an Environment Southland compliance officer was 40 minutes from the scene.
Environment Southland staff had monitored Southern Transport cleanup efforts and had regular meetings with the manager of the company.
The incident was investigated and assessed the same as other incidents, and it was determined Southern Transport had a strong defence to a prosecution so it was not taken to court.
Environment Southland was contacted by MacPherson requesting a meeting some months later, which he and some other community members attended.
There was also a debriefing that included the contractors, Southern Transport and the fire service, Smith said.
"Many lessons were learnt from this incident and, as a result, Environment Southland has stepped up its level of specialist training and equipment.
"Additionally, changes have been made to our response protocols with regard to incident escalation and communication."
Environment Southland did not publicly name people or companies it was investigating or prosecuting, he said.
Environment Southland chairman Nicol Horrell, when asked why the public wasn't informed of the spill, said lessons had been learnt and "we could have done better".
If it happened today, the public would be informed, he said.
He did not believe there was any evidence that human health had been put at risk as a result of the spill.
A retired professor from the UK says he might have pinpointed the location of Camelot, the legendary castle where stories claim that King Arthur held court some 1,400 years ago - if he actually existed.
According to Arthurian literature expert Peter Field, Camelot used to stand at the site of an ancient Roman fort called Camulodunum in Slack, West Yorkshire in the UK, which would have been an ideal spot in 500 AD, when King Arthur is argued to have existed as a real-life military expert tasked with defending Briton from invaders.
"It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up," Field, who taught at Bangor University in the UK from 1964 to 2004, told the BBC.
"I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery."
Field presented his findings during the official launch of Bangor University's Stephen Colclough centre for the history and culture of the book last week.
His hypothesis is yet to be peer-reviewed, so to be clear, a whole lot more research needs to be done before we can read too much into it.
It's also important to note that, despite more than 1,000 years of research, historians and archaeologists have been unable to confirm if King Arthur and Camelot existed outside of the legends at all.
As Bec Crew explained for us earlier this year:
"Despite the fact that the mythological figure has been wildly popular for centuries, no one's actually been able to prove he existed. But what makes Arthur so intriguing is the way we can tie certain historical places and events to him."
But if we take a big leap and assume Camelot did exist, where was it?
Previous research has suggested that it could have been in places like Caerleon in South Wales or Cadbury Castle in England. But so far, there's not been enough archaeological evidence to tie any physical place to the legend.
So Field did additional research based on the historical forts of the time and compared them to the legend of King Arthur. He says the site that best fits Camelot was the modern-day village of Slack.
Looking at Slack today, you'd be hard-pressed to find a reason why someone would want to build a stronghold in what looks to be a mere clearing, but Field says the location was once of great military importance.
Back in 500 AD, Celtic-speaking Britons held back Anglo-Saxon invaders who flooded into the country from the north and west coasts.
It turns out that Slack, which is seemingly in the middle of nowhere, could have been the ideal spot to set up camp to quickly funnel troops to either coast to defend the nation. Its middle-of-nowhere-ness, it turns out, was important.
Here's where it is on a map:
Google Maps
To add to Field's hypothesis, in Roman times, the fort at Slack was thought to be named Camulodunum, which researchers think might have changed linguistically over the years to become Camelot.
And that could explain why the first mention of Camelot only surfaced in literature many years after King Arthur's suspected rule.
"If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around [500 AD], although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180 [AD]," said Field.
"There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information."
Without some type of physical proof in the form of archaeological remains, we won't be able to confirm if Field is onto something here. But he's not the only researcher seeking out the legendary artefacts.
Earlier this year, a team of British archaeologists uncovered a series of massive walls that appear to be from the Dark Ages at a location thought to be tied to the Arthurian legend.
The researchers suggested that these walls were once part of the palace where King Arthur was born, and they're currently excavating the site to uncover more details.
But while it's fun to think that the King Arthur of legend - who had a roundtable and hung out with a wizard named Merlin - did actually exist, some experts claim that the Arthurian legend might actually be a hodgepodge of different British rulers coming together into a single, unified story.
So far, Field - who's been researching Slack for the past 18 months - hasn't mentioned taking his idea further into a physical dig at the site.
But hopefully, his hypothesis will prompt further archaeological study at this site or others like it, so we can finally get some real clues into the enduring mystery of King Arthur, or the real-life kings who inspired the legend.
One task force says VA is intentionally using TBI examination tools that fail to accurately assess the residual effect of mild TBI.
The Montana Governor's Traumatic Brain Injury Advisory Council condemned the screening tools used by VA to diagnose TBI of veterans in the state. And the task force is not alone; the Montana Board of Psychology said at least one VA psychology was using “deficient” TBI examination tools like RBANS to assess effects of mild traumatic brain injury.
RELATED: Get The Facts On TBI Examinations
TASK FORCE TBI EXAMINATIONS REBUKE
The task force wrote a letter to the state's Department of Public Health and Human Services that in part said:
“It appears to the Council that the VA is deliberately adopting a lower standard of care for veterans than that which is accepted for civilians. This accepted standard of care is not always achieved in civilian health care either, but it is remarkable to see it explicitly rejected by the VA.”
GATLIN TBI CASE
The rebuke from the Board and task force come in response to revelations that occurred as a result of failures in the case of retired Army Captain Charles Gatlin.
Gatlin was seen by VA psychologist Robert Bateen who made use of RBANS to assess the severity of Gatlin's TBI despite three previous comprehensive exams. Those previous exams said Gatlin suffered a moderate TBI with moderate residuals.
RELATED: C&P Psychologist Barred In TBI Case
Meanwhile, Bateen uses RBANS, an inferior screening tool, and concluded Gatlin recovered despite indications that his TBI residuals were worse. Gatlin filed a complaint against Bateen's license to practice psychology in the State of Montana.
Montana concluded Bateen committed an ethical violation, reprimanded him, and issued a prohibition against Bateen conducting another TBI examination.
Gatlin eventually restored his benefits, but not after an incredible ordeal that lasted 5 years.
VA leadership continues to deny wrongdoing and believe they are correct to allow psychologists to use inferior tools to assess the effects of TBI.
Why does VA leadership continue to deny the common standards of care for TBI residual assessment? Can Congress straighten them up?

BOISE - School districts across the state are asking voters to approve funding for various projects - from building new schools to repairs and maintenance - during the March 14 election.
A note about levies and bonds: Supplemental levies require a simple majority (over 50 percent) approval to pass, while general obligation bonds require a supermajority (two-thirds) approval.
A number of so-called plant facilities levies are also up for vote. The majority approval required for these levies is dependent on the percentage of market value indebtedness the levy would incur. It's usually between 55 percent and two-thirds majority approval.
Results will post next to the school district as soon as they come in.

ANAHEIM — Anti-Donald Trump protesters draped themselves in the Mexican flag on Wednesday and shouted “Fuck Donald Trump” outside of the Anaheim Convention Center where the Republican presidential frontrunner was speaking to a large crowd of supporters.
“We work at McDonald's, we work at Pizza Hut! We make your tacos!” a Hispanic man who had the Mexican flag wrapped around him shouted to a pro-Trump protester. A “Latinos for Trump” man happened to walk by and shout the slogan at the group. “Aw no, no, no, no,” the Hispanic man said as he shook his head in disbelief.
Anarchists were also present at the protest, holding up flags with the Anarchist pentagram symbol on them. “This entire country was founded on illegal immigration,” Ethan, 25, told Breitbart News. “I'm Mexican, so obviously our ancestors were here way before anybody else,” he said.
Workers United Local 50, representing food and beverage cast members at the Disneyland Resort, was also protesting Trump. “This country's in a weird place right now,” Christopher, 34, the president of the local chapter told Breitbart News. “Extremism is taking hold,” he added.
His colleague Allatorre Jose, 24, said he is supporting Bernie Sanders for president. He told Breitbart News he was at the rally “to see what the opposition looked like.”
Meanwhile, more Latino “Fuck Trump” protesters took to the loudspeakers to express their disdain for the Republican candidate.
“We don't cuss at my house,” another man said, disapprovingly. Earlier, he had inserted himself in the middle of a verbal confrontation between pro and anti-Trump fans, shouting, “What you should do is you should take lessons from Jesus and stop hating. I want to tell you, Jesus Christ can set you free!” he said.
In the courtyard outside the convention center, pro- and anti-Trump ralliers joined to hold the American flag. An anti-Trump protester said “I'm a proud ass Latino, homie. I'm a proud Latino. But you know what? I'm also American … we don't care about Donald Trump. Fuck Donald Trump.”
During his speech, Trump reiterated his intention to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border. “But when I ask the people how important is the wall and they say it's the most important tool than they can think of, we're going to build a wall. We have no other choice,” Trump said. The crowd broke out chanting, “Built that wall! build that wall!” And Trump chimed in and shouted the same.
“Who's gonna pay for the wall?” he asked the crowd. “Mexico!” they shouted in unison. “I love the Mexican people,” Trump said.
He spoke of the importance of bringing manufacturing jobs back to America: “We don't make anything any more folks. We are losing our base, we are losing our manufacturing and it's disgraceful.” Later, Trump went on to share one of the tenets of his own success in business, saying: “When you make a deal, you always have to be prepared to walk.”

Today is supposed to be an organized boycott called “a day without immigrants” – “immigrants” being the replacement word for “undocumented immigrants,” “undocumented immigrants” being the replacement phrase for “illegal immigrants,” and “illegal immigrants” being the replacement phrase for “illegal aliens.”
Organizers are asking illegals and their sympathizers not to attend work, shop at stores, or send their children to schools. We are meant to feel the impact of illegal immigrants and how much they are needed.
They assert:
To the President: without us and our contribution this country is paralyzed!!! We might lose a day of work but we will win much more.
A number of restaurants are planning to close, including some of those owned byChef Jose Andres, who has his own legal dispute with President Trump. Chef Andres says:
We want to show America what may happen if we disappear[.] … We have a new form of slavery. We let them [illegals] come in and work on the farms, working underpaid long hours[.]
There are a number of things I don't understand about this boycott.
1) Organizers are calling for a boycott of schools. We, taxpayers, pay for the education of illegal children. If they were to boycott school every day, we would save a lot of money.
2) Are organizers also calling for a boycott of free health care?
3) Will illegal aliens who are drunk drivers stay sober to honor their boycott day?
4) If they aren't working, and they aren't going to school, and they aren't spending money, just what is it they are doing today? If we were to take this “boycott” seriously, millions of illegal aliens would be hiding in their apartments, locking themselves away from society…which might not be such a bad thing. See #3 above.
5) Will illegals who are part of drug cartels force customers to “buy American” during this day?
6) Will automated phone menus allow one to reach an English-speaking person by pressing any number on our phone keypads during this day?
7) Will Telemundo be broadcasting in English today?
8) If “a day without immigrants” is successful, could it be extended another day, and then another day and another day after that?
How are you going to celebrate “a day without immigrants”? Do you think there's a holiday-appropriate card you can get for your loved one at your local drugstore, and if so, what would it say?

Video appears to show Reidy entering trance-like state after talking to white haired man

Does bizarre footage from the moments preceding her ‘Freemason' rant on the House floor suggest Dianne Reidy was a victim of mind control?
A man with white hair appears to give Reidy a nod, causing her demeanor to immediately shift as she enters a trance-like state before walking towards the podium to deliver her rant. A black man sat opposite appears to react to Reidy's strange behavior. The white haired man then immediately goes to his cellphone to send a text message.
Also learn why we never actually heard Reidy's actual rant when she was stood in front of the speaker's podium – the media simply dubbed over her words from when she was being dragged away in a different part of the building.

Practical Tips on How to Find Your Purpose in Life
It's the age-old question asked by people in different parts of the world – “What is my purpose in life?” In other words, “What am I here to accomplish?” Figuring out your place in the world can be a difficult feat, especially since nowadays, people expect you to have it all figured out at an early age. For a few lucky people, the calling does come early, and they spend their days living out their dream. But what about the rest of us?
For those of us who found our purpose later in life (or for those who are still searching), all is not lost. First, figure out why you are searching for your life purpose. Is it because of a deep interest in what you were meant to do in life, or because someone (or some article) stated you needed to have a purpose in life? If it is the latter, reconsider your search; there is no harm in simply floating through life (albeit being a productive member of society) for a bit. However, if you have the nagging urge to truly discover what you were meant to do in your life, read on.
Sit down and think: Are you satisfied with your life as it is? And I'm talking about the here and now. Where would you rank your life at this very moment, on a scale of 1 to 10? If you rank yourself around an 8 or above, consider yourself lucky. Anyone with that level of satisfaction in their current life has likely already found their purpose. Because remember, not every day is going to be filled with rainbows and sunshine; it takes an occasional storm to create that beauty.
Now, for those of you who rated your life at a 7 or below, let's talk. If you've ranked yourself at those lower levels, you obviously have some sense of dissatisfaction with your current life. So, think back to a time when you were truly, 100 percent happy. Envision everything about that time in your life – what stands out, what was it about that time that made you feel good? Part of your answer might be tied to having less responsibility, feeling more carefree and having less to worry about. If that is the case, think about your current worries; how many of them could go away? Sure, it would be great if they could all disappear, but be realistic – how many of those current worries could you lessen or do away with? Start there – downsize your worries. It won't be simple, especially if you've been worrying about those things for years. Keep a journal for a week if you aren't particularly sure about all the worries you have; you can keep it with you to track worries throughout the day, or you can write it all down at the end of the day.
Once you have discovered those worries, make a promise to stop thinking about at least one of them for a week. If the thought comes into your head, have a mantra to eliminate it. The first few days will be tough, but by the end of the week it will get easier. Keep eliminating worries as the weeks go on until you feel more comfortable with your life. To eliminate your worries and repetitive negative thoughts related to them, you should focus on positive aspects of your life. Positive psychology became incredibly popular in the past 10 years as it is aimed on making ordinary life more fulfilling through changing person's attitude and increasing his level of happiness in daily life.
After eliminating a majority of worries, you will be free to think about your life purpose once more. Worries distract of us from thinking about this, since we devote so much energy to the worries. Focus your energy on what makes you happy – it could be volunteering, it might be donating money to a charitable cause, or it could be a whole life overhaul. Remember, the point is to be happy and satisfied with the life you (not anyone else) chose.

Using sabermetrics, three teams have done a great job with their first-round picks over the years, while three teams certainly have not.
Drafting amateur baseball players is hard.
The first round, however, is where you're supposed to have the most success because, presumably, you're selecting from the very best amateur players in America. These are the players who are scouted the most, and these are the players that are expected to become stars.
That doesn't mean it's easy. Injuries, bad luck, and a baseball team's inability to develop raw talent can sometimes turn a good draft pick into a bust. And the difference in draft philosophies, taking more polished college players versus raw high school guys with tremendous "tools," has a lot to do with the bust versus success rate in the first round.
So as Major League Baseball gets set for the 2014 MLB Draft on Thursday, here are the three teams that have had the most, and least, success in the first round since 2004.
The metric used to tabulate "success" was Baseball Reference's WAR formula and our very own nERD data.
Three Most Successful First-Round Franchises
Team Number of Picks WAR WAR/pick Batting nERD Pitching nERD Diamondbacks 22 74.4 3.38 17.73 25.78 Nationals 15 63.6 4.24 15.2 22.04 Rays 22 60.4 2.75 10.12 19.85
Since 2004, the Arizona Diamondbacks have gotten 74.4 wins above replacement from their 22 first-round draft picks, for an average of 3.38 wins per pick. Of course, 22 picks is a lot, trailing only the Blue Jays' 27, the Padres' 26, and Red Sox' 25. Of course, most of the big-name draftees are no longer with the team, like Stephen Drew (2004), Justin Upton (2005), Max Scherzer (2006) and A.J. Pollock (2009), which has got to be kind of a bummer for D-Back fans.
The Washington Nationals are second, getting 63.6 wins above replacement from their 15 first-round picks, good for an average of 4.24 wins per pick. Most of that production has been generated by some easy, no-brainer selections like Stephen Strasburg (2009) and Bryce Harper (2010). Talk about getting lucky. The Nats also hit it big when they drafted Ryan Zimmerman (2005), and appear to have a star-in-the-making in Anthony Rendon (2011), the man who has taken over third base for Zimmerman.
Finally, the Tampa Bay Rays are third, getting 60.4 wins above replacement from their 22 first-round picks since 2004, an average of 2.75 wins per pick. However, that number is weighted heavily by two selections, Evan Longoria (2006) and David Price (2007), who have accounted for 93% of that overall total. The Rays have not had a first round draft pick appear in a Major League game since 2008 first-round pick Tim Beckham.
Three Least Successful First-Round Franchises
Team Number of Picks WAR WAR/pick Batting nERD Pitching nERD Phillies 12 -2.3 -0.19 -2.15 1.47 Padres 26 2.8 0.11 -0.44 5.32 Indians 11 5.4 0.49 -0.11 12.73
I'm not sure "least successful" can accurately describe the wasteland that has been the Philadelphia Phillies' first-round selections over the last 10 years. They're the only team in baseball to receive negative wins above replacement from their first-round draft picks over the last decade, 12 selections in all. Their -2.3 wins above replacement averages out to -0.19 per pick, a staggering failure to both draft and develop young talent.
Part of the Phillies' lack of success is due to their five-year playoff run from 2007-2011, which had them picking near the tail end of the first round. They didn't have a pick higher than 16th (last year's selection of J.P. Crawford) over the last 10 years, and didn't have any first-round picks at all in 2005 and 2009. There's reason to hope that Crawford and Jesse Biddle (2010) can be decent contributors in the next few years, but other than that, it's been a real tire fire.
The San Diego Padres' selections have been almost as bad, and they've had more than twice the picks the Phils have. Their 26 first-round selections since 2004 have netted them 2.8 wins above replacement, or just 0.11 wins per pick. And whereas the Phillies made the playoffs five years in a row and won a World Series, the Padres have made the playoffs just twice (2005 and 2006) in the last decade.
San Diego has had just four first rounders drafted since 2008 play in the big leagues (Jace Peterson, Jaff Decker, Logan Forsythe and Cory Luebke), with Luebke being the most productive (2.4 rWAR). There is some hope, though. The Padres' most recent first round selections, 2012 draftee Max Fried, and last year's first round pick Hunter Renfroe, were ranked in Baseball America's pre-season Top 100 Prospects.
Finally, the Cleveland Indians have had the third worst success rate with their first-round picks, getting just 5.4 wins above replacement with their 11 first rounders since '04, an average of 0.49 wins per pick. Their most productive first-round pick over the last decade so far has been third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall (2008), who has generated 4.0 wins above replacement. But like the Padres, a few recent first round picks are among Baseball America's Top 100, including 2011 first-rounder Francisco Lindor and 2013 first-rounder Clint Frazier, so hopes are high for those two.
Of course, success in the later rounds can make up for first-round misses. But the stars of tomorrow are expected to be taken out of the first round, and many a general manager has lost their job thanks to too many misses there.
On Thursday, they all get another chance to find their next franchise player.
Reports Sunday cast Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey in a seemingly unlikely role: the man who might save the gun control bill.
Toomey, as The Washington Post's Greg Sargent reported last week, is currently in talks with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) about a deal on expanded background checks -- an effort that comes amid concerns from gun control advocates that the best chance to significantly alter gun rights in more than a decade was disappearing.
Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey
That Toomey is involved in these talks in the final days -- or at least what most people expect to be the final days -- of the debate over gun legislation, is telling.
He rose to national prominence as a conservative icon, nearly knocking off Sen. Arlen Specter in a Republican primary in 2004 and then spending the rest of the decade chairing the Club For Growth, a leading fiscal conservative organization.
And, since winning an open seat in 2010, Toomey has been among the most conservative members -- by voting record -- in the Senate. In 2012, Toomey was ranked as the fourth most conservative Senator by National Journal -- behind only Jim Risch (Idaho), John Cornyn (Texas) and Jim DeMint (S.C.). In 2011, Toomey was the 18th most conservative Senator.
So, why is Toomey involved in talks on background checks? Because, at his core, Toomey is not a pure ideologue but rather a political survivor. Prior to running against Specter in 2004, Toomey spent three terms representing a swing-ish House seat in northeastern Pennsylvania. And, while he clearly touted his conservative bona fides when he ran against Specter in 2004, he cast himself much more as a pragmatic pol during his 2010 win.
Toomey understands then that to win in 2016 -- a presidential year in a state where a Republican nominee has not won since 1988 -- he has to demonstrate some cross-aisle cooperation. And, while much of the middle section of Pennsylvania is filled with hunters who prize their gun rights, the votes Toomey needs are in the Philadelphia suburbs where voters are much more likely to support gun restrictions. Being involved in what will almost certainly be cast as a "common sense" deal -- if a deal is struck -- is great politics for Toomey.
The question is how many other Republicans in the Senate and House make the same political calculation that Toomey quite clearly has done.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says the "Gang of Eight" is on track for an agreement on immigration reform by week's end. But there could still be a delay.
Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) compared National Rifle Association head Wayne LaPierre to "the clowns at the circus."
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) isn't a fan of some conservative senators' threats to filibuster gun control legislation.
A trio of senators called on China to step up its pressure on North Korea. One of them, McCain, also warned of accidental war with North Korea.
White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said House Republicans are proposing the "Romney economic plan."
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will speak at Howard University on Wednesday about the GOP's outreach to younger voters and minority groups.

San Bernardino, Calif., has now followed Stockton into bankruptcy.
Harrisburg and Scranton, Pa., and Jefferson County, Ala., home to Birmingham, are already there to welcome them.
Detroit has been taken into receivership by Michigan. A plan under discussion is to level a fourth of the city and reconvert it into the pasture and farmland it used to be a century ago.
On the Web, one may find a pictorial tale of two cities: Hiroshima, a smoking flattened ruin in 1945, now a beautiful gleaming metropolis. And Detroit, forge and furnace of democracy in 1945, today resembling Dresden after Bomber Command paid its visit.
Other American cities are exploring bankruptcy to escape from under the mountain of debt they have amassed or to get out of contracts an earlier generation of politicians negotiated.
No longer shameful, bankruptcy is now seen as an option for U.S. cities. The crisis of the public sector has come to River City.
What happened to us?
In the Reagan-Clinton prosperity, officials earned popularity by making commitments that could be met only if the good times lasted forever. They added new beneficiaries to old programs and launched new ones. They hired more bureaucrats, aides, teachers, firemen, cops.
Government's share of the labor force soared to 22.5 million. This is almost three times the number in the public sector when JFK took the oath of office. These employees were guaranteed job security and high salaries, given subsidized health care, and promised early retirement and pensions the private sector could not match.
The balance between the private and public sectors shifted. As a share of the U.S. population, the number of taxpayers fell, as tax consumers – the beneficiaries of government programs and government employees who run those programs – rose.
The top 1 percent now pays 40 percent of the income tax. The top 10 percent pays 70 percent. The bottom half, scores of millions of workers, pay nothing. They ride free.
This could not go on forever. And when something cannot go on forever it will, by Stein's Law, stop. The Great Recession brought it to a stop. We have come to the end of the line.
U.S. cities depend on property and sales taxes. But property tax revenue has fallen with the collapse of the housing market. Sales tax revenue has fallen as a result of the recession that has kept the consumers out of the malls.
Revenues down, cities and counties face a choice. Raise taxes, or cut payrolls and services. But if taxes rise or workers are laid off and services decline, Americans in our mobile society move across city and state lines, as they are moving from California to Colorado, Nevada and Arizona.
This does not end the crisis, it exacerbates it.
Bankruptcy not only offers cities relief from paying interest to bondholders; it enables mayors to break contracts with public service unions. Since the recession began, 650,000 government workers, almost all city, county or state employees, have lost their jobs. Millions have seen pay and benefits cut.
The salad days of the public sector are over. From San Joaquin Valley to Spain, its numbers have begun to shrink and its benefits to be cut.
A declaration of bankruptcy by a few cities, however, has an impact upon all – for it usually involves a default on debts. This terrifies investors, who then demand a higher rate of interest for the increased risk they take when they buy the new municipal bonds that fund the educational and infrastructure projects of the solvent cities.
Cities and counties have no way out of the vicious cycle. Rising deficits and debts force new tax hikes and new cuts in schools, cops and firemen. Residents see the town going down, and pack and leave.
This further reduces the tax base and further enlarges the deficit.
Then the process begins anew.
This is what is happening in Spain and Greece, which have reached the early 1930s stage of rioting and the rise of radical parties.
Since the New Deal, Keynesianism has been our answer to recession. As the private sector shrinks, the public sector expands to fill the void until the private sector returns to health. Only Keynesianism is not working.
Obama gave us an $800 billion stimulus and four deficits totaling $5 trillion. The Fed tripled the money supply and put interest rates at near zero. The banks are flush with cash. But the engine will not turn over.
What about supply-side tax cuts? But with the Bush tax cuts still in place, taxes are generating the smallest share of gross domestic product in decades.
How much bigger a deficit should we run?
Liberal economists are saying, deficits be damned, print money and spend. With Republicans blocking tax hikes and Democrats resisting cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, all eyes turn to the Fed.
As Milton Friedman said, “Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation.”
EU diplomats are hoping to increase pressure on the Assad regime [Reuters]
The European Union has imposed sanctions on Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, raising pressure on his government to end violence against protesters, EU diplomats said.
EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to add several Syrian officials, including Assad, to a list people affected by EU travel restrictions and asset freezes.
Syrian security forces have used tanks, gunfire and mass arrests to crack down on flashpoints in a bid to crush a two-month-old revolt against four decades of rule by the Assad family.
"The repression in Syria continues," British foreign secretary William Hague said as he went into talks with his counterparts.
"It is important to see the right to peaceful protest, the release of political prisoners and taking the path of reform not repression in Syria over the coming days."
Leading officials sanctioned
The European sanctions against Syria included asset freezes, travel bans and an arms embargo.
"They (the EU) have actually come into line with the US now and included president Bashar al-Assad in their list of officials targeted by sanctions," Al Jazeera's Nadim Baba reported from Brussels.
Florence Looi reports in an Al Jazeera Exclusive on Syrians being tortured by security forces.
"This means he will now also face an asset freeze and a travel ban."
"It shows how seriously the European Union takes [Assad's] failure to accept the olive branch that they offered him," our correspondent added.
On the list of 13 targeted officials was the president's brother, Maher al-Assad, who commands Syria's Republican Guard and is the second most powerful man in Syria.
Ali Mamlouk, head of the General Intelligence Service, and Adulfattah Qudsiyeh, who runs military intelligence were also on the list.
"The aim of the sanctions is to stop the violence and press Assad to agree to a process of reform, but not to force him to step down," an EU diplomat said earlier of the new measures to be announced at the two-day talks.
Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said it was necessary to move against Syria's top leaders.
"If someone represses his own people like that, responds to peaceful demonstrations with force, this can't be left unanswered by the European Union," he said.
Crackdown
On Sunday, protesters defied a security crackdown, turning out in thousands in the city of Homs to attend the funerals of pro-democracy demonstrators and calling for Assad's removal.
Anti-government demonstrators also rallied in an eastern town after a 17-year-old activist, Mohammad Akram al-Tumah, immolated himself on Friday, echoing the self immolation of a Tunisian vegetable trader last year that sparked protests across the Arab world.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain, said it had the names of 863 civilians who had been killed in shootings by security forces since the pro-democracy uprising erupted 10 weeks ago.
Assad has largely dismissed the protests as part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to sow sectarian strife in Syria.
In April, the United States imposed sanctions on Syria's intelligence agency and two relatives of the president.
The sanctions included asset freezes and bans on US business dealings, building on broader US measures against Syria that were in place since 2004.
Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
With just days to go before the launch of action game, we're now getting a better look than ever at just how large the open-world game's 400-square mile map is.
Just Cause 3 takes place on the island of Medici. This new video from PlayStation Access takes players on a virtual helicopter ride from one end of the map to the other.
As stated previously, Just Cause 3's world size is not necessarily larger than Just Cause 2's, though it's supposed to feel more "dense" than its predecessor.
"Just Cause 2 was already enormous," game director Roland Lesterlin said. "We really wanted to focus now on density and the feel of the world itself. So we didn't necessarily just have to do increased land mass. But we have certainly gone a lot bigger when it comes to density of the world. And now it's not just on top of the world--we also have caves and tunnels and all sorts of stuff there, too."
You can also watch this video to see the game's first hour of gameplay.
In other Just Cause 3 news, Avalanche recently confirmed that it explored a multiplayer mode for the game, but ultimately decided to keep it a single-player-only experience...for now. In addition, the developer has confirmed that the PS4 edition runs at 1080p while the Xbox One version runs at 900p. You can also watch this new 4K gameplay video that shows the game with "all settings turned to overkill."
The Just Cause 3 release date is set for December 1 across PC, PS4, and Xbox One. What stands out most to you in this video? Let us know in the comments below.
MITT ROMNEY probably never imagined his current predicament: He lost three of the last four Republican contests to the lightly regarded former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum; trails Santorum by 10 points in the latest Gallup poll; and is limping into his home state primary in Michigan next Tuesday - a contest he may well lose. The Republican establishment is becoming ever more noisily dissatisfied with his candidacy, and if he can't prevail on Tuesday, several prominent members appear poised to demand that he step aside. Their concern isn't hard to fathom.
Right now, Romney looks as though he'd be a dangerously weak nominee. But there isn't many Republicans can do about it. And for that, Romney can thank the Supreme Court. Its 2010 decision, Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission, gave rise to so-called “super PACs,'' the ostensibly independent political committees that can accept unlimited sums from individuals, unions, and corporations and use that money to influence races, usually in the form of negative television ads.
Most of the recent attention devoted to super PACs has focused on Foster Friess and Sheldon Adelson, the wealthy donors whose millions have helped prolong the candidacies of Santorum and Newt Gingrich, respectively. But Romney's super PAC has been at least as instrumental to his own campaign, and possibly more so. In the states where he's won, Romney and his allies have routinely outspent his opponents by a factor of 5 to 1 or even greater, burying them beneath waves of negative ads to which they lack the resources to respond. As the Globe's Glen Johnson has pointed out, Romney's campaign committee and super PAC combined to spend more than $32 million last month, dwarfing his rivals' efforts and pushing him into the lead.

But when Romney hasn't deployed these resources, such as in the Missouri, Colorado, and Minnesota contests two weeks ago, he's fared much worse. All else being equal, most Republicans don't seem to want him as their nominee. Given his current tenuous position in the race, it's easy to imagine that his many deficiencies would have sunk him by now were it not for the tens of millions of dollars in support he has received from an outside entity.

This is hardly the result most Republicans (and Democrats) anticipated from Citizens United. Instead of making it easier for the establishment to consolidate support behind its preferred choice, the decision may inadvertently vouchsafe the nomination to someone too weak to have won it otherwise.
It wouldn't be the first time that major changes to campaign finance laws have wound up having unanticipated effects. In 2003, the McCain-Feingold law took effect, all but wiping out the large “soft money'' donations upon which Democrats in particular had long relied.
The law also limited individual donations to a presidential candidate to $2,000 for the primary and general elections (the limit increased to $2,300 in 2008). This put a premium on the kind of small donors the Republican Party had traditionally done a much better job of attracting. Although most conservatives opposed the new law, Republican election lawyers were so confident it would redound to their party's benefit that they privately dubbed it “the Democratic Party suicide bill.''
A few years later, things looked much different. Contrary to popular assumption, the Democrats did not suffer under the new system. In 2007, candidate Barack Obama built an online fundraising machine that attracted small donors in record number. This enabled Obama first to knock off the powerful favorite, Hillary Clinton, in the Democratic primary, and then to rout John McCain, the law's namesake, in the general election, vastly outraising him in the process.

But the Citizens United decision and the rise of the super PACs has returned rich donors to a position of prominence, even more so than before. In the aggregate, this has benefited Romney more than anyone else and looks to be his campaign's saving grace. Whether or not it's a blessing for his party is something that may not become clear until Election Day.
OAKLAND (CBS SF) — The mother of a 26-year-old musician slain early Saturday morning in Oakland said the only consolation in her youngest son's death is that he did not die alone.
Emiliano Nevarez, a bass player and vocalist for the punk rock bank The Lucky Eejits, was packing up his equipment when a stray bullet struck him.
Bernadette Valadez, Nevarez's mother, said police told her he wasn't the intended target of the gunfire. Two people were engaged in an argument unrelated to him when someone started shooting, she said.
Officers responded around 1:15 a.m. to the 400 block of 14th treet, police said. Two people were injured from the gunfire, but Valadez said the bullet found Nevarez's neck.
“There was a lot of blood and they couldn't stop it,” she said. “It sounded like he didn't suffer for very long.”
Nevarez's best friend was by his side and his long-time girlfriend was there as well, she said.
“The most important thing I wanted to make sure of was that when he got shot there was someone there with him,” Valadez said. “I felt somewhat a sense of relief that he wasn't alone on the street, that he had his girlfriend there and that he wasn't by himself.”
Valadez said Nevarez was surrounded by music at a young age. His older sister and brother played the flute and clarinet, respectively, and Valadez said she is trained as a classical vocalist and piano player.
Nevarez picked up a trumpet at the age of five and played in a youth symphony before he started learning the guitar and found his true musical calling, Valadez said.
Although Valadez said her side of the family, which includes six brothers and two sisters, is steeped in classical music, Nevarez gravitated to rock and roll and heavy metal.
It wasn't the kind of music she preferred, but she said she didn't mind.
“That was what was exciting to him,” Valadez said. “I never stopped him from doing what I felt was his desire.”
His passion for music infused his playing, making him a joy to watch on stage, she said.
“I'm biased because I thought he was great,” Valadez said. “Like any good guitarist, he would experiment and do a lot of riffs that were unusual. He would do his own thing, so I just felt he was trying to be the best musician he could be.”
The Antioch High School graduate received a Bachelor's Degree in audio engineering from Ex'pression College in Emeryville and went to work as an audio engineer in the Bay Area, she said.
Saturday evening was just a typical weekend night for Nevarez, who would perform nearly every week in and around the Bay Area, she said.
“I had told him many, many times to be careful when you go out to these places, some of which are not in the best areas of town,” Valadez said.
She said she had sent him a text message to wish him a Happy Easter and was wondering why he hadn't replied when she got a call from an Oakland police detective.
“It was a real shock,” Valadez said. “Usually he's very protective of the people around him and it didn't seem like he felt threatened in any way. He didn't know any harm was coming there.”
Valadez said Nevarez's brother was preparing to get married and Nevarez was supposed to be his best man. His sister recently had a baby and Valadez said she was planning on going with Nevarez to visit his new nephew.
“There were a lot of really good things happening in his life,” Valadez said. “(His older brother) is devastated that he can't have his brother in his wedding.”
Beyond his music, Nevarez was good-hearted, helpful to his parents — he cared for his father when he was ill — loyal and outgoing, she said.
“He's not a quiet kid,” Valadez said. “He's friendly and personable and he just seemed to have the same friends for a really long time.”
Valadez said plans for a memorial service and funeral are on hold until the coroner completes an autopsy and the body is released to the family, likely sometime early this week.
Although nothing can bring her son back, Valadez said she hopes the person responsible for his death is caught.
“Bad things happen to good people and it's the bad people who get away with it,” Valadez said. “Emiliano was a good kid. There's nothing anyone could say or do to bring him back right now. I just want him to rest in peace.”
Parliament is still hung. Its hungedness is sometimes forgotten because coalition government has proved unexpectedly stable. There were ample forecasts that the arrangement could never work and, even when it started working, differences between Tories and Liberal Democrats were routinely advertised as "having the potential to wreck the coalition". NHS reform; the AV referendum; Europe - their wrecking potential is as yet unfulfilled.
Not all rows between the coalition partners are even worthy of the name. Nick Clegg's recent public veto on Michael Gove allowing free schools to operate for profit was choreographed months in advance "down to the last comma and full stop", according to a senior government adviser. It gave the Lib Dem leader a trophy concession to help bring his party behind Gove's reforms.
Behind closed doors, there are disputes of real ferocity, as in any government. Still, a quiet technocratic revolution has been achieved: coalition is established in the repertoire of British peacetime politics. That causes glee among senior Liberal Democrats, although there are many in the party who find alliance with Tories hard to stomach. The mood at the party's annual conference was one of queasy satisfaction. Lib Dems' hunger for power has been fed with unsavoury political partners. Inevitably, dyspeptic anti-Tory belches were released in Birmingham. Tim Farron, the party president, happily anticipated "divorce" from the Conservatives. The Energy Secretary, Chris Huhne, warned of a "Tea Party tendency" on the Tory right. On the conference fringe, delegates groaned about NHS reform and university tuition fees.
Thrashable Brown
Privately, Clegg is growing increasingly impatient with his party's public bellyaching. "HMS Coalition is sailing," one senior aide said to me when asked about dissenters. "The question is: are they on board?"
The same might be asked of the right wing of the Conservative Party, which is, for tactical reasons, quite popular with the Lib Dems at the moment. While the junior coalition partner can only be grateful for the hung parliament, the Tory back benches are barely reconciled it having happened at all. David Cameron's inability to thrash the eminently thrashable Gordon Brown is a source of confusion and shame. That feeling expresses itself in haphazard demands - tax cuts for high earners, tighter abortion rules, separation from Europe - all of which helps support the notion, vital to Clegg's prospects of an electoral comeback, that coalition is a brake on Tory fanaticism. "They are not unhelpful," a Lib Dem minister says of these grumpy Tories. "It reminds people what they would have been like without us."
The Tories' failure to win the last election has disoriented Labour, too. It demonstrated that there are still many people, mostly in the north of England and Scotland, whose prime motive in the polling booth is to prevent a Tory government. "They couldn't even beat Gordon," says a recovering Brownite adviser, looking for reasons to be optimistic. Recent history suggests voters sentence ousted parties to opposition for longer than one term, but the indecisive 2010 result opens the tantalising prospect of a swifter recovery for Labour. As one senior member of the shadowcabinet puts it: "We don't know where on the trajectory back to power we're supposed to be."
That confusion is stirred by bad economic news on the eve of Labour's annual conference. On 20 September, the International Monetary Fund downgraded forecasts for growth in the UK economy and counselled flexibility in the government's timetable for cutting the deficit. That looks like vindication for Ed Balls, who has long warned of just such an outcome.
Frustratingly for Labour, scoring political points from bad economic news, when most voters have not followed the nuances of the argument, risks looking ghoulish and smug. Besides, having the right economic analysis after the bust doesn't eliminate the charge that Lab­our presided recklessly over the boom.
Ed Miliband's approach to Labour's legacy is to bury it in bigger themes. He wants to frame the country's economic problems as part of an epoch-shaping ideological challenge - the need to reform capitalism - and not just a managerial task of restoring growth. One Miliband friend and adviser describes the project as "starting with the premise that politics and the economy have to be completely rethought". A Miliband refrain for the Labour conference, as rehearsed in an interview with my colleague Mehdi Hasan (starts page 40), is "ripping up the rule book". Emboldened by victory over Rupert Murdoch in the phone-hacking wars, the Labour leader wants to present himself as the scourge of other unaccountable, vested interests: banks, corporate fat cats, exploitative employers.
Want to be a rebel
One obstacle to this is the memory of Labour's incumbency. How long after slavishly following a rule book can a party convincingly rip it up? Another problem is the Lib Dems, who want to be the government's scourges-in-residence of vested interest. A section of Nick Clegg's conference speech was dedicated to the theme, boasting that his party was never in the pocket of big business or the media barons (although a big reason is that it was never invited).
It is a curious contest. On one side is Labour, recently in government, striving to be a prin­cipled opposition. On the other side are the Lib Dems, knowing only opposition, striving to be credible in government. Both want to be the anti-establishment party, which rather concedes the point that the Tories are still in some deep cultural sense "the establishment". It is a mantle that most Conservatives wear gladly, with or without a majority in parliament.
The three main Westminster parties are struggling to decode the signal that voters sent them at the last election. Meanwhile, Britain is three years in to an economic crisis that could last much longer, leaving most people feeling ever angrier, poorer and more afraid. The gap between people's craving for a remedy and politicians' ability credibly to offer them one is widening at alarming speed. Coalition has solved the technical problem of governing in a hung parliament. That is quite an achievement. It hasn't even begun to address the problem of our hung politics.

James Kerr formed the London Armoury Company in 1856, manufacturing Adams patent revolvers (Adams was one of the founding investors) and 1853 pattern Enfield rifles. The rifles were the better business and the company rather quickly decided to focus on them, which led Adams to leave with his patents. In order to keep a revolver in the LAC's catalog, Kerr patented his own design, which proved to be a quite effective handgun.
When the US Civil War broke out, both the Union and the CSA sent procurement agents to Europe to purchase foreign arms, and the Confederate's Captain Caleb Huse struck a substantial deal with the London Armoury Company. The Confederacy would ultimately purchase ore than 70,000 Enfield pattern rifles from LAC, as well as Kerr's patent sharpshooting rifles and 7,000-9,000 Kerr revolvers - the vast majority of LAC's production during the war. So much of their production, that the LAC would actually fail and dissolver in 1866 when their best customer ceased to exist.
The revolver design was made in single and double action versions and in both .36 and .44 calibers, although the CSA purchased guns were all single action .44s. The action is basically a simple rifle style lockplate mounted on the grip and frame, isolated form the soot and fouling of the black powder very well. The cylinder is easily removed via an axis pin entering the rear of the frame, and the guns could be easily serviced by any competent gunsmith without need for any special knowledge or parts.
The two we have in today's video are actually consecutive serial numbers (10,110 and 10,111) right at the very end of the Confederate acquisition period.

Story highlights Bombs kill 20 across Kirkuk
Iraq's PM-designate praises "heroic defence" put up by besieged town
U.N. calls for action to help Amerli, a Turkmen Shiite town under attack by ISIS
Sunni lawmakers pull out of talks to form a government over a mosque attack
As violence continues to wrack Iraq, the United Nations warned Saturday of another ethnic slaughter in the making by Sunni extremists from ISIS.
ISIS fighters have besieged the ethnic Turkmen Shiite town of Amerli in the north for two months, and its fewer than 20,000 residents are without power and running out of food, water and medical supplies.
"The situation of the people in Amerli is desperate and demands immediate action to prevent the possible massacre of its citizens," said Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Iraq.
He said the suffering was "unspeakable" and demanded that the Shiite majority Iraqi government "relieve the siege" on Amerli.
The religious group's head cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, pushed the government to do the same Friday. And he called for air drops "to ease the suffering of its people, especially children and the weak."
About 5,000 families live in Amerli, which has been under siege for 70 days, according to Dr. Ali Albayati, head of the Turkmen Saving Foundation. He told CNN the town is running without electricity, is out of medicine and can only turn to wells for water.

Nearly three dozen villages surrounding Amerli are already under ISIS control, Albayati said. The people of Amerli are relying on the Iraqi government to take them out by helicopter or support them with food drops, Albayati said. In the past 10 days, he added, only one flight has delivered food.
Surrounded on four sides, the 17,400 residents have had to defend themselves with only the help of local police, said Masrwr Aswad of Iraq's Human Rights Commission. He said attempts to bring aid have been hampered by the ISIS security threat, which makes flying helicopters into the area extremely difficult and dangerous.
Their situation echoes the ordeal of Iraq's ethnic Yazidis, whose plight after they were forced to flee into the mountains to escape militants ISIS triggered U.S. aid drops and the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.
Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi praised the people of Amerli for their "heroic defense" in the face of the ISIS siege and called for them to be given support.
Their resistance represents "the beginning of the demise" of ISIS, he said, saying it could encourage other communities also to stand up against the militants.
ISIS has targeted Shiite, Christian and other minority communities as it has advanced across Iraq.
Baghdad, Kirkuk and Irbil bombings
Meanwhile, a suicide bomber targeted the Interior Ministry intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 35 others.
The attacker drove up to the complex gate and detonated the explosives, local police officials said. They warned that the casualty figures are expected to rise.
In Kirkuk, a series of three car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in close succession in different areas of the volatile city, killing at least 20 people and wounding 113 others, Kirkuk police officials told CNN.
This follows a warning issued by ISIS on Friday promising revenge after the killing of 50 of its members in a battle in Jalawla, Iraq. ISIS specifically promised to retaliate against the Kurdish Peshmerga forces.
Two of the three car bombs appeared to target a construction site where Kurdish Pershmerga and Asayesh (Kurdish intelligence) forces were stationed at a security post.
Another car bomb detonated in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region, Kurdish government officials confirmed to CNN. It was the first explosion in the city since a suicide bomber targeted the security headquarters there in September 2013.
The car bomb exploded on the outskirts of the city, on the side of a main road leading out of Irbil to Kirkuk.
Kurdish officials said at least two people were injured, and the local television network Rudaw reported from the scene that three people light injuries.
This string of incidents came as the death toll death rose to 70 from an attack on Sunni Muslims a day earlier at a mosque in northeast Iraq, when suspected Shiite militiamen opened fire on worshipers.
Friday's attack in the Musab bin Omar Mosque in the village of Bani Weis, about 50 miles northeast of Baquba, also injured at least 17 people, officials said.
It also threatened to derail efforts to form a new, inclusive government -- something world leaders have said is a must if the country hopes to defeat Islamic militants.
Iraqi authorities did not immediately identify the attackers, but Sunni politicians have put the blame on Shiite militias.
Outraged Sunni lawmakers withdrew from negotiations to form a new government, saying they would not return until those behind the attack were arrested, two party officials told CNN.
But the United States and the United Nations called on Iraq to continue its efforts to form a united government.

U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq -- including military advisers -- as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS.
And U.S. officials have said that Washington is mulling the possibility of going after ISIS fighters in their stronghold in eastern Syria
But Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby would not confirm concrete plans. "We don't telegraph our punches," he said.
"I'm not going to get ahead of planning that hasn't been done or decisions that haven't been made," Kirby said.
ISIS vows retribution for killings
ISIS made threats over battle losses on Friday.
More than 50 of its fighters were killed while defending the large ISIS-held town of Jalawla "against the Peshmerga (Kurdish) mercenaries," it said on Twitter. A subsequent tweet said the group vowed revenge.
Iraqi and Kurdish forces surrounded Jalawla and took back several nearby villages in Diyala province, a spokesman for Kurdish forces said.
The Peshmerga and Iraqi commandos inflicted heavy losses against ISIS in those battles, military officials said.
In neighboring Salaheddin province, also north of Baghdad, Iraqi helicopters killed 30 ISIS fighters in the town of Dhuluiya, about 70 kilometers northeast of Baquba, Iraqi security officials told CNN.
More U.S. airstrikes near Mosul Dam
Meanwhile, U.S. military forces have conducted more airstrikes against the militants, primarily ISIS-driven vehicles, near Mosul Dam, the Pentagon said.
Since August 8, the U.S. military has carried out 94 airstrikes, 61 of them in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam, according to the Defense Department.
The dam is the largest in the country, and Iraqi and U.S. officials fear that a breach in the dam would threaten the lives of millions of Iraqis who live downstream in Mosul and Baghdad.
The U.S. airstrikes have continued despite a threat by ISIS to kill another American hostage.
Earlier this week, ISIS posted an online video showing the execution of American journalist James Foley. The group threatened the life of another man, identified as American journalist Steven Sotloff, if the United States didn't end airstrikes in Iraq.
There's high youth unemployment around the world, despite a multitude of job vacancies.
Blame the skills shortage, which 39 percent of employers say is preventing them from filling entry level jobs, according to a McKinsey report. Meanwhile in most of the world, less than half of students think their educations prepare them for employment.
Employers know what we're doing isn't working. Students know it as well. But educational institutions apparently don't, which may be preventing them from making needed changes, as this chart from a McKinsey survey indicates:
McKinsey on Society
While students prefer hands-on and on the job learning and feel it's more effective, even vocational schools don't always make it a priority:
McKinsey on Society
Finally, despite leaders and pundits praising vocational training, few parents want to send their own kids to those schools. McKinsey found that every surveyed country except Germany values academic paths over vocational ones:
McKinsey on Society
Solutions may require (1) educators changing their perspective, (2) employers investing more in training raise wages when skills are in short supply, (3) and societies changing some deeply held preferences.
Demand and demographic trends mean that unless we start those changes soon, the shortage of highly skilled workers will only increase.

It has not been a good week for the much-maligned Liverpool transfer committee. The club's summer targets - Ben Chilwell, Piotr Zielinski and Sadio Mane – have unleashed fury in a manner only football fans can. Their target, as expected, those involved in the recruitment and decision-making.
But if they dare put their head above the parapet, they would be forgiven for doing so with their arms aloft. Not in surrender, but celebration.
Perhaps they would be right to. As discussions around Mane intensify with the news he is having a medical on Merseyside, there can be little debate about one thing: the committee, and whatever it entails, got it right.
Liverpool is likely to part with around £30m for the Senegalese international, a fee that would see him become one of the club's most expensive players.
It could have been so different, though. Two years ago, Mane was identified at Red Bull Salzburg. It was there, under the guidance of now-Leverkusen boss Roger Schmidt, were Mane bagged 13 goals in a side that dominated their domestic league, scoring a staggering 110 goals in 36 games.
He was used to playing in a side with such abandon going forward, and a move to Liverpool – 101 goals in 2013-14, of course – made sense. Brendan Rodgers did not agree, and Southampton swooped for the forward in a £12m deal.
Two years on, with Klopp already an admirer from his time at Borussia Dortmund, the deal is nearing completion – for nearly £20m more than it should have been.
There is no knowing how Mane would have developed at Anfield. It is possible he would have been dragged into the club's season-long hangover from the failed 2014 title bid; two years under Ronald Koeman is far more desirable to a player's progression than the instability and inconsistency that riddled Anfield.
Read: Mane on his way to Liverpool for medical
Yet the fact remains Mane was identified long before he became a £30m star. That, in essence, what the transfer committee is supposed to do; so, too, the scouting network.
One swallow does not a summer make. There has been deserved criticism levelled at the committee for mistakes of the past. Indeed, the moniker itself does not help, making it sound far more complicated, and giving it far more gravitas, than necessary. Most top-flight clubs have a multi-layered decision-making process which involves manager, scouting team and chief executive – but few have taken on an identity like Liverpool's.
There have been the recruitment failures, too. Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Diego Costa, Willian and Alexis Sanchez have been identified and gone elsewhere. Some of the signings – Mario Balotelli, in particular – remain questionable at best.
But something is working, evidently. Credit where credit is due. Emre Can was signed for £10m and is now a full German international worth at least double. Roberto Firmino quietly enjoyed a storming maiden campaign, justifying his £29m fee. Mamadou Sakho divides opinion but he has served the Reds well.
Three young players with potential signed, integrated and developing. Three young players worth more now than they were the day they signed.
Mane could have been the fourth, his value already on the rise. That it isn't will be a sense of frustration to those who spotted him that he isn't.
Instead, he comes as a big-money buy. The expectation upon him is already tangible, and will be something Klopp must manage. His first season at the club suggests he will.
The names who the committee missed out on elicits a wince. Costa and Willian have since won the Premier League, Sanchez is considered one of the league's best players and Mkhitaryan has performed at the top level in the Champions League.
Liverpool's missed targets often go on to do great things. The Reds will hope the same can be said of Mane.
The Democratic Party's biggest super PAC, recently retooled as an early pro-Hillary Clinton effort, will sit out the midterm elections this year.
A spokesman with the group, Priorities USA Action, confirmed to BuzzFeed on Wednesday night that it would not be involved in House or Senate campaigns.
"House Majority PAC and Majority PAC are doing everything right and making a real difference. We fully support their efforts," said the spokesman, Peter Kauffmann, referring to the main groups supporting Democratic congressional candidates.
Priorities USA, which operates under loose campaign finance rules that allow it to raise and spend unlimited sums, put $65 million behind Barack Obama in 2012.
Sources close to the group say its leaders considered helping Democrats in House and Senate races approaching this fall. The PAC's principal financial backer, Hollywood magnate Jeffrey Katzenberg, has shown an interest in one midterm candidate in particular: Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat gunning to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell. Katzenberg, one of Obama's biggest bundlers, raised more than $1 million for Grimes on her first trip to California last year.
Sean Sweeney, the former Obama aide who co-founded Priorities USA, said a year ago that the group would likely let others, like House Majority PAC and Majority PAC, "take the lead on House and Senate races."
Kauffmann told the Center for Public Integrity last week that the group did not intend to be involved in the midterms. But his statement Wednesday night amounts to a sure signal from the group that it will steer clear of 2014 races.
Priorities USA will also take steps to ensure its Clinton fundraising operation doesn't interfere with the party during the midterms, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. The group, the article said, is discussing a system in which it asks donors to hold off on making larger contributions until after 2014.
After months of discussions, which date back to as early as last spring, the political action committee announced it would support Clinton should she decide to make a second White House run in 2016. The group assembled a new board of directors, headed by Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, and Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan who backed Clinton's first presidential bid in 2008. Priorities USA announced its new board in the New York Times last month.
The PAC is one of several Democratic groups — including Ready for Hillary and American Bridge — already aligned behind Clinton. EMILY's List, another PAC, has also launched a polling effort under its "Madame President" project, an initiative aimed at electing a woman to the White House in 2016.
Update: This article has been updated to include reference to a piece by the Center for Public Integrity. (2/7/2013)
Fallen Angels
True Cost of Sex Tourism: Philippine's Fatherless Kids
Sign in to add to Watchlist
Until 1991 there used to be a US air force base in Angeles City in the Philippines. These days it is a well-known sex tourism destination, where mostly wealthy retired men from all over the world go to get a taste of Philippine women. Angeles City could easily pass for a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.
Hundreds of local young women work in the bars and nightclubs that are common to this place. They offer sex in exchange for the money they desperately need to survive. The bars only hire young women, so as soon as they reach a certain age, some are forced to quit their jobs.
A lot of the young call girls prefer the older clients because they seem more willing to pay extra and cater to their every whim. Sometimes the younger tourists become violent and hurt the girls and there are rumors of call girls getting murdered and their bodies hidden.
However, the real victims are the children that have been fathered by these foreign travellers. There is little to no chance that the children will ever find or get to know their dads. The saddest part is that these children live in extreme poverty in the Philippines, while their biological fathers are more than likely somewhere on a golf course or in a fancy office wondering where to invest their money next.
Because they are mixed-race, these children easily stand out in the crowd. Sometimes they are teased and bullied because most locals can identify them as the product of a sex tourist and a call girl. Ironically, it's not something that the women try to avoid, either. And many times more than one female in a family has been through the same situation. The poverty is so great that they are willing to do whatever it takes to make some money to buy food for their families.
The young women who work at the bars and nightclubs tend to demand that their clients wear condoms during sex, however these men lie often. One woman recalls that her daughter's father told her he'd had a vasectomy. Another woman says she was very drunk and was probably raped by her child's father.
Selling their bodies seems to be a way to escape from poverty. Still most of the women continue to live in ghettos even though they wear expensive fancy clothes to go to work.
This documentary explores the complex lives of the Filipino call girls and their mixed children. Watch it now.
Gallup + Fox Nation + Abortion Poll = "Churnalism"
Since Friday, May 15th, the Fox Nation front page has featured a photo of a wide-eyed infant (Caucasian and blue-eyed, natch) over the headline, “Cultural Shift? Pro-Lifers Now the Majority in the US.” (see photo after the jump). A click on the headline under the cutsey wootsey, pink-with-health likkle babby (no anencephalic babies need to apply) takes us to a Gallup page headed “More Americans “Pro-Life” Than “Pro-Choice” for First Time”.
Wow, how did that happen!? Did we miss something??
Roughly this time last year, polls were showing a clear majority in favor of choice at least some of the time: a Qunnipiac poll showed 63% agreeing with the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to an abortion; a Pew poll last August showed 54% in favor of abortion being legal in most or all cases, with 5% undecided; and a TIME/SRBI showed an overwhelming 85% of those polled supporting a woman's right to obtain an abortion either up until the time of viability or under certain more limited circumstances. And just last November the American people elected a President whose speeches and voting record demonstrated a pro-choice stance.
So where did this sudden seismic shift in public opinion come from?
From sloppy poll-taking, and journalists and editorial staff who are lazy, biased, or both, that's where.
The truth is that while the Gallup poll showed that a greater number of those polled identified themselves as “pro-life” (51%) than “pro-choice” ( 42%), the majority (76%) responded that abortion should be legal in either all or limited circumstances. Only 23% responded that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.
But it's SOOOO much easier to attract publicity (and advertising) with a provocative headline and slanted story than with a fully truthful one. And its even better yet if the headline and story can be lifted wholesale from other sources, tweaked a little and, with minimal effort, sent on its merry way to propagate the meme du jour among the great unwashed, who in turn will be too lazy to look past the headline or check other sources. A review of online “news” sources shows that the meme has gone viral, as memes do. Look at this from the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire :
“A majority of Americans now say they oppose abortion rights, according to a Gallup poll released today. It is the first time since the polling outfit began asking the question in 1995 that a majority of Americans have held that position.”
Helllloooooooo??? In what world does 76% in favor of abortion rights in some circumstances mean that a majority are opposed to them???
This is a prime example of what award-winning British journalist Nick Davies calls “Flat Earth News”: stories full of distortion, if not outright lies, get churned out and passed along in a media game of Chinese Whispers with an eye firmly on the bottom line, and the truth be damned. It's not journalism - it's “churnalism”.
And churn the story is what Fox News did too, following the lead of Lydia Saad, Gallup Senior Editor, who slanted the story towards the “pro-life” angle throughout her online report. Granted, the statistics show a trend towards a more conservative position on abortion among Republicans and independents who lean Republican – but those who identified themselves as Republican were strongly over-represented in the sample, which in turn may well have skewed the stats which purport to show an increase in the number calling themselves “pro-life” among those with Christian affiliations. Pretty slipshod work from an organization that has been considered the gold standard in public opinion polling for many years.
Be that as it may, there is one interesting question which is not addressed anywhere in Gallup's online analysis:
How do you square this:
...with this?
Fifty-one percent identify themselves as “pro-life”, yet only 23% think abortion should be banned under all circumstances…even with social conservatives over-represented in the sample? Gee, now how could that be? Doesn't "pro-life" mean "no abortion"?
I will leave it to you, the readers, to discuss this apparent “discrepancy”. I report, you decide…
Meanwhile, back at the Fox Nation, where the sun never sets on the (self-)righteous, life is simple and uncomplicated. A click on the “comments” button brings us to this blurb: “New Gallup Poll, conducted May 7-10, finds 51% of Americans calling themselves "pro-life" on the issue of abortion and 42% "pro-choice." This is the first time a majority of U.S. adults have identified themselves as pro-life since Gallup began asking this question in 1995.” And that's all it says. What a surprise.

1. My name is Niclas and I am sitting here with John McCarthy at OOPSA. He is going to do a talk tomorrow about his latest research and for those of you who don't know John McCarthy, he is the father of LISP, one of the originals of artificial intelligence, creator of time sharing and he won the Turing award the years I was born actually (1971). So what have you been up to, what's your current research about? What I am talking about tomorrow is Elephant and Elephant is based on two slogans, one is that an elephant never forgets and the other is "I meant what I said and I said what I meant" an Elephant's faithful 100%. Elephant programs have two characteristics that are described: one of them is that they can refer directly to the past without in the program itself defining a data structure and second that they can make promises and are correct if they keep their promises. So those are the basic aspects of Elephants. My original plan was that Elephant 2000 should be a programming language that would be ready by the year 2005 , but it's not and it seems to me that there still aren't enough ideas to completely define a new programming language, so it's occurred to me that the basic ideas of Elephant are things that can be used to extend a variety of present programming languages if their implementers want to do that, so such languages called Fortran, COBOL, Java, etc.
2. Could you describe these ideas and how they could be implemented in future programming languages? First the idea of referring to the past and as I said the example was a passenger has a reservation if he's made one and it hasn't been canceled. Now we would like to put that into a programming language so that it would be defining a predicate "has passenger reservation" so you might have a statement or some input/output "has John reservation on Air Canada flight 761 from Montreal to San Francisco". So now the question is how does this get implemented and there are two ways they can be implemented, one is by compiler and one is by an interpreter and in order to do it with a compiler the compiler would have to invent the data structure for saving current reservations and maybe it would have to be smart enough so that reservations that were canceled did not have to be remembered.
On the other hand an interpreter might simply maintain a journal of the events that occurred and evaluate a predicate of "has John reservation" or a function "John's reservation" by doing calculations involving this journal of events that have occurred. So that would be the basic idea of implementation of reference to the past. Now in principle one can also have reference to the future, namely a statement that the baggage handler should be ready a half hour before the flight arrives. In principle this is different from the idea that the baggage handler should be ready a half hour before the plane is scheduled to arrive. What you would like to achieve as much as possible is that they are ready before the plane does arrive and therefore the implementation of such a statement might in its simplest form merely refer to the schedule, in a more elaborate form might refer to other information that becomes available as to when the airplane will actually arrive.
If you allow reference to the future then you can get contradictory programs that have the contradictions like those of time travel, namely you can say: "Well if I am going to do something, then don't do it", but that is just a bad program, possible to write bad programs in any programming language. So these are the main aspects, that I know of, of implementing reference to the past. I think that anyone who actually decides to add it to his programming language that is for example to make a version of C that has reference to the past, would find further complications.
3. Are there any specific constraints on these ideas that would make them more suitable for certain type of languages and other languages that would just be impossible to include these ideas in? As far as I understand current programming languages it could be added to any of them, maybe some of the ideological constraints in programming languages like Dijkstra's bad idea of eliminating gotos completely, might offer some interference, but I am not even sure of that.
4. So how come you want these features within the language and not in a framework that can be used from any language? I suppose by that you mean a framework of some structures that are implemented within the language and you could certainly do it that way, but it's clear if you want to do it in the language. Now the reason for referring directly to the past is to save the programmer the necessity of himself inventing data structures, compiler will do it for him and this is particularly important for languages that are to be used by children or by generals.
5. Are there other constructs or things thinking in this area, except for the references in the past that you would like to describe for us? The other major thing has to do with the speech acts idea. Speech acts were invented by some English ordinary philosophers who didn't like logic because they didn't want to learn it, but anyway the logicians discuss the truth value of sentences, so they were interested in sentences whose content was not necessarily a truth value like: "I now pronounce you man and wife" or the very similar thing "I now sentence you to be hanged by the neck until dead" and a key one is promises and a couple of philosophers, J.L. Austin, an English man, and John Searle, a philosopher from UC Berkeley wrote books on these things.
Their formulations do not exactly suit me, for example Searle in his definition of a promise wanted it to be a requirement that the promiser think that the recipient of the promise will get some good out of it and I don't want to include that so someone promises you a table at the restaurant because it's his job to do so even thought he knows that on that particular the good cook is sick.
So in any case we are interested in promises. Computer programs will and do increasingly operate in a social context or a business context where they buy and sell, and therefore make commitments on behalf of their owners or the people who have paid to use them so they should make only the promises they are authorized to make and in so far as it involves them they should keep the promises. So in particular the airline reservations program that has promised to let you on to this flight should make sure that the people at the gate have the information that you indeed have a reservation. So this has to do with promises.
There are questions and answer to questions and the answer to the question should be truthful and they should also be responsive. So if you ask me "What's Vladimirs's telephone number?" and I were to give an answer that "Vladimir's telephone number is Vladimir's wife's husband's telephone number." that would be an answer that was truthful but not responsive and it's a little problematical to define what a responsive answer is but at least in this case it's that he should in some sense know the telephone number after the question has been answered.
6. Are there any research going on trying to implement these things in programming languages that you are aware of, or if not what do you think the timeframe will be for these ideas to enter maybe not the mainstream languages, but at least accessible ? I don't like to specify a timeframe because I've done that in the past unsuccessfully, so I thought that if I defined Elephant 2000 then it would be reasonable that it should be ready by 2005, but here it is 2007 and it's not. From time to time people have talked to me about implementing it and I encouraged them and they ran away and never came back, so I guess they found either difficulties or in the current situation it wasn't very useful to them, but I do think that the two major advantages of Elephant, one of being able to refer to the past conveniently and the other being able to define the correct performance of speech acts will eventually be important and whoever successfully implements them will have an advantage.
7. InfoQ has a lot of readers who are interested in programming languages and many modern programming languages like Ruby are claiming big influences from Lisp Have you seen those languages or do you have any ideas about the current state of programming languages? Lisp seems to be much more influential now then it was a couple of decades ago to new programming languages. Well of course one could just partly relate to just natural turnover. If you want a new programming language then it has to be different in some way and one of the ways is making things different from its immediate predecessors is to go back to more different, distant paths and this happens in lots of fields, not merely programming languages. I don't know enough for example about Ruby to know in what way it's related to Lisp. Does it use, for example, list structures as data. So if you want to compute with sums and products, you have to parse every time? So, in that respect Ruby still isn't up to where Lisp was in 1960.
8. So what do you think of the good choices that the software industry has taken the last few decades? I would say the biggest thing that has been done is to make them more interactive to make it more convenient to write programs that interact with people and also programs that interact with other programs, including programs that were not written to interact together. So the standardization of remote procedure calling for example has been an important thing that needs to be carried further and the speech act idea of programs communicating in speech acts is an extension and of course the object oriented programming was an extension.
9. So what would you think are the bad routes that software industry has taken the last few decades? Of course things becoming more proprietary is a bad business idea. In particular that fact that the major operating systems, both Windows and the Macintosh operating system are proprietary and even secret because I remember back in the good old days one could make modifications to the operating system freely. So Linux has been a substantial improvement in that respect, but so far as I know in many respects it's not up to the level of things like XEmacs in terms of permitting the user to add their own operating features to the system. Now of course Emacs is merely and editor but nevertheless is does permit significant user modifications and the modern operating systems do not. Let me give an example: one thing that I have done is to add a feature where you can put in a file, the name of another file and even also a location in that file. And then with a single key press it will search forward till it finds its file name and go to that filename in place. And I use it for putting references to email messages in my calendar file. That's just one of the uses of it and I asked about the new Google calendar file. Can you put a reference to email messages in there? And the answer is not only can't the user do it, but even the implementers can't do it, but to me anyway it's very useful. When I receive email about a meeting or a seminar, or something like that, to be able to put a link to the email itself into the calendar file and Emacs permitted me to do that myself, without my even having to become a real expert in the inners of it, and I think this will be important.
USA: After Hoboken., Yuba City To Get Its First Sikh Mayor
December 2, 2017 | By Sikh Siyasat Bureau
New York: As per the media reports emanating from the USA, Yuba City council is all set to swore in Vice Mayor Preet Didbal as first Sikh Mayor of the city on Tuesday, 5th December 2017. It will take place at 6 p.m. in Council Chambers at the start of the regular City Council meeting, with a reception to follow.
Last month Ravinder Singh Bhalla after defying all odds and a racial slur was appointed as Mayor of Hoboken city of New Jersey.
Preet Didbal was elected to her first term in 2014 after 8 years of serving on the Yuba City Planning Commission and 2 years on Sutter County Planning Commission. She is beating the odds, breaking cultural, and gender barriers being the first Sikh American woman to be elected Mayor in the United States, reports Action News.
“Seeing someone that looks like you, that comes from the same faith as you, to be elected in a public office in this country is inspiring and exciting. And it's definitely moving,” Jaydeep Singh from Sikh rights group reportedly said.
“When Ravi Bhalla was elected in New Jersey, that was the first time I saw someone who looked like me, who was in a public office in the United States of America,” he adds to his statement while interacting with the NDTV.
Vice Mayor Preet Didbal reportedly said that her priorities, in part, for the city will continue to be it's youth, infrastructure, and public safety. She also plans to stay vigilant on ordinances to regulate marijuana and draw from her roots as a planning commissioner in prioritizing infrastructure and development, with key focus on infill opportunities.

Thierry Neuville says after Hyundai demonstrated it is capable of winning WRC events this year he must show what he can produce at Rally Mexico having thrown away two winning positions in the opening two rounds of 2017.
Neuville has seen victories in Monte Carlo and Sweden slip away due to driver errors that have seen him crash out while leading, something the Belgian driver is solely focused on changing in Mexico.
Neuville says he has full confidence Hyundai will provide him with the package to fight at the front again in the third WRC event of 2017 and is plotting his revenge after a nightmare start to the campaign.
"We are confident that we can perform well," Neuville said. "The car has already demonstrated what it can do in Monte and Sweden, so we have to go out there and show what we know we are capable of. We're determined to fight back.
"Mexico is a unique event and one which brings back happy memories of the team's first WRC podium back in 2014. It is the first hot event of the season, which combined with the fact that the event takes place at such a high altitude, makes it special.
"It's an enjoyable rally; we can really push because of the knowledge and experience we have from the previous seasons."
Having claimed back-to-back WRC rostrums in Mexico in 2013 and 2014, the Belgian driver has somewhat struggled for consistency over the past two years with eighth place in 2015 followed by a retirement last year.

"This program is now on Android which really just completes the major mobile platforms that publishers want to reach around the world," Facebook Instant Articles product manager Michael Reckhow told BuzzFeed News in an interview. "With this scale, it's going to be really exciting to see the engagement that publishers are getting."
Facebook introduced Instant Articles with the hope of improving the experience of people using its app, who often had to wait a number of seconds before an article they clicked on loaded in a normal web browser.
92 - Uranium (U)
Gender: Male (all of my OC elements are male + )
Note: Using HTF digiter
Relative atomic mass: 238
Grouping: Radioactive, Transition metals – Actinides
He is radioactive metal and he can make cool things. The most stable isotope is U-238 (4.468×10^9 years). His U-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile. He can create atomic bomb. He creates first nuclear bomb used in war aka Little Boy. He is like being a military that he can make weapons such as high-density penetrators, tank armor and other removable vehicle armor, counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material by using his depleted uranium. He can fuel nuclear power plants. He also can create colorful (usually green) uranium glasses, uranium glazes, pottery glazes and uranium tile. He can make photographic chemicals, lamp filaments, to improve the appearance of dentures and leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. He also can target X-ray in the making of high-energy X-rays.
Appearance – His body is silvery gray metallic because of pure uranium. His belly, hair and tail are green that is the colour of most uranium glass. Back of his hair is from green to yellow because normal colour of uranium glass ranges from yellow to green depending on the oxidation state and concentration of the metal ions. His glasses lenses are made out of uranium glass. He has symbols of Uranus on his arms (uranium named after planet Uranus). He is wearing radioactive necklace because all uranium isotopes are radioactive and Planet Uranus necklace. His back has number '92' represent his atomic number. His front and back of his tail have letter ‘U' represent his atomic symbol.
Any radioactive elements emit glows around their body.

Last month, we looked at military spending by state, and how some states — South Carolina and Virginia, for example — have military spending as a major component of their local economies. Proposing cuts to government spending via military spending would likely be political suicide in any of these places.
But of course military spending is just one type of government spending, and some states are heavily dependent on government spending whether the spending is on civilian federal employees, the military, or transfer payments such as Social Security and Medicare.
Federal Spending as a Percentage of State GDP
If we look at federal spending as a proportion of each state's overall GDP, we find that the recipients are not exactly evenly distributed:
Source: Pew Charitable Trusts (based on data from 2004–2013)
This is all federal spending, so these totals are a combination of military spending, social welfare programs such as Medicare, and ordinary civilian federal spending, including civilian research facilities and other programs funded by federal grants.
These are proportional numbers, so they are a function of both the amount of federal spending and the overall size of GDP. So, in California, for example, which receives immense amounts of government spending, is nevertheless a state where federal spending is offset by a very large private sector. In a more rural state with few major private industries, such as New Mexico, the state shows up as being highly reliant on federal spending.
By this measure, the state most reliant on federal spending is Mississippi where federal spending is equal to 32 percent of the state's GDP. The state least reliant on federal spending is Wyoming where federal spending is equal to 11 percent of the state's GDP:
Source: Pew Charitable Trusts (based on data from 2004–2013)
The above measure gives us a sense of how much federal spending is taking place relative to overall economic activity. But, it tells us little about how much the feds are spending in each state relative to the tax revenue being produced in each state.
To discover that, we need to compare federal spending to tax collections from each state. So, I took gross tax collection by state, and then subtracted refund totals. I then compared the "net" collections to Pew's total federal spending data in each state. (The tax data used was 2013 data.) We can then measure the result in terms of dollars spend in each state per dollar in tax revenue collected. States that have a value of less than a dollar in the map below receive less than a dollar in federal spending for every dollar in taxes paid from that state. So, for example, Ohio receives 91 cents in federal spending for every dollar collected in taxes from Ohio:
I've divided this graph up into "net tax payer states," "break-even states" and "net tax receiver" states. The lightest shade of blue are states that, by far, pay in more than they receive back, such as New Jersey and Minnesota. The next lightest shade of blue are states that are more or less "break even" in the sense that spending and tax collections hover somewhat around a 1-for-1 relationship. The darker blue states are states that receive considerably more in federal spending than they pay in taxes.
Here are all states, including values:
Naturally, these values aren't spread evenly within the states themselves, either. Areas that are more rural and reliant on agriculture will tend to be net tax receiver areas both because farmers and ranchers receive a lot of government subsidies, and also because agricultural work tends to have lower productivity than urban work.
Urban areas, in contrast, produce most of the tax revenue, so highly urbanized states will tend to more often be "break even" or "net tax payer" states.
Other Considerations
One thing that must not be ignored is the fact that the US government spends more than it takes in nationwide. During 2013, for example, the federal government spent a dollar for every 80 cents it took in via taxes.
Nationwide, the tax-spending ratio is not one dollar, but it about $1.20. So, states that are getting around $1.20 back for every dollar extracted in taxes are really just at the national average.
This is being made possible by old-fashioned deficit spending and also by monetization of the debt which the Federal Reserve facilitates by expanding the money supply. Once interest rates rise or the international value of the dollar begins to fall significantly, this sort of overspending will no longer be possible, and many states will find themselves in dire straits. (States that are "net tax payer" or "break even" states will adjust the best to any significant disruptions in federal spending.)
On the other hand, the realities of the central bank tend to favor the richer, more urban states at the expense of the poorer tax-receiver states.
For example, the Fed's war on interest rates tends to more heavily impact communities that have a relatively large number of modest savers and risk-averse investors. By driving down interest rates so far, the Fed is favoring wealthy investors with access to high-yield investments at the expense of ordinary Main-Street households who rely on more conservative, easily-accessed forms of saving and investment, such as savings accounts and CDs. As a result, capital accumulation is negatively impacted most in parts of the country that produce the least tax revenue and have less productive workers.
In other words, the central banking regime perpetuates the current imbalance between net tax payer states and net tax receiver states by making it more difficult for poorer parts of the country to accumulate wealth and increase productivity.
Simultaneously, the money creation process tends to favor the financial sectors in large urban areas at the expense of less urban and poorer areas. Thanks to the way the central bank creates money, it is the urban investor classes that get to spend the new money first — before prices adjust to the new, larger money supply — while more rural, less urban, and less productive parts of the country receive this money only after prices have risen. This further perpetuates the tax-spending imbalance.
So while it is true that urban, coastal taxpayers are often paying more in taxes and financing government spending in other parts of the country, those same taxpayers do indeed benefit from national policy that favors the investor class (and those who work with them) over others. They're paying more taxes because they have higher incomes, but these higher incomes come, to a certain extent, at the expense of Americans outside these corridors of financial power.
Beyond the monetary angle, of course, is the fact that states also are restrained in their ability to fully utilize resources in their own states by federal regulations.
Western states, especially, are not able to access resources on federal lands except in a manner consistent with federal laws written primarily by politicians from outside the state. Such policies are unresponsive to local needs and economic realities.
And, of course, trade regulations, when implemented at the national level, may have significant negative impacts on certain states that are not free to negotiate their own trade arrangements with foreign economies.
The Jones Act and trade barriers on sugar are just two examples.
While we can see that the net tax receiver states do indeed benefit from large amounts of federal spending, we must also take into account the fact that federal policy may also be hobbling those local economies while favoring and redirecting wealth toward the net tax payer states.
That is, the tax-and-spend wealth transfers from net taxpayer states to net tax receiver states could be viewed as something that merely helps to diminish the effects of impoverishment that are the result of national policy. Were it not for these policies, it is entirely possible that these net tax receiver areas would not have become so reliant on federal spending in the first place.
French scholar and translator
Anne Dacier, née Le Fèvre
Anne Le Fèvre Dacier (1647 – 17 August 1720), better known during her lifetime as Madame Dacier, was a French scholar, translator, commentator and editor of the classics, including the Iliad and the Odyssey. She sought to champion ancient literature and used her great capabilities in Latin and Greek for this purpose as well as for her own financial support, producing a series of editions and translations from which she earned her living.[1] She was the dedicatee of Gilles Ménage's Historia mulierum philosopharum, whose characterisation of her and of Anna Maria van Schurman was used to provide leading examples in treatises arguing for female education across the following centuries.[1][2]
Early life and education [ edit ]
The exact date of her birth is not known and sources differ in their opinions: 1647 is proposed by Frade and Wyles and also Conley in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy; the Encyclopædia Britannica suggests 1654; and the Catholic Encyclopedia 1651. The only known portrait of her, dated 1854, has her death at the age of 68,[3] suggesting 1651–52. Dacier was raised in Saumur, a town in the Loire region of France, and taught both Latin and ancient Greek by her father, Tanneguy Le Fèvre. In 1683 she married one of her father's students, André Dacier (also engaged in classical studies and translations albeit his work is considered by encyclopedia editors to be far inferior to hers).[4]
Classical editions and translations [ edit ]
Her father died in 1672, after which she moved to Paris, carrying with her part of an edition of Callimachus, which she published in 1674. She gained further work through a friend of her father, Pierre-Daniel Huet, then assistant tutor to the Dauphin and responsible for the Ad usum Delphini series of editions (commonly known as the Delphin Classics). He commissioned her to produce editions of: Publius Annius Florus (1674), Dictys Cretensis (1680), Sextus Aurelius Victor (1681) and Eutropius (1683).
In 1681 her prose version of Anacreon and Sappho appeared, and in the next few years, she published prose versions of Terence and some of the plays of Plautus and Aristophanes. In 1684 she and her husband retired to Castres, with the object of devoting themselves to theological studies. In 1685 the Daciers were rewarded with a pension by Louis XIV of France for their conversion to Roman Catholicism.[6]
In 1699 her prose translation of the Iliad appeared, which earned her the esteem in which she is held in French literature. It was followed nine years later by a similar translation of the Odyssey, which Alexander Pope found useful. Dacier in turn published in 1724 remarks on Pope's translation of the former (1715–20), which gained her some fame in England as well.[7]
Controversy [ edit ]
The Iliad, which made Homer known for the first time to many French men of letters (including Antoine Houdar de la Motte) gave rise to a famous literary controversy. In 1714, La Motte published a poetical version of the Iliad, abridged and altered to suit his own taste, together with a Discours sur Homère, stating the reasons why Homer failed to satisfy his critical taste. Mme. Dacier replied in the same year in her work, Des causes de la corruption du goût (“Of the Causes of the Corruption of Taste”). In defending Homer, Dacier "developed her own philosophical aesthetics. She insists on the centrality of taste as an indicator of the level of civilization, both moral and artistic, within a particular culture."[8]
La Motte carried on the discussion with light gaiety and badinage, and had the happiness of seeing his views supported by the abbé Jean Terrasson, who in 1715 produced two volumes entitled Dissertation critique sur L'Iliade, in which he maintained that science and philosophy, and especially the science and philosophy of René Descartes, had so developed the human mind that the poets of the eighteenth century were immeasurably superior to those of ancient Greece.[6]
In the same year, Claude Buffier published Homère en arbitrage, in which he concluded that both parties were really agreed on the essential point that Homer was one of the greatest geniuses the world had seen, and that, as a whole, no other poem could be preferred to his; and, soon after (on 5 April 1716) in the house of Jean-Baptiste de Valincourt, Mme. Dacier and La Motte met at supper, and drank to the health of Homer.[6]

Cash Cab is the latest game show to get rebooted in recent months. The Gong Show was recently revived at ABC, which also is home to Celebrity Family Feud, Match Game and $100,000 Pyramid. ABC also has been casting for a new iteration of Battle of the Network Stars. And Fox has a reboot of Love Connection with Andy Cohen set to debut in summer.
Harling Point, The Harpoon Erratic, and Migmatite Bedrock Updated geology, Oct. 10, 2013.
By Bud Hardwick, Bellingham; additional geology by Gerri McEwen (U Vic).
Reference: The Geology of Southern Vancouver Island, A Field Guide. C. J. Yorath, H. W. Nasmith. 1995, Orca Book Publishers, Victoria, and an unpublished undergraduate thesis by Gerri McEwen.
Harling Point protrudes into the Strait of Juan de Fuca at the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island. It is located in the municipality of Oak Bay, immediately east of Victoria. The shoreline geology at the point is complexly folded seafloor volcanic rocks overlain by marine mudstone. Overlying Pleistocene deposits are highlighted by the Harling Point erratic and glacial grooves and striae.
The Harling Point Erratic, also known as Harpoon or Devilfish Rock, is exceptional both in appearance and location. So distinctive is its appearance that oral legends among the Songhees First Nations people about this stone have been passed down to the present day. The stone's vertical orientation is said to have resulted when a disrespectful complaining seal fishermen was turned into a stone harpoon by the angry Transformer. Another legend explains that if one were to walk out to the stone and touch it (low tide is necessary) the protein rich devilfish (Pacific octopus) would rise up and be easily captured.
The geologic setting of this large vertical stone is worth noting. The erratic sits on a bedrock platform of marine mudstone scoured by sediment carried in the base of the Vashon glacial lobe around 15,000 years ago. The large, long parallel grooves are unmistakable. It is easy to imagine (if not correctly) that this very stone was responsible for the groove it straddles.
The hilly outcrop to the east of the Chinese cemetery is folded ocean floor volcanic rock. The mudstone north of the Harpoon erratic was deposited on top of it in deep water.
The human history of this area is also outstanding. Besides the millennia of use by the indigenous people this small point figured in the more recent history of a colony and later a young nation. In the time of sailing ship dominance the point was known as Foul Point for the many submerged rocks that could damage or sink ships rounding too close to shore. In the early 1900s, displaced Chinese immigrants made this deserted piece of land the location for their cemetery with its rare funerary burner, at which time it was called Chinese Point. In the 1930s a local dentist, Dr. Fred Harling, died while attempting to rescue a family caught in a small boat during a storm off this point. It was subsequently renamed Harling Point to honor his bravery and selfless sacrifice.
When visiting Harling Point be respectful of the cemetery and funerary structures which are part of the National Historic Site. Interpretive panels describe the point's cultural history, geology, and natural history including the rare and protected flowers that bloom in the spring. A trail corridor located outside the southeast entrance to the cemetery, allows for a short pleasant hike to or from Trafalgar Park Lookout on a bluff a short distance to the east on equally scenic Beach Drive. Inland and above the cemetery but clearly visible are the interesting summits of Gonzales and Walbron Parks. Seaward views from the shoreline and the surrounding parks are exceptional.
For an interesting walk along more glacial “tracks” visit nearby Westsong Way along the west shore of Victoria's Inner Harbor (coming next on Northwest Geology Field Trips). You can record the orientation of the glacial grooves with a compass and compare them to different locations and see for yourself the deflection forced on the glaciers as they rounded the southern end of Vancouver Island.
Getting there:
2099 Penzance Rd, Oak Bay, Vancouver Island; approximate coordinates N 48° 24.348′ W 123° 19.338′
From the south shore of Victoria below Beacon Hill, follow scenic Dallas Road east and continue as it becomes Crescent Road in Oak Bay. Soon after passing Gonzales Bay, follow Crescent Road as it turns sharply south (right). In a short distance take Penzance Road angling off to the left and continue along the cemetery fence-line to the east gate. The Harling Point erratic can be found through the gate and directly south close to shore but in the tidal zone. It is best seen or visited during lower tides. Please be respectful of the cemetery and protected natural areas. BC transit buses from downtown go to the Gonzales stop, only two blocks north of the point.

WASHINGTON -- Ken Starr, the former Reagan administration appeals court judge who spent years investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton, thinks Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) should hold hearings and a vote on President Barack Obama's choice to succeed Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.
Starr served six years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit -- where Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, now presides as chief judge -- before becoming President George H.W. Bush's solicitor general. Current Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was Starr's deputy.
The former judge, now president of Baylor University, rose to notoriety as the independent counsel who spent four years probing the Clintons over their Whitewater investments and Monica Lewinsky, among other things. Democrats routinely cast the investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt.
Speaking on a panel at his university Wednesday, Starr argued that the Senate has a responsibility to vote on Garland, the Waco Tribune reported.
“Good government calls for us to have a hearing and vote up or down,” Starr said at the event where he also profusely praised Scalia, who died in mid-February, prompting McConnell to announce a blockade of any Obama nominee to replace him.
But Starr also granted Garland a ringing endorsement to fill the conservative jurist's vacant seat.
“He's superbly qualified,” said Starr of Obama's nominee. “I had the privilege of knowing the chief judge for many years. Unfortunately, I never served with him, but we have rubbed shoulders professionally for several decades and he is, again, superbly qualified.”
A spokesman for McConnell declined to provide a comment.

He didn't fail. He succeeded at being what he wanted to be, which was ‘the respected partner of Rose aka an alien war general' and ‘Steven's dad'. He still makes music in his spare time and loves it, but his priority #1 (by choice NOT because he isn't good for anything else) is Steven.
He was Steven's primary caretaker until he hit the limits of what he could teach (aka gem stuff), and he gave Steven a loving, nurturing life full of physical affection, musical tutoring, family traditions and outings.
I don't think the gems pay for Steven's cell phone subscription. I'm pretty damn sure that Greg thought a phone with music storage capacity for his son was a better use of his cash than anything for himself. He's content living in the van, I think – he strikes me as being pretty zen– but he does have needs.
He always puts those needs second for Steven, except the once, which was such a huge anomaly we got an entire story arc about it.
Reviewers make a lot of how Steven seems to have ‘inherited' Rose's kind nature– bull. Bull and shit. Yes to some extent he does have Rose in him, but to ignore how much of his nurturing and forgiving nature he LEARNED from Greg is just lazy.
Greg Universe's lover laughed in his face when he asked her if she respected him and he stuck around and talked it out like a goddamn adult.
Greg Universe had his home wrecked because he helped the Crystal Gems fight off Lapis and never turned his distress on them.
Greg Universe got pushed off a fucking roof because a badly socialized tech support agent wanted to see if he could fly and immediately forgave her because she didn't know any better.
Greg has never told his son to ‘man up' or ‘butch up' or ‘toughen up'. Greg would have stared blankly if anyone ever suggested that he was ‘babysitting' his own child. Greg is a huge part of why Steven is who he is and he chose to be there because he never for a second questioned or shirked his responsibility as a father.
Inside Final Fantasy XIII-2's Casino And Chocobo Races
By Spencer . October 27, 2011 . 11:51pm
That's Hope, director of research at the Academy, and his assistant Alyssa. It appears Noel is showing them how he and Serah can travel through time while they're visiting Academia.
Monsters are the third party member in Final Fantasy XIII-2 and each creature has their own special attack called a Feral Link. Looks like the Tonberry is up to its old tricks with its lantern and little knife. Chocobos were in the last build of Final Fantasy XIII-2 I got to play and they have a kicking combo. Players will also see the flightless birds in Xanadu. The casino area has slot machines that look like futuristic bikes and chocobo racing where you can win a chocodagger.
Temporal Rifts (aka Labyrinth of Time in Japan) are puzzle-like areas where you have to collect all of the crystals and then reach a goal before time runs out. Players will see these throughout the game within the main story.

Re: Super Strength and Ripping off Limbs Quote: Doctor Thantos Originally Posted by So I have a player whom next session, is going to try and rip off the limbs of his opponents. He is super strong (ST40) But what is the mechanism?

If they do 5x the limb hits does it automatically come off? 10X?
Any thoughts?
Thanks
Try a HT+4 roll, maybe at a penalty of (say) -1 per HP past the full HP required to cause you to roll HT+4 in teh first place.
So at ST 25 (5d-1 swing), a max-damage roll of 24 points to a HT 10/HP 10 person would put 14 points over the "maybe it comes off" threshold. That's a roll of HT-10, or HT 0 . . . it comes right off.
To do this on an average damge roll, you'd need to swing damage of about 6d+2 or 7d-1, or ST 37-40.
Since someone with ST 40 has a basic lift sufficient to exert 2500 lbs. of force with a two-handed lift, having an arm come off under this load doesn't break my suspension of disbelief much. At all. :-) I would use Wrench Limb. It's a ST-based roll made after grappling the limb. Make a grapple using two hands of your foe's arm, win a Quick Contest of your Wrench Limb technique (Martial Arts, p. 82) vs. the best of your foe's ST or HT, and then roll swing damage.Well, ST 10 swing damage can be had for 2d-2 on the best roll, which is ST 13 (2d-1). You can do even worse with an All-Out Attack.Try a HT+4 roll, maybe at a penalty of (say) -1 per HP past the full HP required to cause you to roll HT+4 in teh first place.So at ST 25 (5d-1 swing), a max-damage roll of 24 points to a HT 10/HP 10 person would put 14 points over the "maybe it comes off" threshold.

As the morning school bell rings and students rush through crowded corridors, teenagers in one Portland classroom settle onto mats and meditation pillows. They fall silent after the teacher taps a Tibetan "singing bowl."
"Allow yourself to settle into the experience of being here, in this moment," teacher Caverly Morgan tells two dozen students at Wilson High School.
The students are enrolled in a for-credit, year-long mindfulness class meant to ease youth anxiety and depression and to prevent violence. For 90 minutes, three days a week, they practice a mix of yoga, sitting and walking meditation, visualization techniques, deep breathing, journaling and non-judgmental listening.
The idea behind mindfulness is that focusing on the present moment helps a person deal better with stress, difficult emotions and negative thoughts.
Mindfulness, yoga and meditation have gained popularity among Americans in recent decades, buoyed by studies showing their benefits to emotional, mental and physical health. The centuries-old practices have roots in Buddhism and Hinduism, but Western culture has secularized them to focus on physical postures, breathing and relaxation techniques.
Such practices are now offered by corporations like Google, Target and General Mills to their employees. Prison inmates, hospital patients and the U.S. Marines are using them to combat stress and illness, increase focus and well-being. And now schools all over the country are introducing the practices.
Some people have greeted the move with less than enthusiasm.
Last year, an elementary school in Ohio ended its mindfulness program after parents complained it was too closely linked to Eastern religion and a conservative Christian law firm unsuccessfully sued on behalf of a couple in Encinitas, California, arguing their school district's yoga classes indoctrinate children.
But many school districts are reporting success.
In Richmond, California, where a teacher started a mindfulness program called the Mindful Life Project, schools have reported drops in detentions and referrals among low-income, at-risk youth.
The school district in South Burlington, Vermont, implemented a successful mindfulness course as part of a health and wellness program, and now administrators there have written a manual on incorporating mindfulness into K-12 curriculums.
Portland is known for its progressivism, so it should be no surprise the idea of teaching mindfulness is being embraced here. Students at Wilson say the class has been a boon for them.
"Sometimes I have trouble breathing, I have panic attacks. This class helps me bring more attention to my breath and overcome that," junior Cassia McIntyre said. "I'm less stressed out and able to better cope with stress."
The class is the brainchild of Morgan, who trained at a Zen Buddhist monastery for eight years and started a meditation center in Sacramento. After moving to Portland two years ago, Morgan teamed up with Allyson Copacino, who teaches yoga to children.
The two started an after-school program at Wilson. After hundreds of students signed up, principal Brian Chatard took note. The school was dealing with a student's suicide, and few resources were available to address students' emotional and mental health.
Chatard said high school years are hard for many students, because they entail emotional and hormonal changes, social and academic pressures — and for some, depression.
"High school is the hardest period of time for kids," Chatard said. "You've got emotional changes, hormonal changes, all the social pressures. It's also the onset of mental illness for some kids, depression hits, and there's the pressure of college and sports. All these things kids do is overwhelming without having a strategy to deal with it."
During a class in October, after a half-hour of yoga exercises, Morgan asked students to visualize a stressful moment in their lives and notice the negative internal dialogue in their heads.
Students wrote the negative self-talk in a journal, then shared it with the class and practiced compassionate — non-judgmental — listening in pairs.
Learning how to recognize the "inner critic" is crucial for teens, Morgan said.
"It's very important that teens learn how to do that, because that critical voice leads to behaviors that are extremely unhealthy, such as overeating, bullying, even committing suicide," Morgan said.
Pediatric psychologists at Oregon Health & Science University are partnering with the mindfulness program to study its impact on students.
A similar year-long program is offered at Rosemary High School, an alternative school in nearby Gresham that serves students who were expelled or dropped out, are homeless or single parents.
Unlike at Wilson, mindfulness at Rosemary is mandatory for some 70 students, many of whom knew little or nothing about it. Some of the students were initially skeptical and complained about the course, the principal, Erica Stavis, said.
But on mid-term reviews, students reported the class had helped them better recognize their feelings, deal with anger and distance themselves from destructive thoughts during difficult family situations.
"This program filled a gap," Stavis said. "It helps students build capacity to problem-solve."
Once a Raider, always a Raider.
Free agent center Samson Satele, who started 42 games for the Oakland Raiders as an offensive lineman, was arrested early Saturday morning in Hawaii, according to reports.
Satele, a native of Hawaii, was arrested in the town of Aiea, just west of Honolulu, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
He was arrested for disorderly conduct in a shopping center noted for late-night bars and clubs, the newspaper reported. Police took him into custody at around 4 a.m. and he was released on $500 bail at 4:50 a.m., the newspaper reported.
Further details were not available.
Satele has an address in Kapolei, a town on Oahu's leeward -- or west -- shore.
Satele, 27, was the Raiders' starting center for the past three seasons. He started 15 of 16 games for Oakland at that position.
He attended high school in Kailua, on the island's east side, and played at the University of Hawaii-Manoa.
He is a free agent.

The Darlington Memorial Fountain in Judiciary Square was dedicated in 1923 to honor D.C. lawyer Joseph J. Darlington. The statue, by sculptor C. Paul Jennewein, was controversial when it was erected. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)
In 1923, the lawyers of Washington realized that they had a problem. A lot of people in town had decided they were creepy perverts.
How were they to convince the local citizenry that this was not the case?
The uproar arose when a new fountain was installed in November. The fountain honored a District lawyer named Joseph J. Darlington. Born in 1849 in South Carolina, Darlington came to Washington to study at the law school of Columbian University (known today as George Washington University). He eventually became one of the city's keenest legal minds, and when he died in 1920, at age 71, he was considered the dean of the Washington bar.
Friends and colleagues immediately pooled their money to build Darlington a fitting monument. What was lowered in place atop a plinth at Fifth Street NW and Indiana Avenue in Judiciary Square was a naked lady and a deer.
“Tawdry” is how Judge William DeLacey described the statue. “Repulsive,” said the Rev. John C. Ball of Metropolitan Baptist Church. The Rev. John E. Briggs, pastor of Fifth Baptist Church, where Darlington worshiped, denied that he had termed the statue a “blasphemy” but said that Darlington wouldn't have liked it.
“Tawdry” and “repulsive” were some of the first comments made about the Darlington Memorial Fountain. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)
The Washington Post interviewed a lawyer who quipped that perhaps the statue was meant to symbolize a woman summoned by the U.S. Marshals for hunting without a license — and without clothes.
As the uproar grew, the secretary of the District's bar association felt it necessary to stress that the money to erect the statue came from private contributions. If his group had been involved, he said, “it is possible that the present statue would not have been approved.” In other words: Don't blame us.
Even those observers who averred that the statue was art, and not smut, said it was still inappropriate.
George Julian Zolnay, a prominent sculptor, said, “True art invariably is a matter of fitness.” He didn't mean fitness as in toned abs, but as in a specific link to the person honored. If Darlington had been a hunter, Zolnay said, the Diana-like statue might have been suitable. But what did a naked maiden standing next to a fawn have to do with one of Washington's most powerful attorneys?
This controversy erupted 22 years after the dedication of the memorial Answer Man wrote about last week, the statue of prominent Mason (and Confederate general) Albert Pike. Standing across Judiciary Square from the Darlington fountain, it was what a lot of people back then thought a monument should be: a big, honking likeness of a dead person. For many, the Darlington memorial was altogether too weird. It's a sentiment not dissimilar to the criticism that Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial faced.
[Why is Confederate general Albert Pike memorialized at Judiciary Square?]
Frank Hogan — head of the Darlington memorial committee and founder of what became the powerhouse D.C. law firm Hogan Lovells — finally decided it was time to set the record straight. Although the statue was privately funded, he explained, it needed the approval of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. The commission did not want merely an effigy of a man, but “something artistically beautiful.”
A half-dozen sculptors had entered the design competition. Each was furnished with a dossier of Darlington's professional accomplishments and, more important, his personal characteristics. Darlington's “constant charities” — his thoughtfulness, tenderness, philanthropy, consideration of others — were more worthy of being permanently enshrined than his greatness as a lawyer.
And that's what the winning statue, by German-born sculptor C. Paul Jennewein and approved by Darlington's two daughters, was meant to symbolize.
Art can lose something when you have to explain it, but Hogan planked out the statue's meaning for anyone too dense to get it. The beautiful maiden, he said, represented God's best human handiwork. She symbolized humanity at its finest: considerate and tender. So tender, in fact, that a deer had come to the maiden's side for care and succor, just as, Hogan implied, a defendant might come to a lawyer.
Yes, the maiden was nude, but that's the “better to represent her as she came from the hands of her Creator, rather than the hands of a dressmaker.”
Seventy years later, another Jennewein piece was to cause controversy. A bare-breasted maiden he'd created for the Justice Department distracted John Ashcroft so much that the attorney general ordered it hidden behind curtains.
Within the larger controversy of the naked lady in Judiciary Square was a smaller one: When Jennewein arrived to inspect the statue's installation, he saw that it had been set up facing the wrong direction. He ordered the workers to lift it and rotate it 180 degrees.
Darlington's colleagues had to chuckle. The old lawyer had won many cases, but more than a few were overturned in the U.S. Court of Appeals, the building that the gold-bottomed maiden was now mooning.

Nearer The Moon
Specialising in luxury independent erotic lingerie
Nearer The Moon is an independent ethically made lingerie company based in the UK. I started the company after finding current traditionally "sexy" lingerie options were seriously lacking.
I am here to buck the trend of homogenised, poor quality and poorly fitting erotic lingerie by keeping my brand independent of investors, sourcing fabric and making the garments myself and offering bespoke sizing options where possible.
Currently I run the business online with pop ups 5-6 times a year with alternative themed events.
Our pop ups at Le Boutique Bazaar in London have proved a great success already!
I started selling on the Etsy.com marketplace and in 2014 I was able to expand to selling on a standalone site nearerthemoon.com.
I have been looking for opportunities to connect with customers in person in a mainstream fashion location for the last 6 months in order to convey the quality and craftsmanship in the lingerie I create. Take a look at the sewing process below...
Opportunity
Nearer The Moon has been offered an amazing opportunity to trade in the brand new "Rinse Showrooms" in the Brick Lane area of London.
"Located in the heart of London's East End 'The Old Truman Brewery' has for some 20 years been the artistic epicentre for the area's regeneration and at the forefront of Brick Lane's creative revolution.
Drawing upon this experience 'Rinse Showrooms' will offer an opportunity for aspiring young designers to exhibit their work with bespoke units...for trading Thursday through to Sunday.
Located directly at the entrance to the Backyard Market on Brick Lane footfall is plentiful with approximately 25,000 individuals visiting the entire site each weekend."
As you can see this is an opportunity I do not want to miss! I have extensive luxury retail sales experience and know that with access to the right customers in the right location I can push Nearer The Moon to the next level.
Independent ethically made lingerie for all!
Having a semi-permanent showroom style space will not only benefit Nearer The Moon customers in London or the UK. It will be a way to create more capital to fund bigger, better and more intricate collections to sell online and it will provide a space for press and buyers to see the collection in person hopefully creating further reach for the company.
Budget
I currently have the working capital free to commit to just a couple of weeks but as it is a semi-permanent showroom, I believe three months of rent is the minimum needed in order to ensure footfall is high enough for it to become a self-sustaining endeavour. Without negotiation this currently stands at £1100 for the smallest space.
Past retail displays of Nearer The Moon
Once I have the capital, I plan to negotiate on this price to allow the space to be funded by this project longer or to allow for a slightly larger space.
I will also need to create stock to have enough to sell and sizes for customers to try on (there is a changing room available for use at the showroom).
I have been working on creating stock for current ranges and am slowly building up a good range of in stock items when cash flow allows buying materials in bulk but it is not enough to stock a full retail space. I believe I would need £800 to create enough stock for the first 3 months of selling in this busy area.
Current collection to make stock for...
I also need to merchandise the space to fit with the Nearer The Moon brand. This would include purchasing items like grid wall mesh panels, more hangers & having marketing materials printed such as brand signage and swing tickets. I estimate this to come £500.
I'm allocating three weeks to fund the project. Even though that leaves me just a few days to purchase everything for the showroom, this opportunity has only just presented itself & I will not be able to lay much marketing groundwork before the launch of the KickStarter so I have added time to allow for this.

Columbus, with 1,800 residents, sits just across the border from Las Palomas, a Mexican town about 75 miles west of El Paso. Many families have relatives on both sides of the line. Hundreds of children cross every morning from Las Palomas to attend school in Columbus. But drug violence has strained the relationship. Columbus residents recount how the mayor of Las Palomas was killed some years back and how a popular dentist was taken away, never to be seen again. Although such violence has not spread to Columbus, residents say, the influence of the drug trafficking groups in Las Palomas has definitely reached north.
“We don't like to say much because we don't want to lose our lives,” said Mr. Dean, the historian.
The arrests and the guilty pleas that some of the defendants have entered, though, speak volumes.
“This town should be a lovely tourist attraction, but people aren't coming,” said Mr. Dean, who runs a local museum and almost singlehandedly tries to keep the legend of that Pancho Villa raid alive. “People say, ‘Oh, it's too dangerous there.' And this has not helped our reputation.”

The evidence against Columbus's leaders laid out in court documents leaves residents here shaking their heads in disbelief. “What can I say?” said Martha Skinner, a former mayor who runs a bed-and-breakfast in Columbus called Martha's Place. “No one knew these guys were selling guns to the bad guys. We found out that morning. It was like Afghanistan.”
The smuggling ring bought about 200 automatic weapons from a gun store in New Mexico and transported them across the border to Mexico, according to the indictment. Bullets and body armor were also purchased in New Mexico for use by drug traffickers in Mexico, prosecutors say.
Blas Gutierrez, the jailed village trustee, is accused of arranging the deals with an inmate in a Mexican prison and using a Columbus police vehicle to transport weapons. Mayor Eddie Espinoza, who is related to Mr. Gutierrez by marriage, has already pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme and, on Thursday, Police Chief Angelo Vega also entered a guilty plea in federal court in Las Cruces.
In 1916, soldiers with the United States 13th Cavalry Regiment were stationed in Columbus, and at other points along the border, as part of an effort to keep the Mexican Revolution from spilling into the United States, Mr. Dean said. With Mexico in the midst of a drug war, those same concerns exist today. Mr. Dean said that with Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops in the area there was more of a security presence than a century ago.

After the Villa raid, in which the invading Mexicans had tried to torch Columbus into oblivion, the population of the village actually swelled as President Woodrow Wilson ordered in more soldiers for protection.

The recent arrests, however, may have the opposite effect and doom Columbus entirely. Ms. Lawson, who was appointed to replace the arrested mayor, has found the village's books in such disarray, with hints of huge debts and reckless spending, that she fears that Columbus may soon lose its incorporation status and be taken over by Luna County.
At a meeting of the village board on Wednesday night, it was clear how deep Columbus's financial hole had become. The fire chief pleaded with the village board to get serious and finish the paperwork for a state grant that had already been tentatively approved to finance a fire truck that the village had already taken possession of. As discussion went back and forth, he stormed out.
“If you want, I will put the pumper in the parking lot tomorrow with a ‘For Sale' sign on it,” he said.
To save money, the village has disbanded its six-person police department, which had had eight police chiefs over the last five years, and contracted with the Luna County Sheriff's Department for law enforcement. “Violation of public trust is probably one of the most heinous crimes that can be perpetrated on the public,” Sheriff Raymond Cobos told reporters. “I mean, it's horrible.”
The village also wiped out its code enforcement, animal control and recreation departments because it lacked the money to operate them. “We're dangling on the edge,” the mayor said. “We try not to look over. We try to climb back up. But I don't know if we can survive.”

Kronos 1, Deep Space Exploration Vehicle.
This is probably my most ambitious space project so far. I've been working on this spacecraft for quite a while now, several months of all the design work that includes the spacecraft design, interiors, mission structure and goals, functional design of different sections of the vehicle and some other technical details. For now I wanted to present to you a 3d model that took almost a month to make and there are still lots of stuff to do. Anyway, I wanted to tease you a bit and share some of my excitement for this project, full presentation of the Kronos 1 mission coming later this year.
PS - Any resemblance to Hermes spacecraft from The Martian is pretty much coincidental and mostly comes from the research and lots of thinking about realistic long duration crewed space missions. It just means that both me and The Martian crew, did their research on space vehicles

Statutory Town in Colorado, United States
Fairplay is the statutory town that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Park County, Colorado, United States.[8] Fairplay is located in South Park at an elevation of 9,953 feet (3,034 m). The town is the fifth-highest incorporated place in the State of Colorado.[5] The population was 679 at the U.S. Census 2010.
History [ edit ]
A historic gold mining settlement, the town was founded in 1859 during the early days of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. The town was named by settlers who were upset by the generous mining claims given to the earliest prospectors and promised a more equitable system for its residents.[9][10] The town of Fairplay was incorporated in 1872.[11]
Front Street, late 1800s
It is the largest community in the grassland basin of Colorado known as South Park, sitting on the west edge of the basin at the junction of U.S. Highway 285 and State Highway 9. It is on a hillside just east of the Middle Fork South Platte River, near where Highway 9 ascends the river valley northward to Alma and Hoosier Pass. It is a quiet town, and the roads surrounding it have a low volume of traffic. Although it was founded during the initial placer mining boom, the mines in the area continued to produce gold and silver ore for many decades up through the middle of the 20th century.
The town consists of modern retail businesses along the highway, as well as a historic town on the bluff above the river along Front Street. The northern extension of Front Street along the river has been preserved and has become the site of relocated historic structures as an open-air museum called South Park City, intended to recreate the early days of the Colorado Gold Rush. Most of the residences in town are located on the hillside west of US Highway 285 and east of State Highway 9, in the vicinity of the schools and Park County Courthouse. The majority of the streets in town were finally paved in 2005.
The Town of Fairplay, is the visual basis for the Town of South Park, in the television series South Park.[12] The people in the show are influenced by Boulder, Colorado, where creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker attended college at the University of Colorado.
From 1966 to 1984, the asbestos-ridden McNamara Building in Fairplay, now demolished, had been the community hospital. It was named for Dr. Edward Bradley McNamara, a former U.S. Army doctor in World War II, who moved to Fairplay in 1962 from Michigan. He died working in the emergency room of his namesake hospital in August 1973. The hospital, built with Hill-Burton Act funds, had financial woes from the start. Before it was condemned and vacated in 2009, it had been used by several successive clinics and by Park County for office space. A previous eight-bed Park County Hospital had operated in Fairplay as early as 1892 and preceded the McNamara Hospital. Both facilities had been mainly for emergencies, obstetrics, and minor surgery, and later for nursing home care.[13]
In 1874, the Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson built in Fairplay the still-standing Sheldon Jackson Memorial Chapel, since renamed the South Park Community Church, a one-room Victorian Gothic Revival structure which was listed in 1977 on the National Register of Historic Places.[14]
Geography [ edit ]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all of it land.

Burro Days [ edit ]
The Burro Days festival is held on the last weekend of July.[18] The event celebrates the town's mining heritage. The main feature of the festival is a 29-mile burro race over rough terrain and approximately 3,000-ft elevation gain from downtown Fairplay to the 13,000-ft summit of Mosquito Pass. Teams consist of one person and one burro. The race takes about five hours to complete; first prize is $1,000. Previously, the first prize included an ounce of gold. There are several other burro races in Colorado, the most notable takes place in Leadville.
The Fairplay event is the World Championship of Burro Racing, an ultra-marathon and the longest burro race in the state.[19] For many years (in the 1960s and early 1970s) the Burro race took place from Leadville to Fairplay, or vice versa, crossing over Mosquito Pass. This followed the route that Father John Lewis Dyer of the Methodist Episcopal Church used for circuit riding and for carrying mail. With time, the rivalry between the two cities ended this cooperative endeavor.
The 64th burro race, held in Fairplay on July 28–29, 2012, despite rain attracted a record crowd of more than ten thousand persons. Llama races are held on the Saturday prior to the Sunday burro run. Burro Days is the major fundraiser for area schools.[20] The 2012 winner of the 29.5-mile long course is George Zack of Broomfield, Colorado, with his burro "Jack." The 2011 winner of the long course, Karen Thorpe of Durango, won the 2012 short course of 14.5 miles. There were fifty-seven entries in the burro contests in 2012.[21]

In popular culture [ edit ]
The town has become mildly famous in recent years as the town depicted in the South Park animated television series on Comedy Central. Although the geographical references contained in several episodes imply that Fairplay is the model for South Park, it is much smaller and more rustic than its fictional counterpart, which has a more suburban character. Co-creator Trey Parker grew up in Conifer and went to high school in Evergreen, both of which are somewhat more affluent mountain communities immediately west of Denver in Jefferson County. Co-creator Matt Stone lived in the Denver suburb of Littleton.
Because the town is a regional center of government and commerce, the term "South Park" has historically been used in the town in the naming of institutions and business, including South Park High School (the namesake of which appears in the series). The elementary school is Edith Teter Elementary and the middle school is South Park Middle School.
Although the town of South Park is based upon the real life town of Fairplay, the latter is mentioned by Gerald Broflovski in the episode "Night of the Living Homeless" and described as "4 miles away" in "Jakovasaurs", which implies that it is a separate town in the show. The county seat offices in Fairplay are seen, though not mentioned by name, in the episode "Stanley's Cup". In "T.M.I." the Pissed Off and Angry Party invade a FedEx Office location which the news reporter reports as the Fairplay FedEx.
A South Park parallel to the Burro race can be found in the "Cow Days" episode.

Two more fast food franchises are cutting worker hours in order to avoid paying for Obamacare-mandated employee health care.
According to local Nebraska NBC affiliate WOWT, around 100 Wendy's employees in the Omaha area are going to see their hours reduced to 28 hours a week, meaning they will no longer qualify for the health care benefits which Obamacare mandates for full-time employees. A Taco Bell in Guthrie, Oklahoma has reportedly adopted a similar policy.
Other restaurant chains have tried to dodge Obamacare costs, with mixed results. After a Florida Denny's franchise added a 5% “Obamacare surcharge” to customers' checks, the CEO of Denny's publicly reprimanded the franchise's owner. Darden Restaurants—the owner of Olive Garden and Red Lobster—is evidently still going forward with its own experiment in reducing Obamacare costs, though the company was forced to “clarify” its position following a public backlash and subsequent drop in earnings.
It remains to be seen whether a similar fate will befall Nebraska Wendy's restaurants. What is known is that the industry-wide shift to part-time labor has very little to do with the Affordable Care Act, and is likely to proceed apace regardless of developments in the nation's health care infrastructure.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that about half of all fast food employees already work part-time, and that the number of Americans forced into involuntary part-time labor has been increasing since 2006 [PDF].
The trend precedes Obamacare by a few years, and the cost of the legislation to large businesses is in fact rather negligible—4.3%, according to the Urban Institute [PDF]. Meanwhile, fast food work is still the lowest-paying occupation in America, even as the profits of major fast food companies have increased since the 2008 financial collapse.
A cautionary tale of a vibrant and thriving culture lost in time, these photographs collected on a community Facebook page in Afghanistan are likely to leave you in disbelief. The country we're so often shown today is comparable to a broken medieval society, but not so long ago, the barren landscape was dotted with stylish buildings, women wore pencil skirts and teenagers shopped at record stores.
As you browse the photos that capture progress, hope and that rock'n'roll spirit in the air, keep in mind the implications of what happened to this culture in just a few decades.

Mohammad Qayoumi grew up in Kabul during the 60s and 70s and many of his photographs are featured on the Facebook page's collection. This is the Afghanistan he remembers:
A half-century ago, Afghan women pursued careers in medicine; men and women mingled casually at movie theaters and university campuses in Kabul; factories in the suburbs churned out textiles and other goods. There was a tradition of law and order, and a government capable of undertaking large national infrastructure projects, like building hydropower stations and roads, albeit with outside help. Ordinary people had a sense of hope, a belief that education could open opportunities for all, a conviction that a bright future lay ahead. All that has been destroyed by three decades of war, but it was real.

Thomas Peter/Reuters In Japanese, the word is johatsu, or "evaporated people."
Tormented by the shame of a lost job, failed marriage, or mounting debt, thousands of Japanese citizens have reportedly started leaving behind their formal identities and seeking refuge in the anonymous, off-the-grid world.
That's according to a recently-published book called "The Vanished: The 'Evaporated People' of Japan in Stories and Photographs," by French author-photographer pair Léna Mauger and Stéphane Remael. The book features a collection of vignettes from people who have fled modern society in search of a more secretive, less shame-filled life.
Mauger and Remael spent five years traveling around Japan beginning in 2008, earning the trust of locals to learn about the troubling trend. They also met the loved ones of those who disappeared: abandoned fathers, housewives, and ex-lovers. No formal government data exists on the trend, but by the pair's research more than 100,000 people "disappear" annually.
None of these people physically vanish, per se; the "evaporation" is more of an administrative disappearance. Similar to those in the Witness Protection Program in the US, johatsu opt to change their names, addresses, and business ties. They can essentially wipe the slate clean.
In Japan this escape can be surprisingly easy, Public Radio International reports. Japanese privacy laws give citizens a great deal of freedom in keeping their whereabouts under wraps. Only in criminal cases can the police mine people's personal data, and relatives can't look up financial records.
As Mauger told The New York Post in December, the disappearing acts stem from Japan's pressure to save face.
"It's so taboo," Mauger said. "It's something you can't really talk about. But people can disappear because there's another society underneath Japan's society. When people disappear, they know they can find a way to survive."
Johatsu cases seem to have emerged in the late 1960s, bolstered by a 1967 film called "A Man Vanishes," in which a man abruptly leaves behind his job and fiancee to disappear. In the 1970s, more cases emerged of young, rural-bred workers escaping harsh jobs in big cities, says Hikaru Yamagishi, who studies political science at Yale.
One man that Mauger and Remael met said it was his job to move these johatsu to faraway towns and cities during the 1990s. He and others like him called themselves a "night movers." It was their job to shuttle people to new, undisclosed locations under the cover of darkness. According to PRI, the 1990s were a booming time for such night moves. The economy had just crashed, and many people were looking for a way out.
"It's a crazy thing, but disappearance became a business at that time," Mauger told PRI.
In their book, Mauger and Remael also shed light on the loved ones who get left behind. Often, the families of johatsu said they wish the missing person had not felt so ashamed.
"We simply want to hear from him, he doesn't have to come home. If he needs money, we'll send it to him," a parent of a johatsu told Mauger and Remael.
The Japanese pressure to save face manifests itself in other ways, too.
For instance, Japanese has a word to describe suicides driven by overwork: karoshi. Last October, a report found that more than 20% of people in a survey of 10,000 said they worked at least 80 hours of overtime a month. Half of all respondents said they give up taking paid vacations.
In recent months, the Japanese government has taken small steps to reduce cases of karoshi, such as encouraging companies to let their staff work shorter hours on Friday. According to experts, however, the culture of work is so strong that many feel the incentives still don't outweigh the downsides of dropping out.
That is, unless they go the way of johatsu and walk away for good.
Too often, when a controversial topic is raised in cricket, or indeed any non-fiction book, the standard reaction is that it is the author's or publisher's ploy to garner sales. When Adam Gilchrist, in his biography True Colours, suggested that Sachin Tendulkar may have lied to protect Harbhajan Singh in the infamous “Monkeygate" scandal of 2008, angry reactions in India claimed it was a marketing gimmick.
So it is no surprise that when Ed Hawkins writes that the India-Pakistan semi-final of the 2011 World Cup was fixed, these allegations were met with similar reactions. This is not the only juicy bit in Hawkins' book. It is strewn with examples of other matches being fixed, like the England-Sri Lanka Test in Cardiff, UK, in 2011. It features an extensive interview with former Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi, who says he faced attempts on his life thrice, and best of all, a description of how the betting industry works in India.
The central event around which Hawkins pieces together his narrative is the World Cup semi-final. India won the match after scoring 260 runs, aided by five or so dropped catches by Pakistan. Hawkins says he received a text message before the match stating more or less how the match was going to unfold. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has brushed off these allegations, and Hawkins is unable to prove or find out who fixed the match. While the evidence may be termed circumstantial, he gets a statistician to calculate the odds on someone predicting the match in such detail. The chances are 405-1.
Admittedly, reporting on the Indian betting industry is a bit thin, what with Hawkins basing most of his statements on two bookies he met over Twitter. But to be fair to him, it's not as if people are queuing to be interviewed on this subject, which is illegal in India. One also gets the sense that cricket officialdom doesn't want to talk much about it even though the ICC has an anti-corruption squad which is trying to plug loopholes.
What I found most interesting were details on how the Indian bookmaking system is organized around syndicates, and how it can manipulate the odds of a match. Hawkins suggests that there is no market for spot fixing—made famous by News of the World sting on how Pakistani bowlers took money for bowling no balls against England in 2010—since the odds on such small events are astronomical. According to Hawkins, such fixes are aligned towards changing the odds in four main betting markers: The result, runs made in an inning, runs made in a 10 or 15-over session, and the midway favourite after the first innings in a One Day International.
Overall, the book makes for a fascinating read since so little has been written on the subject in so much depth.
New offshore wind power is now cheaper than nuclear in Britain. (AFP Photo/SHAUN CURRY)
London (AFP) - The price of electricity from offshore wind in Britain has dipped below the level guaranteed to Hinkley Point, raising questions about the construction of the vast nuclear power station.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy disclosed Monday the results of auctions for state subsidies for three new wind offshore farms.
Denmark's DONG Energy won the auction to build Hornsea Two, which will become the world's biggest offshore wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire in northern England.
Germany's Innogy and Norway's Statkraft won the auction for Triton Knoll off Lincolnshire in eastern England, while Moray in Scotland was won by a consortium comprising EDP Renovaveis of Portugal and ENGIE of France.
"The projects, which are set to generate over three gigawatts of electricity, enough to power 3.6 million homes, demonstrate that the UK continues to be an attractive place to invest in clean energy," the department said in a statement.
The companies lodged bids for the so-called "strike price" they will be paid by the state for electricity generated, with the lowest amounts securing the deals.
Those prices have tumbled to £74.75 (82.36 euros, $98.52) per megawatt hour for projects deliverable in 2021/2022, and to £57.50 for projects due in 2022/2023.
- 'Nail in the coffin' -
The price of offshore wind has fallen far below that of nuclear, with the planned Hinkley Point C power plant in southwestern England having secured subsidies of £92.50 per megawatt hour.
The gigantic Hinkley project was awarded to a French-Chinese consortium -- led by French giant EDF -- last year but has been plagued by long delays and cost overruns.
"Today's results mean that both onshore and offshore wind are cheaper than gas and nuclear," noted trade body RenewableUK in a statement on Monday.
However, the Nuclear Industry Association cautioned in another statement that "one technology alone can't solve the UK's power challenge".
Wind and solar production have the drawback of being unpredictable, with countries needing to call on gas, coal or nuclear plants to raise output if there is no breeze or sun.
British government wind power subsidies have now halved since the last auction was held in 2015.
Environmentalists have long urged the government to focus on renewable sources like wind and solar power to meet Britain's energy needs.
Opponents have criticised the high guaranteed Hinkley price level, which is fixed over 35 years and rises with inflation.
Lawmaker Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said the massive price drop for offshore wind should be the "nail in the coffin" for new nuclear power.
"The government's undying commitment to new nuclear risks locking us into sky-high prices for years to come," Lucas warned.
- 'Big step forward' -
Meanwhile, Michael Ware, partner at BDO's corporate finance division, said Monday's announcement raised questions over the future of tidal and wave energy -- which are more costly.
“We were pleasantly surprised by the low price bids in the latest auction," Ware told AFP, describing it a "vindication" of government policy.
"However, it does beg the obvious question of where a £57.50 strike price leaves other nascent technologies, such as tidal and wave, which are probably not economically viable at that level.
"It also puts the (price) being paid for Hinkley Point into sharp perspective."
Nevertheless, Ware added it was "a big step forward in the transition to a renewable (energy) grid".
About
*UPDATE*
We will be developing and playtesting an advanced pack to add-on to the existing game, allowing for deeper and more strategic play than is already included. Please see Stretch Goals, and help us get there!
The game supports 2-6 players, ages 6+, and lasts 30-60 minutes with minimal set up time. Monster Moos! was developed to help bridge the gap between adult hobby games and kid's games, but Monster Moos! is a fun game for everyone, regardless of your board game experience!
In Monster Moos! players take on the role of inter-dimensional cowboys riding the range in a limbo plane called "The Field". The Field is populated by monstrous cows (called Moos) that have escaped from their home dimensions. Your goal is to try to wrangle as many Dragon Moos, Ghost Moos, Cyborg Moos, and/or Zombie Moos as you can before the other cowboys. Do this by collecting tools that are used against the particular type of Moo you're trying to wrangle, or do actions (in the form of the Action Cards) to alter your situation. You can go for quantity and get a larger herd, 25 Moos to be precise, or quality, and get a pedigree 15 Moo herds of all the same type of Moo.
Always be prepared!
Here's what other people have said about Monster Moos!
" That game was exceptionally well loved by the Child Geeks and the Parent Geeks, including the non-gamers." - Father Geek, read his review here
Father Geek, read his review here "Monster Moos takes the familiar set collecting mechanic, throws in a dash of special actions, and stirs it up with some light tactical choices." Jason at islaythedragon.com, read his review here

Some people ask why we created this game when there are already so many out there? We did so because we are gamers with children. Looking around we find very limited options when it comes to good, tactical board games that parents and their kids can play together, and be on equal footing. The name and theme were actually inspired by our son Octavian. The first animal sound he ever learned was a monstrous roar, and so as far as he is concerned every animal sound should be a roar. We were driving past a farm and he began frantically pointing at the cows in the field moo-roaring as loud as he could. The idea developed through the remainder of our drive and the next few days and then was cleaned up through multiple playtesting sessions, both in-house and out-of-house.
Shipping to the US included. Shipping to Canada please add $10, and everywhere else please add $20. Anyone is free to pledge however much money they want for any reward within their pledge range or no reward at all if they just want to back us. However, we have some awesome rewards planned. See below for a reference chart and reward graphics!
Art Print! *Cowboys subject to change
The Dandy tier gets a copy of our hand drawn cards and tokens, while the Gentleman and Gentlelady tiers we actually hand draw!
While the art for for the Dandy and Gentleman tiers is charming in it's a own way, we didn't feel it was quite as impactful as our wonderful artists' and illustrators' work. However, if you want this art in your copy of the game, we will do a limited edition including it just for you!
You can add an additional copy of the game to any tier for $25
We've already paid for prototyping, promos, artist and design fees, and other pre-costs out of our own pocket. Now we're at a point where we can't make this happen without some help.
Shipping: $1500 (A 20 foot container costs approximately $5000 but we will be doing a partial load in an existing container.)
Tooling: $1000 (Printer setup)
Testing: $1000 (to ensure product is safe for selling w/in US)
Initial Production Run: $10,500
Kickstarter & Amazon Fees: Between 8%-10%
First off, we vetted numerous production companies, and because we aren't able to make the trips to the production facilities it was very important for us to be able to get a company to oversee quality control. We're getting the game at a great price from them, but they have a minimum requirement in how many we have to order. Tooling is required to set up the machines to produce our game, testing is the cost to ensure the manufactured product is safe and follows the required laws for retail here in America, and production is the cost of the actual units at their minimum quantity.
In addition to production, there is also the shipping from the factories to our warehouse. And we can't forget Kickstarter and Amazon fees. Our company goal is to keep the cost of games down and to reward those who support us. The game will retail for $30, but all Kickstarter backers will get it for $25 which is going to include shipping of course to the US. Canada, please add $10 to your pledge.
While we have many stretch goals in mind, we would like to take them one at a time! With that stated, I present our first stretch goal!
$18,000
Advanced Pack
You asked for it, and we're obliging! If we can get to $18,000 we will have an advanced pack to increase the strategic play of the game for more advanced players! This will include:
The Omega Wolf!
Hidden win condition cards!
Player Boards!
Additional Action Cards!
$22,000
Instead of the dice just having colored faced, we will screen print them with the faces of the Moos! This helps with color-blindness and makes the dice more attractive overall!

This will be her first baby with her new husband, Ned Rocknroll, the nephew of businessman, Sir Richard Branson.
"I can confirm Kate Winslet is pregnant and she and Ned Rocknroll are thrilled," said a publicist. "The baby is due at the end of the year."
Kate, originally from Reading in Berkshire, already has a 12-year-old daughter, Mia, with her ex-husband, director Jim Threapleton.
Joe, her son with second husband, the director Sam Mendes, is nine.

The 37-year-old Oscar winner married Ned Rocknroll, 34, in New York, in December.
In January the pair were granted a High Court injunction preventing The Sun newspaper from publishing semi-naked photographs of Ned Rocknroll taken by friends at a 21st birthday party a few years ago.
Kate Winslet shot to fame after starring in Titanic alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.
She won her Oscar for her role in the 2008 film The Reader. It was her sixth nomination.
The actress was awarded a CBE last year for her services to drama.
She revealed that she had discussed motherhood with the Queen as she collected her honour, after the Queen asked how much she enjoyed acting.
"I said yes, I liked it, but not as much as being a mother. She [the Queen] said, 'It is the best job'."

The UN refugee agency said more than 700 refugees may have drowned in three Mediterranean Sea shipwrecks south of Italy in the past few days.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Geneva, William Spindler, a UNHCR spokesman for Europe, said there had been a spate of incidents in the Mediterranean last week.
"The first one was on Wednesday, which was widely reported. A boat capsized, carrying about 600 people. Some of those people are still missing," Spindler said.
"Then there was a second incident on Thursday and a third one on Friday. In total, we fear that in these three incidents more than 700 people are missing, presumed drowned.
"There are a number of boats at the moment trying to make their way from Libya to Italy and several rescue operations are ongoing."

Spindler said more needed to be done to stop refugees from taking to the sea in small boats.
"It is very difficult to prevent people from doing this. In our view, what needs to be done is to offer legal alternatives to the most vulnerable refugees to travel to Europe. The reason why people are undertaking these dangerous journeys is because they have no choice," he said.
Refugee shipwreck survivors arrive in Italy
Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, told the Associated Press news agency by phone that an estimated 100 people were missing from a smugglers' boat that capsized on Wednesday.
She said about 550 others were missing from the boat that sank on Thursday.
Refugees said that boat, which was carrying about 670 people, did not have an engine and was being towed by another smuggling boat before it capsized.
About 25 people survived the incident, 79 others were rescued by patrol boats, and 15 bodies were recovered.

Sami said 45 more bodies were recovered from the shipwreck on Friday and many more were reported missing.
In a separate development, 19 refugees were rescued from a boat in the English Channel, the AFP news agency reported, citing coastguard officials.
