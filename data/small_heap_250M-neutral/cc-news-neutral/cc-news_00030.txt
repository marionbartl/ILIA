Organizers with a new Louisiana festival say the two-day event will go on as planned as Tropical Storm Nate moves through the Caribbean Sea.
The decision was made Friday afternoon. The festival will be held October 7 and 8 on the Ascension Fields at the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales. Officials say there will be three stages.
Sam Hunt, Lynard Skynyrd, and others will perform for the festival. Click here for all artists.
Last minute preps were coming together Friday as Ascension Parish leaders say Flambeau Fest must go on despite the threat Tropical Storm Nate may bring to the area.
“It's a great day in Ascension Parish and I want to welcome everyone here to the Flambeau Festival,” said Ascension Parish President Kenny Matassa.
It's something organizers say they have been working on for years, but a decision on whether the inaugural event would actually happen came down to the wire Friday afternoon.
BREAKING UPDATE: Organizers announce Flambeau Fest WILL continue as scheduled despite possible threat from #Nate. @WAFB @WAFBweather pic.twitter.com/EbgwDwWKJV — Scottie Hunter WAFB (@ScottieWAFB) October 6, 2017
“This week, with everything we've faced and the challenges, I couldn't have asked for more miracles to come through. I really do feel like with this team and the Applied Production Team and the Flambeau Fest team this is just fantastic,” said event organizer, Mark Miller.
With Nate setting its sights on the Louisiana Gulf Coast, the storm is expected to make its presence known in the area right in the middle of the weekend event, but with the storm's track making a recent shift farther east Friday morning, the concert got a late afternoon blessing from Ascension Parish leaders.
“We feel that the weather is conducive to conduct safe operations of the festival this weekend,” said Ascension OHSEP director, Rick Webre.
“I want everybody to come out and have a great time. It looks like the weather is going to really do good for us,” Matassa added.
Weather is not the only challenge that Flambeau Fest faced in the past week. It's set for just a week after dozens were killed and hundreds more were injured at a similar concert in Las Vegas. Organizers admit one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history caused quite a bit of concern. “We've been planning it for three years, but the last four days have been the hardest,” said Miller.
Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley promises extra security for the event and says concert-goers have nothing to worry about. “Clearly we have a bar that was raised from last weekend,” said Wiley. “Our department, the concert security, the management here, and the Lamar Dixon personnel, we are determined and guaranteeing you the safest venue that you could have.”

Surviving members of the Capital Gazette's staff will participate in a Fourth of July parade in Annapolis, six days after a gunman killed five of the newspaper's employees during a rampage in the newsroom.

The decision to participate in this year's parade rather than simply cover it like the paper normally does was announced in an opinion piece published Wednesday.
"You'll recognize us from our vaguely lost expressions. We don't think we have a banner or T-shirts, although we're looking around. We might have a few hats. It will be unusual for us to walk together in the same rough direction if we're being totally honest here," the article stated.
"The news staff of The Capital feels out of place being part of the event rather than on the sidelines taking notes or producing video," the article added.
The article goes on to say that the surviving staff members are a symbol for the community, even though "we're hurting."
"We'll be on West Street and Main Street because we want our readers and our community to see that we believe things will, eventually, be OK again. Eventually," the article states.
This isn't the first appeal the staff has made to the public. They wrote a letter on Sunday, three days after the attack, thanking people for the "outpouring of sympathy" they received.
In that letter, the paper's staff wrote that they will "never forget" their five slain colleagues: Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Rebecca Smith.

They also noted that there were some more sinister messages following the attack that they will not be forgetting, either.
"Here's what else we won't forget: Death threats and emails from people we don't know celebrating our loss, or the people who called for one of our reporters to get fired because they got angry and cursed on national television after witnessing their friends getting shot," the letter reads.
The letter also said they "won't forget being called an enemy of the people," which was an apparent dig at President Donald Trump, who has used that phrase in statements directed at the media.
Trump ordered federal flags lowered to half staff on Tuesday July 3 to honor the victims of the shooting.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos has been released from Germany's World Cup qualifying squad to allow them to recover from a rib injury.
Kroos recently missed games for Madrid with the same injury but played in Germany's 3-1 win over Northern Ireland on Thursday, helping the team secure qualification for next year's tournament in Russia.
The German soccer federation says Kroos left the team hotel in Belfast on Friday morning in order to "fully heal."
Germany coach Joachim Loew says "we know what Toni can give us. When it comes down to it we can always rely on him. The deciding factor was that they are completely fit for next year."
Germany plays Azerbaijan on Sunday as it bids to complete qualification with 10 wins from 10 games.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kyle Hendricks outpitched Stephen Strasburg, and the Chicago Cubs opened defense of their first World Series title in 108 years by beating the Washington Nationals 3-0 on Friday in Game 1 of their NL Division Series.
Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo produced RBI singles in the sixth inning for the first two hits off an otherwise-dominant Strasburg. Hendricks was even better, giving up only two singles in seven strong innings.
Rizzo added an RBI double off reliever Ryan Madson in the eighth. Carl Edwards Jr. threw a perfect inning and Wade Davis finished the two-hitter for a save.
Game 2 in the best-of-five series is Saturday, with Jon Lester set to start for Chicago against fellow left-hander Gio Gonzalez.
Strasburg didn't allow a hit until there were two outs in the sixth. Javier Baez reached on third baseman Anthony Rendon's error to start the inning and was sacrificed to second by Hendricks. One out later, Bryant drove in the first run with a single to right-center and went to second when Bryce Harper missed the cutoff man.
The next batter, Rizzo, singled to right in front of a diving Harper to make it 2-0.
With a heavy beard and a lot of sweat on a muggy, 77-degree night, Strasburg dialed up their fastball to 97 mph and occasionally used an unhittable changeup. To cheers of "Let's go, Strasburg!" from many in a sellout crowd of 43,898, they held the Cubs without a hit for 5 2/3 innings and wound up with 10 strikeouts, a playoff record for the Expos-Nationals franchise.
In only their second postseason appearance — remember the shutdown of 2012 and the arm injury of 2016? — the righty showed precisely the sort of power and poise that made them the No. 1 pick in baseball's amateur draft. Until, that is, the sixth inning. That's when everything changed in a matter of minutes.
Until then, the Cubs managed only one baserunner, and that was via a walk. But Baez led off with a bouncer that Rendon gloved, then bobbled while trying to transfer it to their throwing hand. It was Rendon's first error since July 22; they made only seven in 145 regular-season games.
After Hendricks' bunt moved Baez to second, 2016 NL MVP Bryant lined Strasburg's 60th pitch, a four-seam fastball, to right-center for the game's first run. Harper's throw missed the cutoff man, and Bryant took second. Two pitches later, on another fastball, Rizzo sent a sinking shot to right, where Harper came up just short trying to make a diving catch, and suddenly it was 2-0. As pitching coach Mike Maddux came out for a mound visit with Strasburg, Rizzo whooped it up at the bag, high-fiving first base coach Brandon Hyde.
Strasburg wound up allowing those two unearned runs in seven innings, with three hits and one walk.
Hendricks went about things differently — their best fastball is about 10 mph slower than Strasburg's — but was every bit as good. The slender righty from Dartmouth, who led the NL in ERA last season, did not give up a hit after the second inning. They walked three batters and struck out six.
In the Washington ninth, Ryan Zimmerman was called out when catcher Willson Contreras' throw hit the player in the back as they ran to first on a dropped third strike.
While the Cubs are no longer the "Lovable Losers" after last year's championship, the Nationals were the NL East champions for the fourth time in six seasons but have yet to win a playoff series.
Their undoing in the past has often been poor hitting and bad relief pitching, and it was the former that was most glaring this time.
Yes, Harper — wearing shoes with "Pray for Las Vegas" written on the side following the recent mass shooting in their hometown — did single in the first inning, but was 0 for 3 in their other at-bats as they try to regain their timing after returning recently from a long injury layoff. Rendon, Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy, Trea Turner and Jayson Werth were a combined 0 for 17 with three walks.
SUSPENSION
Less than a half-hour before the game, the Nationals announced that assistant hitting coach Jacque Jones has been suspended with pay pending an internal investigation. The team said the suspension is connected to a legal matter. The 42-year-old Jones retired as a player in 2008 after 10 years with four teams.
SCALISE'S PITCH
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise threw out the ceremonial first pitch, less than four months after the Louisiana Republican was shot while practicing for an annual charity baseball game featuring members of Congress. Scalise returned to the House last week.
UP NEXT
Cubs: Lester makes the 20th postseason start of their career, which includes three World Series titles and an NLCS MVP award last year.  They are 9-7 with a 2.63 ERA over their postseason career.
Nationals: Gonzalez goes in Game 2 instead of two-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer, who is slated for Game 3 at Wrigley Field on Monday. Scherzer has been dealing with a sore right hamstring. It will be Gonzalez's first playoff start at home since Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS against St. Louis, when they were staked to a 6-0 lead in a game Washington lost 9-7.

It was not the wake-up call Tom Metcalf was expecting.
On January 9, around 6 a.m., the president of the Royal Canadian Legion Br. 396 in Chippawa received a frantic call from a cleaner at the Legion Street facility.
A water pipe had burst and the basement had flooded.
"There were two inches of water downstairs," they recalled.
The basement area sustained extensive water damage. The tables and chairs are gone and the bar, carpet and tiles have been ripped out.
All that remains is pool table and a few metal desks piled with books and other items members were able to salvage.
"It's pretty well void of anything," Metcalf said.
While insurance will cover the damage, he's been told the legion will be stuck with a $62,000 H.S.T. bill as insurance does not cover the tax on claims at commercial properties.
The legion, which has approximately 150 members, is now scrambling to raise the funds to cover the tax and other expenses that have arisen since the flood.
There is a leak in the basement wall along the east side of the building which was built in 1952. A new floor in the damaged basement can't be installed until the leak is repaired first.
"Now, all of a sudden, that has jumped to the top of the list in terms of priorities," Metcalf said.
Also, the roof needs work.
In the past, the hall on the main floor of the legion has been available for rent but any future rentals are on hold at this time as the legion needs to use the hall as its club house. The legion relied on income generated from the rentals to provide services to area veterans.
The legion is now looking to the community for support.
"Drop in and see us," Metcalf said, adding new members are always welcome. "Have a drink once in a while, a beer or pop or whatever. Come in and chew the fat."
The fundraising dance will be held Feb. 10.
"It started as a Valentine's Day dance and now it's a raise money dance," said Patricia Fischer, second vice president.
Admission is $10 and includes pizza and door prizes. Entertainment will be provided by Second Heaven.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The agricultural working holiday program for New Southbound Policy countries is expected to be implemented as early as in June, Council of Agriculture Minister Lin Tsung-hsien announced today.
Lin made the announcement in the kick-off meeting on April 24 for the National Agriculture Conference scheduled for September 7 and 8, reported the Liberty Times.
The program--aimed at Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand--is proposed to supplement the island's agricultural workforce. A six-month trial-run for the program is being planned, with relatives of new immigrants already residing in Taiwan to receive priority for reviewing their application for the program.
According to the proposal, a quota of 200 openings will be granted for each of the four countries. Relevant guidelines are currently being drawn up by the COA, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Labor. The four countries have expressed interest in the program as they work on fast-tracking required administrative procedures.
COA is also in discussions with MOL on the viability of directing fishermen to aid in the agricultural sector during the fishing moratorium. The measure will be carried out as soon as next month when Taiwan could face a shortage of farm labor thanks to the expected bumper harvest for lychee in the southern part of the island.
Regarding the wages for the workers enrolled in the working holiday program, COA gave a rough idea how much the individuals will earn. For garlic-picking, the daily wage ranges from NT$1,200 (US$40) to NT$1,500 (US$50), while those carrying rice seedlings will be paid a higher amount between NT$1,800 (US$60) and NT$2,000 (US$67) for eight hours of work.

Sometimes it seems as if we're living under a constant barrage of heavy news. But it isn't all bad out there. This feature is meant to send you into the weekend with a smile, or at least a lighter heart.
Here are seven great things we wrote about this week:
It's been 10 years since a devastating global economic crisis, and things are looking up. The United States, the world's largest economy, is in its ninth year of growth. Europe, China and Japan are expanding as well.

It's like a Humane Society with handcuffs and badges. This Dutch police force rescues dog left on snowy balconies, comforts sick seals stranded on the beach, and handles cases of abuse and neglect. The work is a mix of animal protection and human social services.
Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who has used graphic dialogues and nudity in their debut digital web series ‘Guns and Thighs', based on the Mumbai underworld, says they have used the freedom offered by the new age entertainment platform.
Justifying the bold scenes in the trailer, they say they are not purely intended to titillate the audience.
Asked if the trailer, which has drawn attention, was a well-planned strategy to titillate, Varma told IANS here, “Titillating is a very relative world. At times, a character or a situation can titillate someone (and lead him/her) to watch the show.
“So you cannot specify what is exactly the element of titillation in the viewers' mind. Yes, the story of the web series has age restrictions, as it is adult content, but when an audience is clicking on the link to watch an episode, from the name itself they get an idea of the subject matter. Therefore, there is no element of surprise.”
Varma pointed out how ‘anything that is restricted to adults is either violence or sex'.
“In fact, that is the rule of our censor board as well. My point is, we are living in a world with people of different choices and sensibilities, where if you, as an individual, do not want to watch something, don't (watch it), but don't force others to do the same. Let them celebrate their choice as well. That is what freedom of choice and expression is about.”
Known for making Bollywood crime thrillers on the underworld – ‘Company', ‘Ab Tak Chhappan' and ‘D' to name some — Varma has once again explored the genre in the web series, which is set between 1995 and 2005.
“I think the genre always does not matter, but the storytelling does. Yes, this web series is on the Mumbai underworld, but the style of narration, imagery, characters, situations… these are very different,” added the filmmaker.
Explaining the title, they said, “You see, guns and thighs are the symbols of power and sex. In politics, mostly, radical decisions are taken under the influence of power and sex.
“On the other hand, as I always say, my prime interest in filmmaking has come from Amitabh Bachchan's gun and Zeenat Aman's thighs… So now you know that the title is apt. It's very symbolic.”
The National Award-winning filmmaker is exploring the digital platform for the first time, and sees its advantages. “More than anything else, it is the creative freedom that we get on web series. There is no time limit of two hours that I have to compress my thought (into), keeping the interval and duration of a film in mind.
“I have also taken liberty on that.”
Asked why they decided to show a woman nude and not a man, they quipped, “Maybe as a man, I do not want to see a man's nude body. I think a woman (film) maker would like to do that. However, I believe a woman's body is more beautiful than a man's.”
Transcript for Charges against suspect who sold ammo to Las Vegas shooter
it. A man identified in court documents as a person of interest after the Las Vegas massacre S now charged in connection with that massacre. This morning they are speaking out about their contact with the gunman, Stephen paddock. ABC's Stephanie Ramos joins us now with more from Washington. Stephanie, good morning to you. Reporter: Good morning. It's been about four months since the Las Vegas massacre and we're now getting some insight as to who sold the mass killer some of the ammo found in their hotel room. I'm the guy that sold ammunition to Stephen paddock. Reporter: Overnight an ammunition seller charged in connection with the Las Vegas massacre. 55-year-old Douglas haig says they sold ammunition to Stephen paddock in the weeks before they shot and killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival. At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd. Reporter: According to court documents haig admitted to selling about 700 rounds of tracer bullets to paddock. They said they were going to go out to the desert and put on a light show either with or for their friends. Reporter: Early on in the investigation authorities say they discovered a shipping box among paddock's possessions with haig's name on it. Investigators say they also found haig's fingerprints on armor piercing bullets which were found in paddock's Vegas hotel room. The complaint alleges haig did not have a license to manufacture or sell that type of ammo. No contribution to what paddock did. I had no way to see in their mind. The product I sold them had absolutely nothing to do with what they did. I'm a vendor. Reporter: Court documents also show authorities served a warrant on their home on October 19th and seized over 100 items including more armor piercing bullets. Haig's attorney says haig was contacted by law enforcement within 24 hours of the shooting and he's been fully cooperative. Dan, Paula. Stephanie, thank you.

I read many articles from all around the world sharing beautiful photography locations. However, there seems to be a lack of content about Australia. Having lived here for over five years now, I want to share with you some of the best landscape and wildlife photography locations that I have visited. In this article I am going to focus on South Australia, but I hope to keep building on it and adding new locations when I have the time.
South Australia, as you can probably guess, is a state on the southernmost part of the Australian continent. It is notable for being the driest state on the driest permanently inhabited continent. However, this does not seem to have limited the abundance of plants and animals.
Adelaide – the state capital, and the only real city in the state – has a population of about 1.3 million and is a very relaxed place. It has a reputation for being like a large, quiet country town where everyone knows everyone else. The rest of the state is sparsely populated, with numerous small towns and regional centres. To put this in perspective, regional South Australia has a population of about 400,000 spread over an area twice the size of France.
The climate in South Australia is that of a hot, arid Mediterranean country. In Adelaide during the summer, the temperatures are very hot, with temperatures averaging around 30 Celsius (85 Fahrenheit) and periods of over 40 C being somewhat common. Winters are generally dry and mild. The best seasons to visit are spring and autumn, when temperatures are warm and dry. At these times of year, the days are still long, and you will also have the added benefit of fewer tourists.
So, what is there to photograph? Well, South Australia offers a range of unique landscapes, from large eucalyptus forests, to long sandy beaches, to the outback. As for wildlife, Australia has a number of unique species. Among those found in South Australia are kangaroo, koala, emu, echidna, and platypus. For those with something more leisurely in mind, Southern Australia has some of the most renowned wine-making regions in the country. Also, being in the Southern Hemisphere, these areas of Australia also offer a different perspective on the night sky for most people – and with such a sparsely populated country, a large number of dark sky regions exist here as well.
People are often scared of the ‘deadly' wildlife in Australia. While it is true that there are dangerous species of spiders and snakes in South Australia, these are really quite rare. Only twice have I encountered snakes while bush walking. As with most wild animals, common sense applies. Ensure you are wearing sturdy footwear and treading cautiously, and know what to do in an emergency.
As a final note, at the height of summer in South Australia, there is an ever-present risk of bushfires. The main piece of advice I can offer is to avoid going out when there is a total fire ban in place, and follow any directions given by the local or state services.

Kanye West's hospitalization late last year was highly publicized, and on Sunday's episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," viewers got an inside look at how the incident affected Kim Kardashian West.
West, 39, was admitted to the hospital due to exhaustion and sleep deprivation on Nov. 21, 2016, and Kardashian West soon rushed to their side in Los Angeles.
"My heart is breaking for Kim," Kardashian West's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, said in the most recent episode of the show. "I know that them and Kanye have been through so much this year ... it just never ends."
"Everything will be OK," Kardashian West, 36, said. "It's forcing them to take much needed time off, which they need. I think that will be really good for him. I feel a sense of responsibility just with the pressure of taking care of everything. Even after the robbery and everything it's just [that] I've been staying home and I've been looking to them to just take care of everything while I stay home."
They also touched on a conversation they had with West after the events transpired.
"Kanye was really cute," Kardashian West said. "He was like, 'So, this is what for better and worse means?' and I'm like, 'Yeah.' This is being a wife. This is what you got to do."
The incident only added to other struggles the couple had recently gone through together. West's hospitalization came shortly after Kardashian West was robbed at gunpoint in Paris last October. The pair married in 2014 and have two children, 3-year-old North and 1-year-old Saint.
Rachel Notley is the premier of Alberta
Some people in Alberta say we're landlocked, and to break that landlock we need a pipeline to tidewater. I see things a bit differently. I don't think we're landlocked, because we are Canadians, and Canada has more coastline than any country on earth. I believe in Canada, not just as a concept, but as a country.
We're in this together — creating jobs and supporting public services together, and working on climate change together, too.
We're also together on getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built. This week, Canadians heard the news that the Government of Canada, with support from Alberta, has agreed to buy the Trans Mountain Pipeline, because it's in the national interest to build it. And build it we will.
For the longest time, Albertans and Canadians were stuck with the status quo, building nothing. Because Alberta had only one customer for our energy — the United States — we were stuck receiving a discounted price for our oil. But the people in power could not, or would not, get a pipeline built to tidewater and to new markets. The same old strategy wasn't working. Yelling at people who disagreed was not working. Stomping their feet wasn't working. And putting fingers in their ears and refusing to listen to those who disagreed was not working, either. The result was no pipeline to tidewater, and Canada lost billions. Billions that could have gone to things we all rely on each and every day – schools, hospitals, roads, and public transit.
When Albertans changed government in 2015, we really did change. For a start, we embraced one guiding principle: that climate leadership and good jobs can go hand in hand. In fact, they must. So that's what we set out to create – a Climate Leadership Plan to lower emissions while growing the economy. We are pricing carbon and phasing out coal use. We are aggressively increasing renewable energy, we are investing in innovation and technology to produce lower carbon barrels. And, when it comes to the oil sands, we are the world's first energy producer to place a voluntary cap on emissions.
The world should use more renewable energy. It should burn less coal. And Alberta should diversify our economy, as we are. These can be true while acknowledging the world will use fossil fuels for some time to come is also true. Stopping the pipeline doesn't mean the world will use less nonrenewable energy, it means Albertans and Canadians will merely receive a lower return on the energy we sell.
At my first meeting with the other provinces and territories, we got my fellow premiers — every single one at that time — to agree on the need for new pipelines, through the Canadian Energy Strategy. The people of Alberta were already united behind the need to take action to get full value for our resources, and after this meeting, so were all of Canada's premiers. The next step was to make our case to Canadians. So we hit the road and spoke with — not yelled at, or ignored — people of every persuasion, and in every conversation the environment and economy were presented as one.
This pipeline is unlike any other before it. There was unprecedented scrutiny, unprecedented consultations and, thanks to our work on climate change and cooperation, a federal government in full support. There are also unprecedented benefits – the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion will bring the Canadian economy an estimated $73.5 billion over 20 years.
Of course, any long journey will have a few bumps in the road. Some people in Alberta saw no benefit in pricing carbon, or working on climate change. Some people outside of Alberta saw no benefit to our energy industry, the good jobs it creates and the revenue it generates that's essential to all Canadians. But once we'd made our case, most people saw the benefit to keep Canada working, to keeping our economy strong, and to keeping our commitments on climate change. The courts weighed in, with 16 straight decisions in the pipeline's favour so far, and a majority of Canadians, along with a majority of British Columbians, support the pipeline's expansion.
We hit another bump in the road when Kinder Morgan issued their May 31st deadline. Again, we committed to Albertans that we would do whatever it takes to bring certainty to this project. And we delivered. The Government of Canada has stepped up and purchased the project, with support from Alberta. In return for Alberta's support, we will see construction resume immediately, the project will move forward on schedule, and Alberta will see full value for our investment.
Every few decades an extraordinary project of national importance comes along. This is one of those projects, the first major pipeline to Canadian tidewater in over 50 years. In a project of this magnitude, so clearly linked to nation building, it is sometimes the case that the public sector has a role to play, and this happens while maintaining a healthy investment climate. In this case, government is investing in — not subsidizing — a project that we know is profitable and will bring strong returns for all of us.
Sometimes nation-building projects require nation-building leadership, and that is what people expect from their governments.
We are proud to have brought Canadians together in support of this project. There are those who said this would never happen. There were some who hoped it would fail for their own political interests. But those people don't know today's Alberta. We do things differently here. And together, we are building this pipeline — with B.C. workers using steel made in Saskatchewan from ore mined in Quebec.
The Trans Mountain Pipeline will keep Canada working. It will support tens of thousands of jobs and billions in financial benefits. It will ensure the national climate plan continues. And it will show the world that when Canada makes a decision, we stand behind it.
Now, it's time to pick those tools back up, folks. We've got a pipeline to build.

ISTANBUL, Turkey – Thirty-nine people were killed in Istanbul on Sunday when a gunman went on a shooting rampage in an upmarket nightclub as revelers celebrated the New Year.
It was a bloody start to 2017 in Turkey, which has suffered a year of attacks by Islamic State jihadists and Kurdish militants and a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Following are the worst attacks in Turkey over the past year:

Nightclub terror
January 1: Seventy-five minutes after party-goers ring in the New Year, a gunman opens fire in the Reina nightclub on the banks of the Bosphorus, killing 39 people and injuring at least 65. The victims include nationals from several Arab states. Police have launched a manhunt for the assailant.
Ambassador assassinated
December 19: Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, is shot dead at an Ankara art gallery by an off-duty police officer who claims they are acting to avenge the conflict in Syria, especially Aleppo.

December 17: 14 soldiers are killed and dozens of other people wounded in a suicide attack targeting a military bus in the central city of Kayseri. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), seen as a radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), claims responsibility.

Nigeria initiates investors' match-making platform
Nigeria is set to establish a match-making data base for international business interconnectivity and stress-free investments.
The 119 Nigeria missions would serve as one-stop shops to spur investments through information sharing and elimination of bottlenecks.
Foreign Affairs minister Geoffrey Onyeama, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that the initiative would enable Nigeria's products and investors to access the world market easily.
It would also enable foreign investors have unfettered access to informed and genuine information concerning business opportunities in Nigeria.
The minister explained that the scheme was to be implemented through a matching-making data base aimed at promoting exports and enhancing nation's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
According to Onyeama, the design is an economic diplomacy which is a framework to address the severe economic challenges facing Nigeria.
They said that Nigeria has representations in 119 countries and the ministry could leverage on the advantage to deliver concrete economic benefit to the nation.
“It is a pet project. It is a matching making data base, for our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and export promotion.
“So this data base will essentially enable any Nigerian business to upload to our data base that could be managed from Foreign and affairs together with the ministry of trade and investment,” they said.
They said all the information needed about what they want to export and investment types would be readily available in all the119 countries where Nigeria has presence.
“I felt that when we have presence in 119 countries it is fantastic advantage to push Nigerian products and businesses in 119 countries.
“So we would like to present a one-stop shop to export Nigeria goods.
“And that whenever any business is uploaded in each of their countries they have to seek for partners and match that business person with a partner in that country to put in places a business agreement,” they said.
They said they would like same be done in inversely conversely, so that any foreigner who wants to get involve in business in Nigeria not knowing the country can also upload on the data base.
According to him, such people can access all the information about what they might want to deal in and we together with ministry of trade we match them with Nigerian businesses.
They said the scheme would also save Nigerian business people from going through all kinds of bottlenecks and paying all kinds of fees in foreign countries.
“We feel it that way because we have a lot bottlenecks in a lot of Nigerian business people trying to do business outside the country, so many bottlenecks.
“So if we can provide them a very simple access what we call it is market access.
“We have the markets in all these countries, so that our business people and traders have the world at their finger-tips,” they said.
Onyeama said that their ministry was also looking at how to utilise the same method to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Nigeria.
They said that Nigerians in the Diaspora would also be able to utilise the data base to search for partners in Nigeria and other countries.

BEIJING (AP) — Some say China's most prominent journalist is finished.
Far from it, says Hu Shuli, founder of the financial magazine Caixin.
Hu listened one recent afternoon to the theories floating in China's chattering class about why they were handing over the editorial reins at Caixin, the only newsroom known for hard-hitting, investigative reporting in China — and dismissed them.
"Laughable rumors," Hu snapped. "I'm not stepping back or stepping down. You could say I'm stepping up."
In a rare interview with the Associated Press, Hu spoke bullishly about transitioning this month into a publisher role at the newsmagazine they co-founded in 2009, and about the prospects of the "Me Too" movement in China. They spoke more guardedly about censorship and declared Caixin as free as ever to conduct its signature muckraking reporting. China watchers say the space for independent journalism in the country, already one of the world's most censored news environments, is fast vanishing under President Xi Jinping.
"We always think there are stories to do and we don't think, 'maybe this environment should be better,'" said Hu. "We've always felt we could do anything we wanted. It was just based on what our priorities are."
Hu said they were handing the operation over to their long-time deputy Wang Shuo because of their age — they turn 65 this year. They will occasionally conduct major interviews and remain involved in major editorial decisions as an adviser to Wang, who they hired as a 25-year-old two decades ago.
Known for their political savvy, for 30 years Hu has published scoops that uncovered corporate malfeasance and government corruption without repercussions while other journalists fell afoul of authorities and landed in jail. Them publication blew open the government cover-up of the SARS epidemic in 2003 and has questioned countless deals among powerful companies, including state-backed enterprises.
Caixin's reshuffle comes shortly after Wang Qishan, an official widely seen as Hu's longtime ally, stepped down from the Communist Party's top leadership body, said Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
"Ms. Hu is famous for being supercharged, full of energy," Lam said. "It's difficult to believe she's stepping aside because of age. It has to do with politics."
Hu declined to discuss their relationship with Wang and denied that political factors were behind their move. In any case, Wang appears to retain significant influence: they joined a parliamentary delegation this week amid speculation that Xi might soon name them vice president.
Still, at a time when Xi demands strict ideological discipline across Chinese society, particularly in sensitive industries like media, it remains to be seen if Caixin can continue to push the envelope. A liberal historical journal, Yanhuang Chunqiu, has been shuttered and influential online commentators silenced. Caixin made international headlines in 2016 when it published an interview with a Shanghai professor who criticized China's tightening censorship, and, when censors moved to block the interview, Caixin disclosed the takedown order in an unusual show of defiance.
Pressed nearly two years later, Hu shook their head, saying they don't remember the incident.
Even though they have not directed coverage recently, Hu said they are proud of their staff's reporting on sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement in China. Discussion of the subject has sometimes been censored on Chinese social media or branded as a destabilizing foreign movement. But the story has gained some domestic traction, including reports by state-run outlets like the official Xinhua news agency, which Hu praised.
"China also has this kind of problem ... China had the 'women hold up half the sky' revolutionary slogan — but the actual situation, the actual status of women — I think is a very profound issue," said Hu, adding that they wanted to do more to promote #MeToo.
Hu said most of their energy will be focused on developing Caixin's business model.
In October the company became the first Chinese news company to erect a paywall, a decision Hu made based on the success of leading western newspapers. They declined to discuss subscription or revenue numbers, but acknowledged that online revenues are not yet considered "substantial."
Wei Wuhui, a lecturer of new media at Shanghai Jiaotong University who was asked by Hu to consult on Caixin's paywall model last year, said the increasingly restrictive political atmosphere will affect Caixin. Apart from direct censorship, it will be hurt by the scarcity of young people willing to pursue journalism.
"Even students studying journalism don't want to do journalism now," Wei said. "In a few years, the market for investigative journalism may not exist at all."
Never mind the naysayers, said Hu.
Caixin has more fertile (and safe) areas than ever to investigate in China, they said.
Wang ticked off financial crimes and environmental protection as beats where they plan to beef up staffing.
A month after they officially relinquished the editor position, Hu still sat in their same corner office, their books and pictures untouched. Wang still works on a long narrow table with other editors in Caixin's main newsroom of 400 people.
Them advice for Wang was that "the opportunity is theirs to take now," they said, adding: "And I'm still here."
United Nations Commends Nigeria on SDGs Implementation
Abimbola Akosile
The efforts of the Federal Government to effectively domesticate and implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) got a big boost in Abuja recently with the United Nations pledging its partnership and support to Nigeria to deliver on the implementation of the SDGs.
The pledge was made when the Global Director of the United Nations SDG Action Campaign, Mr. Mitchell Toomey paid a courtesy visit to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the SDGs, Princess Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire.
Toomey, in a release issued by the Media Assistant to the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs, Mr. Desmond Utomwen commended the Federal Government of Nigeria for taking policy, institutional, and financial steps towards providing the needed environment for the implementation of the SDGs in Nigeria.
Specifically, they noted that Nigeria was amongst the first countries to establish a special high-level office in the presidency to coordinate the implementation of the SDGs. They also commended Nigeria for its multi-stakeholder approach in implementing the SDGs.
Through this approach, Nigeria has been able to set up structures which will support the engagement of the private sector, civil society and other non-state actors, the release noted.
According to Toomey, “the SDGs are about the people. The formulation of the SDGs saw one of the most inclusive and consultative processes in the history of the United Nations, involving the Member states, civil society, private sector, parliamentarians, local authorities, faith leaders amongst other. The implementation should therefore be founded upon broad-based partnerships and contributions from every segment of the society”.
The UN Chief congratulated Nigeria for being a candidate country in the 2017 Voluntary National Reviews of the SDGs, a global process through which national implementation of the SDGs are reviewed. This move, according to him, was a mark of Nigeria's openness and commitment to implementing the SDGs.
Responding, Princess Orelope-Adefulire acknowledged the historical partnership existing between Nigeria and the UN SDG Action Campaign dating back to its precursor, the UN Millennium Campaign, which was anchored in Nigeria then by Mr. Hilary Ogbonna before its transformation when the SDGs were adopted in New York at the historic 70th UN General Assembly in September 2015.
They pledged the continuation of this unique partnership and called on the SDG Action Campaign to devise effective means of ensuring the SDGs are promoted and owned by peoples of the world. The Presidential Adviser assured that the “current administration in Nigeria is committed to faithfully implementing the SDGs and ensuring that no Nigerian is left behind.”
They also noted that “in spite of the current economic realities, Nigeria has continued to commit funds to the SDGs and in social investments in two successive national budgets.”
Nigeria was one of the more than 190 member-nations who endorsed the adopted SDGs at the 70th General Assembly, and President Muhammadu Buhari led the delegation which attended the landmark event in the United States. The country also signed the international agreement on climate change, tagged the Paris Accord,

The movie was meant as a harsh critique of the excesses of 1980s capitalism — but it became wildly popular with actual Wall Street types. (When it came out, our critic suggested that its moralizing was its weak point: “The movie crashes in a heap of platitudes,” Vincent Canby wrote.)
The director, Oliver Stone, said that in a twist, many young people told them it had inspired them to work on Wall Street. Even years later, brokers would tell him, “You're the man!”

Mr. Stone discussed the film's legacy in this 2009 Times video. They said it was “misunderstood by some, because it was about a horrible thing that was going on, about how people would worship money at all costs.”

The big G's AR toolkit for mobile graduated from preview phase in late February, and is now compatible with phones other than Pixel devices. You can now download and install it if you have a Pixel, a Samsung Galaxy S7, S8, S9 or Note 8, an LG V30, an Asus Zenfone AR or a OnePlus 5. Actually, you'll have to install it if you want to use any ARCore apps, which are bound to pop up one by one now that the platform works on more devices. That means you won't be able to run Ikea Place or any other ARCore app if you have a non-compatible phone, but Google says it's working to bring the platform to more devices throughout the year.
In addition to launching Place for Android, Ikea has also added Visual Search to its apps. The new feature gives the applications the capability to search for items in Ikea's inventory -- you just need to point your camera towards that piece of furniture that caught your eye. Finally, Ikea has launched a new gameshow series called Matchers Keepers that you can play with friends and family. You'll need to pick pieces of furniture over three rounds for a specific place in your home, and you get points for picking out matching items. All players will need to have access to Ikea Place, though, so any housemate with a non-compatible device will have to sit it out.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron have ditched the White House for the nearby National Gallery of Art to see the works of Paul Cezanne.
Wearing white suits and high heels, the first ladies of the United States and France toured an exhibit of about 60 works by the French post-impressionist painter.
They paused near a portrait of Cézanne's father reading a newspaper. Mary Morton, the musem's curator of French paintings, explained that Cezanne had a difficult relationship with their father, who was a banker.
The two first ladies then strolled through the building's Rotunda and past a statue of Mercury.
It was the second day of French President Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron's visit to Washington. Later Tuesday, the Trumps are hosting the couple at the administration's first state dinner.
JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's deputy president is acting more like a president these days, while talk surrounding their scandal-tainted boss is about how and when they would quit.
That makes for awkward leadership in one of Africa's biggest economies, where a power transition from President Jacob Zuma to their deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, appears to be taking shape even though the president's term runs until 2019 elections.
An early exit for Zuma is being considered by ruling African National Congress party officials amid impatience among South Africans who hope change at the top could reduce high-level corruption that has hurt the economy and the ANC's popularity and diminished South Africa's international image.
A flashpoint for frustration could come on Feb. 8 when Zuma is scheduled to deliver the state of the nation address in parliament. If they speak, there likely would be protested both inside and outside the chamber. On Wednesday, Mmusi Maimane, the main opposition leader, asked the parliament speaker to postpone the speech until the ruling party resolves its internal conflict and South Africa has a new president.
For now, South Africa seems to have two leaders, one on the way out and one poised to take over. Ramaphosa, who emerged from Zuma's shadow after replacing them as head of the ruling party in December, represented the country last week in a high-profile visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
In a speech back home on Tuesday, Ramaphosa delivered an anti-corruption message widely viewed as a coded attack on Zuma and their associates.
"We remain resolute that no act of corruption will go unpunished, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator," Ramaphosa said, adding that national development "cannot take root in a sea of patronage, greed and willful economic sabotage."
Zuma, meanwhile, returned on the same day from an African Union summit in Ethiopia, where they also talked about corruption. They acknowledged a problem in Africa but called it "quite exaggerated" at times and said entities outside the continent encourage African corruption for their own benefit.
Zuma's office said they also hosted a dinner commemorating the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013. Some South African media characterized the dinner as an informal farewell to fellow leaders.
The Ethiopia trip contrasted with Ramaphosa's up-tempo appearance among world leaders at Davos, where they promised that South Africa was entering a "new era" of clean government and business confidence.
A former union leader during apartheid, Ramaphosa built a reputation as a shrewd ANC negotiator during the early 1990s transition from white minority rule to democracy and later became a wealthy business person.
Zuma, also a figure in the anti-apartheid movement, has been embroiled in scandals, including multi-million-dollar upgrades to their private home with state money and their association with the Guptas, a business family accused of looting state enterprises and influencing Cabinet ministers for their own benefit. Both Zuma and the Guptas have denied wrongdoing.
High-profile investigations have picked up pace since Ramaphosa became ruling party leader.
On Tuesday, Lucky Montana, a former CEO of South Africa's passenger rail agency, told a parliamentary inquiry that they resisted pressure to appoint Gupta associates to the agency's board. Parliament is investigating similar allegations of corruption and mismanagement at other state-owned enterprises, including power utility Eskom.
Under pressure in recent weeks to step aside and improve the ruling party's image ahead of the 2019 elections, Zuma has appointed a commission of inquiry to look into corruption allegations. They could be looking to secure benefits after the presidency including protection from prosecution, according to analysts.
The options for an early Zuma exit include resignation; their recall by the ruling party's leadership; and impeachment or a vote of no-confidence in parliament, where the ANC holds a majority.
Maimane, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said that as long as Zuma is president and Ramaphosa is head of the ruling party, the country is left "not knowing which direction is being pursued."

Re “Keep ICE Arrests Out of Court” (Op-Ed, Nov. 27):
As César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández points out, equal access to justice — a founding principle of our country — is threatened when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seize suspected undocumented immigrants from our courthouses.
These actions discourage immigrants from coming to court as witnesses, plaintiffs and defendants and undermine the country's promise of justice for all. That's why the American Bar Association House of Delegates adopted a resolution in August calling on Congress to add courthouses to the list of “sensitive locations” in which immigration enforcement actions can be taken only in emergency circumstances.
Schools, hospitals and churches are already considered sensitive locations. Free and unfettered access to courthouses is essential to the administration of justice. Do we really want to discourage domestic violence victims or witnesses of crime from visiting our institutions of justice?
HILARIE BASS, MIAMI
The writer is president of the American Bar Association.
Penn State York is now offering a week-long "Social Justice and Education" course to teach educators, counselors, and social workers to employ a “culturally responsive lens” in the classroom.
According to the university's website, the course will be taught by Kathy Roy, associate professor of literacy education at Penn State Harrisburg and coordinator of the literary education program, and will focus on training educators to be "culturally responsive" toward their students.
"Every day, every teacher makes multiple decisions that impact social justice and equity in their classroom."

The course is also intended to address questions concerning “the needs of diverse student populations,” ways in which “students, teachers, and administrators benefit from culturally responsive approaches,” and other presumed benefits of “equity and social justice.”
In addition, the Social Justice and Equity in Education workshop will feature local artists who will share their perspectives on art in education “to celebrate community and diversity,” which Roy described as part of the course's non-traditional approach, which also incorporates lectures and workshops put on by “nationally-renowned educators and scholars.”

The school notes that Roy's academic experience is “grounded in social justice frameworks,” saying their research primarily “examines the classroom and community experiences of new and existing refugee and immigrant populations in the U.S., focusing particularly on the intersections of race, culture, language, and other markers of identity.”
Francine Baker, coordinator of the master of education in Teaching and Curriculum at Penn State York, said the course will provide useful tools and techniques to “maximize the learning experience” in the classroom.

“Every day, every teacher makes multiple decisions that impact social justice and equity in their classroom, school, and thus the community-at-large,” Baker explained. “Every student comes with their own story, beliefs, values and ideas. The summer institute at Penn State offers educators the research and strategies to support and expand educational practices that connect students and maximize the learning experience.”
Baker also maintained that the course will allow educators to “design activities to directly embed in their curricular area, classroom and school, while earning three graduate credits or Act 48 hours.”

A bag that washed ashore near a private harbor has been confirmed as coming from a small plane carrying six people that disappeared over Lake Erie near Cleveland, authorities said Monday as they resumed a search for the missing aircraft.
The city said there have been multiple reports of debris washing ashore east of Burke Lakefront Airport, where a plane carrying a family of four and two neighbors departed late Thursday. John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting. Their wife, Sue, their two teenage sons, Jack and Andrew, and two neighbors were also aboard.
Police confirmed that a bag recovered Sunday was from the aircraft. It was found near Shoreby Club Harbor in Bratenahl, a small lakeside community. No other details were released immediately.
The other debris hadn't been verified as coming from the Cessna 525 Citation.
The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport, northwest of downtown Columbus. The plane suddenly lost altitude about 2 miles out, according to a flight-tracking service.
Fleming's father has said the family and friends went to a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game.
The city of Cleveland said there were light winds and fairly calm waters Monday for seven vessels and four dive teams searching waters 35 to 45 feet deep. The search grid area is some 2.5 miles from east to west along the shoreline and 2 miles north to south into the lake.
The U.S. Coast Guard and crews from Cleveland city agencies, the cities of Akron and Toledo, Ohio's Department of Natural Resources, New York State Police and Underwater Marine Contractors are involved in the search by air, shore and water.
The Coast Guard began searching the air after being notified soon after the plane's disappearance. High waves and blustery conditions prevented smaller Coast Guard boats from the Cleveland area from deploying Thursday night. A 140-foot Coast Guard cutter joined a search that covered 128 square miles of the lake on Friday.
Weather and water conditions didn't allow for recovery efforts to begin Saturday, but crews searched for the plane until darkness fell Sunday.
The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Mitch Haniger and Mike Zunino homered against Ervin Santana early, and the Seattle Mariners bullpen held off the Minnesota Twins late in a 6-4 victory Wednesday night.
Ben Gamel added three hits and two runs for the Mariners, who have won 12 of 17 games. Rookie Sam Gaviglio picked up the win by pitching into the sixth inning, and four relief pitchers combined to close the door on the Twins' attempt to come back from a 5-0 deficit.
Edwin Diaz recorded four outs and dealt with a scare in the ninth inning to pick up their 11th save in 13 opportunities and bring Seattle one win away from the .500 mark.
The Mariners never trailed, grabbing the lead before Santana recorded an out when Haniger drove a two-run homer to left. Two innings later, Zunino continued their hot hitting with a three-run homer off the facing of the second deck in left-center field to give Seattle a five-run lead. Zunino is hitting .396 since May 29 with four homers against the Twins in that span.
Santana (8-4) gave up a season-high nine hits in five innings, their second-shortest start of the season. It was the fourth time this year they allowed five or more runs and the third time they allowed multiple home runs in a game. The Twins ace doesn't have a win in their last four home starts.
Gaviglio (3-1) earned their third win in three decisions for the Mariners despite tiring after four strong innings. The rookie finished 5 1/3 innings and struck out five but allowed a career-high three home runs. Eduardo Escobar and Byron Buxton hit solo home runs in the fifth inning, and Miguel Sano hit a two-run homer in the sixth to knock out Gaviglio and bring the Twins within striking distance at 6-4.
James Pazos, Nick Vincent, Marc Rzepczynski and Edwin Diaz combined for 3 2/3 scoreless innings out of the Mariners bullpen, one night after Seattle relief pitchers gave up 11 runs in a 20-7 loss. The Twins had a chance in the ninth Wednesday night with two on and two outs, but Eddie Rosario struck out and Brian Dozier flied out to deep center to end it.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Mariners: SS Jean Segura (right ankle sprain) did agility drills and took batting practice before the game Wednesday. According to manager Scott Servais, the team will know within a couple of days whether Segura will need a rehab assignment. Servais had hoped to get their shortstop off the 10-day DL at some point during the Mariners' upcoming weekend series in Texas but admitted it may take a bit longer.
Twins: LHP Hector Santiago (strained left shoulder) will throw a side session on Thursday to see if he'll be ready in time for the Twins' doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians on Saturday. Manager Paul Molitor indicated the team has several options for a spot starter if Santiago can't appear, though they ruled out long reliever Tyler Duffey.
UP NEXT
Mariners: LHP Ariel Miranda (6-2) takes the mound in Thursday's matinee to conclude the four-game series. They have not allowed more than two earned runs in any of their last six starts.
Twins: RHP Jose Berrios (5-1) aims for their third win in a row. They led the Twins to two victories on their recent West Coast trip, allowing two earned runs in each start.
As for the Microbus-inspired ID Buzz? That hasn't been cleared for production, but it might stand a chance. While the original Microbus concept was unlikely to ever hit the streets because of its one-off platform, the Buzz might make it because it shares the same underpinnings as other ID models. The uncertainty could lead to a prolonged wait, however. A finished Buzz might not be ready until closer to 2025.
Even the 2020 window is a long way off, so we wouldn't count on everything panning out no matter how accurate the insiders might be. However, the plans at least make sense. The regular ID is clearly aimed at drivers who would otherwise buy the Golf, which is considerably more popular in Europe than it is in the States. Also, the Crozz may be an ideal EV for a large-scale American launch. Its dual-motor all-wheel drive, far stronger 302HP output and relatively realistic design could help it sell in volume to Americans concerned that EVs might not handle snow and rough back roads.

Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz (Likud) announced that the "trans-Samaria" train line will be extended to the Tapuah Junction.
The train line, which is still being planned, was originally set to end in the city of Ariel. It will run from Rosh Ha'ayin, providing residents of Judea and Samaria a safe and efficient way to commute to central Israel. It is also expected to allow for economic growth, as more opportunities open up in Samaria and additional Samaria residents gain the option of commuting.
Last week, Katz met with Samaria Regional Council Head Yossi Dagan, Transportation Ministry Deputy Director-General Kobi Blitstein, Netivei Israel CEO Nissim Peretz, and other officials involved, ordering Netivei Israel (Israel's transport infrastructure company) to appoint a director for the project this month.
"Advancing the plan to extend the train to Tapuah Junction is critical to the settlements' development, and has historical significance," Dagan said. "I support Minister Katz for the leadership they displayed in this decision."
"The residents of Samaria, just like every other resident of Israel, deserve proper service, and certainly, they deserve good and appropriate public transportation.
"In the future, this train line will continue eastward, and connect towns in the Jordan Valley to central Israel. There is no doubt that the planning and execution of this project have great importance, and that it will help Samaria's residents reach central Israel easily and comfortably, using their commute time to work or rest, to enjoy Samaria's scenery, or to simply enjoy the trip."
The North Has Always Depended on the South for its Economic Needs – Annkio Briggs
An environmental activist, Annkio Briggs, has described as false the claim by the Northern Elders' Forum that Northern Nigeria funded the development of the southern part of the country before the discovery of oil.
Briggs, who spoke with newsmen in Port Harcourt, decried the statement credited to NEF's spokesperson, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, that the West and East had no money to run their affairs until they got financial support from the North in the past.
The convener of the Niger Delta Self-Determination Movement said Abdullahi lied against historical facts by saying that the first oil exploration in the country was conducted using funds from groundnut pyramid, cotton, hide and skin, among other cash crops from the North.
Calling on the NEF's spokesperson to stop misleading Nigerians with false information, Briggs maintained that “verifiable records” had shown that the North had always been dependent on the South for its economic and infrastructural needs before and after the amalgamation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates.
“The fallacious and deliberate falsehood by Ango Abdullahi, including the claim that money from the North was used to construct the Nigerian railways, refineries and other facilities and that the first oil exploration was conducted using money from groundnut pyramid, cotton, hide and skin and other cash crops from Northern Nigeria are anti-historical and contrary to historical facts and figures in British archives and all other historical records available to humanity.

Dino Melaye is trying to make Nigeria ungovernable – Bello
Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello says Dino Melaye, member representing Kogi West at the Senate, is trying to make Nigeria ungovernable following their attitude recently.
Bello said this at Kogi State Polytechnic on Monday, when they visited the venue following the protest handled by Melaye and their followers that led to the untimely death of a student and a police officer.
According to Bello, it is unfortunate that somebody charged with the responsibilities of making laws is now taking laws into their hands.
The governor equally said that early this year they received a report concerning the senator's move to disrupt the peace of the state, adding that they also received a report of the incident that happened in front of Kogi State Polytechnic about Dino Melaye, and that their cohorts were trying to disrupt the peace of the state.
They emphasised that they had earlier written to Mr. President about the development in order to rubbish the present administration, making it look like Nigeria was ungovernable.
They said when they heard about the gathering they called on the commissioner of police and DSS to ascertain if they were duly informed about the whole issue, they said they were not aware as they had no information about Dino Melaye, adding that somebody was now lying lifeless and another officer injured following the fracas.
They assured Kogi people that they would do all that were within their reach to make sure peace reign in the state.
Also speaking, Isa Mohammed, rector of Kogi State Polytechnic, said around 9am, while they were addressing their students they saw people gathering in front of the school's gate. On enquiry, they were told that Dino Melaye was having a rally, and then at a stage the number starts increasing to the tone of over 200.
When they noticed it was turning into a fight and there were sporadic gunshots that lasted about one hour, they then called on the commissioner of police to informed them of the development, saying one of their students, Saka Shaibu and officer were shot dead during the fracas.
The police commissioner in their reaction said they were not informed about the gathering and urged politicians to follow due process, adding that Dino Melaye was supposed to inform them and equally take permission from the school management before embarking on such act.

Charlie Hunnam was just a teenager when they first got married, which wound up being some of the most "terrible, painful" years of their life.
During a recent interview with the Associated Press in Las Vegas, the Sons of Anarchy star detailed their Vegas wedding to actor Katharine Towne, whom they met in 1999 at a Dawson's Creek audition when they were 18 years old.
EXCLUSIVE: Charlie Hunnam Thanks 'Incredible Girlfriend' After Ghosting Them for 5 Months for 'Lost City of Z'
"First time I was ever in Vegas, I got married, which didn't turn out that well," Hunnam, 37, recalled. "I'd known the girl for three weeks, and we'd fallen madly in love. It was the first time I had ever been in love."
The couple made the hasty decision to elope before Hunnam had to head back to England. "We thought, 'What if we never see each other again? Let's get married and then we'll have to see each other again even if it's just to get divorced," the actor said. "So we came to Vegas, but I couldn't even get a drink, so I actually didn't think I would be able to get married."
How wrong Hunnam was, because the young pair ended up saying their vows at the Silver Bell Wedding Chapel, which led to "three terrible years," according to The Lost City of Z star. "Three terrible, painful, expensive years," they said. "I got the cats at the end of it, so that was good. There was a small victory."
Hunnam has since been with girlfriend Morgana McNelis for 11 years, though the actor recently confessed to ignoring them for all of five months while filming The Lost City of Z in Colombia last year.
"I just wanted to feel lonely and selfish, so it worked," they told ET at the movie's Los Angeles premiere earlier this month. "Thankfully, I have an incredible girlfriend who's very, very understanding and supportive of these silly whims that I have."

The actor also admits that they do want to settle down at some point in the near future. "I've got three more years 'til the big 4-0. It feels significant, 40 feels really significant for some reason," Hunnam said. "It's just a number like any other, but I gotta start having some kids, get married, start being sensible in my life."
Watch the video below for more on Hunnam's relationship with McNelis.

When President Obama directed the U.S. Ambassador to Israel to allow a U.N. committee to pass an anti-Israel resolution, they betrayed Israel and America. Secretary of State John Kerry made matters worse when they ranted for over an hour against Israel.
Obama's anti-Israel rhetoric in the final days of their presidency is not surprising, since we have known their support for Israel has never been strong. The two-state idea for a lasting peace is a fallacy. It is a failed experiment. There can be no lasting solution for peace until the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas government in Gaza recognize Israel's right to exist.
Most people do not realize there are two competing factions of Muslim Arabs in Israel. Mahmood Abbas is the figurehead for the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah. They were booted out of Gaza when Hamas took control of the government. Hamas is a recognized terrorist organization. Neither group has authority over the other. Neither the PA nor Hamas in Gaza has a mandate from the people they represent to negotiate peace with Israel. Neither group acknowledges Israel's right to exist. Both groups want all of Israel and want to exile all Jews from the land. There can never be a two-state solution under these circumstances.

In 1993, President Bill Clinton hosted Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organization negotiator Mahmood Abbas for the signing of the Oslo Accords. The following year, the Israeli and Palestinian signers received the Nobel Peace Prize. The Oslo Accords created the PA and transferred control of certain Palestinian populated areas to the organization. The Israeli Defense Forces and security began to phase out of Gaza and later from Bethlehem. But, instead of securing peace, the Oslo Accords have worsened the situation. Gaza is now controlled by Hamas and continues to launch missiles into Israel. Jews, Christians and even Arab Muslims are not safe in Gaza, from which Jews and Christians have fled. Many Jews and Christians have also fled Bethlehem. Entering Bethlehem, Jews are confronted with a sign warning them not to enter.
The best way to fail in the future is to continue the same failed policies of the past. When the Hamas government encourages Arab Muslim children to become suicide bombers, and when their children are taught that Jews are pigs or the Satan, there can be no foreseeable two-state solution. The anti-Israel rhetoric of Obama and Kerry is shameful and will soon be gone. The anti-Israel resolution by the U.N. is more than just cause to defund that incompetent organization.
Mat Staver is founder and chairperson of Liberty Counsel and President of Christians in Defense of Israel.

Disney
Fans of the Star Wars franchise are still coming to terms with Carrie Fisher's death after a heart attack. Mark Hamill has been continuing to pay respects to their friend and longtime co-star, and meanwhile, headlines about Disney's reportedly staggering insurance policy on Fisher are beginning to circulate.
Insurance Insider reveals how, in the event that Fisher became unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to portray Princess Leia in the newest slate of Star Wars films, a policy stipulated that Disney could receive a $50-million payout. The policy was underwritten by a New Jersey agency for Lloyd's of London and looks set to trigger after the star's passing.
Fisher had completed work for the upcoming Episode VIII, but filming on Episode IX — which would have starred them in a substantial capacity — had yet to begin. Insurance Insider notes that this payout would be the insurance industry's highest ever single-person accident claim if it happens:
Sources said that the claim would be widely spread within the Lloyd's personal accident market, with more than 20 carriers on the binder. However, the loss would cause substantial damage to the 2016 underwriting result for the segment, with some Lloyd's insurers writing personal accident books with $10mn or less of annual premiums.
With the loss of Fisher still so raw, Disney has yet to reveal how Fisher's absence will affect Episode IX. However and immediately after Fisher's death, the question arose of how Disney could honor Fisher and their iconic character. Will they be portrayed through unused footage, or simply spoken of in an offscreen manner? The overwhelming call from fans is that a CGI portrayal should be avoided at all costs.
In this week's most genuinely impressive act of celebrity almost-heroism, Drake reportedly offered to try to talk a man down from a bridge on the way back from a tour stop in Manchester, England.
According to the Manchester Evening News, the singer's tour bus got caught in a traffic jam near where police were attempting to coax a potential jumper down from the side of a bridge. An officer was approached by a member of Drake's entourage, who “offered for Drake to speak to the male on the bridge, if that would help.” The police declined Drake's offer and the man was eventually brought to a hospital for treatment.

A judge declined to set bond for an Ohio man during their first court appearance after allegedly ramming a vehicle into a crowd of people demonstrating against a white supremacist rally Saturday in Charlottesville, Va.
Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer was killed, and at least 19 other people were in injured in the attack.
The Charlottesville Police Department said Saturday that James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and run.
During today's Charlottesville court hearing, as NPR's Debbie Elliott reports, Fields "appeared by video from jail, dressed in a gray and white-striped prison jumpsuit."
They answered the judge's questions with a simple "Yes, sir" and "No, sir," according to The Associated Press.
Fields told Judge Robert Downer that they could not afford a lawyer. "Downer assigned a court-appointed attorney to represent Fields, and set another hearing for Aug. 25," Debbie adds. "Until then, the judge said, Fields would remain in jail with no bond in part because they have no ties to the area."
The AP adds that the judge told the court that the "public defenders' office informed them it could not represent Fields because a relative of someone in the office was injured in Saturday's protest." Fields was taken into custody on Saturday after the incident.
Details are emerging about Fields' background and their interest in Nazi Germany. One of the suspect's high school teachers in Ohio told member station WVXU that Fields "was intelligent and didn't cause trouble," but was "also deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy."
Derek Weimer, who had Fields in three classes at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Ky., told WVXU, "He went to a good school. Lived in a good neighborhood. There were plenty of people around to try to guide them in the right direction. My first feeling is we failed. I failed."
Fields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Toledo Blade that they were aware their son was going to what they called an "alt-right" rally. "I told them to be careful," Bloom said, according to the newspaper. "[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully."
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron has shaken up a two-day visit to Nigeria with a stop at the New Afrika Shrine, a concert hall founded by the late music legend Fela Kuti.

Macron's visit to Africa's most populous nation ends Wednesday.
Their visit to the New Afrika Shrine was for a launch event for the 2020 Season of African Cultures in France.
Macron also is inaugurating an Alliance Francaise cultural center in Lagos and meeting young Nigerian entrepreneurs.

Oral contraceptives appear to reduce the incidence of some less common reproductive cancers, like endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, which is often detected at an advanced stage, when it is hard to treat. There is some evidence that birth control pills may also reduce the odds of colorectal cancer.
A British study of over 46,000 women who were recruited in 1968, during the early days of the pill, and followed for up to 44 years found that despite increases in breast and cervical cancers among those who used the pill, the effect on overall cancer rates was neutral, because other cancers were reduced.
Other studies have reached the same conclusion.
“In aggregate, over a woman's lifetime contraceptive use might prevent more cancers” than it causes, said David J. Hunter, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at University of Oxford in Britain, who wrote a commentary on the Danish study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week.
“There is good data to show that five or more years of oral contraceptive use substantially reduces ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer risk, and may reduce colorectal cancer,” they said. “And the protection persists for 10 or 20 years after cessation.”
While the new study's findings about breast cancer are important, “these results are not a cause for alarm,” said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, a professor of women's health at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

“It's really problematic to look at one outcome in isolation. Hormonal contraception has a complex matrix of benefits and risks, and you need to look at the overall pattern.”
Dr. Hal Lawrence, an obstetrician-gynecologist and chief executive officer of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said their biggest concern was that the study would “scare women away from effective contraception,” resulting in unwanted pregnancies.
“We're never going to eliminate all the potential risks that come with medication,” Dr. Lawrence said. “But we know a lot of the benefits, and the No. 1 benefit is preventing unintended pregnancies and the health and socio-economic risks that go along with that.”
In some ways, the results of the new study were not surprising. Research had linked birth control pills to a modest increase in breast cancer decades ago.
What was surprising was that the risk has persisted even with new pills that use lower doses of estrogen than the first generation of pills that came on the market — and that the increase in risk was experienced even by women who don't take hormones orally, relying instead on implanted intrauterine devices that release a hormone “locally” into the uterus.
Many older women who have completed their families and are at higher risk for breast cancer because of their age turn to the IUD precisely because they want to minimize exposure to hormones.
So what are women to do?
Here's some advice from top doctors who were interviewed about the implications of the new research.

• First, if you're concerned, make an appointment to speak with your health care provider. Think about your priorities and preferences, the stage of life you're in, your family plans and medical history, and find a doctor who will take time to listen to your concerns.
“Providers do tend to think a preference for a nonhormonal method is inherently unscientific, and we tend to dismiss that preference as not being founded in fact, and we have to recognize that women have real personal reasons for their preferences,” said Dr. Christine Dehlendorf, director of the program in woman-centered contraception in the department of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

“We have to trust women to know what their preferences are, and what their abilities are to use certain methods, and to choose the methods that are the best choice for them.”
• If you're using oral contraceptives for reasons other than birth control, such as irregular periods, premenstrual syndrome or acne, consider taking a break from pills, suggested Dr. Marisa Weiss, an oncologist who founded breastcancer.org. The condition may have improved since you started taking the pills, or you may be able to find a nonhormonal way to manage it.
• If you use an IUD, find out if it releases the hormone progestin, which the Danish study implicated in the increased breast cancer risk. Both nonhormonal IUDs like the Paragard (or copper IUD) and hormone-releasing IUDs provide long-term, reversible contraception, Dr. Manson said. (Because an IUD can be effective for several years, it's easy to forget about it; some women may not recall which kind they have.) Keep in mind that hormone-releasing IUDs may make menstrual periods lighter, while nonhormonal IUDs may make them heavier.
• If you're not sexually active on a regular basis with a steady partner, or are using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, ask your doctor if this might be a good time to take a break from the pill. One of the findings of the Danish study was that the risks increased with longer duration of hormone use.
• Ask your provider about new contraceptive products or older methods that have fallen out of favor but might be a good fit for you. The new diaphragm Caya, for example, does not have to be fitted and can be purchased at the drugstore with a doctor's prescription. Apps can guide you through fertility-awareness methods that rely on daily tracking of body temperature and cervical mucous (these methods require motivation and discipline). Be aware that many doctors say these methods are less reliable than hormonal contraception; IUDs and sterilization are the most effective at preventing pregnancy.
• As you approach 40, you may want to discuss nonhormonal methods of contraception with your health provider. The risk of breast cancer increases with age, as does the risk of complications associated with oral contraceptives, such as blood clots in the legs and the lungs.
Most gynecologists do not think women under 35 or 40 need to worry about the findings of the new study. “The risk seen in this study is an incredibly small risk,” said Dr. Melissa Gilliam, a pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at the University of Chicago.
“This is not a call to change contraceptive behavior. An adolescent who uses birth control pills for painful periods when she's 14 should not be hearing they have an increased risk of breast cancer.”

• If you have already had children and your family is complete, consider surgical options — for women and men. “We should be talking about vasectomy more,” Dr. Manson said. “It should be seriously considered in many relationships.”
Among married couples where the woman has taken responsibility for contraception for most of the relationship, this can be a way to share the burden.
And if your goal is to reduce your overall risk of breast cancer, know that having children before age 30, breast-feeding at any age for any length of time, minimizing exposure to radiation, and not using hormone therapy after menopause — all can help reduce risk.
Lifestyle changes — including not smoking, losing weight, exercising at least three to four hours a week, limiting red meat, and drinking no more than three alcoholic drinks a week — may reduce your risk, Dr. Weiss said.
“We now have proof that you can lower your risk at any age by modifying these factors,” they said.

39 Indian scientists co-authored papers that got Nobel Physics prize
DH News Service, New Delhi, Oct 7 2017, 1:59 IST
The Nobel Prize for Physics, 2017, which was given for the detection of gravitational waves is a “proud moment” for India also, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said on Friday.
It said the discovery papers were co-authored by 39 Indian authors/scientists from nine institutions.
“An opportunity for India to take leadership in this field has opened up with the LIGO-India mega-science project that was granted ‘in-principle' approval by the Union Cabinet on February 17, 2016,” it added.
The department said LIGO-India project was “on track” for commencing operations by 2024.
“A LIGO-India Apex committee, together with the LIGO-India Project Management Board (LI-PMB) and LIGO-India Scientific Management Board (LI-SMB), were constituted in August 2016 to oversee the project execution. There has been a rapid pace of progress since then,” the DST said.
The 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics has been conferred on three scientists — Rainer Weiss, Barry C Barish and Kip S Thorne — under the LIGO Project for their discovery of gravitational waves, 100 years after Einstein's theory of General Relativity predicted it.
Indian scientists, who are co-authors of the discovery paper, are from CMI Chennai, ICTS-TIFR Bengaluru, IISER-Kolkata, IISER-Trivandrum, IIT-Gandhinagar, IPR Gandhinagar, IUCAA Pune, RRCAT Indore and TIFR Mumbai, the DST said.
“This is a proud moment for India also,” it said.
The department said Indian scientist C V Vishveshvara of RRI, Bengaluru and S V Dhurandhar of IUCAA, Pune and “some others” from India made “seminal contributions to this field which contributed towards the principles behind the LIGO Detector”.
“The group led by Bala Iyer at the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in collaboration with scientists in France had pioneered the mathematical calculations used to model gravitational wave signals from orbiting black holes and neutron stars,” the department said.
Theoretical work that combined black holes and gravitational waves was published by Vishveshvara in 1970.
“These contributions are prominently cited in the discovery paper.” the department said.
GUISELEY are just a point above the National League drop zone after sliding to a 2-1 home defeat at the hands of Tranmere Rovers on Easter Monday, writes Tom Feaheny.
Guiseley are just a point above the National League drop zone after sliding to a 2-1 home defeat at the hands of Tranmere Rovers on Easter Monday, writes Tom Feaheny.
But the Lions' fate remains in their own hands with two matches to go, and boss Adam Lockwood said: “We are disappointed with the loss, but performance-wise I cannot criticise the lads, we gave it everything but we just couldn't get the result we wanted.
“We know how important Bromley on Saturday is and we will be going with the intention of doing the good things from this Tranmere loss.”
Guiseley played at a high tempo and nearly took the lead when James Wesolowski fired wide from just outside the area.
Rovers also went close when from a corner, Andy Cook poked the ball towards goal, but Connor Brown was in the right place to clear it off the line.
The home side took the lead when Derek Asamoah saw their looping 25-yard effort go into the top right-hand corner leaving Scott Davies with no chance.
The second half began with Tranmere on the front foot, they equalised with their first attack when a Jeff Hughes corner found James Norwood who scored with a free header.
The visitors got a second when when Liam Ridehalgh floated the ball into the area, and Cook controlled it well and fired past Jonny Maxted.
Guiseley: Maxted, Brown, Palmer, Lawlor, Williams (Preston 83,) Wesolowsi (Purver 70), Walton, Hurst, Hatfield, Rankine, Asamoah.
Tranmere: Davies; Vaughan, Ridehalgh, McNulty, Ihiekwe, Buxton, Hughes, C Jennings (Dunn 63), Wallace, Cook (Stockton 68), Norwood (Mangan 90).
According to WEMA director Joey Cooper, it was to test the sirens so they could be upgraded from analog to digital.
“WEMA has an older system that has not been updated in a number of years,” said Cooper. “The current system is a one-way analog system, and upon activation, there is no way on knowing if they were actually activated without actually hearing it.”
The Wilson County Commission voted on and passed funding for the upgrade to the digital system in June. The new system will allow emergency managers and public safety officials activate and monitor the status of the system.
“The radio shop has been going around to each siren for several months now upgrading the hardware to make the needed upgrade,” said Cooper. “The last two weeks, they've been installing the needed software and testing the sirens on an individual and on a zone basis.”
According to Cooper, WEMA officials to be finished with the upgrades and testing by the end of the week.
Boady Santavy, a 20-year-old Sarnia weightlifter expected to compete in next month's Commonwealth Games in Australia, is charged in connection with a hit-and-run crash that left a pedestrian seriously hurt.
Santavy turned themselves in to Sarnia police Monday morning, several hours after police say the crash happened at 1:30 a.m. on Lakeshore Road. The 29-year-old man who was struck has been taken to London hospital, where they were listed in serious condition.
Police say the driver left the scene.
Police said Santavy turned themselves in at about 9:50 a.m. Monday and has been charged with failing to remain at the scene of a collision.
Police are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact city police at 519-344-8861, ext. 6152 or 6132.
Santavy, the son and grandson of competitive weightlifters, earned a sixth-place finish at the International Weightlifting Federation world championships in California late last year.

US Vice President warns North Korea 'not to test Trump,' says 'all options are on the table.
US President Donald Trump on Monday warned North Korea that the "era of strategic patience is over."
At a joint news conference with South Korean President Hwang Kyo-Ahn, US VIce President Mike Pence said, "Since 1992, the United States and our allies have stood together for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
"But the era of strategic patience is over. President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.
"We hope to achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all options are on the table.
"North Korea would do well not to test their resolve — or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region."
When asked for their message for North Korean leader Kin Jong-un, Trump said two words: "Gotta behave."
3 killed as building collapses in Anambra
Oko (Anambra) – Three persons on Tuesday were killed following the collapse of a four-storey building still under construction in Okeani, Oko community in Anambra state.
The building located close to the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, is owned by an indigene based in Europe.
A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the incident occurred at about 2a.m Tuesday after heavy rainfall recorded in the area.
The source said that the deceased, all believed to be non-indigenes and construction workers in the building were fast asleep when the structure collapsed.
A neighbor, Angela Ivories told journalists that one of the survivors and student of the Oko polytechnic, simply identified as Samuel sustained fracture on their hand.
“When the building first showed sign of collapse on Sunday, Musa advised their co-workers to vacate the building, but some of them did not heed their advice,” they said.
According to Ivories, it was that same night they were advised to vacate the building that the structure collapsed.
Anambra State Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, Prof. Peter Katchy, confirmed the incident.
Katchy said that they were trying to get to the root cause of the collapsed building, and advised those constructing houses to always engage experts.

THE GAME: The Angels began their final week of spring training in Arizona with an 8-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night in Tempe.
PITCHING REPORT: Right-hander Osmer Morales got the start, with Tyler Skaggs having taken their turn earlier in the day in an intrasquad game. Morales allowed one hit in 3-1/3 scoreless innings. They struck out five. The Angels currently view Morales primarily as starting pitching depth, Manager Mike Scioscia said. Eventually Morales could work their way into a big league bullpen role. … Right-handers Cam Bedrosian and Blake Parker each gave up solo homers in their inning of work. … Right-hander Felix Peña pitched 1-1/3 innings, allowing a homer to Dan Vogelbach. They also struck out three more, giving them 15 strikeouts in nine innings this spring, which would appear to make them a favorite to win a spot on the opening day roster. … Right-hander Justin Anderson is not among the Angels' top prospects, but they came up from minor league camp to pitch their fifth game of the spring. They have not allowed a run yet.
HITTING REPORT: Albert Pujols had three singles, including poking an opposite-field hit at the end of a 10-pitch at-bat in the fourth inning. Pujols spent Sunday getting extra at-bats in a minor league game. They had four hits, including a homer in the minor league game. … Andrelton Simmons also had three hits.  They are 6 for 16 since returning from a shoulder injury that cost them a week. … The Angels scored seven runs in the fifth, all charged to pitchers who will not start the season in the majors.
DEFENSE REPORT: Right fielder Kole Calhoun threw out a runner at the plate with a one-hop throw. … Simmons, the shortstop, raced far into the outfield to make a catch of a popup.
UP NEXT: Angels (Parker Bridwell) vs. Diamondbacks (Robbie Ray), Tuesday, 1 p.m., Tempe Diablo Stadium, Fox Sports West/KLAA (AM 830).
N-Delta group blasts Amaechi, Oshiomhole over attacks on Jonathan
By Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief
Save Ijaw Nation Group, SING, yesterday, took on the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Amaechi and former Edo State governor, Mr Adams Oshiomhole, over their attacks on former President Goodluck Jonathan, describing them as betrayers.
Amaechi and Oshiomhole were reported to have spoken against Jonathan at separate events on Tuesday.
While the former Edo State governor had queried Jonathan's capacity as President, Amaechi had claimed that Nigeria was heading towards a civil war during the 2015 elections.
However, replying the two politicians in a statement, yesterday, SING accused Amaechi of being one of those threatening war while Jonathan was preaching peace, in the run up to the 2015 general elections.
Co-ordinator of the group, Mr. Otobo Osborne also reminded Oshiomhole that they had before now always praised Jonathan for their statesmanship but has turned against the ex-President because they (Oshiomhole) was out of job and needed one.
They said: “Amaechi, the man who threatened that their party would form a parallel government if it did not win the 2015 election now accuses former President Jonathan who said ‘my ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian,' of leading Nigeria to a civil war. If this is not delusional thinking then it is hard to imagine what is.
“Never since the civil war has Nigeria been as divided as it is today with different regions of the nation giving quit notices to each other. A prudent person would in such circumstances tailor their speech to build unity, but not Amaechi.”
“Sadly, what we are experiencing today is the culmination of the threats made during the course of the general 2015 elections by persons like Amaechi.
“President Jonathan has demonstrated statesmanship. I think there is hope for Nigeria. What the Edo election has confirmed is that when the President and Commander-in-Chief puts the country first and conducts themselves as a statesman, not just as a party leader, credible elections are possible.
“Of course, it is not surprising that Oshiomhole would change their tone today especially when they are out of a job and is desperate to curry favour with the hope of getting a new job but we wish to remind them that under Jonathan, elections were free and fair as they said and there was no ‘inconclusive elections.
“In a democratic setting, the most basic requirement of any leader is that they provide the platform for democracy and the economy to thrive. On both scores, no one can fault Jonathan. We are however, not surprised at the utterances of these two characters because they have proven to be double-faced liars and serial betrayers.”

CLEVELAND — Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant is out of the lineup against the Cleveland Indians two days after being hit on the head by a pitch.
Cubs manager Joe Maddon said before Tuesday night's game that the 2016 National League MVP has a cut above their left eye but no concussion after being hit Sunday by Colorado's German Marquez.
"I think he's fine, but getting hit in the head is a pretty traumatic experience," Maddon said. "Fortunately, it never happened to me, but it happened to him."
The pitch hit the underside of the flap on Bryant's helmet, and they were helped off the field. Bryant is batting .319 with two homers and 11 RBIs this season.
Tommy La Stella started at third base and batted fifth Tuesday. Second baseman Javier Baez batted second, in Byrant's usual spot in the lineup.
Shortstop Addison Russell was in the lineup after experiencing an allergic reaction to a postgame meal Sunday in the Cubs' clubhouse. Russell, who is allergic to shellfish, began eating what they thought was lemon chicken but actually was shrimp.
Russell spent the night in Denver after being hospitalized briefly and rejoined the team Monday.
"Being taken on a gurney by paramedics was pretty scary," they said. "I went to the hospital, they gave me an IV, and three hours later I was fine."
The Cubs are making their first appearance at Progressive Field since beating the Indians in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series to win their first title since 1908.

TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Researchers are urging Albanian authorities to build a museum to display hundreds of Roman and Greek artifacts and ancient shipwrecks that are sitting under the country's barely explored coastline.
Archaeologists at the Albanian Underwater Archaeology conference warned Tuesday that the wealth of underwater artifacts in the country's southwestern seabed, near its border with Greece, could easily fall prey to looters or treasure hunters.
James Goold, chairperson of the Florida-based RPM Nautical Foundation, said the objects — dating from the 8th century B.C. through to World War II — would be a great tourist attraction if properly displayed.
Goold's RPM has mapped out the Ionian seabed from the Greek border all along to the Vlora Bay, finding at least 22 shipwrecks from the ancient times to World War II and hundreds of ancient amphorae. Those long, narrow terracotta vessels carried olive oil and wine along trade routes between North Africa and the Roman Empire, where Albania, then Illyria, was a crossroad.
"The time has come to build a museum for Albanian and foreign tourists," said Albanian archaeologist Neritan Ceka.
Some amphorae may have already been looted — they are not infrequently seen decorating restaurants along the Albanian coastline.
Albania is trying to protect and capitalize on its rich underwater heritage, long neglected by its former communist regime, but preservation still receives scarce funding from the government in one of Europe's poorest nations.
The arrival of RPM's Hercules research vessel 11 years ago was "a real revolution," Ceka said, praising its professional divers, high-tech sonar and remotely operated underwater vehicle.
RPM and a joint Albanian-Italian expedition are the only scientific underwater efforts in Albania so far, both with the government's approval.
Now RPM believes it's time for the not-for-profit Institute of Nautical Archaeology research organization, which is based in Texas, U.S., to explore the possibilities of excavating shipwrecks, a financially expensive and scientifically delicate process.
"There's a special environment in Albania, because the coast has been so protected for so many years," said INA's David Ruff, a former commander of a nuclear-powered submarine.
Ruff said "one of the real gems of Albania is the Butrint site" — a UNESCO-protected ancient Greek and Roman site in southernmost Albania close to the Greek border.
They said INA's Virazon II research vessel will stay for a month in Albanian waters "to understand the coast of Albania and if we can run a large-scale excavation here."

OTTAWA — The federal government says it taking further steps to prevent foreign steel and aluminum from being dumped into the North American market just ahead of a U.S. decision on whether to slap punishing duties on those products.
Canada, Mexico and Europe were exempted from import duties of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum when they were first imposed in March but those exemptions expire on Friday.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement late Wednesday that Canada has expanded the scope of its country of origin marking regime for steel and aluminum products to better determine where they come from.
Morneau said this builds on new funding announced in late April of an initial outlay of more than $30 million over five years to hire 40 new officers to investigate trade-related complaints, including those linked to steel and aluminum.
That announcement came about a month after the Canada Border Services Agency was granted extra powers to identify businesses that try to dodge import duties and ship cheap foreign steel and aluminum through the Canadian market.
The latest federal attempt to ward off the tariffs coincided with a concerted effort by Canada and its European allies to try to stop the Trump administration from imposing the tariffs this week.
The Associated Press reported late Wednesday, however, that the Trump administration is planning to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports after failing to win concessions from the European Union.
Two people familiar with the discussions said the administration's plans could change if the two sides are able to reach a last-minute agreement before the reprieve expires. The Associated Press report did not indicate if Canada would also be hit with the tariffs.
In addition to discussing the matter on Wednesday with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trudeau also spoke by phone with the premiers of Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan.
The Prime Minister's Office said they "all agreed to continue to defend the Canadian steel and aluminum industry from unwarranted tariffs and to stand up for the best interests of all Canadian workers and businesses."

Switzerland Returned $322.5 Million Abacha Loot With Interest – Envoy
Switzerland said it has returned all the money kept in the country by late Nigeria's Head of State Gen. Sani Abacha, with 1.5 million dollars interest.
Amb. Pio Wennubst, Assistant Director-General and Head, Global Cooperation Department, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, told the Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York.
Wennubst said Switzerland returned about 322.5 million dollars (N116.11 billion) to the Federal Government.
According to him, the original amount was 321 million dollars.
The Federal Government had announced receipt of 322.51 million from the Swiss government as part of the looted funds recovered from the late former Head of State.
The Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, through their Special Adviser, Media and Communications, Oluyinka Akintunde, had confirmed the receipt of money from Switzerland.
Akintunde said: “We state that $322,515,931.83 (N116,105,735,458.80) was received into a Special Account in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Dec. 18, 2017, from the Swiss government''.
Confirming this, Wennubst said: “We returned 321 million dollars including the interests.
“We return all the amount, 322.5 million dollars including the interest for the time that the funds were blocked''.
The Swiss envoy also said that the money was returned to the Nigerian Government unconditionally.
“We are not talking about the condition; there was a programme on the social safety net that was developed by the Government of Nigeria and the Bank.
“After discussing, the only condition, set by the judiciary, not by us, was that the return of this asset should have been monitored by the World Bank and this is where we worked on''.
According to him, these funds were part of the Nigerian Government contributions to the social safety net programme, “plus concessional loans from the Bank”.
NAN recalls that the ‘Abacha loot' was frozen in 2014 by a Swiss court after a legal procedure against their son, Abba Abacha.
Originally deposited in Luxembourg, the money was a fraction of the billions of dollars allegedly looted during their rule from 1993 to 1998.
Similarly, the UK Government also pledged its commitment to ensuring that money and other assets illegally transferred from Nigeria are repatriated back to the country.
Mr Nick Dyer, Director General, Economic Development and International, UK Department for International Development told NAN that assets return would contribute to the development of the origin countries.
Dyer said it was an important part of the development process to identify how and where assets were going astray and to also recover them and send them back.

TOWN OF HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) – Friday marked the deadline for Hempstead school officials to submit a plan of action to the New York State Department of Education.
They're trying to revamp one of the state's worst performing school districts, CBS2's Carolyn Gusoff reported. But is there anything in the new plan that promises to finally make a difference?
“There are several areas of concern — governance, budget and fiscal operations, school safety and security,” Acting Superintendent Regina Armstrong said Friday.
Under orders from the state, officials are setting out to rebuild the troubled district with protocols that have eluded Hempstead for years. The blueprint for transformation starts with governance.
Web Extra: CBS2 Exclusive: State Education Commissioner Warns Hempstead School Board To Shape Up Or Risk Dismissal
Chaotic meetings will be remedied with school board and superintendent training already underway on open meetings laws.
For chronic violence – student IDs, an upgraded camera system, more safety officers, and an updated code of conduct and attendance policy in a district where one third of the seniors class are no-shows.
To raise the paltry graduation rate – a plan to make a plan this year through focus groups, town hall meetings, parent workshops and a high school leadership team.
All this was rolled out just weeks after a scathing report by a state-appointed monitor, Jack Bierwirth, who says they will help in its implementation.
“I am enormously hopeful, but this isn't about hopes and it isn't about plans. It's whether things are going to get done or not,” they told Gusoff.
Some of the improvements were initiated by Superintendent Shimon Waronker, but shot down by a divided board while they were placed on forced leave. Trustees who helped bring Waronker to Hempstead told CBS2 they are hopeful about the action plan if the state demands accountability.
The plan will now be executed by some of the same administrators who have presided over the district's shortcomings for years. The difference now is they have milestones to meet, a state monitor reporting to Albany and a very public spotlight on the district.
A spokesperson for the education department says the commissioner will now review the plan and work with the district to ensure it is implemented.
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Alvin Ellis scored 15 of their 18 points with a 3-point barrage in the first half and Michigan State went on to beat Ohio State 74-66 Tuesday night.
Miles Bridges had 17 points and 11 rebounds and Nick Ward scored 15 for Michigan State (16-10, 8-5 Big Ten), which has won four of five.
The Buckeyes (15-12, 5-9) have lost four of six.
Ohio State's Marc Loving scored 22 points and reserve JaQuan Lyle scored all 10 of their points in the first half.
Ellis made five 3-pointers in a 3:38 span of the first half, helping the Spartans take a 21-12 lead and stunning the crowd because the senior was averaging just six points a game.
The Buckeyes later scored 10 straight to take the lead before falling behind 40-34 at halftime.
The Spartans scored the first six points of the second half, building a 12-point lead. Ohio State, once again, rallied with a 17-6 run to pull within one point.
Michigan State finished off the Buckeyes by outscoring them 12-2 to take an 11-point lead and they were able to keep a comfortable cushion.
Ellis made their first five 3-pointers, surpassing their previous career high of three. They finished 6 of 9 beyond the arc and 6 of 11 overall, falling two points shy of their career high.
BIG PICTURE
Ohio State: The Buckeyes, who played in the NIT last season, are in danger of failing to make the NCAA Tournament in two straight seasons for the first time since Thad Matta took over the program in 2004.
Michigan State: The Spartans have improved their chances of extending their NCAA Tournament streak to 20 with their recent surge of success.

Ohio State: Host Nebraska on Saturday.
Michigan State: Play at No. 16 Purdue on Saturday.

A review of tonight's Legion coming up just as soon as I guess wrong about what your dream means…
“Love isn't gonna save us. It's what we have to save. Pain makes us strong enough to do it. All our scars, our anger, our despair — it's armor.” –Syd
Characterization is by and large one of Legion‘s bigger weaknesses, with David and friends exiting primarily as hollow vessels for whatever eccentric way Noah Hawley has found to dramatize superpowers and/or mental illness. Last week's journey inside the minds of Ptonomy and Melanie were cases in point: stunning to look at without offering much insight into either.
To a degree, “Chapter 12” is also rehashing what little we already know about Syd, as its big emotional setpiece is a dramatization of the story they told David last year about the time they swapped bodies with their mother to sleep with their mother's boyfriend. But the ways in which this episode chooses to dramatize that moment and the rest of Syd's difficult childhood, and the superb work that Rachel Keller does (along with the actors playing the younger Syds, particularly Pearl Amanda Dickson as the teen version), work wonders in making them feel like a more well-rounded and complicated character, even if only some of the information we learn is new.
Superpowers can be a wonderful thing, if they're the right powers for the right person. But they ruined Syd Barrett's life, and in turn led them to ruin the lives of people around them They can't touch people without swapping with them, so in their younger years they alternate between shutting themselves off from the world, trying to connect with people without touching them (like trying on the guests' clothes at one of their mom's dinner parties), and lashing out. Swapping with the lacrosse player who came on too strong and called their frigid, then using their body to beat up the mean girls, may be a cathartic response to a group of popular bullies who get to enjoy so many parts of life that Syd can't, but it's also a case of the punishment wildly outstripping the crime. And having sex with their mother's boyfriend traumatizes everyone, and gets an innocent man locked up as a child molester.
Syd is one of Legion‘s most inherently sympathetic characters because of the warmth of Keller's performance, because their love for David is true and unflinching, and because it's clear how much their power has traumatized them But the Syd that David meets throughout this Möbius trip through their life is a much darker and more complicated figure. They turn inward, then lashes out, and takes pleasure in the havoc they wreak and the pain they share with others. (At least they do with the high school kids; they seem just as traumatized as everyone else when they snap back into their own body in the shower.) David themselves doesn't come with a squeaky-clean past(*), which can also be blamed largely on their powers, but the romance with Syd represented them aspiring to their best and kindest possible self, in large part because they had fallen for someone who seemed so fundamentally good. She's never been exactly that (in season one's finale, they risked a lot by prioritizing David over the plan), but here we come to fully appreciate just how far the real Syd is from the idealized vision David has always had of her, and how important it is to Syd not only for David to see that, but to understand their own guarded worldview and how that might help them beat Farouk in the present and the coming threat in the future.
(*) One of the bigger stumbling blocks I sometimes have with the show is reconciling the easy-going nice guy that Dan Stevens is playing with the intensely damaged person David was in the past — and arguably still is now.
Dickson moves to actualise $20bn Brass LNG project
Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has moved to actualise the $20 billion Brass LNG project in the state, in line with their campaign promise to continuously attract investments to the state.
At an interaction with Dr. Jackson Gaius- Obaseki, Chairman, Board of Directors of Brass LNG project, in Lagos, Governor Dickson declared the total commitment of the government and people of Bayelsa State to bring the project to fruition in the shortest possible time.
The governor said that the government will do everything possible to ensure that the project stays on course.
As part of their commitment to the project, the governor said Bayelsa State Government had already allotted an office space to Brass LNG at the Investment Towers in Yenagoa to facilitate the sharing of investable information.
They said: “I am passionate about the Brass LNG project because it will boost the economy of Bayelsa State and the Niger Delta in general by creating jobs for over 18 thousand people at the peak of construction alone, for the project also has licenses for seaport, airport and Free Trade Zone.
“The provision of job opportunities will engender development in the region, reduce youth restiveness, crime and above all, build peace amongst communities.”
The multiplier effect of all of these is that, the Brass LNG project will complement our vision of taking Bayelsa State to the world and bringing the world to Bayelsa State.”
The governor promised to collaborate and partner the Federal Government to create the enabling environment and provide the needed political will for the successful take-off of the project within the shortest possible time.

Unidentified gunmen attacked the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the northern Mali city of Timbuktu on Monday, killing seven people and injuring seven others in what the mission's chief called a "terrorist" attack.
Earlier Monday, gunmen attacked two neighboring U.N. camps in Douentza in the Mopti region of central Mali, killing a Malian soldier and a U.N. peacekeeper and lightly wounding another peacekeeper. The head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, also called that incident a terrorist attack.
The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali is the deadliest of the U.N.'s 16 global peacekeeping operations, and the death of the soldier in Douentza brought the number of U.N. peacekeepers killed in attacks this year to nine, according to the U.N. peacekeeping department. This was also one of the worst losses of mission employees.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and stressed that attacks targeting U.N. peacekeepers "may constitute war crimes under international law," U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said. Guterres commends "the important efforts" that Mali and four neighboring countries are making to combat terrorism and violent extremism and promote peace in the region, Haq added.
In the Timbuktu attack, the mission said five Malian security guards and a Malian contractor working for the mission were killed along with a member of the Malian gendarmerie. It said six U.N. peacekeepers were wounded, two seriously, along with one Malian security guard.
The mission, known as MINUSMA, said it dispatched a quick reaction force and attack helicopters to secure the Timbuktu headquarters. It said U.N. troops killed six assailants.
In Douentza, MINUSMA said a group of attackers fired on a U.N. camp from an adjacent hill and Malian troops returned fire. Another armed group shot at peacekeepers in a neighboring camp who also returned fire, the mission said. The U.N. mission said two attackers were killed in the exchanges.
The U.N. is looking into whether there was any connection between the two attacks.
Annadif, the MINUSMA commander, called for those responsible for "these terrorist acts" to be brought to justice.
In 2135, NASA says an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building could slam into Earth.
According to the Washington Post, scientists say, though the chance is small, the asteroid could slam into Earth on September 22, 2135, destroying lots of living things on the planet.
The odds of the asteroid, named Bennu, actually hitting Earth are one in 2,700. If the asteroid does get too close for comfort, the geniuses at NASA have hatched a plan.
NASA says they could send a nine-ton “bulk impactor” to push the asteroid out of Earth's orbit. The plan is called HAMMER, which stands for (deep breath) Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response.
Though the odds are slim that the massive asteroid will hit Earth, in 1908, what is believed to be an asteroid crashed in Siberia with force 185 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The impact flattened 80 million trees and killed hundreds of reindeer. Scientists say Bennu isn't all bad.
The asteroid is giving scientists a chance to test theories. NASA's OSIRIS-Rex will also map Bennu and figure out what the asteroid is made of.

ATLANTA (AP) — Brandon Nimmo and Adrian Gonzalez each drove in two runs, Jason Vargas pitched five scoreless innings and the New York Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 on Wednesday night.
It was a much-needed reprieve for the Mets, who had lost seven of nine and are 16-25 since starting the season 11-1.
The Braves had rallied to win two of the first three games in the series in the ninth inning, but they couldn't muster a comeback this time, going down in order as Robert Gsellman earned their second save.
Atlanta dropped into second place in the NL East, one-half game behind Washington, the two-time defending division champion that begins a four-game series at SunTrust Park on Thursday.
Jeurys Familia, the Mets' usual closer, avoided trouble in the eighth, getting Nick Markakis to ground into a double play to strand a runner at third.
Vargas (2-3) pitched five scoreless innings, allowing just two hits and one intentional walk with two strikeouts.
The Mets got what they needed from Vargas, who was pitching on three days' rest and began the game 1-3 with a 10.62 ERA in five starts in their first season with New York.
New York made it 2-0 in the seventh off Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (4-3) when Amed Rosario tripled with two outs and scored on Nimmo's single.
The Mets went up 3-1 in the eighth on Gonzalez's single off Sam Freeman and took a 4-1 lead in the ninth when Rosario doubled off Miguel Socolovich and scored on Nimmo's double.
New York led 1-0 in the fourth when Jay Bruce doubled and scored on Gonzalez's double.
Teheran gave up five hits, two runs and three walks in seven innings. They struck out three.
New York moved Vargas up in the rotation after Noah Syndergaard went on the disabled list with a strained ligament in their right index finger. Vargas had given up 34 hits, including six homers, with 10 walks in 20 1/3 innings in their first season with the Mets and was hit hard in a loss May 3 to the Braves in New York.
But they kept Atlanta off-balance, allowing a first-inning single to Freddie Freeman and a second-inning double to Charlie Culberson.
Tim Peterson, making their major league debut, retired the first four batters they faced before Johan Camargo hit their fourth homer in the seventh to cut the lead to 2-1.
PERFECT CONDITIONS
After the first three games had over four combined hours of delays caused by rain or the threat of a storm, Wednesday's games breezed through in 2 hours, 42 minutes. The temperature stayed in the high 70s on a clear night.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Mets: LHP Steven Matz is listed day to day, and the team hopes they won't miss a turn in the rotation with a mild strain in their middle left finger. Manager Mickey Callaway said Matz isn't expected to go on the disabled list.
Braves: RHP Mike Soroka, on the disabled list the past two weeks with a right shoulder strain, will make their first rehab appearance Friday at Class A Rome.
UP NEXT
Mets: RHP Seth Lugo (1-1, 2.48 ERA) will make their first start of the season as the Mets open a four-game home series against the Chicago Cubs. In 26 starts, he's 12-6 with a 4.09 ERA. He's 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA in one start and two relief appearances when facing the Cubs.
Braves: LHP Sean Newcomb (5-1, 2.75 ERA) is coming off no-decision last Saturday at Boston in which they lasted just three innings and gave up six hits and three runs. Before that, Newcomb had won four starts this month and allowed just one run and nine hits in 25 innings. Newcomb is 0-2 with a 9.72 ERA in two career starts against Washington.

In March, Walmart announced that it would begin delivering groceries to 100 new cities this year, up from the six it serviced at the time. Since then, it's announced partnerships with Postmates, and now, DoorDash, to make that promise a reality.
What does DoorDash have to gain? Data, according to our sister publication. The service's drivers are typically busy later at night, this would give them something to do during non-peak hours. The extra data would then help DoorDash become more efficient and open the door to delivering more than just food.
United States' Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has backtracked on their comments that it remains an "open question" if athletes from the country will compete at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games by insisting a full delegation will attend the event.
Haley caused concern when they raised doubts on the extent of American participation at the Games in Pyeongchang.
It comes as tension continues to rise between North Korea - located just 50 miles north of Pyeongchang - and the US.
In response to Haley's quotes, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) reiterated their stance that they would be sending a full team to Pyeongchang 2018.
The White House and State Department have both expressed unqualified support for sending the full Olympics team and delegation.
The ambassador appears to have performed a u-turn on their original stance, telling Fox News Sunday that the "full US Olympic team" would compete at the Games.
"We're doing in this Olympics what we've done in every single Olympics," Haley said.
"If you look back, we have always talked about security in the Olympics.
"We've always talked about keeping our athletes safe.
"We're at the location and we're starting to secure the process.
"But we always look out for the best interests of the United States' citizens.
"But, yes, there will be a delegation that goes and we will do everything we can to make sure they're safe."

Representatives from other nations due to participate in Pyeongchang, notably France and Germany, have also raised security fears.
Concern in South Korea is far lower than similar rhetoric has been common ever since the Korean War ended with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty in 1953.
The International Olympic Committee claim to be "closely monitoring" the situation but that it is currently safe for competition.
North Korea's Foreign Ministry claimed last week that the outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsular is an "established fact" and seemingly a matter of when rather than if.
The US flew a supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a week-long set of military exercises intended to send a strong warning to North Korea - which has in turn carried out intercontinental ballistic missile tests.
A set of joint military exercises between the US and South Korea are scheduled to take part during March next year, despite it coming within the "Olympic Truce" window which is supposed to exist for the entire period of the Olympics and Paralympics.
Haley has also told the UN Security Council that "continued acts of aggression" from North Korea could lead to war, and that "if war comes, make no mistake - the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed".
Equities Market Rallies on Portfolio Rebalancing
WEEKLY REPORT
The stock market closed the last week of 2016 on a positive note, rising by 1.47 per cent. Although the market opened for only three days, the bullish trend that has started in December was sustained last week as fund managers rebalanced their portfolios while oil and gas stocks also rallied. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (NSE) ASI closed 1.47 per cent higher at 26,874.62, while market capitalisation rose by the same margin to be at N9.247 trillion.

The NSE ASI rose by 0.76 per cent to close higher at 26, 688.25 , just as the market capitalization of equities appreciated by same margin to be at N9.11 trillion.
The market had remained bearish for most part of the year and was heading for a third consecutive yearly decline. However, the 0.76 per cent recorded on Wednesday reduced the year-to-date decline to 6.82 per cent.
The appreciation recorded in the share prices of Union Bank, Transcorp, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC and Nigerian Breweries were mainly responsible for the gain recorded in the NSE ASI yesterday.

In terms of sectoral performance, as all sector indices closed in the green except the NSE Industrial Goods Index which declined by 0.02 per cent owing to price drop by Lafarge Africa Plc.
However, the NSE Consumer Goods Index (+1.5 per cent) led sector gainers, driven by the significant appreciation in Nigerian Breweries Plc (+3.3 per cent), Cadbury Nigeria (+8.0 per cent) and Honeywell Flour Mills Plc (+4.9 per cent).
Nigerian Breweries Plc recently got commendation from the Chief Executive Officer of the NSE, Mr. Oscar Onyema its commitment to corporate governance standards. The NSE boss also congratulated the company on its 70th anniversary and for winning the Most Compliant Listed Company award for the year.

Similar to the performance of the broader index, sector performance was largely bullish with the NSE Oil & Gas Index (-0.5 per cent) recording the only decline as sell pressure in Forte Oil (-9.5 per cent) and Oando (-0.9 per cent) weighed on the index performance to offset gains in Seplat (+2.6 pe cent). However, the NSE Banking rose by 2.2 per cent on gains by GTBank(+5.8 per cent), Zenith (+1.4 per cent) and Union Bank (+3.7 per cent). Similarly, the NSE Insurance Index appreciated by 1.8 per cent following gains booked by AIICO Insurance, NEM Insurance and Law Union and Rock Insurance.
Also the NSE Consumer Goods Index rose 0.34 per cent on the back of positive sentiment towards Dangote Flour (+4.6 per cent) and PZ (+1.8 per cent).

Specifically, the NSE ASI closed the year at 26,874.62, while the market Capitalisation ended at N9.25trillion.

Business made easy: Immigration trains 160 officers on ICT
From Chris Anucha, Port Harcourt
Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), said it has trained 160 officers at Anambra State Command on Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
The training was in response to the Presidential Executive Order issued by the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on the ease of doing business in Nigeria.
According to the Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Service, Anambra State, King Ekpedeme, the two-day capacity building for the 160 officers was aimed at meeting the timeline given by Osinbajo.
Ekpedeme said there was also a directive from the Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammad Babandede, for officers to sharpen their ICT skills in order to efficiently and effectively deliver services within the time frame stipulated in the Presidential Order.
The Comptroller, said the training involved data collection, storage and analysis, adding that it would eliminate bureaucratic delays, which they recalled, had been detrimental to prompt action in Immigration operations and service line.
The Comptroller said: “This programme became necessary, after painstaking evaluation of the needs of the command, particularly our urgency to key into the Presidential Order, and consequent directive by the Comptroller General of Immigration that all officers must have the requisite competence to provide the kind of service that meets the growing demand of Nigerians.”
Declaring the capacity building programme open, the representative of the Anambra State government, a Permanent Secretary in the office of the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Dan Ezeanwu, told the participants that the state government would continue to encourage and support security agencies in their drive to improve on their competences. They said, “such support and collaboration with the state government are what have made Anambra a safe state.”
The Permanent Secretary called on the NIS to sustain the programme and commended the command for its close collaboration with the host state government.

The effort by the women to attract new attention to the allegations comes amid rapidly shifting attitudes in American society about the need to hold men accountable for their treatment of women, even for acts perpetrated long ago. Several high-profile television anchors have been fired from their jobs after being accused of inappropriate touching, exposing themselves or assaulting women in the workplace.
Allegations of sexual assault against Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, have roiled the special election in that state, where voting is to take place on Tuesday. Mr. Trump's decision to endorse Mr. Moore despite accusations that the Senate candidate once fondled a 14-year-old girl, has highlighted the president's own accusations.
On Monday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, added their name to a short list of Democratic lawmakers who have called on Mr. Trump to resign because of the sexual misconduct accusations lodged against him.
“President Trump has committed assault, according to these women,” Ms. Gillibrand said Monday afternoon on CNN. “And those are very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity, and they should be fully investigated and they should resign.” They echoed the comments of the women, saying that Congress should investigate.
Whether the president will hold themselves accountable “is something you really can't hold your breath for, so Congress should have hearings,” Ms. Gillibrand said.

This month, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, called on the president to step down because of a track record of “horrific conduct” with women. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said on Sunday that the president “has been accused by many women of assault” and urged them to consider resigning the way that Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, agreed to do after multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, told Vice News on Sunday that the accusations by the women against Mr. Trump were “far more damning.”
White House officials on Monday repeated the president's claim that the accusations of sexual misconduct were false and that the women were lying.

“The president has directly responded and said that these allegations are false and that's what I'm doing in relaying that information to you,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Asked whether Congress should investigate, Ms. Sanders noted that voters had already made a judgment about the allegations.
“This took place long before they were elected to be president,” Ms. Sanders said. “And the people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.”
The women accusing the president originally came forward, along with several others, in October 2016 after reports emerged of Mr. Trump talking crudely on an “Access Hollywood” recording. Mr. Trump admitted to making the comments on the tape, and apologized for them, but they vehemently denied the allegations of misconduct and harassment by the other women.
After Mr. Trump's victory on Election Day, interest waned in the allegations. Several of the women said on Monday that they were angry that their decision to tell their stories did not initially seem to be taken seriously.
“It was heartbreaking last year,” Ms. Holvey said on the NBC program. “We are private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there, to try to show America who this man is, and especially how they view women, for them to say, ‘Meh, we don't care,' it hurt.”
It remains to be seen whether the women will now be treated differently. Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and a prominent woman in Mr. Trump's cabinet, broke with White House talking points on Sunday when they said that the president's accusers “should be heard” and should feel free to come forward — even though the election was over.
“I know that they were elected,” Ms. Haley said on CBS's “Face the Nation.” “But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”
At the White House, Ms. Sanders responded to a question about Ms. Haley's comments by saying that the president agreed — in generic terms — that “it's a good thing that women are coming forward” to tell their stories about harassment.
But they said that “he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn't determine the course,” and they repeated Mr. Trump's belief that their victory in the election should be the end of the story.

“The American people knew this and voted for the president,” Ms. Sanders said. “And we feel like we're ready to move forward in that process.”
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — A prosecutor in Uruguay is asking for formal charges against a former vice president of the South American country.
Lawmakers accepted Raul Sendic's resignation last year amid corruption accusations involving their tenure as head of state oil company ANCAP. It was the first time a vice president had stepped down in Uruguay.
Prosecutor Luis Pacheco on Monday also requested charges against eight other senior officials at ANCAP and its subsidiaries. A judge must now decide if Sendic goes to trial.
The corruption allegations surfaced after a weekly publication reported that between 2010 and 2013, Sendic used corporate credit cards to make purchases at jewelry, electronics, furniture and other stores apparently unrelated to their official business.
He's also accused of abuse of office over some contracts.
Sendic has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
MADISON — Wisconsin is looking for a new assistant football coach.
In reaction to the NCAA voting to allow a 10th on-field assistant coach as of early January, the Badgers posted the opening on the university's job site Dec. 7. Applicants must have their resume in by Dec. 14, with an anticipated start date of Jan. 9, 2018.

It's unclear how the Badgers will use the extra spot. Coach Paul Chryst said Friday that other coaches he's spoken with have said they are using it to hire a special teams coach, but Wisconsin already has one with Chris Haering.
One possibility, and probably the most likely addition, would be the promotion of Jon Budmayr. The former Wisconsin quarterback served as a graduate assistant their first year with Chryst in Madison, and then spent the past two seasons as a quality control coach. During that time, he's almost been considered UW's quarterbacks coach, even helping with recruiting at different points.
Wisconsin could also look to split up the secondary duties. Defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard has overseen the entire unit the last two years, but former UW defensive back Antonio Fenelus, a quality control coach this season, has worked pretty heavily with the cornerbacks and could elevate to that full-time role.
“It goes back to, how do you get the best group of people. And then how do [you] divide and use everyone's strengths,” Chryst said.

There have been previous attempts at AI-guided fills, but they've typically been limited to rectangular sections, have focused on gaps near the middle of the picture and haven't scaled well to missing photo data of different sizes. NVIDIA's "partial convolution" approach, which guarantees that the output for missing pixels doesn't rely on the input values, can work with holes of any shape, size or location. That, in turn, produces uncannily realistic results in many cases -- even if the AI doesn't know exactly what's missing, the result usually looks like it fits. Previous methods tended to produce obvious glitches.
NVIDIA trained its system by generating tens of thousands of hole variations and making the AI learn how to reconstruct photos. It tested using a different set of holes to ensure the AI genuinely understood how to restore photos on its own.
The results aren't always flawless. You may see a facial feature clearly borrowed from someone else, and it's bound to struggle if the hole is so large that there isn't enough information to create a plausible reconstruction. But what's here could still be incredibly useful. You could repair seemingly hopeless images without hours of painstaking reconstruction. The scientists also envision the AI helping to upscale images without losing sharpness. In effect, you'd only ever have to worry about touching up minor details -- the days of recreating whole segments from scratch might soon be over.
MediaGuido is not sure why the Telegraph thought it would be a good idea to survey staff on their workplace happiness and then deliver the results in a town hall meeting. The anonymous questionnaire was sent to all staff – editorial and non-editorial – a few weeks back. The results were read out recently at a highly awkward all staff meeting. Just 40% said Telegraph Media Group “motivates me” – well below industry standards. There were bad numbers for the general management – only 47% said employee engagement was “favourable“. There were some positives for the Telegraph brand – 72% said they were proud to work at such a prestigious paper. Though there was little surprise when the organisation that carried out the survey informed the room that they were way below other media groups. The numbers for “promotion opportunities” were surprisingly dire given the number of jobs going, and a majority of staff are considering alternative employment. Though to be fair, that is often not their choice…
After Chelsea suffered defeat at the hands of Manchester United at Old Trafford, manager Antonio Conte admitted that they now had 50-50 chance of winning the Premier League title.
Conte said that Chelsea's players were not focused during the match while United put up its best game this season.
“They [United] showed more desire, more ambition, more motivation,” they said. “It is very simple and in this case the fault is with the coach. It means the coach was not able to transfer the right concentration, desire, ambition to win this game.”
Musing about the defeat, Conte further said, “Against Crystal Palace [a 2-1 defeat] we didn't deserve to lose. Today we deserved to lose the game.”
“It won't be easy because I think Tottenham are now the best team. They are in good form and they have a lot of enthusiasm. They are feeling the possibility to write history and it is important for us to know this,” Conte said in the press conference after the match.
However, upcoming games for Chelsea are relatively easier compared with Tottenham.
PARDUBICE, Czech Republic — As dusk settled over the rambling Czech countryside, a group of haggard workers emerged from a dank three-story cement dormitory and jammed into buses. The evening shift was about to begin at two nearby factories owned by Foxconn and Panasonic.
Most of the workers had been recruited from Romania, Bulgaria and other central European countries by a large employment agency. When their contracts are up, they will be sent home, with another group of migrant workers brought in as required — replaceable cogs in a tireless machine.
Across Europe, nearly 55,000 agencies recruit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers each year for cheap manual labor and service jobs. The agencies allow employers to tap into a more flexible work force — and avoid some of the region's more onerous labor costs.
Those agencies recruiting manual labor scour the Continent for people willing to pick vegetables in Britain, pour concrete in France or work assembly lines in Eastern Europe. The monthly salaries can average out to as little as 3.50 euros, or about $4.10, an hour — less than the minimum wage in some of the countries where their employees are sent to work. Some agencies control entire labor supply chains, transporting recruits across borders, lodging them, bussing them to and from job sites, and then moving them elsewhere when they're no longer needed.

The practices are legal under rules that allow European citizens to work anywhere in the 28-nation bloc. But as employers outsource more workers and deepen their reliance on shorter-term contracts to cut costs, European regulators are increasing their scrutiny. About a third of Europeans are now in some form of atypical employment, ranging from Uber drivers to pilots, and there are concerns that basic labor protections, including social security benefits and sick leave, are being eroded.

For companies, the challenges of hiring low-cost workers are growing: An economic recovery is shrinking the pool of cheap labor that initially attracted Foxconn and others to Europe. Employment agencies like Xawax, which finds workers for the Foxconn and Panasonic factories, are an important conduit.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on a management shake-up at The Los Angeles Times (all times local):
5:30 p.m.
The Los Angeles Times' parent company says Jim Kirk has been officially named the newspaper's editor-in-chief.
In a move that was expected, Tronc, Inc. announced Kirk's hiring late Monday.
The previous top editor, Lewis D'Vorkin, has been named chief content officer for Chicago-based Tronc, Inc..
Kirk is a former editor and publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times.
They were briefly interim editor-in-chief at the LA Times before D'Vorkin got the job in August.
The moves come at a time of tension and upheaval at the Times, where publisher Ross Levinsohn is on leave and under investigation for workplace misconduct on previous jobs.
The newsroom recently voted to unionize.
___
10 p.m.
A spokesperson for Los Angeles Times' parent company says it plans to announce Monday that Jim Kirk will be named the newspaper's editor-in-chief.
Tronc, Inc. spokesperson Marisa Kollias said Sunday The Times' current top editor, Lewis D'Vorkin, is expected to be named chief content officer.
The newspaper reported that Kirk was previously publisher and editor of the Chicago Sun-Times and joined Tronc in August.
They were named interim editor of the Times on Aug. 21 after a shake-up but stepped aside after D'Vorkin joined The Times in early November.
The Times said its newsroom has become alarmed by recent hirings of several news executives who report to business executives — not to editors in the newsroom.
Flashy ads, catchy gimmicks, and all manner of marketing mumbo jumbo may work in other industries, but in the suspension game, performance is priority. If it doesn't work, it doesn't sell. And, how do you make it work? You test it—rigorously and repeatedly.
Garrett Harmola, of Aldan American, did just that by entering their garage-built '71 C10 Cheyenne Super into the 2017 Classic Industries Super Chevy Muscle Car Challenge presented by Falken Tires. Built by them and their brother Spencer, the truck is a fresh build and a future testbed for Aldan's new suspension products.
“We've been on and off with the build for a year and a half,” said Harmola. “The Muscle Car Challenge was our maiden voyage and we really had only taken [the truck] around the block before then.” A helluva—and true hot rodder-esque—way to break in a fresh build. And, while a few teething problems hampered their event performance, the outcome was a budget-built truck that danced around a racetrack and slalom like no '70's GM truck engineer could ever have imagined.
“We did the whole event with no clutch,” said Harmola. “We lost a slave cylinder and it bled fluid onto the clutch, soaking it. It was so hot that day we thought it'd have to dry out!” they laughed. Despite the soggy friction disc, the team persevered. “The suspension worked great, the engine ran great, and all and all it was a great day.”
The Budget Recipe
By far, the C10 was the most grassroots entry in the competition—which we love. Even more admirable than that, the Harmola brothers built it themselves in Spencer's personal garage. “It's a real garage build that we plan to use to test parts and go to shows in,” said Harmola.
With a donor engine and transmission out of a late-model F-body, affordable suspension, and some clever home fab', the truck was truly a blue-collar crusader.
Harmola first crossed paths with the Cheyenne Super while scouring eBay one night. “The body needed some work, but everything was there and it was a real Cheyenne Super pickup,” said Harmola. “We were outbid on the truck, but the buyer flaked. We contacted the seller in Northern California and picked the truck up for a screaming deal of less than $5,000.”
“The engine and transmission are an LS1 and T-56 sourced from a 1997 and 2002 Camaro,” said Harmola; and even they have a story to tell. “The rebuilt engine had only 40 miles on it, and the donor Camaro was totaled in a high-speed chase,” they said. The Camaro owner, now headed to jail—due to the recent bout of reckless driving—was ready to part ways with the engine and the Harmolas ended up getting another smokin' deal on a freshly-built LS1 with 10:1-compression Wiseco forged pistons.
Other than basic bolt-on parts, such as a mild Edelbrock cam, headers, and a throttle body, the drivetrain is stock. This is the same sort of scrounger's song and dance being performed by gearheads across the country.
Under the skin, the truck is a far cry from the workhorse suspension it rolled off the assembly line with. Up front is a bolt-in Scott's Hot Rods independent front suspension that uses upper and lower tubular control arms and replaces the antiquated steering box with a modern rack-and-pinion setup. Two-inch drop spindles lower the truck's center of gravity while Wilwood calipers on 14-inch rotors provide the necessary stopping power. Keeping the Falken rubber planted to the pavement are a pair of Aldan American Striker series double-adjustable coilovers.
Beneath the bed is a trailing arm setup from Performance Online and a bit of custom fabrication courtesy of Spencer Harmola. They fab'd up mounts for Aldan Regulator series coilovers and also C-notched the frame to allow the truck to sit lower to the pavement. “Mounting the shocks outside the frame gives us a little more travel and better traction,” said Harmola. “We had our friends at Cortez Tire in Los Angeles send us a mock wheel and tire based on the specs we were looking to run for our rear tires and wheels. This allowed us to get the spacing and clearances right before we welded up everything.”
Once all the suspension bits were finish-welded in place, a friend who specializes in off-road racing stepped in to assemble the 12-bolt differential, freshening it up and adding 4.11 gears for a bit more green-light punch and a matching set of Wilwood disc brakes for the red-light equivalent. The last step was adding a set of Intro wheels measuring 18×10 front and 18×12 rear.
While the C10 was set to debut at SEMA 2016, an unexpected layover in paint purgatory held that process up. Perfection takes patience, and the Harmolas were rewarded with a pristine truck, coated in Porsche Modegrau gray. “The color looks desert tan, green drab, and grey depending on the lighting,” said Harmola. “For a purpose-built track truck and daily driver, the paintjob is perfect.” The Muscle Car Challenge became the truck's first on-screen performance, but that was shortly followed up by an official debut at SEMA 2017 in Las Vegas.
As a testbed for new Aldan American suspension pieces, the truck will never really be done. But, according to Harmola, the next few upgrades will consist of a new McLeod clutch setup and some new EFI widgets from FiTech to further modernize the pickup. In true Project X fashion it'll continue on, ever-changing and always getting faster.

PATCHOGUE, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — The countdown is on! With Chanukah starting on Tuesday and Christmas just two weeks away, some Long Island merchants are launching promotions to lure you in and keep you close.
With Santa on mainstreet joined by twelve-foot toy soldiers, retailers are getting creative bringing buyers back to downtown.
“This was a booming, thriving retail destination for decades,” Bay Shore merchant Drew Allt told CBS2's Jennifer McLogan. “Then the mall came.”
It's led to many tough holiday seasons, but Allt is now celebrating ten years of business in Bay Shore. They say they found the Radio City Music Hall statues at a flea market and decided to put them up at the corner of Ocean and Main. They've become a big draw unto themselves.
14 miles east, Patchogue is also experiencing a renaissance.
“You support your neighbor, that's the essence of family, that's the essence of the holiday spirit,” business owner James Skidmore said.
With 700 new apartments and dining and theater scenes taking off, it's easy to forget about the transformation in retail. Local merchants are stimulating shoppers with ease of parking, later hours, prizes, and even raffles.
They've even formed the first “retailers committee.”
“We shine a light on some of the unique retail opportunities in the village here now,” committee member John Murray said.
Their message is a simple one; holiday shopping in your own backyard.
“A vibrant main street has a direct relationship of what your property value is,” David Kennedy from the Greater Patchogue Chamber of Commerce said.
Some merchants are even volunteering as financial advisors, suggesting to shoppers to set a budget, limit your visit, stick to cash, relax, and smile.

In November, Kill Bill star Uma Thurman was asked about the then-mounting allegations of sexual misconduct against the film's producer, Harvey Weinstein. “I don't have a tidy soundbite for you,” they told reporters. “I've been waiting to feel less angry. And when I'm ready, I'll say what I have to say.” They then posted a photo of their Bride character on Instagram with a chilling message. “Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!” they wrote. “Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators — I'm glad it's going slowly — you don't deserve a bullet.” On Saturday, Thurman's non-bullet arrived in the New York Times.
Before the pair teamed up with fellow Pulp Fiction collaborator Quentin Tarantino for Kill Bill, Thurman recalled they were arguing in Weinstein's hotel suite over a script “when the bathrobe came out”:
The first “attack,” they say, came not long after in Weinstein's suite at the Savoy Hotel in London. “It was such a bat to the head. They pushed me down. They tried to shove themselves on me. They tried to expose himself. They did all kinds of unpleasant things. But they didn't actually put their back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not their track.”
The next day, “a 26-inch-wide vulgar bunch of roses” arrived at the house of Thurman's friend Ilona Herman, where they were staying. “They were yellow. And I opened the note like it was a soiled diaper and it just said, ‘You have great instincts.'” Not long after, Weinstein's assistants began calling them repeated “to talk about projects,” almost as if the assault had never happened. Thurman agreed to meet, but only if Herman was allowed to accompany her, and if the meeting took place in public at the hotel's bar. After more back-and-forth, however, they agreed to meet Weinstein in their hotel room.
Weinstein's spokesperson told the Times that, while the disgraced producer “denied ever threatening their prospects,” they “acknowledged their account of the episodes” while claiming they had “a flirtatious and fun working relationship” before then. “Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading their signals in Paris. They immediately apologized.” Even so, a top Hollywood executive familiar with Thurman and their account of what happened with Weinstein told the Times, “She didn't give them the time of day” after that.

2016: The Canadian labour movement in review
RankandFile.ca, December 30
It's been a year of bruising battles and bully governments for Canadian workers. But despite all this, there have always been glimpses of what's possible when workers organize and fight. During the October 2015 federal election, millions of Canadians jumped at the chance to get rid of Harper, betting on the Liberals when the NDP showed up with a lacklustre set of policies and Mulcair's conservatism. The election of the Liberals proved disorienting for sections of organized labour. Some labour leaders tried to cozy up to the Liberals when they reversed some of the worst Tory legislation, such as Bill C-377 and C-525. The Liberals also didn't interfere too negatively in Canada Post negotiations with back-to-work legislation as previous Tory and Liberal governments have, but they didn't turf the Harper-appointed executives hell-bent on a confrontation with postal workers.

Sociologist Susan Walzer published a research article in 1996, called “Thinking About the Baby,” pointing to this household gender gap. Scholars had already documented that women, even those who worked full time, were doing the majority of what came to be called the “second shift”: the work that greets us when we come home from work. Walzer was interested in the invisible part of this work, the kind that occupied people's minds. They interviewed 23 husband-wife couples, finding them through the rather quaint method of reading birth announcements in a local newspaper. All had brought a baby home in the last year.
FISH-NL to reveal strategy for certification bid on Friday
CBC, December 29
The leaders of an upstart union movement in Newfoundland and Labrador will reveal their strategy for a certification bid Friday, months after launching a bitter and divisive campaign to try and raid the province's influential fisheries union. Representatives from the Federation of Independent Sea Harvesters (FISH-NL) will visit the Labour Relations Board in St. John's in the morning, and plans to speak with reporters at their office on Job Street at 11 a.m.
Today marks 80th anniversary of start of Flint Sit-Down Strike
MLive, December 30
Today marks the beginning of the 80th anniversary of the Flint Sit-Down Strike. The strike began Dec. 30, 1936, when about 50 men sat down on the line inside General Motors' Fisher Body Plant 2, protesting the transfer of three inspectors who refused to quit the union. It ended 44 days later on Feb. 11, 1937, when both sides reached an agreement that allowed the United Auto Workers union to act as the bargaining representative for hourly workers. This is the first year there are no known strikers to talk about it. The last known surviving Sit-Down striker, Richard Wiecorek, died earlier this year at the age of 99.
SEIU-West says premier should discuss cutting Sask. government jobs with union
CBC, December 29
The president of a union representing more than 13,000 government employees in Saskatchewan is disappointed the premier is talking about possibly cutting government jobs without reaching out to it first. “My premier is musing about these sorts of things in a year-end interview instead of actually having these conversations with the unions and the members that he's talking about,” said Barbara Cape, president of the Service Employees International Union's western Canada branch.
Union prepares for legal battle ahead of pension cuts
Montreal Gazette, December 28
A union leader representing 17,000 retired municipal workers said Wednesday he's prepared to take the city of Montreal to court over pension cuts set to begin on Jan. 1. As of next year, thousands of retirees will no longer see an annual one per cent cost-of-living increase in their pensions. Though the employees and city had previously signed a deal that guaranteed the increases, a controversial provincial law allows cities to back out of that obligation.
Minimum wage hikes not effective in reducing poverty: Manitoba premier
CBC, December 29
There is no guarantee Manitoba's frozen minimum wage will thaw in 2017, as the premier and labour leaders disagree over whether a higher minimum pay rate helps the poor. In a year-end interview with The Canadian Press, Premier Brian Pallister said they don't believe a higher minimum wage is the best way to reduce poverty.
Former union official wants ‘scabs' investigated
The Nugget, December 27
As past CUPE Local 2049 president and protection worker, I call it a screw the union plan. What does “helper from another areas” really mean? Well it really means scabs. In many cases, they are union employees from another agency. But they could also be supervisors and /or other managerial staff. Lets look at union employees (scabs) who are willing to work under the conditions now being rejected by the striking employees. Is this not despicable and a slap in the face to those who now are walking the picket line?
Unions suspend Phoenix court challenge in exchange for inside information on payroll fiasco
Ottawa Citizen, December 27
Unions suspended their court battle to force the federal government to pay public servants properly in exchange for being kept in the loop about what's wrong with the malfunctioning Phoenix payroll system and how to fix it. The 14 unions and government mutually agreed to a consent order, approved by the Federal Court, in which the government promises to share more information and expert opinion on problems plaguing the payroll system.
Premier Brad Wall hints at wage rollbacks as province faces ballooning deficit
CTV, December 28
Public sector workers in Saskatchewan will be asked to help tackle the province's $1 billion deficit in the coming year, potentially through wage rollbacks or layoffs. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said wages make up 60 per cent of government spending and everything has to be on the table when it comes to filling the huge hole in the budget.
These 7 Fraser Institute reports published in 2016 are completely nuts and also 100% real
Press Progress, December 27
Thought 2016 was a rough year? Thankfully the Fraser Institute, Canada's intrepid right-wing think tank, was able to get to the bottom of many important questions that are top-of-mind for ordinary Canadians, like: Is university a form of child care? Should the government privatize Canada Day? Are dancing chimney sweeps transmitting secret communist messages through your family's DVD player?
Ministry of Labour cracks down on law-breaking bosses
Toronto Star, December 27
The number of law-breaking Ontario bosses facing prosecution has risen by more than 40 per cent over the past year, statistics requested by the Star show, with more fines than in any other year on record for employers who failed to pay workers. The provincial Ministry of Labour convicted 122 employers in 2016 for failing to meet employment standards, including refusing to comply with government orders to pay their workers. Such convictions come with hefty financial penalties in the thousands of dollars — and possible imprisonment.
Beyond Bread and Butter
Jacobin, December 27
When we think of strikes, we usually think of disputes over wages and benefits. Strikes make the case that it's easier for bosses to pay workers more than to run a company without them. But unions often fight for more than money. Workers can walk off the job to demand new rights at work, fighting for control over their working conditions.

Phenomenal fishing was one of the reasons Port Colborne was chosen to be part of the Berkley B1 Championship Tour, said tournament president Ben Woo.
“There's a bass factory right off of the city,” said Woo, just days ahead of the fishing tournament on Lake Erie.
Woo said it's the first year for the tournament, which started in 2009 in Quebec, in Ontario. They said a poll was taken of anglers that participate in the event asking where they wanted to fish.
“They said the Bay of Quinte and Port Colborne … it was a popular choice”
Logistics, they said, factored into the decision to host the event in the city at H.H. Knoll Lakeview Park as well.
“We're able to put on a large show … there's the park, the stage and the marina and a lot of space for the 160 anglers. It made sense. We came to the city and they were onboard,” said Woo, a guide angler and TV and radio show host.
Anglers will battle it out for $75,000 in cash and prizes including a Ranger bass boat package courtesy of Maple City Marine.
The tournament was starting to set up on Monday, in preparation for the two-day event, August 18-19, which will be livestreamed with multiple cameras on Facebook at www.facebook.com/berkleyb1open/.
While tournament organizers were starting to set up, Woo said anglers in the tournament were on Lake Erie practicing.
“They were out looking for where the bass are, where they were going to go, how they were going to plan their day and manage their time.”
Anglers were allowed to fish in both Canadian and American waters during practice and those waters are also open during the tournament. Ninety-five per cent of the anglers taking part in the tournament are Canadian, from Quebec and Ontario. There are a number of anglers from the Niagara Region as well.
“It's a live release event … we have a live release boat,” they said.
Woo said anglers are allowed five bass a day, smallmouth or largemouth, and after the first day, the field will be cut in half. They said Lake Erie is known for its giant smallmouth bass and expects that's what those coming to watch the weigh-in will see.
“The Bay of Quinte saw largemouth bass,” they said.
Boats leave in waves during the event, with the first group of 25 leaving at 7 a.m., followed by a wave of 25 every 10 minutes. The first wave returns for weigh-in at 3 p.m.

Olubadan, chiefs back Ajimobi on Olubadan chieftaincy law review
The move by Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi to review the 1957 Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration got a boost yesterday.
The Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Adetunji and members of the Olubadan-in-Council endorsed the move.
The governor, on May 19, inaugurated a seven-man judicial commission of ienquiry, headed by a retired High Court judge, Justice Akintunde Boade, to review the chieftaincy declaration and other related chieftaincies in Ibadan land.
The royal father, who spoke at the end of a meeting with the governor at the Governor's Office, said they and their chiefs supported the review.
The monarch noted that it would bring development to the ancient city.
Olubadan said: “Our visit (to the governor) today (yesterday), as you can see, is to put paid to the rumours and misgivings about the review of the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration.
“We have come to show our sincere support to the governor and to let them know that we are on the same page with them as the review is for the progress of Ibadan and its people.”
Also, the Otun Olubadan, Chief Lekan Balogun, who was among the two high chiefs who sued the governor over the matter, attributed their action to what they called communication gap.
Balogun said: “Change is the only constant thing in life. There is nothing that is above change. All the furore, which resulted from government's move, was due to communication gap but that has been resolved now.
“Life is dialectical; things must be changing and we must all be growing with it. The government is quite right to have set up machinery to look into the law and see how it can be made better.
“We believe it is a welcome development, especially with the kind of governor we have who is keenly interested in the growth and development of Ibadan land.”
The high chief said the benefits inherent in the review were many, adding that the Olubadan would henceforth enjoy the company of beaded crown chiefs whenever they have any outing.
This, they said, would raise the status of Ibadan as one of the most important cities in Yoruba land.
Balogun added: “The benefits to be derived from the review are enormous. Even if we don't want to pre-empt the future, we will wait till things are resolved fundamentally. But we know that Olubadan will no longer be moving alone any longer.
“Of course, there will be high chiefs with the nomenclature of obas. But the Olubadan won't be on their own anymore. When royal majesties (in other cities) go out, they are always in company with beaded crown obas.”

They expressed remorse about the altercation."I've got nothing to say about it really," said Wilder. "I really don't want to talk about. They were a little embarrassed by it, but now she's kind of embraced it that everyone has seen it."Wilder said Farber was at work Thursday afternoon. They said the two are back together and haven't had any alcohol since the incident.Bayou City Wings said they suspended three employees are a result of the video being posted online.
Chesapeake Energy Corp. has announced plans to increase its drilling budget and rig count in 2017, saying that confidence is growing in the hard-hit energy market.
The Oklahoma City-based company said Tuesday that it would increase its capital expenditures to $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion this year. That's compared to 2016 numbers of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion.
Chesapeake CEO Doug Lawler said in a statement that the move will "position Chesapeake for significant production and earnings growth" in 2018. Chesapeake says it plans to operate an average of 17 rigs in 2017, compared to an average of 10 rigs in 2016.
The company will release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 23. In November, Chesapeake reported a loss of $1.16 billion, or $1.54 per share, in its third-quarter results.
This week's Big Question:?What are your earliest memories of Jaromir Jagr?
Eric Lindros, C, retired:?"I'm thinking back to world juniors when I was 16, it was 1989, our Canadian team went to watch the Czechs play one day, everyone had eyes on Jagr. As soon as they got on the ice, nobody is watching anything else. Our world junior team was glued to watching them on every shift. Just everything about him, it's like they did everything without leaving a footprint. I just remember that, our whole team just mesmerized by him."
David Pastrnak, RW, Boston Bruins:?"It was a couple of days after they were traded to Florida, so [ David] Krejci?asked me if I wanted to meet Jagr. They were staying at the same hotel, so we met up in the yard by the pool, [he's] just chilling there, and that's when I met them for the first time. Obviously, he's a legend for us [Czechs]. I didn't say much. I was just listening to him. He's a funny guy. It's unbelievable [he's still playing]. It's their life, and they love hockey. You can't do well in hockey if you don't love it, and they love it a lot, and that's a big thing that sticks out for me."
Jeff O'Neill, C, retired/analyst:?"My first Jagr memory was that playoff goal they scored against Chicago when they deked everybody out. That's when you're like, 'Wow, this guy is a special talent.' Then when I went to Hartford as a rookie, Paul Maurice took over as coach after 7-8 games, and they put me with? Brendan Shanahan and Nelson Emerson, and whenever we played Pittsburgh, we got the Lemieux-Jagr matchup -- and it was hell. I knew that Shanny and Emerson hated me because we never touched the puck the whole game. They were playing shinny hockey with us. ... But you know, it still boggles my mind that I've been retired 10 years, and Jagr is still playing."
Roman Polak, D, Toronto Maple Leafs:?"I just remember in early years they were taller than everybody else. They were big. They had that big ass out there and protected the puck, they were strong, they could skate, just a great player overall. Long stick, long reach, long hair. ... They were big in Czech. Everybody still talks about Jagr in Czech. He's still big. If they tried to be president of the country, they would be. Everybody just loves him. At age 40, they found out there's a Facebook out there, and he's done a pretty good job on the Facebook, too [laughs]."
Ray Ferraro, C, retired/analyst: "My first recollection is of them at the [1990] draft with this really long hair and that awkward Penguins hat on. Playing against them was instantly impossible -- they were too big and had too big a reach, plus an amazing skill set. I always felt they were such a great passer that is overshadowed by their scoring ability, and then all of a sudden they were among the best scorers every year."
Alex Pietrangelo, D, St. Louis Blues: "When they were in Pittsburgh, that was a bit before me, but Washington and the Rangers, that's when I remember them playing. It blows my mind. I'm 27. What is he, 44 [now 45]? I don't think I'll be able to walk when I'm 44. The way that guy still goes, it's unbelievable. It really is impressive the way they can continue to play. The best part about it is that he's playing at a level still that not many people can play at. They continue to impress. ... That's just great for the game."
Bill Guerin, RW, assistant GM, Pittsburgh Penguins: "I first met Jagr at the World Junior Championships in Finland. It was their draft year coming up, I think. Social media wasn't around, the internet wasn't around, so you couldn't brush up on guys. And just seeing this kid on the Czech team. Bobby Holik had been taken 10th overall, so they were the big guy on the team, and then you saw this Jagr kid, and you were, 'Who the hell is that?' And then you see them getting drafted pretty high, and then just from there you go, 'Oh, that's the kid from the World Juniors', and then they just kept going. I think it's amazing what he's doing. I love it. One of the reasons I love what he's doing is they just loves the game. They don't need the money. They don't need the points. They just loves the game."
Brendan Shanahan, LW, Toronto Maple Leafs president:?"I just think it's interesting how they came back with such an appreciation for the NHL and the game. I think going away for a couple of years resparked the love for the game and an appreciation for the NHL. They just seems to be having so much more fun with it than they were before they left. ... When you play a long time in the NHL, there's a point in your career where you're like, 'I've seen this all before.' They stepped away from the NHL, but what makes them so unique is that they were so talented, they were able to come back. Not that they were retired overseas, but I think it was good for their body, good for their mind, and he's just like a kid again."
Tuukka Rask, G, Boston Bruins:?"I played against them in the Czech Republic during the lockout. It's amazing that they still find it fun to play the game, because it's a grinding game, and the season is long, you travel a lot, so to do that for over 25 years is very respectable. They still seem to be having fun, so who knows how long he'll keep playing."
Matt Cullen, C, Pittsburgh Penguins:?"I remember playing with them with the Rangers, and the thing that stood out to me the most was how hard they worked on their game. I didn't know a whole lot about them other than that they were a pretty unique talent and just an unbelievable combination of size and skill. I was always just really impressed with the way that they were at the rink before I ever got there -- and I'm usually one of the first guys -- and they were always there and often doing something, whether it was in the pool working on their hands or out on the ice. I was just really impressed with their commitment to their game and improving their game. You don't see that sort of dedication in a guy, especially as it gets later in their career, and a guy who's been at the top for so long, so it was pretty impressive to see that. So that was something that always struck me and something that always impressed. They would be in the pool up to here [points to chest] and they would just have their stick with maybe weights on it and they would stickhandle underwater, just to have some resistance. I didn't ask a whole ton of questions because some of it was just, 'Holy cow.' They were committed. They were a hard worker."
Trevor Daley, D, Pittsburgh Penguins:?"The mullet. The hair, of course. The hair, their number, the swagger they had about him. Just as a young kid growing up watching the? Pittsburgh Penguins, every time you got to see Jaromir Jagr, they were just different than anyone else. Obviously, I had the chance to be around them and spend some time with them [while with the? Dallas Stars]. He's so dedicated to their craft and what they do. You pick that up right away about him. You look at their age and what he's doing today, it's all because of how much they enjoy the game, how much they love the game and then the work that they put into the game is why he's still playing. In Dallas, they lived right next to the practice rink, and after games they would go back to the practice rink, open it up and make the Zamboni driver pass them pucks. Nothing really surprises me with that guy. He's just a guy that really loves the game, and it doesn't surprise me he's still playing."
Michael Frolik, RW,? Calgary Flames:?"He's from the same hometown [as] me, so I kind of meet them in the summer sometimes. But the first time, I was pretty young. I think when I was 6 years old, they came to skate with us and be on the ice with us. I remember it was pretty cool. We're not buddies or anything like that. I think they don't have many friends in hockey, I think they kind of separates from hockey a little bit [with his] friends. I have the big respect for him, and it's cool to have a chance to play with them on the national team and at Olympics, so it was pretty cool to see what they do off the ice and in the room."
Jay Bouwmeester, D, St. Louis Blues:?"He was old when I came into the league and he's still going. He'll probably be still playing when I'm done, too. But they were a guy that was a lot bigger than you ever thought they are. Just big and wide body, stick their butt out in your face and when you're a 19-year-old defenseman like I was, there's not a whole lot you can do about that. And he's still doing it. Their talent level, and what he's doing even now ... that's crazy. He's got some good genes, for sure, for their body to hang in there."
David Backes, C, Boston Bruins:?"I don't know if I've had many face-to-face conversations with him, but [my first memory is] NHL '94 on Super Nintendo as a 10-year-old. I did pretty darn good. The Penguins were dynamite in that game, and if you went across the crease as Jagr on your backhand, you scored every time. He's still doing that."

Independence dilemma for Greenland voters
Greenland votes Tuesday in a local parliament election, with full independence a key issue for the self-ruled Danish territory threatened by global warming and struggling with youth suicides and sex abuse among its indigenous people.
Rich in unexploited natural resources, Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979 and was granted self-rule in 2009, though Copenhagen retains control of foreign and defence affairs.
The vast island between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, mostly covered in ice and home to just 55,000 people, also receives some 3.6 billion kroner (483 million euros, $591 million) in subsidies each year from its former colonial master.
While Denmark's constitution recognises the island's right to decide on its own independence, if it became a sovereign nation it would lose the much-needed subsidies, which make up 60 percent of Greenland's annual budget.
So the main issue for pro-independence campaigners is when to secede, and how to do so without impoverishing the island.
With a gross domestic product of $2.2 billion in 2015, an independent Greenland would be the poorest country in Europe along with San Marino.
Of the seven political parties, six are in favour of independence. Some are keen to declare independence by 2021 to coincide with the 300th anniversary of Denmark's occupation, though most have not set a timeline.
Opinion polls suggest the left-green Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party will win Tuesday's election, where 31 seats are up for grabs.
A poll published on April 20 credited IA with 31 percent of voter support, ahead of its main rival, the social democratic Siumut party which has dominated Greenland politics since 1979 and is currently in power.
Seen garnering 27.4 percent of votes, Siumut could find itself relegated to the opposition — though one in four voters is still undecided.
The two parties are at odds over the use of the island's lucrative natural resources and the thorny issue of uranium mining, which IA, with strong support among urban youths, opposes.
Meanwhile, polls show the newly-formed Cooperation Party, the only anti-independence party, with around 2.9 percent of votes.
Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a lawmaker for IA, told AFP that before setting a timeline for independence, the island should first lay the financial groundwork.
“Foreign investments are going to be crucial when you talk about the development of Greenlandic society,” they said.
Them party wants to see a diversification of investments, as rising temperatures in the Arctic melt Greenland's ice sheet, exposing mineral riches — and drawing eager glances from the West, Russia and China.
– Economic assets –
While not sustainable, “economic development the last (few) years has been rather good; the fishing industry has been doing quite well … Employment has been increasing and unemployment is low,” said Torben Andersen, Aarhus University economics professor and chairperson of the Greenland Economic Council.
The fishing industry, which accounts for 90 percent of Greenland's exports, is temporarily benefiting from climate change as the rising temperatures bring new species to fish, though that is likely to change over time.
And while Greenland may have a wealth of untapped natural resources, primarily minerals, that could help finance its independence, “it suffers from a lack of infrastructure and a qualified labour shortage,” stressed Mikaa Mered, an Arctic expert and economics and geopolitics professor at France's School of International Relations.
That's also a major hurdle for the territory's desire to emulate the thriving tourism industry of its Arctic neighbour Iceland.
– Social woes –
Voter turnout is typically high in Greenland, around 70 percent.
Heidi Moller Isaksen, a 51-year-old secretary who lives in the capital Nuuk, declined to disclose which party they would vote for.
But breaking free from Denmark is a long-term goal.
“I do want independence one day but we've got to be realistic and take one step at a time,” they told AFP.
“We can never have independence as long as we have so many social problems.”
The Inuit like other indigenous populations are torn between tradition and modernisation. The tension has led to Greenland having one of the world's highest suicide rates, and a third of children are victims of sexual abuse.
In addition, global warming has escalated the exodus from isolated villages to the few towns and cities, said Mered.
It is “wreaking havoc on Greenland's culture: young people are losing interest in traditional hunting and fishing, it's difficult to travel by dogsled from one village to another, and wild animals are moving further and further away from the regular hunting grounds,” they said.
All of this leads to “numerous new problems, such as youth suicides.”

Saying that they were “saving the unborn,” Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi signed into law on Monday a measure that would ban almost all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion rights supporters called it the earliest abortion ban in the country, and said it was an unconstitutional restriction that defied years of federal court precedent over the limits states may impose on abortion providers.
The only abortion clinic in the state quickly filed a complaint in federal court to block the law.
The bill, labeled the Gestational Age Act, was passed overwhelmingly by both chambers of the Republican-controlled State Legislature this month.
The governor was in a jovial mood as they signed the bill into law. “We are saving more of the unborn than any state in America, and what better thing we could do,” said Mr. Bryant, a Republican serving their second term.
They said they expected a swift legal challenge, and indeed, the abortion clinic, the Jackson Women's Health Organization, filed a complaint in United States District Court for Mississippi's Southern District less than an hour after they signed the bill into law. The organization sought a preliminary injunction preventing officials from enforcing the act. Later Monday, the organization filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, said Robert B. McDuff, one of the lawyers for the clinic.

Police in Belgium arrest driver who tried to ram haredi man and child who were walking to synagogue in Antwerp.
Police in Belgium have arrested a man who is suspected of trying to ram with their car an Orthodox man and a child on a street in Antwerp, JTA reported Saturday.
The incident occurred on Saturday morning while the man and the child were walking to synagogue and was filmed by security cameras.
The footage shows a black Seat Ibiza car swerving sharply while speeding on Isabellalei, a central street in Antwerp, toward the alleged victim and a boy, who is the man's son, according to the Antwerp-based Joods Actueel Jewish monthly.
The car is seen intersecting a bike path, apparently while speeding. The car then climbs the curb as the two alleged victims are walking toward it, prompting them to jump away from the curb and toward the safety of the building facades.
They jump behind a lamp post. The car swerves back wildly, returning to the road from its incursion into the sidewalk. The father ran after the car as it sped away.
Joods Actueel reported that witnesses said the driver had foreign origins. While their report did not name the man or offer any additional information on their identity, Israel's public broadcaster Kan News reported that the driver was of Muslim origin.
The suspect was tracked down through the footage of the license plate.  They are to be arraigned Sunday on suspicion of attempted manslaughter.
In September, a Jewish man in Antwerp was physically assaulted as they made their way home from synagogue on a Friday night. The victim was accosted by a local youth, who hurled anti-Semitic epithets at him.
The assailant, who apparently is a recent convert to Islam, then physically assaulted the haredi man, punching them in the face and leaving them injured.
About 12,000 of Belgium's 40,000 Jews live in Antwerp, which also is the location of two thirds of the country's synagogues and a significant hasidic community.

In a White House event on Monday, President Donald Trump explicitly condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis after facing increasing pressure to rebuke the hate groups responsible for the outbreak of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.
Earlier in the day, Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of the country's third largest pharmaceutical company, Merck, resigned from Trump's American Manufacturing Council. Frazier opposed the president's original statement from Saturday that blamed “many sides” for the violence that left three people dead, including one counter-protester who was run over when a car driven by a white nationalist plowed into a crowd.
“As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” Frazier said in a tweet.
Trump immediately fired back at Frazier on Twitter.
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2017
Frazier is not the first CEO to step down from a Trump presidential advisory council. Other CEOs include Travis Kalanick, formerly of Uber, Tesla's Elon Musk, and Walt Disney's Robert Iger. Musk also departed from the manufacturing council.
Marketplace reached out to CEOs and companies on Trump's manufacturing council for comment. Below are their responses. We will update this post if we get additonal comments.
Dell: "While we wouldn't comment on any member's personal decision, there's no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, customers and employees."
Lockheed Martin: "We don't have a comment."
GE: “GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend. GE is a proudly inclusive company with employees who represent all religions, nationalities, sexual orientations and races. With more than 100,000 employees in the United States, it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S., therefore, Jeff Immelt will remain on the Presidential Committee on American Manufacturing while they are the Chairman of GE.”
Whirlpool Corporation: “Whirlpool Corp. believes strongly in an open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds. Our company has long fostered an environment of acceptance and tolerance in the workplace. The company will continue on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative to represent our industry, our 15,000 U.S. workers, and to provide input and advice on ways to create jobs and strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.”
Dow Chemical Company Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris: “I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, and my thoughts and prayers are with those who lost loved ones and with the people of Virginia. In Dow there is no room for hatred, racism, or bigotry. Dow will continue to work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of the communities where it operates — including supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce.”
Campbell: “The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our society. Not simply because of the violence, but because the racist ideology at the center of the protests is wrong and must be condemned in no uncertain terms. Campbell has long held the belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to the success of our business and our culture. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering, and we will remain active champions for these efforts. We believe it continues to be important for Campbell to have a voice and provide input on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees in support of growth. Therefore, Ms. Morrison will remain on the President's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.”
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka: "The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the President to do the same. We are aware of the decisions by other members of the President's Manufacturing Council, which has yet to hold any real meeting, and are assessing our role. While the AFL-CIO will remain a powerful voice for the freedoms of working people, there are real questions into the effectiveness of this council to deliver real policy that lifts working families."
International Paper: International Paper strongly condemns the violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend — there is no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in our society. We are a company that fosters an inclusive workforce where all employees are valued and treated with dignity and respect. Through our participation on the Manufacturing Jobs Council, we will work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of communities across the country by creating employment opportunities in manufacturing."
Nucor Corporation: “At Nucor, we condemn the violence that occurred this past weekend in Charlottesville and reject the hate, bigotry, and racism expressed at the demonstration. As North America's largest steel producer, Nucor has engaged with several administrations to work on policies that help strengthen the U.S. manufacturing sector and provide opportunities for American workers. We believe a strong manufacturing sector is the backbone of a strong economy, and we will continue to serve as a member of the White House Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.”

MT. CARMEL, TN (WJHL) – A youth Sunday school teacher at a church in Hawkins County has been indicted on child pornography charges.
In an indictment from the U.S. District Court in Greeneville, it says Mark Curtis Adams used the app “Kik” to communicate with a child under the age of 18.
We are told Adams was a deacon and youth Sunday school teacher at Oak Grove Baptist church in Mt. Carmel.
The indictment says Adams used the app to knowingly persuade, induce, entice or coerce the child for sexual activity.
The Grand Jury indicted Adams on May 30, but that indictment was sealed until Tuesday.
Adams is charged with enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity and production of child pornography.
The indictment says for at least a month prior to May 30, Adams asked for sexually explicit pictures from a minor.
News Channel 11 reached out to Oak Grove Baptist Church, it told us quote:
“The Oak Grove Baptist Church is aware of the recently filed charges and arrest of Mr. Mark Adams, a deacon in our church. Members of the church leadership have met with authorities to ensure our understanding of the charges and any possible impact on our church community. We intend to fully cooperate with investigators as they continue their investigation. It is important to note, at this time, there is no indication that any member of our church community has been victimized by Mr. Adams.”
Adams is scheduled to be arraigned on June 19 at 1:30 p.m.

Re: Forming 6.5-06 AI brass For a 6.5-06, you can go either way, 270 or 25-06. The easiest is using a 25-06, lube inside of necks and just run a 6.5 expander in the neck and trim to 2.484", chamfer, prime, and shoot. For 270 brass, you anneal if you can (not terribly important on new brass, but more consistent forming), trim to 2.484", lube inside necks and case, run them thru your 6.5-06 die and check trim length again. Chamfer,prime and shoot. The 270 cases will have some slightly thicker necks after forming. Use the best brass you can afford. Happy shooting. __________________
If it's not yours, don't take it. If it's not true, don't say it. If it's not right, don't do it. If you don't think you can hit him, don't shoot him.

The cards should be available sometime early this year (in other words, soon), and they should work much like the scratch-and-redeem cards you already find at the store. The concept certainly isn't unusual for streaming services (Netflix has had prepaid cards for a while, as well as Hulu), but it's not so common for traditional TV outlets. Now, as channels like HBO Now and Starz move beyond the cable bundle, they're making similar efforts to reach customers directly.

Hidden Truth
RANDOM THOTS
The different chants and responses about separation in Nigeria have both a focus and a source. To this reporter, this whole imbroglio can be traced to the political elites who don't want the control of this country to slip from their selfish grasp.
Pray, why would a Hausa man born in the creeks of Port Harcourt suddenly up their roots and go back to their ‘home-land' in the North? Why on earth would an Ibo man raised in Kaduna all their life relocate to a strange land back in the East? And why would a Yoruba-man who has spent all their life on the banks of Lake Chad in Borno State feel at home in the back-waters of Ode-Omu in Osun State, all because some angry folks are chanting war songs of separation and secession all over the country?
This relocation agenda is not new to Nigeria and it failed in April 1990 when late Major Gideon Orkar and their cronies launched a military coup and ordered every Nigerian to relocate to their ‘states of origin'. It didn't work then because the citizens didn't buy into such a process, and there is little likelihood that it would succeed now.
Nigerians are used to living together and the differences in more than 589 dialects from both major and minor ethnic groups have not affected this synergy. But as long as these same evil political elites – who tried to lure the military into a coup – continue their disruptive agenda, that peace which is a vital pre-requisite for development may prove elusive. The security agencies and government must fish out the war-mongers and bring them to justice, to help keep Nigeria one. Until then, no one is safe…simple truth

The 2019 model year marks the start of a new cycle for some of America's top trucks, led by redesigned pickups from Chevrolet and Ram. Ford's top-selling F-150 had updates in 2018, and more may be in the offing for 2019. Typically, Japanese truckmakers Nissan and Toyota aren't far behind with their own updates. Edmunds breaks down what you need to know about today's crop of full-size pickups.
2019 CHEVROLET SILVERADO
Arriving at dealers in the fall, the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado features a ground-up redesign that results in a longer, lighter pickup. Weight savings of around 450 pounds should pay dividends for fuel economy and acceleration.
The new Silverado offers a taller driving position and more room in crew-cab models. It also has the largest cargo box in its class and a power-lowering and -raising tailgate that's exclusive to the class.
The Silverado offers a variety of engines: a V6 (285 horsepower), a V8 (355 horsepower), a larger and stronger V8 (420 horsepower), and a turbocharged four-cylinder (310 horsepower). A six-cylinder diesel arrives in early 2019.
The Silverado's mechanical twin, the GMC Sierra, is also new and goes on sale in the fall. The 2019 Sierra will offer a more upscale interior than the Chevy, along with other exclusive features such as a carbon-fiber cargo box and enhanced technology. The MSRP for a 2019 Silverado crew cab ranges from $34,600 to $53,000.
2018 FORD F-150
Perennially the top-selling vehicle in America, the F-150 reigns supreme among full-size trucks. Multiple trims and configurations, four engine options, and remarkable capabilities make the F-150 a benchmark. Engines include a new base-level 3.3-liter V6 (290 horsepower), along with two turbo V6 options (325 horsepower or 375 horsepower), a V8 (395 horsepower) and a new diesel V6 (250 horsepower).
With towing capacity of up to 13,200 pounds and up to 25 mpg combined city/highway fuel economy, there's not much the F-150 can't do. There's even the bonkers 450-horsepower Raptor edition that can traverse broad swaths of off-road terrain without breaking a sweat. The MSRP for a 2018 F-150 crew cab ranges from $34,245 to $60,850. The 2019 F-150 is expected to be released later this summer.
2018 NISSAN TITAN
Built in Mississippi, the Titan is nearly as American as its domestic rivals despite its Japanese origins. The current Titan was redesigned for 2017 with a bold new look and a new XD model that splits the difference between the capabilities of regular half-ton and heavy-duty pickups. The Titan offers a single 390-horsepower V8 engine and can tow up to 9,740 pounds. The XD version comes with the same V8 or an optional diesel V8 that helps the truck tow up to 12,640 pounds.
The Titan's not our first choice among full-size pickups, but it's roomy and comfortable and it delivers legitimate capability at an attractive price. The MSRP for a 2018 Nissan Titan crew cab ranges from $35,930 to $56,800. The 2019 Nissan Titan arrives this fall.
2019 RAM 1500
Ram shook up the truck world a decade ago with a new rear suspension design that delivered sedan-like ride comfort without sacrificing capability. A refined, comfortable cabin and advanced tech features made its rivals look like archaic work trucks almost overnight. The rivals have since caught up, but the new Ram, thoroughly overhauled for 2019 and now on sale, continues to innovate.
A new frame and body design yield more room for rear passengers and reduce weight by about 200 pounds. The Ram's V8 engine (395 horsepower) returns with a revamped eight-speed transmission that makes more timely shifts. There's also a 3.6-liter V6 base engine that will be paired up with an electric-assist system for smoother power and acceleration and a maximum tow capacity of 12,750 pounds. Redesigned front seats, new technology features and an optional 12-inch infotainment display add to the Ram's winning streak of refinement. The MSRP for a 2019 Ram 1500 crew cab ranges from $34,495 to $56,495.
2018 TOYOTA TUNDRA
The Tundra has gone the longest of any in this group without a full redesign. It's still plenty capable, offering two V8 engines (310 horsepower and 381 horsepower), two body styles and three bed lengths. It can tow up to 10,200 pounds, carry a 1,730-pound payload and handle itself well off-road. The Tundra also is built in the U.S.
The aging Tundra could benefit from a diesel engine (increased towing strength), a smaller turbocharged V6 (better fuel economy) and a thorough technology update. Still, the Tundra has a charm for certain truck buyers. The MSRP for a 2018 Toyota Tundra crew cab ranges from $35,450 to $50,330. The 2019 model arrives in the fall.
EDMUNDS SAYS: With new designs from Chevrolet and Ram and further refinements to the venerable F-150, it's a great time for full-size truck shoppers. Most pickups offer similar capabilities, so look for such qualities as comfort and innovative technology to make a difference.

Los Angeles Angels' Andrelton Simmons points upward after hitting a two-run home run during the seventh inning of the team's baseball game against the New York Yankees, Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in Anaheim, Calif. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Shortstop Andrelton Simmons hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to break a tie and lead the Los Angeles Angels to a 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Wednesday night.
Simmons fell to one knee to hit their seventh home run and ruined the major league debut of New York right-hander Ronald Herrera (0-1).
Danny Espinosa hit a two-run homer for the Angels, and Gary Sanchez a three-run shot for the Yankees.
Blake Parker (2-2) earned the victory in relief. Angels starter Matt Shoemaker left the game in the fourth inning with what the team called tightness of their right forearm extensor muscle.
David Hernandez pitched a scoreless ninth to earn their first save of the year.

NEW YORK (AP) - Facebook plunged to its worst loss in four years Monday and led a rout in technology companies. The social media company's stock fell following reports that a data mining firm working for the Trump campaign improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users.
The drop in Facebook stock came after the New York Times and the Guardian reported that the firm, Cambridge Analytica, was able to tap the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission. Legislators in the U.S. and Europe criticized Facebook and said they want more information about what happened. Investors wondered if companies like Facebook and Alphabet will face tighter regulation as a result.
Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, said Facebook is in a crisis, and it will have to work hard to reassure users, investors and governments.
"This is a defining moment for them," they said. "It either becomes a blip on the radar and it helps the platform mature... or it becomes the start of something broader."
Elsewhere, the British pound rose and European stocks slumped after Britain and the European Union said they are getting closer to a deal that will complete Britain's departure from the EU in March 2019.
The S&P 500 index sank 39.09 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,712.92. The benchmark index took its biggest loss since Feb. 8, when it tumbled almost 4 percent as investors worried that rising inflation would slow the progress of the market and the U.S. economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 335.60 points, or 1.3 percent, to 24,610.91. During the day it fell as much as 493 points. The Nasdaq composite gave up 137.74 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,344.24. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks declined 15.49 points, or 1 percent, to 1,570.56.
Larger technology companies including Apple and Microsoft fared worse than smaller ones. Another market favorite, Amazon, also dropped, and health care stocks fell more than the rest of the market.
Representatives of Britain and the European Union said they made progress on the terms of Britain's departure from the bloc. British envoy David Davis said important steps have been made in the last few days and they think EU leaders will back them in a meeting Thursday and Friday. Britain is scheduled to officially leave the EU on March 29, 2019.
The pound rose to $1.4050 from $1.3938. The British FTSE 100 index fell 1.7 percent and Germany's DAX fell 1.4 percent. France's CAC-40 was 1.1 percent lower.
Facebook said late Friday that it suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent company. It said Cambridge obtained data from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app that was described as a personality test. A former employee said Cambridge was able to get data from tens of millions of other users who were friends with the people who downloaded that app.
Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago but hadn't disclosed it. Facebook also said it recently received a report that Cambridge Analytica hadn't deleted all of the data it obtained from Facebook, something Facebook said the company claimed to have done. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee while legislators in Britain and the European Union also called for inquiries.
On Monday Facebook said it hired an outside firm to audit Cambridge. Its stock sank $12.53, or 6.8 percent, to $172.56, its biggest one-day loss since March 2014.
Ives, of GBH, said Wall Street is more concerned about the latest situation than it was about issues like Facebook's platform spreading fake news. That's because Cambridge reportedly got access to the personal data of a large number of users, and the backlash suggests Facebook may face more regulation and could lose users, advertisers or advertising revenue.
They estimated that $5 billion in annual revenue for Facebook might be a risk and said the situation could create problems for other tech companies, especially Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube unit. Alphabet lost $34.35, or 3 percent, to $1,100.07.
Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow stocks finished the day with losses. The only exception was airplane maker Boeing.
Bond prices gave up an early gain. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.85 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 28 cents to $62.06 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 16 cents to $66.05 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.92 a gallon. Heating oil remained at $1.91 a gallon. Natural gas fell 4 cents to $2.65 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold added $5.50 to $1,317.80 an ounce. Silver rose 5 cents to $16.33 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $3.08 a pound.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up less than 0.1 percent. Seoul's Kospi lost 0.8 percent.
The dollar slipped to 105.97 yen from 106.10 yen. The euro rose to $1.2357 from $1.2284.

“How far away is the Roadkill shoot? 250 miles? Why don't you take the Cummins, then you don't have to stop for gas.” So said Tom before I headed out the other day. The suggestion made sense. After all, the 1993 Cummins W250 is the newest car in our household, definitely the sensible choice for a long drive. The most reliable.
Yeah, well, mice, men, plans—what's the saying? I've got a new one, “Your most reliable truck is gonna shear all the teeth off the transmission and leave you in the dark on a hill next to the Mexican/American border, where there is one bar of cell service.” I know, it's not super catchy, but it is what happened. One minute I'm driving along and the next the truck is shuddering and it sounds like someone is shooting pool with ball bearings under there.
I made it to the side of the highway and did all the usual checks. Is anything obviously hanging down? Is there more fluid dripping than there should be? Did the driveshaft fall out? Did the wheel fall off? Does locking the front hubs make a difference? Oh man, it's dark out here, have you ever seen, The Hills Have Eyes? I was a little cautious about calling for help, since I once made Tom pick me up in my Duster for a broken third member and it was just a loose pinion snubber. They haven't forgotten that, but it was really dark and the thing was truly broke.
I ended up getting a tow to the nearest motel, where I listened to the night clerk explain sniper tactics for 4 hours while Tom wired up the dually for the trailer and somehow managed to find me without working GPS. The rescue vehicle? A 1978 440-powered Dodge D300. The new Old Reliable.
In their justly famous decision in The T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1932), Judge Learned wrote that:
... in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required; there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.
In other words, in negligence cases, courts will usually defer to industry standards but in some cases courts will be prepared to say that a universal industry custom may be so deficient as to itself be negligent.
Contrast that approach to Delaware's consistent jurisprudence on corporate governance best practices. The invaluable Francis Pileggi draws to their readers' attention the latest case to hold that legal liability will not result from a failure to come up to best practice:
The best way to explain the noteworthiness, for those engaged in corporate litigation, of the recent Delaware Chancery decision in Wilkin v. Narachi, C.A. No. 12412-VCMR (Del. Ch. Feb. 28, 2018), is to quote from the Court's introduction: “This case … is a prime example of the difference between a best practice and a legal obligation . . . but Plaintiff fails to point to a single legal obligation that directors violated … [and] Plaintiff has not pled facts that give the Court reason to doubt that these [unexpectedly less successful] outcomes stemmed from rational, good faith decisions of faithful, loyal directors.”
It seems there may be one of to things going on here. First, best practice may differ from "common prudence." On this issue, cf. Dan Laidman, When the Slander Is the Story: The Neutral Reportage Privilege in Theory and Practice , 17 UCLA Ent. L. Rev. 74, 104 (2010) ("While rare, it is not unheard of for courts to look to journalistic best practices in the same way that they use customs in other industries as proxies for reasonableness and negligence when determining tort liability."). But see Niva Elkin-Koren & Orit Fischman-Afori, Taking Users' Rights to the Next Level: A Pragmatist Approach to Fair Use , 33 Cardozo Arts & Ent. L.J. 1, 22 (2015) ("Rothman claims that such [fair use] Best Practices, at best, reflect wishful thinking and not the de-facto industry custom, and at worst, create reality but do not describe it").
Second, because negligence is not a relevant standard in Delaware corporate law--the duty of care is violated by gross negligence--perhaps industry practice is less relevant than tort law.
Interestingly, according to Westlaw, no Delaware court has ever cited The TJ Hooper.

Zimbabwe and Zambia have consummated a $295 million Kariba Dam wall rehabilitation project funded by the European Union to avert a major disaster, as the dam wall's base is under threat of under-cutting.
Repair and rehabilitation works are aimed at pre-empting the corrosive effects of water falling onto the foot of the dam wall, which was beginning to undercut the natural rock on its base, creating an 80-metre gaping hole.
The project will include reshaping of the plunge pool and is expected to be completed in 2020, while the full rehabilitation of the dam to extend its lifespan and improve its safety will be ongoing for eight years.
Addressing delegates at the signing ceremony, Zambian Finance Minister Mr Felix Mutati said the project was the first major works after the dam's commissioning in 1960.
“This double curvature electric dam in the Kariba Gorge of the Zambezi River Basin has over the past years faced weakening of its structural integrity that is threatening livelihoods and ecosystems downstream,” said Mr Mutati.
They urged the contractor, Razel-BEC from France, to expedite work on the project after completion of formalities by the two governments.
Mr Mutati hailed the European Union, which chipped in with a $100 million grant, the African Development Bank which provided $75 million in part loan and grant, the Swedish government's $20 million and the World Bank which extended a $75 million loan.
The Zambezi River Authority is expected to monitor the project and it contributed $19,2 million.
Finance Minister Cde Patrick Chinamasa said energy played a critical role in the development of the economy and every effort should be made to maintain infrastructure.
Giving a technical outline of the project, Zambezi River Authority chief executive Engineer Munyaradzi Munodawafa said the project will allow the authority to spill (water) using all six gates instead of the current maximum of three.
EU head of delegation to Zambia and the COMESA region Mr Alessandro Mariani said the project epitomised solidarity and dynamic partnership between the two countries and cooperating partners. The Chronicle
Your employer wants to hire top salespeople and is counting on HR to deliver the best. There's the old-fashioned way: collect resumes, sort for keywords, check on social networks, get referrals and interview.
But what about geotagging?
Employers often have "top performer clubs" for their salespeople. Incentives for these top performers usually involve rewards such as trips to Hawaii, the Caribbean or Italy.
"That's fairly public knowledge," said Bertrand Dussert, vice president of Human Capital Management (HCM) transformation and thought leadership at Oracle. "You can assemble the known list of salespeople and compare it to geotagged tweets." (Clues can be found on the web. For instance, see this corporate blog post, Italy Awaits Adobe's Top Sales Performers).
"And now you have a targeted list -- provided by the employer -- of their very top salespeople," Dussert said.
This type of analysis is being enabled, in part, by the shift to cloud-based HR systems. It can bring more analytics, databases and tools to users for improving hiring processes and retaining employees.
At the Oracle HCM World conference in Boston last week, there were broad questions about the risks associated with some of these new capabilities.
A new employee, at the time of hiring, might sign forms acknowledging that the company may monitor the employee's email, web use and instant messaging. For some companies, it's standard practice.
But most employees quickly forget about acknowledgement forms, said Mary Young, a principal researcher, human capital, at The Conference Board. "And most people would probably be uncomfortable if they knew their employer was reading your emails."
But where the creep factor may be strongest is due to internet-of-things technologies. Sensors in access/ID cards and even office furniture not only track locations but may be sensitive enough to record biometrics.
Companies can take this information and use it for employee analysis or to glean how teams interact, for instance who talks with whom, and to examine how office space is used.
Young said companies need to be transparent with employees if they want to retain trust. "It would just be unethical to be collecting the data without telling people you are collecting the data," they said. It would hurt employee engagement and morale. "The cost of doing that would so outstrip the benefits."
The term used to describe this trend is "quantified workforce."
"It's about measuring every human-powered process in the enterprise," said Dussert. They defined the quantified workforce this way: "If there is a human being that is doing work, that is building a product, that is interacting with a customer, I want to be able to measure it."
This deeper measurement is also providing different approaches to hiring.
LinkedIn may be more important than resumes in understanding someone's strengths. Endorsements, especially if they are from experts in the speciality, may say a lot about a person's capabilities. Code competitions, for instance, may be more important than degrees, Â Dussert said, when hiring a developer.
"I don't care if you went to MIT 10 years ago if you just won a Java code competition and you're top 10 in the world," they said.
Predictive analytics will play a growing role. Dussert said predictive analytics can help determine whether an employee is at risk of leaving the company. The system could analyze multiple variables, including performance rating, absenteeism and commuting time to work.
Algorithm-assisted decision making will also have a growing role in HR, but there are risks here since these systems could introduce bias into hiring.
These are new technologies and approaches enabled by social networks, big data and IoT. But it's hard to say how big of a change this will be for workers.
"The fact is we've all been measured at work for hundreds of years," said Bruce Flitcroft, the founder and CEO of IT infrastructure company Alliant Tech. "Now there's just hard data associated with it."
ICT Sector Agog over Osinbajo's Executive Order
The executive order that was recently signed by the acting President Yemi Osinbajo which seeks to support local content development in the Information and Communications Technology sector, has continued to elicit stakeholders' reactions, writes Emma Okonji
Although the federal government had in 2006, through the then Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Ufot Ekaette, given a directive to all government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, (MDAs) to support locally developed software and hardware, the directive was not implemented. The order was meant to support local content development in the country. Also, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, had promised to give Software Nigeria, a wing of the old Federal Secretariat in Ikoyi, Lagos for software development. Again that promised ended only in paper work as the government neither renovated the place nor deployed the right facilities.
As a result of the failed promises of government, the ICT sector, has continued to suffer great setbacks, until penultimate week when Osinbajo eventually signed a new executive order to boost local content development and patronage.
Industry stakeholders have continued to hail the federal government on the recent plans to support local content development in the ICT sector.
Failed executive orders
Following several complaints from ICT industry stakeholders, calling for government's support in the area of policy formulation and implementation that will encourage patronage of locally developed software and hardware in the country, and at the same time boost local content development in the ICT sector, the federal government, through Ekaette had ordered all government MDAs to first consider patronage of local software and hardware, whenever the need to purchase software and hardware arose.
Giving details about the first executive order, the President of the Institute of Software Practitioners of Nigeria (ISPON), Olorogun James Emadoye, who raised a national concern when they led a team of ISPON executive on a courtesy visit to the Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu in Abuja last year, said on October 20th, 2006, Ekaette, wrote a letter with Ref No SGF/OP/1/S.3/VII/795, to head of civil service commission, and MDAs of government on the need to patronise made-in-Nigeria products, including procurement of locally assembled computers and locally developed software. They said the letter directed all federal MDAs to comply with the directive. However, Emadoye disclosed that the directive was not implemented.
The ISPON boss also cited how the federal government had promised Software Nigeria a wing of the old federal secretariat in Ikoyi, Lagos, by Obasanjo but never bothered to renovate the place and deploy the right facilities because of the weak implementation drive of government.
According to him, the wing of the federal secretariat would have been a mini version of silicon valley for Software Nigeria, where great software ideas would have been incubated and developed for national growth, if the federal government had deemed it fit to renovate and deplore the right facilities after donating the place for software development.
Emadoye, during the visit, drew the attention of the minister to seek immediate implementation of the guidelines and policy for national software infrastructure, declaring software as a critical infrastructure for nation building and development.
They equally called on government to revisit the 2006 circular on patronage of locally developed computer products and software products.
Latest executive order
Respite, however, came the way of ICT practitioners penultimate week, when Osinbajo signed a new executive order for the support of local content in public procurement, which seeks to boost local content development in the ICT sector.
The order dwells mostly on the preference for indigenous goods and services as well as the removal of bureaucracies which always stall businesses.
The executive order, as detailed in a document presented by Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Okechukwu Enelamah, states that all MDAs of the federal government shall grant preference to local manufacturers of goods and service providers in their procurement processes for a number of items including food and beverages, motor vehicles, ICT products, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, furniture and fittings, among others.
Stakeholders commend FG
The executive order signed by Osinbajo has continued to elicit responses from ICT stakeholders, who believed that the move, if well implemented, would boost patronage and local content development in the ICT sector.
President of the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), Prof. Adesola Aderounmu, in a statement, aligned with the executive order.
According to Aderounmu, “to say the order is a welcome development is an understatement. Over the years, NCS has strongly advocated for the development of local content in ICT to drive growth, unlock youth potential and create jobs in Nigeria. The Executive Order was received by NCS with great expectations and elation. We are indeed pleased that all MDAs of the federal government are now mandated to grant preference to local manufacturers of goods and service providers in their procurement processes for a number of priority items including Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products.”
“This development should stop the wasteful and unsustainable importation and adoption of foreign expertise and solutions. Nigerian companies in the ICT sector have proven to be capable of delivering solutions needed in our public and private sectors. Deploying domestic products and services expands the local industry, fosters local job creation and boosts the local economy,” Aderounmu said.
According to him, “using innovation to bring efficiencies and create jobs in virtually all sectors, not just in ICT is critical to the success of the federal government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (EGRP).
The EGRP and sustainable development depend on having a vibrant and growing domestic ICT sector. Effective implementation of the Executive Order should therefore be a priority, they said in a statement.”
“NCS commends this bold and inspiring decision to support local initiatives and views the executive order as a welcome enabler. For the tech sector, the consistency is appreciated as the order builds on the existing guidelines on Nigerian Content in ICT, they said, adding that NCS is particularly pleased to note that heads of MDAs are required to assess the monitoring, enforcement, implementation and compliance with the executive order. We look forward to collaborating closely with government to ensure the successful implementation of the executive order. In addition, we assure government of the readiness of our group to collaborate on other important policy initiatives and issues in the ICT domain,”Aderounmu said.
The Chairman of Zinox Group, Leo Stan Ekeh, also commended the federal government on the recent signing of an executive order compelling all MDAs of the federal government to buy Made-in-Nigeria goods and services. They said the order would go a long way in boosting indigenous businesses and the local content drive in Nigeria.
Ekeh said it was a step in the right direction and a potential game-changer for many quality-minded local businesses in Nigeria.
“The announcement alone would have excited an army of 21st century young Nigerian entrepreneurs who have been facing depression based on rejection of their certified products by government agencies and parastatals. It is a great development in our new Nigeria and I pray the federal government demonstrates the will to implement this to the letter in order to activate real and progressive development in the country. As you know, this policy direction will potentially result in massive job creation for our youths,” Ekeh said.
“Granting preference to local manufacturers is a sure way of igniting the spirit of indigenous entrepreneurship. This is the standard the world over. Nigeria boasts a number of world-class companies whose products can compete favourably with those of their foreign counterparts. The problem has always been the right form of support from the government,” they added.
According to him, “Zinox, for instance, is patronised by a number of multinationals. Apart from Chevron Nigeria that remains one of our most regular customers, we have also enjoyed consistent patronage from other multinationals such as Total and Shell. Some of these companies – Chevron, Shell, Total have been patronising Zinox for over 14 years and this is based purely on service quality as we all know the high standards these companies aspire to.”
“I must commend the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and the acting President, Yemi Osinbajo for this bold move which will certainly go a long way in strengthening our local industries, provide more employment for our youths and boost our local currency,” Ekeh said.

In a public post, Facebook stated that Cambridge Analytica will be complying with the audit along with Aleksander Kogan, a psychology professor at Cambridge who passed along user data to that political firm (among others). Kogan acquired the information by hiring hundreds of thousands of Amazon Mechanical Turks to take a "personality prediction app" which collected their personal info -- and also that of their Facebook friends. Collecting this data was within acceptable grounds at the time, but keeping it was not: Facebook insists that it ordered the personal info deleted in 2015 after Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had finished using it. While those parties insist they destroyed the data, the social network isn't sure.
Facebook requested someone else comply with the audit -- Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who talked to The Guardian and has declined to participate, according to the social network's post. The audit will determine whether that data still exists; If it does, it would be "a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made." But more to the point, the social network insisted that this incredible access to remote and non-consenting users' data wouldn't happen today: "Kogan's app would not be permitted access to detailed friends' data today."
Dalung has ruined Nigeria's sports – Galadima
By Patrick Omorodion
As confusion continue to trail the National Sports Federation elections conducted by the Youth and Sports ministry, former NOC vice president, Alhaji Ibrahim Galadima has described the sports minister, Solomon Dalung as a cog in the wheel of sports progress.
Speaking from their home in Kano, Alhaji Galadima expressed dismay about the confusion and intrigues that reportedly marred the federations election in Abuja last Tuesday stressing that the Minister has succeeded in supervising the destruction of sports in the country.
“The whole drama of intrigues and manipulation of the election process will create confusion in sports. Dalung has run sports down and there is no likelihood that it will improve under their tenure,” the Chairman of the Kano State Sports Council said.
They urged sports writers in the country to stand up and fight the injustice the sports ministry has meted to aspirants in the election in Abuja which they termed a charade as they commended the NBBF for taking a bold step towards getting its autonomy by creating its own Constitution.
The former Kano Pillars Chairman took a swipe on the minister for appointing them to head a committee for the reform of football in the country but failing to receive the report over a year after the committee completed its work.
“He appointed the committee and gave us two weeks to submit our report. We finished the work since April last year but they have refused to receive the report despite reminders to him. They have shown they are not serious about any reforms. Sports in Nigeria has been going down since they came and something urgent must be done to salvage the situation,” Alhaji Galadima said.

Senator Husain promises effective representation
Senator Mudashir Husain of the Progressives Congress, APC, has expressed their commitment to the welfare of the people of Osun West Senatorial District in advancement of democracy and good governance in the country.
Senator Husain stated this in their acceptance Speech shortly after Hon Sanusi Rikiji, who chaired the screening committee for the Osun West Senatorial District Bye-election declared them as the winner of the election.
Rikiji, an incumbent Speaker of the Zamfara State House of Assembly announced that Hussein polled 2,412 out of 2,560 delegates who participated in the primary election on Wednesday, June 14, 2017
Senator Husain described their victory at the primary as significant for the Progressives Congress (APC), the people of Osun West Senatorial District and the people of the State of Osun in General. The APC candidate maintained that the primary held at Egbedore Local is a further testimony of the life-changing developments of APC led administration of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.
Husain used the occasion to call for the observation of a minute silence in Honour of the late Senator Isiaka Adetunji Adeleke whose death they described as painful.
While appealing to all party faithful to always toe the line of obedience and submission to party leadership in tandem with democratic tenets, Senator Husain emphasized party supremacy at all times just as they reflected on circumstances that earlier surrounded their disqualification.
“It is to the public knowledge, that this contest was characterized by twists and turns, amongst which was my earlier disqualification by the Screening Committee of the party, which decision was upheld by the Appeal Screening Committee. However, as stipulated in the guideline of our party, the NWC upheld my further appeal to it as the body with power to make final verdict on the qualification of any candidate”
They then expressed appreciation to the National Chairman, Chief John Odigiwe-Oyegun, Governor Rauf Aregbesola and all the Leaders and members of APC throughout the country for their unflinching support leading to their emergence as the flag bearer for the rerun election.
“I believe in the oneness of our party, and I took the decision to use legal means to correct what I felt has been wrongly done by both the screening committee and the Screening Appeal Committee. Fortunately, the National Working Committee of our party upheld our contentions. This is the beauty of democracy, especially in a political party like ours.”
Senator Husain tasked party members to work together as a team to secure ultimate Victory at the poll come July 8.
“Our contenders, I mean the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), though scattered and disorganized, are looking for loopholes to ridicule us, but we must remain undivided so that we can all coast to victory at the election.”
They gave an assurance that if they are return to the Senate, they will effectively use the mandate to serve the people of Oṣun West Senatorial District and build on the successes they recorded when they were in the Senate between 2011 and 2015, and also build on achievement recorded by the late Senator, Isiaka Adeleke.
They were the lone candidate in the primary election following the withdrawal of their co-contestant, Dr Ademola Adeleke.

Erdoğan's narrow win will quickly test EU relationship
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's narrow victory in a referendum to strengthen their powers is likely to swiftly test their already worsening relations with the European Union.
Erdoğan said on Monday that Turkey could hold another referendum on its long-stalled EU membership bid — and a further plebiscite on re-introducing the death penalty, a red line for the bloc that would exclude Ankara's candidacy.
Sunday's referendum on expanding Erdoğan's powers came almost exactly 30 years after Turkey formally applied — April 14, 1987 — to join the EU.
Esra Ozyurek, an associate professor at the European Institute of the London School of Economics, said the fact that Erdoğan had spoken so swiftly on the death penalty was an important indication.
“If they think that their anti-European language gains them votes, and nationalism definitely increases their vote, they may go with it,” they said, noting Erdoğan said such a step was “the first thing” he'd do next.
The Turkish strongman, however, did not get the unanimous outcome on Sunday that they had sought — a slim majority of 51.41 percent voted to hand them boosted powers.
The vast majority of the constitutional reforms will follow a presidential election in 2019.
Ibrahim Dogus, founder and director of the Centre for Turkey Studies think-tank in London, said if Erdoğan is to galvanise their supporters “he has to go harder and harder… on issues like the death penalty.”
The referendum campaign was marked by virulent Erdoğan invective against the EU and its leading states, accusing Germany of behaving like Nazis by banning numerous rallies by their ministers hoping to whip up the ‘Yes' vote among expatriate Turks.
– End of the dream? –
Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe focused on Turkey and the Middle East, said bringing back the death penalty would allow Erdoğan to pin the blame on the EU for the end of the membership bid.
“Bringing back the death penalty would have two objectives: putting an end to any internal disagreement, and triggering a formal halt by the EU — and not by Turkey — of the accession negotiations,” Pierini said.
Germany and France have both warned Turkey about the broad consequences of reinstating the death penalty, which was abolished in 2004.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that if Ankara were to bring back capital punishment, the move would be “synonymous with the end of the European dream” and mark the end of decades of talks to enter the EU.
– ‘Even more difficult' –
The referendum result and Turkey's difficult relations with the EU mean the two are “on a collision course”, according to Amanda Paul, a Turkey specialist at the European Policy Centre in Brussels.
“I don't think it's going to make them more cautious vis-a-vis the EU, particularly because the result was so narrow,” they said of Erdoğan.
“We'll probably continue to see what we've been seeing for the past few months, a pretty anti-EU narrative, he's not going to change this.”
Although the accession progress “has been dead for a long time”, officially drawing it to a close would have longer-lasting implications domestically and abroad.
“They're going to be caught in an even more difficult situation now because clearly the nearly 50 percent of Turks that voted ‘no' will be expecting the EU to continue to engage with Turkey, not to close the door on Turkey,” Paul said.
“But I'm guessing a number of member states and possibly the European Parliament will be pushing for an official freezing of the accession process.
“I personally believe that a relationship between Turkey and the EU that is just based on economy and trade will be a significant blow to Turkish democrats and those that support reform and the modernisation of the country,” they added.
“It's certainly not going to do them any favours. Furthermore if the EU continues to turn a blind eye to the democratic deficits in Turkey, what does it say about the EU as a value based actor?”
The most intransigent Europeans, such as Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, have already called for an end to accession negotiations.

YOUR QUICKCAST:
MONDAY: Partly cloudy AM; PM scattered rain/storms - a high of 92°
MONDAY NIGHT: A few clouds - a few isolated showers (20%); a low of 75°
TUESDAY: Sun/cloud mix early; 50% PM rain/storms - a high of 91°
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
- After a relatively dry Sunday, very little activity occurred during the morning hours Monday on FIRST ALERT Doppler radar …
- However, VERY warm and steamy summer weather has returned - due, in part, to the wet weather activity not being as widespread as it has been in days past and because of a rather weak (and persistent) area of high pressure situated over the northern Gulf of Mexico
- Instead of daytime showers/storms in the “likely to numerous” category, we're actually paring down the amount and coverage of the (manly) afternoon/early evening to 40% - 50% (in the "scattered category")… only a “marginally” unstable atmosphere in place
- While the clouds and rain last week meant somewhat “cooler than normal” daytime highs, we're now looking at afternoon temperatures pushing back into the lower 90°s - coupled with high humidity/dew point, the “feels like” reading is expected to top out in the lower triple digits …
- At 4 a.m., it was 79° with a feel like of 83°; as of late morning, it's 89° with a feel like of 100°
- Be careful in the heat … stay hydrated, check on the very young and older neighbors and keep pets and small children SAFE while in your vehicle.
BOATERS FORECAST:
Coastal Waters: SW winds, 5 - 10 knots; Seas, 1 foot or less; light chop
Inland Lakes: SW winds, 5 - 10 knots; Waves, 1 foot or less

NORMAL HIGH/LOW FOR AUGUST 14 … 93°; 74°
SUNRISE: 6:31 a.m.

TROPICAL UPDATE:
Tropical Storm Gert is getting a little stronger … highest sustained winds are now at 60 mph; moving to the North at 8 mph; about 460 miles WSW of the island of Bermuda. The good news is the fact that “Gert” will NOT impact the east coast of the US … nonetheless, it will (in all likelihood) become a “Category 1” hurricane by late Tuesday night or early Wednesday.

To the Editor:
Re “Trump's Magical Fantasy World” (column, May 25):
David Brooks opines that we are being seduced into President Trump's fantasy world “like puppets on their string” dominated by the “Trumpian soap opera.”  They are misunderstanding, in my opinion, the reality of many Americans.
As a psychoanalyst I hear many of my patients describe the feeling of living in a waking nightmare in a reality that is both terrifying and terrorizing because reality itself is under constant attack. This leads not to seduction but to hypervigilance in an effort to manage a constant feeling of threat.
I have urged many of my patients to respect their need to be informed without compulsively monitoring the news in a failed effort to reassure themselves that they are safe. For many people some form of activism, an antidote to feeling paralyzed with fear and helplessness, is crucial.
Many mental health experts have argued that Mr. Trump's problem staying in reality impairs their ability to make decisions and raises questions as to their fitness to serve. We are witnessing a metaphorical train crash in slow motion. History will not be kind to those who blindly or knowingly joined our president for the ride.
Rapper Meek Mill is out of jail after being held behind bars for five months for probation violations.
Mill took off in a helicopter shortly before 7 p.m. Tuesday from the prison outside of Philadelphia.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday directed a Philadelphia judge who had jailed them to immediately issue an order freeing them on bail while they appeal decade-old drug and gun violations.
Mill was sentenced in November to 2 to 4 years in prison for violating probation.
A team of lawyers and public relations consultants had waged an all-out battle to get them freed on bail.
Philadelphia's district attorney believes Mill should get a new trial because of questions raised about the credibility of their arresting officer.

George H.W. Bush Hospitalized Day After Wife's Funeral
Former president George H.W. Bush was being treated for a blood infection on Monday, one day after laying their wife Barbara to rest, their office said.
A statement stressed that Bush, 93, was responding to treatment. They were admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital early Sunday, just a day after bidding a final farewell to their wife of 73 years during a funeral in the same Texas city. Barbara Bush had died on Tuesday.
The 41st president greeted and shook hands with numerous attendees of the event during the invitation-only funeral attended by four former presidents, including themselves and their son George W. Bush.
More than a thousand people attended the ceremony.
“I always knew Barbara was the most beloved woman in the world, and in fact I used to tease them that I had a complex about that fact,” Bush said after their wife's passing.
Their marriage was the longest presidential union in American history.
They married the love of their life while on leave from military deployment in 1945, several months before World War II ended.
Bush, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and is wheelchair-bound as a result, has been repeatedly hospitalized for pneumonia. Theirs is a less-common version of Parkinson's that only affects the lower body.
“President Bush was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital yesterday morning after contracting an infection that spread to their blood,” a statement read.
“He is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. We will issue additional updates as events warrant.”
One-term war hero
George Herbert Walker Bush was born June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts to a wealthy New England political dynasty, the son of Prescott Bush, a successful banker and US Senator for Connecticut.
Bush had a pampered upbringing and attended the prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, but delayed their acceptance to Yale in order to enlist in the Navy on their 18th birthday and head off to World War II.
They went on to fly 58 combat missions during the war. They were shot down over the Pacific by Japanese anti-aircraft fire and rescued by a submarine after huddling in a life raft for four hours while enemy aircraft circled.
The decorated war hero and former CIA chief suffered the ignominy of being a one-term president, but led a political dynasty that would win back the White House eight years later, albeit with a leader with a very different approach.
A foreign policy realist who navigated the turbulent fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, they assembled an unprecedented coalition to defeat Saddam Hussein two years later.
But they also presided over a period of economic malaise and infuriated their fellow Republicans during a budget battle with rival Democrats by famously breaking their vow: “Read my lips: no new taxes.”
After retiring from public life, Bush fulfilled a wartime pledge to one day jump out of a plane for fun and famously went skydiving on their 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays.
They joined Bill Clinton — the Democrat to whom they lost their re-election bid — to raise funds for victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In February 2011 Democratic president Barack Obama awarded Bush the highest US civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom.
Bush, who served as commander-in-chief from 1989 to 1993, is the oldest of the five living former US presidents.
 They are father to ex-president George W. Bush (2001-2009) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who was a contender in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tina Turner is not done telling them story.
The rock superstar is working on a sequel to their 1986 memoir "I, Tina," Atria Books told The Associated Press on Monday. The new book is called "Tina Turner: My Love Story" and will come out next October, timed to the singer's 60th year in music.
Seventy-eight year-old Turner says in a statement that they will write about everything from "finding love" to surviving a "life-threatening illness" they had never disclosed before.
Turner, who endured a horrifying marriage to musician Ike Turner, married Erwin Bach in 2013.  They are known for such hits as "Proud Mary" and "What's Love Got To Do With It," the title of a 1993 biopic starring Angela Bassett as Tina Turner and Laurence Fishburne as Ike.

The first month of the year is officially over. But has your new year's resolution of losing weight and getting in shape lasted through January?
Not many of us can hang on past the first month of the year when it comes to our new year's resolutions. Especially the one about weight loss and eating right. Dr. Edith Mbagwu, Primary Care Physician at Ochsner Health Center- Denham Springs North, has a solution that could solve this goal crusher.
Dr. Mbagwe says SMART goal setting can help people set and keep realistic weight loss goals- “no matter how much or how little they're trying to lose.”
SMART is an acronym that helps bring structure to what you are trying to accomplish. It stands for S-specific, M-measurable, A-attainable, R-realistic, T-time-based.
While the SMART structure can be applied to any goals, Dr. Mbagwu has a few ideas on how it can wrestle weight loss.
Specific: Make sure your goals are clearly defined. ‘I will exercise more and eat better' is not specific enough.
Dr. Mbagwu says, “For example, decide how many days per week you will exercise, how many calories per day you will burn, what types of exercises you will do, and what types of foods you will eat.”
Measurable: What assessments will you use to keep on track? Health and fitness assessments include weight, body, fat percentage, number of calories, size of clothes, and how much you can lift, etc.
“Some people find certain measurements more discouraging than helpful. There are plenty of different ways to track your progress. Find the ones that motivate you,” says Dr. Mbagwu.
Attainable: Can you achieve your goal? If so, then how? If not, why?
Realistic: Is your goal manageable within the resources, knowledge and time you have available? If so, then how? If not, what can you do to make it realistic?
“It's also a good idea to reassess your goals every now and then to make certain they are realistic,” says Dr. Mbagwu. “No one can lose 30 pounds in three days and stay healthy. Setting smaller goals along the way can make it easier to commit to a larger goal.”
Dr. Mbagwu says, “if you want to lose 75 pounds, keep a goal of burning 500 calories per day, which equals 3,500 calories per week and translates to one pound of fat loss per week.”
Motivation and prioritizing can be big issues when it comes to realistic weight loss added Dr. Mbagwu. “A lot of people want to lose weight, but they also want fried chicken, pasta, and cake. Some kind of motivation like training for a race, wanting to fit into certain clothes, or reaching a health target can help you stick to your program and hit your goals.”
Time-based: Do you have enough time to work toward your goal daily, weekly or monthly? How can you rearrange your schedule to accommodate your goal? How can you make your health a priority?

Enrique Marquez Jr., 25, of Riverside, Calif., is accused of purchasing the assault rifles used in the San Bernardino terrorist attack, and has agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.
Benjamin Gottlieb of member station KCRW tells our Newscast unit:
In their plea, Marquez admits that their friend, Syed Rizwan Farook, paid them for the assault rifles used to kill 14 people and injure 22 others in December of 2015. That's when Farook and their wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire at a holiday party of Farook's coworkers at the Inland Regional Center. Marquez also admits they conspired with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to attack Riverside City College (RCC) — as well as commuter traffic on a major freeway in Southern California. Those plans never materialized.
U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said, "While their earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center."
Prosecutors say there is no evidence that Marquez participated in the San Bernardino attack or had advance knowledge about it.
They did acknowledge that they were a "straw buyer" when they purchased two high-powered rifles used in the San Bernardino attack.
According to a Justice Department statement:
"Straw purchasers are criminals who are the beginning of the chain of violence in our country," said ATF Special Agent in Charge Eric D. Harden. "It is purchases like Marquez's that led to the terror on that tragic day in San Bernardino. The crime goes beyond making a false statement on a government form. It puts guns in the hands of criminals who will victimize the community. In this case, the straw purchase is as reprehensible as the attack."
Mandy Pifer, whose boyfriend Shannon Johnson was killed in the terror attack, told The Associated Press that Marquez's plea agreement brought mixed emotions:
"It's a hell of a day to come out, Valentine's Day," the 42-year-old Los Angeles resident said. "I'm relieved that it won't be a long trial. If it'll be finished sooner, I'm all for it." They said they planned to speak at Marquez's sentencing about the impact their boyfriend's killing has had on them In their last moments, Johnson huddled with a colleague under a table, shielding them from the bullets. "It is what it is," they said. "Nothing's going to bring them back."
Marquez is expected to formally enter their guilty pleas Thursday morning.
They have been in custody since they were ordered detained at their initial court appearance in this case on Dec. 17, 2015.
Marquez faces up to 25 years in federal prison.

“We're Not Recruiting Now” Navy Alerts Nigerians As Application For Air Force DSSC 2017 Ends Today
The Nigerian Navy on Wednesday alerted Nigerians on the activities of fraudsters currently operating fake online recruitment sites.
The notification was made in a statement issued by the Navy's Director of Information, Suleiman Dahun, in Abuja.
Mr. Dahun, a captain, said for the avoidance of doubt, the portal for registration of candidates for the 2017 NN Recruitment Exercise has not been opened.
“Therefore, innocent members of the public are advised to steer clear of these fraudulent sites. “Furthermore, information will be conveyed to the public on the commencement of the recruitment exercise in the mass media,” they said.
Mr. Dahun said that the 2017 recruitment form would be free of charge whenever registration commenced.
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has closed application for the Direct Short Service Commission (DSSC).
Recall, NAF had said “online registration starts on 18th May, 2017 and closes on 15th June, 2017.”

Once a staple of family life, family dinners are now in decline. The American College of Pediatricians reports that family time at the dinner table has declined by more than 30 percent over the past three decades. That unfortunate development could have a significant impact on children as they grow up.
The importance of family meals goes beyond parents ensuring their children are eating healthy diets. Family meals can affect various aspects of children's lives, some of which may surprise parents.
Substance abuse. For years, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University has studied the links between family dinners and substance abuse among teenagers.
Former U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano noted that 17 years of studying teens taught the center's researchers that the more often children have dinner with their families, the less likely they are to smoke, drink or do drugs.
Such studies have shown that children who have between five and seven family dinners per week are considerably less likely to use tobacco, alcohol and marijuana than children who eat dinner with their families three or fewer times per week.
Academic performance. Family meals also have been linked to stronger performances in the classroom. One study from the center found that teens that have frequent family dinners were nearly 40 percent more likely to report earning A's and B's in school than their counterparts who ate two or fewer dinners with their families each week.
In addition, a 2012 analysis from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that students who do not regularly eat with their parents are more likely to be truants at school than those who frequently break bread with their parents.
Family bonding. Family dinner tables are great places to bond as families, and families that eat dinner together more often tend to spend more time at the dinner table during such dinners than those who infrequently eat dinner together.
The center's researchers report that teens who have frequent family dinners are twice as likely to say dinners lasts more than 30 minutes when compared to those who have infrequent family dinners.
Time at the dinner table gives parents and children time to engage and communicate with one another, promoting strong relationships as a result.
Family meals may be on the decline, but families who make time to eat dinner together every night or several nights per week can benefit from such efforts in various ways.

After thrilling more than 8 million people worldwide, CORTEO will visit Chattanooga at the McKenzie Arena for a limited run of six performances, from May 10 to 13, 2018.
This unique production directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca premiered in Montreal in April 2005 and has visited 64 cities in 19 countries.
CORTEO, which means cortege in Italian, is a joyous procession, a festive parade imagined by a clown. The show brings together the passion of the actor with the grace and power of the acrobat to plunge the audience into a theatrical world of fun, comedy and spontaneity situated in a mysterious space between heaven and earth.
The clown pictures their own funeral taking place in a carnival atmosphere, watched over by quietly caring angels. Juxtaposing the large with the small, the ridiculous with the tragic and the magic of perfection with the charm of imperfection, the show highlights the strength and fragility of the clown, as well as their wisdom and kindness, to illustrate the portion of humanity that is within each of us. The music turns lyrical and playful carrying CORTEO through a timeless celebration in which illusion teases reality.
The cast of CORTEO includes 51 acrobats, musicians, singers and actors from all around the world.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Some Brooklyn residents are caught in the middle as the city battles with the U.S. Postal Service over broken mailboxes.
As CBS2's Dave Carlin reported, Mitchell Yates and many of their neighbors at 580 Stanley Ave. in the Linden Houses are not receiving delivery of their mail. It's blamed on a bank of 24 boxes that has been busted since mid-August after years of neglect, they say.
“l pay my rent, and I've got to go through this,” Yates said.
“I'm very angry,” said resident Dorinda Pannell. “This is ridiculous.”
Pannell said when they confronted their mail carrier about it, they were told the Postal Service has rules prohibiting them from placing mail in broken boxes.
Residents say picking up their mail at the East New York station on Atlantic Avenue means traveling 10 blocks, and when they get there, the lines are often long.
“I'm not supposed to be there!” Pannell said. “I have a mailbox. My mail should be put in my box.”
CBS2 demanded answers from the New York City Housing Authority, which is in charge of the Linden Houses.
Property Manager Humphrey Smith said the small individual mailbox doors can repair by their team. But in this case, it's the entire front panel for the 24 boxes, and that kind of fix is on the feds.
“The Postal Service is the one that provides and installs the master postal lock,” said Smith, adding they only learned of the problem about three weeks ago. “There's nothing you can do because you have to wait for them to do what they've got to do.”
A Postal Service spokesperson emailed CBS2 saying contact with building's management was established weeks ago, but they could not offer a timeline for replacing the master lock and repairing the doors.
The Postal Service also said, in this case, holding the mail at the station is a courtesy and cannot be done as a permanent solution to what it considers a building maintenance issue.
Last night on Fox News Representative Trey Gowdy stunned many people with multiple comments. There are multiple aspects to the interview that were/are alarming.
In one segment Gowdy stated the Mueller investigation was both a criminal and counterintelligence investigation. Moments later Mr. Gowdy proclaimed their advanced knowledge of the innocence of FBI Director James Comey and Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe surrounding Spygate.
In another segment Gowdy, a former prosecutor himself, asserted that President Trump should sit down with Robert Mueller for a dangerous inquisition by a team of political prosecutors hired specifically because of their adverse ideology. SEE INTERVIEW HERE.
In a well-timed (pre-planned) follow-up, Trey Gowdy appeared on CBS this morning to finish execution of the plan. Notice Norah O'Donnell has their carefully crafted (pre-written) bullet-point questions at the ready. Watch:
.
The more you know the raw source material behind the Spygate story; the more you can see the false assertions behind Gowdy's statements, and the strategic purpose therein.
The Gowdy statements would be alarming by themselves if not compounded by the fact that Mr. Gowdy is one of only a few people with direct first-hand knowledge of the material and evidence in multiple investigations.
After Devin Nunes was forced to recuse themselves from much of the congressional investigation, HPSCI Chairman Devin Nunes specifically selected Gowdy to represent multiple committees in their review of material evidence.
It was Trey Gowdy who looked at the FISA application material and specifically authored the Nunes memo on the FISA Court application against U.S. person Carter Page.
It was Trey Gowdy who initially (April 8th) stated they had “seen” some of the origination material in the two-page “Electronic Communication” document that CIA Director John Brennan used to initiate the FBI Counterintelligence operation against the Trump campaign. Later that Gowdy claim was asserted as false, and only a briefing took place; but the Gowdy claim was useful at the time.
It was Trey Gowdy, and only Trey Gowdy, who claimed Samantha Power denied making all of the unmasking requests; and Trey Gowdy who asserted someone else used their access to make unmasking requests.
IMPORTANT -> It was Trey Gowdy, eight months ago, who positioned themselves for maximum influence within the upcoming political reviews of the Inspector General report by creating a joint House Oversight and House Judiciary Committee (Goodlatte); specifically for the intention of reviewing the IG report, controlling the narrative and getting testimony. (See Here)
It was all originally suspicious, as noted by CTH at the time:
April 2018: Hopefully, this is not cause for alarm. However, given the history of such activity; and specifically given the history of the engagements and motives of the participants involved in this request; it is a troubling development. The House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee is the official DC enterprise deployed when Washington DC interests identify a threat and maneuver their political UniParty alliances to eliminate the issue. Historic Oversight Committee references to Fast-n-Furious (Issa), IRS targeting (Chaffetz), and the origin of the Benghazi, Libya investigation are recent examples of outcomes therein. There is a pattern that should not be dismissed. There is a strong likelihood the DOJ-OIG investigation is too close to the heartbeat of the swamp; and therein the motive for the committee to be called into action becomes part of the self-preservation technique this specific assembly is noted for. Adding more weight to the concern is the appearance of Representative Trey Gowdy as the requesting authority. As if that wasn't concerning enough, the specific area of focus for the committee is outlined in the letter: “The hearing relates to the election-related review“, targeting the 2016 election and the 2017/2018 IG investigation therein. […] We would be remiss if we did not draw reference to the last worst example of weaponization of government; in 2010 where the IRS targeted Tea Party groups and both Democrats and Republicans benefited from the Obama administration's use of the DOJ to eliminate the threat the Tea Party represented. In 2010 IRS Official Lois Lerner was instructed by Attorney General Eric Holder to deliver the “schedule B” filings of 501-c(3)(4) groups, listing every single person who donated to Tea Party groups regardless of contribution amount. Ms. Lerner gave the DOJ twenty-one CD-ROMS containing over 1 million names. {Go Deep} The subsequent list was called the “secret research project”. All of this is documented – none of this is conspiracy theory – the DOJ settled a class-action lawsuit last year admitting to the scheme. The DC investigation into the individuals who coordinated the plan was dropped quietly in 2015. No-one was charged. There are similarities to the 2010, 2011 use of the IRS and DOJ to target political opposition; and the 2015, 2016 use of the FBI and DOJ to target candidate Donald Trump and their campaign. There are a lot of similarities. Unfortunately, there are also the same DC benefactors. As noted in the original use of Fusion-GPS, and Glenn Simpson, by the campaign allies of Marco Rubio to conduct political opposition research – the republican side of the UniParty apparatus uses the same systems, entities, organizations, lawyers and personnel used by the democrat side of the UniParty. Trey Gowdy was a supporter of Marco Rubio. It is reasonable to anticipate entities deep within the Republican infrastructure were willing allies with the FBI and DOJ “small group”, hence we see John McCain, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romey, Ben Sasse, Jeff Flake, Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina (and many, many, more) who likely understood the goals, objectives and benefits behind weaponizing the FBI/DOJ and intelligence community to eliminate their opposition. [Never forget the severity of the scheme within the original GOPe plan in the 2016 presidential primary.] Don't be surprised, if down-the-road, we find direct evidence of key GOPe leadership aiding and assisting the Clinton Campaign, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch and Sally Yates et al. Actually, I would be dumfounded if direct evidence therein is not discovered. (link)
And today, as if on cue, just as predicted; right before the IG report is to drop – here comes Gowdy.
Brilliant play by the UniParty (Deep State) to position Trey Gowdy as an embed, a control agent, awaiting strategic timing to deploy the defensive detonation.
Cue the Gowdy metaphor:

Warmer climate threatens malaria spread in Ethiopia
Paris, France | AFP | Cool, high-lying areas of Ethiopia hitherto shielded from heat-loving malaria mosquitoes are increasingly exposed to the disease as the climate warms, researchers said Thursday.
Most Ethiopians live in the country's highlands, and have long enjoyed natural protection against mosquitoes carrying the malaria-causing parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.
But the buffered area has been shrinking since 1981, scientists reported in the journal Environmental Research Letters. About six million people live in the newly-vulnerable regions.
Air temperatures below 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 degrees Fahrenheit) prevent development of P. falciparum. The survival threshold for P. vivax is 15 C, according to the research team.
Low temperatures also impede the spread of mosquitos that host the parasites.
Since temperatures decrease with altitude, much of the Ethiopian highlands — 1,500 to 2,500 metres (4,921 to 8,202 feet) above sea level — were beyond the reach of malaria transmission.
To date, it was not known whether the mercury had risen in the East African highlands, or whether global warming contributed to a recent upsurge in malaria in the region.
To find out, a team from the University of Maine and Columbia University in New York compiled a national temperature dataset for Ethiopia covering the period 1981-2014.
They discovered that temperatures rose at least 0.22 C (0.4 F) per decade.
The team then used the new climate data to pinpoint the highest elevation where the average minimum temperature never exceeds the 18 C or 15 C malaria threshold.
“The elevation at which the temperature thresholds are met has risen by more than 100 metres (328 feet) since 1981,” the study's lead author Bradfield Lyon of the University of Maine, said in a statement.
Taking into account natural variability in the regional climate and impacts of the seasonal El Nino weather phenomenon, the observed rise was “consistent” with global warming caused by humankind's burning of fossil fuels, the authors found.
“Of particular concern is that the… changes are occurring in the densely populated highlands, where higher elevation has historically served as a buffer against malaria transmission,” they wrote.
According to the World Health Organization, there were 212 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2015, and 429,000 deaths.
Ninety percent of malaria cases and deaths occur in Africa. Children under five are most at risk.

UNHCR worried about alleged insecurity in IDP camps
Gov inaugurates committee on crisis
Over 3000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are allegedly facing security threats in Taraba State.The state chapter of the Protection Sector Working Group (PSWG) disclosed this yesterday after a meeting at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
The PSWG said the displaced persons were also threatened by acute shortage of “relief materials, especially food and medicals.”The UNHCR's Head of Field Unit in the state, Daniel Istifanus Bisu and Paul Tino of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), led the meeting.
According to the group, there is still insecurity at the IDP camps in Ardo-Kola and Lau local councils in Jalingo, despite the presence of armed police officers.
The group stressed that the displaced persons were scattered across Kofai Primary School, UMCN Church, Lankaviri, Jimlari and Abuja phase II in Jalingo the state capital, without adequate protection.
The UNHCR's officials said the relevant authorities assigned to protect the women and children had abandoned their responsibilities to the church.They urged the Federal Government to expedite action so that the displaced persons could return home to continue their farming.
However, the Police Public Relations Officer, David Misal, said armed police officers were on alert to check the unauthorised movement of persons in and out of the camps.
Meanwhile, Governor Dairus Ishaku has constituted a 10-member committee to find a lasting solution to the frequent crisis between the people of Shomo and Jole communities in Lau Council areas.
The committee, which was given two weeks to submit its report, had the Deputy Governor, Haruna Manu as its chairperson, with the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Anthony Jellason, the Commissioner of Police and the state Director of the Department of State Services (DSS) as members.
Others are the Chief of Staff, Government House Administration, Commissioner of Information and Orientation, Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Permanent Secretary, Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and the monarch of Lau communities, Abubakar Danburram.

Rhode Island Democrats are in an uproar after the party endorsed a Donald Trump-voting male candidate over a sitting female lawmaker known for championing liberal causes, in a district and a state that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton.
The decision to endorse Michael Earnheart over Providence state Rep. Moira Walsh unleashed the frustration of many liberal women who say concerns about issues including abortion rights and sexual harassment are not being addressed by the state's Democratic leaders. The chairperson of the party's women's caucus called last week's endorsement unacceptable and said Tuesday they were demanding an explanation.
State Rep. Joe McNamara, the party's chairperson, told The Associated Press they didn't know Earnheart supported Trump when they endorsed him, saying it was "difficult to do a complete history" of the candidate. They said they believed Earnheart no longer supports Trump, although said "we didn't get into it when we spoke with him."
They blamed Walsh for not seeking the endorsement.
"It's not rocket science," they said.
Walsh, 27. disputed that and said the party told them it was not endorsing anyone. They said they and other liberal women were being targeted by House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, who controls Rhode Island's Democratic party.
Rather than listen to women about issues important to them, they said, "their solution has been instead, 'Why don't we get rid of these women, and they won't ask for this stuff anymore.'"
Earnheart, 31, declined an interview but answered some questions by email, confirming they voted for Trump. They called Walsh at the "fringe" of the General Assembly.
Mattiello's spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
Sulina Mohanty, chairperson of the women's caucus, said they believe party leadership is blatantly disrespecting women and fearful that they will have to cede power to newly energized women.
"There are women stepping up at all levels, from running for office, to speaking at hearings. I know so many women who were at the statehouse multiple times a week this session," they said.
Mohanty said the leadership failed to pass legislation women were most focused on, including bills involving sexual harassment, guns in schools and pay equity.
Mattiello angered many people in May when, in a radio interview , they dismissed calls to codify abortion rights in the state in case Roe v. Wade is overturned. They called the concern "not founded in reality."
Then came the endorsements, which included not only Earnheart but a former Providence lawmaker endorsed by local Democrats even though they have a history of being charged with crimes including sexual assault and perjury. They have denied wrongdoing.
The state chapter of the National Organization for Women last week said women are ignored in the state's political environment.
"It is no surprise that men believe they can treat women criminally, and still be considered democratic leaders," they said.
Walsh and their supporters say Earnheart is out of step with the district, which has a large immigrant population.
They point to a photograph of Earnheart holding a Make America Great Again sign at a Trump rally last year and to their now-deleted feed. They recently retweeted conservative figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich. In May, they posted that "illegal aliens are self-entitled lawbreakers and thieves, stealing jobs and government benefits meant for our own people."
Earnheart didn't address criticism about their Twitter feed, but said they went to the rally "to hear opposing viewpoints from each side."
They did not answer whether they still support Trump.
The clinical commissioning groups in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Luton, together with the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST), have continued to make good progress to put in place a reliable transport service for patients that use the service.
Transport services have been working well, with patients picked up on time and attending their outpatient appointments.
A spokesperson for the health groups said: “It is usual for there to be fewer outpatient appointments at hospitals at the weekend.
“Nevertheless, we have obtained a list of appointments so we have a clear picture of when transport is required over the weekend and on Monday.
“This has ensured we have sufficient staff and transport capacity available, as well as to transport patients home when they are fit to leave.
“As a precautionary measure, we have arranged for the contact centre to be open over this weekend in case patients need to talk to someone urgently about existing transport arrangements.”
The number is 01603 481208 and will be open 8am to 6pm with an answer machine service operating outside of these hours.
GLENDALE, Ariz. -- While NFL commissioner Roger Goodell considers the national anthem a "special moment" and a "point of pride," they want to respect the rights of players across the league to sit during the anthem as a form of protest.
Goodell's feelings were voiced during a question-and-answer session for Arizona Cardinals' club season-ticket holders before training camp Monday. A question was posed to Goodell about whether anthem protests this season were "going to be another problem."
On Saturday, Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch sat on a cooler during the national anthem before a preseason game against the Cardinals and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat for the anthem before their game at the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.
"It's one of those things where we have to understand that there are people who have different viewpoints," Goodell said. "It's something that I think everybody wants. The national anthem is a special moment for me. It's a point of pride. That is a really important moment but we also have to understand the other side, that people do have rights and we want to respect those."
Goodell said they had a similar discussion during a New York Jets' fan forum a couple weeks ago. A player, whom Goodell did not name, was asked about the ongoing silent protest, Goodell said. The player, according to Goodell, said there was "a time and a place" to engage in protest.
That, Goodell said Monday, is one of the key components for players to recognize.
"That's what we all have to, sort of, understand, the responsibility of doing it at the right time and in the right way," Goodell said.
"Protest to progress is what I call it. We all have to recognize that people want to see change. Let's go out and try to make that happen in a peaceful and an important way."
Goodell touched on other topics, as well.

62,140 Candidates To Rewrite Their 2017 UTME Examination – JAMB [SEE WHY]
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has blacklisted 48 Computer-Based Test centres and ordered a total of 62,140 candidates to rewrite the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME over their alleged involvement in extortion and organised examination malpractices.
JAMB's Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja at a news conference at the end of an enlarged meeting with external examiners and other stakeholders in the conduct of the 2017 UTME.
Oloyede, who also announced the cancellation of the results of 59,698 candidates who sat for the examination, said another 24 CBT centres had been suspended for one year for failing to live up to expectations.
According to Oloyede, the 62,140 cancelled results include of 57,646 candidates in centres-induced malpractice, 3,811 late registration, and 683 candidates who had biometric challenges.
“The (24 CBT) centres will not participate in the 2018 UTME, but they can be reconsidered for 2019 and above.
“The de-listing of 48 centres from participating in the board's examination in future is as a result of serious technical deficiencies, extortion, organised examination malpractices and other damaging infractions.”
They said that JAMB had fixed July 1, 2017 as the date for supplementary examination for candidates who registered late for this year's UTME.
Oloyede added that some of the candidates whose results were cancelled would also take part in the rescheduled exam.
The JAMB boss said the decision to allow the candidates sit for the rescheduled examination was reached after a thorough review of all the reports that emanated from their centres.
According to him, 1,386 candidates have their results cancelled over examination malpractice; 57,646 results were also affected as a result of centres-induced malpractices; while the results of 666 candidates were cancelled due to multiple examinations.
They listed the categories of candidates whose results were cancelled but who would take part in the rescheduled examination to include candidates of centres with mass malpractices but who are deemed innocent, and those with biometric non-verification machine-related issues.
Others include technical and log-out issues, late registration, incomplete results and candidates who lost examination sessions due to malfunctioning of servers at the affected centres. (NAN)

Four mystery men, including three tourists from Wakefield, helped save the life of a distraught teenager who walked into the sea at Blackpool.
The holidaymakers and a passing cyclist threw life rings to the 19-year-old and pulled them to safety from the water behind the Metropole hotel, close to North Pier, in the early hours of yesterday morning.
One of them, despite being soaked by the cold waves himself, took their shirt off and wrapped it round the distressed woman before the emergency services arrived.
The three tourists, who were said to be from Wakefield and in their 20s, were taken back to the New Royal Windsor Hotel further down the Prom, while the anonymous cyclist left without giving their details.
The men have now been hailed for their actions – and described as ‘selfless'.
Paul Little, the Coastguard's station officer for Lytham, Blackpool, and Cleveleys, said: “They were very brave. Between the four of them they have saved them life.
“She would not have survived very long in the water and it would have been a completely different outcome. It was selfless.”
The teen, who is from Blackpool, was well dressed and is believed to have been partying in the resort before heading towards the cenotaph at high tide at around 2am.
They were seen walking down the steps into the Irish Sea by the cyclist, who had stopped after seeing their handbag lying nearby, Mr Little said.
They shouted, raising the alarm, and, along with the trio from West Yorkshire, threw two life rings to the woman, who is thought to have been around 30 to 40 feet off-shore.
Two rescue teams from the Coastguard were dispatched, while RNLI volunteers from Blackpool launched in two lifeboats after receiving multiple 999 calls at around 2.20am.
Armed police officers, who had been patrolling nearby, were first on the scene, and Coastguard staff cared for the woman, who was shivering and in the early stages of hypothermia, until
paramedics arrived shortly after.
They took them to Blackpool Victoria Hospital, accompanied by a police officer. They have since been discharged.
“If you are in the water, you have 10 to 15 minutes before you succumb to the cold,” Mr Little said. “That's when you drown.”
A spokesperson for the RNLI said: “Both of our D class lifeboats launched to search the area but the casualty was helped to shore just as they reached the scene.”

Prince's family have filed a lawsuit against the hospital that treated their first opioid overdose.
Last week, it was announced by authorities in Minnesota that there would be no criminal charges surrounding the death of the 'Purple Rain' hitmaker, who passed away in April 2016 after an accidental fentanyl overdose at the age of 57.
But on Monday, the late star's family took legal action against Trinity Medical Centre, the Illinois hospital that treated the singer for an opioid overdose the week before their fatal incident.
According to the New York Times newspaper, Prince's family - who filed the suit under the name of a trustee, Michael A. Zimmer - allege in the documents that the singer received "improper medical care" when they arrived for treatment in the early hours of April 15 2016.
The lawsuit also claims that the 'Little Red Corvette' singer's death was a "direct and proximate cause" of the hospital failing to treat their overdose properly, as well as its failure to to investigate the cause and provide proper counselling.
Lawyers for Prince's family, George Loucas and John Goetz, said in a statement to the publication: "What happened to Prince is happening to families across America. The family wishes through its investigation to shed light on this epidemic and how to better the fight to save lives. If Prince's death helps save lives, then all was not lost."
The lawsuit names Trinity Medical Centre along with its parent companies, as well as Nicole F. Mancha, a doctor who provided Prince with care at the hospital, and an unidentified pharmacist or pharmacy employee "that consulted" in the care provided to Prince.
Prince's family is also suing pharmacy chain Walgreens for "dispensing narcotic prescription medications" to the singer for an invalid medical purpose.
The lawsuit comes after Carver County attorney Mark Metz declared the case into Prince's death officially closed.
They said in a statement: "Despite the intensive law enforcement investigation, there is no reliable evidence showing how Prince obtained the counterfeit Vicodin laced with fentanyl, or who else may have had a role in delivering the counterfeit Vicodin to Prince.

We're wrapping up Day 1 of our Week to Wheelin' 2017 Jeep JK project and things are starting to really come together. Today we pulled a bunch of old parts off the 2007 Jeep JK and started prepping the rig for its new digs.
The team pulled both front and rear axles, all the suspension and steering parts, headlights, fenders and bumpers and a slew of odds and ends. Throughout the day the guys installed new bushings all around from Energy Suspension, and Rusty's Off-Road body armor including fender flares, rocker plates and front and rear bumpers.
The rig really is looking swell, and we're right on track to getting this thing dialed by the end of the week. For all you JK folks out there, this build is a great opportunity for you to check out how a well-built JK comes together. Rarely do regular customers get the chance to get up underneath their rig while it's being built to see how every piece of their new off-road vehicle is being installed. Our daily recap videos give you the opportunity to see a sweet build from the ground up, so stay tuned for the rest of the week and be ready to see an epic transformation as we take this little old Jeep from weak to Wheelin.
Record-breaking hurdler, thrower named AAC Athletes of the Week
Following their record-setting weekends, sophomore hurdler Amere Lattin and senior thrower Cameron Cornelius were the Co-Athletes of the Week in the American Athletic Conference. Both earned the distinction by setting season bests and placing in the top 3 for their respective events.
Lattin ran in their toughest meet all season at the Tyson Invitational in Fayettville, Arkansas. At the meet, Grant Holloway of Florida set the fastest time this season, 7.58s, to win the 60m hurdles. This competition resulted in Lattin setting both a new personal best and the No. 3 time in school history.
“It shows that I can compete with the best,” Lattin said. “That I can run with the top in the nation. That guy is predicted to win nationals, but if I keep training the way I'm training, I know I can win it myself.”
Lattin's time moved them from No. 14 to No. 7 in the NCAA, solidifying their place as the top hurdler in the American Conference as the Cougars prepare for the indoor conference. Wondering why this is capitalized
Cornelius has thrown in four events this season and claimed victory each time. Their 18.16m throw at the Howie Ryan Invitational was their top mark this season. The throw is currently No. 38 in the NCAA, leaving Cornelius with work to do if they hope to qualify for nationals.
With the addition of Lattin and Cornelius, the Cougars now have six athletes who have been honored as athletes of the week.
With indoor conference coming up, Cornelius could claim their third indoor title in four years. They have already bested their championship throw from a year ago, 18.11m. They could end up being left behind, however, when others on their team travel to College Station for the Indoor National Championships.

Most of the time, Lonzo Ball's activity on defense leads to good things for the Los Angeles Lakers. But sometimes, the rookie out of UCLA's instincts put them in harm's way. The latter was the case on Monday, when NBA All-Star Victor Oladipo caught the Crown Prince of Chino Hills' body on a vicious putback during the Lakers' game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.
That's the price of defensive effort, albeit one the Purple and Gold would rather Zo pay than not—even if it puts the 20-year-old on a poster.
This essay positions two works of experimental moving-image appropriation art — Bruce Conner's seminal 1958 found-footage film A MOVIE and a recent ‘remake” by the artist and filmmaker Jen Proctor — as models for a hybrid artistic-scholarly form of materialist media theory through which to examine the ways in which media are produced and circulate. The essay argues that both Conner's and Proctor's respective works deploy strategies of appropriation and remix not simply as a form for playful commentary upon contemporary media objects and texts, but crucially as an implicit theoretical framework through which to articulate and expose, on the one hand, the media infrastructures in which the works were made and, on the other, the artists' own labor within these infrastructures.
UKIP leader Paul Nuttall admits on @RadioCityTalk that claims on their website that they lost a close personal friend at Hillsborough are false pic.twitter.com/rjk8kTvgPI — Radio City News (@RadioCityNews) February 14, 2017
Paul Nuttall's press officer Lynda Roughley dives on the grenade and takes the rap for the incorrect Hillsborough website claim:
“I am entirely responsible for the website post regarding Paul's comments about having ‘close friends' who died at Hillsborough. Paul is a man of great integrity and would not say something they knew to be untrue. It's me who has made this mistake, and one I feel absolutely terrible about. I am frankly mortified at the distress this issue has caused Paul and may have caused to anyone involved with the Hillsborough tragedy. I have today offered my resignation, I could not be more sorry.”
Enough to stop it cutting through to voters?
The defending conference champion Buckeyes are looking for a successor to J.T. Barrett. The candidates are redshirted sophomore Dwayne Haskins Jr., senior Joe Burrow and redshirt first-year student Tate Martell. Haskins replaced an injured Barrett to key the win over Michigan last season. Burrow was Barrett's backup in 2016 but broke their hand in preseason and was displaced by Haskins. Martell was a five-star recruit coming out of high school. Coach Urban Meyer has said he'll try to give each QB a post-spring assessment. Burrow is on track to graduate this spring and could play immediately at another school, with two years of eligibility, if they choose to leave.
OTHER QB QUESTIONS
Michigan is awaiting the NCAA ruling on transfer Shea Patterson. They left Mississippi in the wake of an NCAA investigation that landed the Rebels on probation and has appealed for immediate eligibility. If they can't play this fall, coach Jim Harbaugh will choose among Brandon Peters, who played in six games last year, Dylan McCaffrey and Joe Milton. ... The biggest question at Northwestern is how much time Clayton Thorson will miss. They tore their anterior cruciate ligament in the Music City Bowl. They did some throwing this spring, but TJ Green, Aidan Smith and Andrew Marty took the practice snaps. ...
Redshirt first-year student Tanner Morgan has the inside track at Minnesota after throwing for 272 yards and two touchdowns in a spring game that had QBs taking hits. ... Rutgers brings back seven-game starter Gio Rescigno, but first-year student Artur Sitkowski threw for 280 yards in the spring game and could challenge. ... Tyrrell Pigrome and Kasim Hill are both coming off torn ACLs. One of them is expected to be the starter in first-year co-ordinator Matt Canada's pro-style offence. ... Purdue's David Blough (dislocated ankle) and Elijah Sindelar (ACL tear) continue to rehab, leaving redshirt first-year student Nick Sipe and true first-year student Jack Plummer to take most of the practice snaps.
FINALLY, MILES' TURN
Penn State's Miles Sanders was rated the No. 1 running back in the country coming out of high school. Until now, the junior has been overshadowed by Saquon Barkley. Limited to 56 carries for 375 yards through two seasons, Sanders takes over as featured back.
"I can't imagine that there is a better player for Miles to come up under than Saquon Barkley," coach James Franklin said. "Maybe they could have gone to some other schools and played as a true first-year student, but I don't know if their development had been to the point where it is now."
SPARTAN 'D' RATES AN 'A'
Michigan State, which was second nationally in rushing defence and seventh in total defence, appears set to have another strong unit. The Spartans brought back 19 of 22 starters. Coach Mark Dantonio praised the spring performances of defensive linemen Mike Panasiuk, Raequan Williams and Kenny Willekes. Dantonio called Willekes, who had a team-leading seven sacks, a "force."
"Hopefully they are going to get pressure and that's going to be a staple for our football team," they said.
POSITION CHANGE FOR DEITER?
West Division champion Wisconsin, as usual, has an embarrassment of riches on the offensive line. That could allow Michael Deiter, who missed the spring with a leg injury, to go back to their preferred guard spot after playing left tackle in 2017. Deiter projects as an interior lineman in the NFL. Patrick Kasl or Cole Van Lanen would be in line to take over at left tackle.

BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) – Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente has named redshirt first-year student Josh Jackson the starting quarterback for the Hokies' season opener against West Virginia.
Fuente announced the decision Monday.
The coach says they have been pleased with Jackson's consistency, their demeanor, their ability to process information and some of the things the staff gave them to work on through the summer. Fuente added it's time to get the first unit working together.
Jackson beat out junior college transfer AJ Bush and first-year student Hendon Hooker. None of the three has ever taken a snap in an FBS-level game. They say the timing is good because “we'll be able to focus in on getting better and not really worrying about who's going to be in or anything like that.”
The Hokies and Mountaineers open the season on Sept. 3 at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.
“The word that comes to my mind is that he's been the consistent day in and day out the things that we talked about are the 3 criteria that we talked about before when this camp started that we were looking for have them carry the ball the expected outcomes and how we feel and those 3 categories we feel we made the right choice.”
“I think just studying hard and trying to be the best I can be every day and play well and defenses and things like that I think is what gave me a shot at it.”
A cannabis user who was caught with the drug revealed how they have been smoking cannabis as an alternative medication for anxiety and depression.
Chesterfield magistrates' court heard on Thursday, October 5, how Joseph Mellor, 23, of Derby Road, Matlock Bath, was stopped by police due to an unrelated matter when officers had grown concerned about a group acting suspiciously.
Prosecuting solicitor Becky Allsop said: “Mellor was seen by police and stopped due to an unrelated matter because they believed a group had been acting suspiciously.
“He smelled of cannabis and they said they had been smoking a joint and they had a grinder in a rucksack and it had 0.1grammes of cannabis in it.”
Mellor admitted the item found was cannabis and it had been the remnants from an earlier joint.
They told police they have been smoking cannabis for about seven or eight years.
Mellor pleaded guilty to possessing the class B drug after the incident on April 5 and it was accepted that this was for personal use only.
Defence solicitor Bertie Mather said the street value of the amount of cannabis recovered was £1.
They added that Mellor has not been working due to anxiety and depression and the overwhelming effects of their medication had become so stupefying that they had been using cannabis instead.
Magistrates fined Mellor £80 and ordered them to pay a £30 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

At least six dead in Mogadishu restaurant suicide bombing
Mogadishu, Somalia | AFP | At least six people were killed after a suicide car bomber targeted a popular restaurant in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Wednesday evening, security officials said.
“The suicide bomber drove a car loaded with explosives into the building,” said Ali Mohamed, a police official, identifying the target as the Posh Treats restaurant.
Security official Abukar Mohamed said there were “six people killed and several wounded” adding that the operation to clear the building was ongoing late Wednesday night with security forces having cordoned off the area.
Witness Abas Ahmed, who was at another nearby restaurant when the explosion happened, described seeing “the dead bodies of several people and others who were injured.”
The Shabaab, an al-Qaeda aligned militant group that launches regular suicide attacks in the capital against civilian, government and military targets, claimed responsibility for the bombing via its Radio Andalus broadcaster and said that its gunmen had afterwards stormed the restaurant compound.
Islamist attacks often increase in tempo during Ramadan and Wednesday's bombing came in the evening after the breaking of the fast when mosques and restaurants are busy.
Posh Treats, a relatively new restaurant in an affluent part of the capital, is particularly popular with young and diaspora Somalis.
The Shabaab has been fighting for the last decade to overthrow successive internationally-backed governments in Mogadishu and has also launched attacks in Kenya and Uganda, both contributors to a 22,000-strong African Union force in the country.
Although pushed out of the capital in 2011 the group still controls parts of the countryside where a drought threatens to tip into famine this year.

Naira up to N360/$ as CBN injects $210m
By Adaeze Okechukwu
The Naira yesterday appreciated for the first time this week by 54 kobos to N360 per dollar in the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window, even as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) injected $210 million into the foreign exchange market.
Confirming the figures, Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department at the CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, said that the Wholesale sector of the market got another injection of $100 million, just as the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and invisibles sectors each received $55 million.
Data from the Financial Market Dealers Quote (FMDQ) showed that the indicative exchange rate for the I&E window dropped to N360 per dollar yesterday, from N360.54 per dollar on Monday, indicating 54 kobo appreciation in the naira.
The depreciation was in spite of 0.6 percent increase in the I&E window turnover yesterday. The transactions in the window stood at $ 218.25 million, up from $217.16 million recorded on Monday.
Meanwhile, naira remained stable at N363 per dollar yesterday for the ninth consecutive business day in the parallel market.

Hey, did you happen upon a short, tiny and a slightly confused person last week? Chances are that may have been me.
I'm not sure about my height but I assure you the scatterbrain appearance will wear off as I get used to a new job, a new place and new people.
I'm fresh here in Cold Lake, so hey if you're in the market for a new friend I might be your new pal.
I have found a beautiful place to live not too far from the lake, which is exactly what I wanted.
I also have some really helpful colleagues in my new office at the Cold Lake Sun where I'm the new editor.
There's a lot of unfamiliarity around me but to my surprise I'm really enjoying it and that's probably because you guys are really friendly out here.
As I'm tip toeing around my new job and getting to know Cold Lake and the surrounding area, feel free to reach out to me at the Sun.
I will be going around and setting up professional coffee dates and getting to know all of you.
In the meantime, feel free to pop by the office and say hi or shoot me an e-mail with a story tip at mlulla@postmedia.com.
Tuesday - Thundery showers mainly over northern and eastern Singapore in the afternoon.
Wednesday - Late morning and early afternoon thundery showers.

Oh Dear, This Benoni Restaurant Is Offering Free Blow Jobs For Father's Day
Of all the shooters one could offer for free on Father's Day, a Benoni-based restaurant chose that one.
Advertising a “Great Rib & Prawn Combo Deal for only R89”, Tsunami Beach Restaurant / Bar offered a “FREE Blow Job shooter” as well.
We couldn't help but share the special with y'all, just in case you find yourself that side of the world this weekend:
Craig T with the live music – don't miss out!
Take a look at this thread of comments on the post:
Oh dear.
Are we dealing with a mild case of knowing your audience, or were no f*cks given when the idea popped into someone's mind and the whole office laughed hysterically, just to avoid a debate on the pros and cons of being appropriate?
We don't really care, because we would rather go full class and sit down for a superbly cooked steak with a complimentary Stella Pint at HQ.
With performances by Jerry Liberty as well as giveaways throughout the day, including an all-inclusive trip to the Nedbank Golf Challenge, you wouldn't want to have lunch anywhere else this Sunday for Father's Day.
Doesn't that sound better? Indeed.
You can read more about HQ's Father's Day plans here, and let's try to leave anything sexual out of it.

Mohamed Anwar Sadat laughs on the other end of the phone at the mere mention of Egypt's upcoming elections.
“The election is over, it's all about the turnout,” says the former parliamentarian, who is the nephew and namesake of late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated while in office in 1981.
The third device, meanwhile, is Fi's first truly low-cost phone. The Moto G6 is priced at $199 and promises a decent amount of power for the price through its 5.7-inch screen, portrait mode photos and 26 hours of claimed battery life.
You can pre-order the G6 today. The G7 and V35 will be available in June, but there's an incentive to wait: you'll get $50 in Fi service credits if you buy one of them in advance. No, these new handsets won't satisfy anyone who wants to use Galaxy S9 with the service, but this at least provides some honest-to-goodness variety.

A powerful winter storm is expected to pummel Southern California this week, increasing the risk of flash flooding and debris flow in burn areas, forecasters said.
Rain likely will arrive in the region Tuesday afternoon and continue through Thursday, with two to five inches in the coastal and valley areas and up to 10 inches in the foothills and mountains, said National Weather Service specialist Stuart Seto.
“This is the biggest storm of the winter season, so we could definitely see problems even outside of the burn areas,” they said. “We're alerting everybody to be prepared for water streams in any low-lying areas.”
According to the weather service, the most critical time for recent burn areas will be from early Wednesday into Wednesday night when steady rain rates could jump above a half-inch per hour.
The agency, however, held off Monday on issuing any flash-flood warnings, opting to wait for additional computer models.
The city of Anaheim, meanwhile, was keeping an eye on burn areas impacted by the Canyon Fire 2, which scorched more than 9,200 acres in October.
Anaheim Fire & Rescue spokesperson Sgt. Daron Wyatt said the city prepared diligently for a strong storm in January and had no problems.
“With that said, our Emergency Management people are constantly engaged with others at the operational area level so we will know if there are watches or warnings we need to be aware of,” they said, in an email. “So far there are none.”
Santa Barbara County, where 21 people were killed in the Montecito mudslides this year, has issued a pre-evacuation advisory for Tuesday night through Thursday in the areas below the Thomas, Sherpa, Whittier and Alamo fires.
Unfortunately, the wet weather will do little to make up for what has been a dry winter.
As of Oct. 1, Downtown Los Angeles, for example, was nine inches below its normal rainfall totals for this season. Even with an extra two inches expected this week, the area will still be well below normal, they said.
“We're getting a lot of rainfall but the bad thing is that it's coming in such a short period that a lot of it is runoff,” they said.
The rain will ease late Thursday with a few possible scattered showers on Friday before gradual warming and sunshine this weekend.
Mountain areas in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties could see snow on Thursday and Friday, according to weather reports.
Ubuntu devs are currently working on removing the Python 2 interpreter from the Ubuntu repositories as end of life was announced upstream for the year 2020.
Canonical's Matthias Klose informed the Ubuntu community in a mailing list announcement last week that getting the Python 2 interpreter demoted from Ubuntu has been an ongoing task for the last few releases, and that Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark) is the first to ship with a Desktop ISO image that doesn't contain Python2.
However, the next step for them is to prepare to move the Python 2 packages to the "universe" repository in the next few months before the release of the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) operating system in April 2018. While Python 2 will be supported for only two more years, Ubuntu 18.04 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release supported for five years, until 2023.
"Getting Python2 demoted has been an ongoing task for several Ubuntu releases, now finally having a desktop CD image in Ubuntu 17.10 which ships without a Python2 interpreter," wrote Matthias Klose. "The next step is to get Python2 demoted to universe, before finally in the far future it can be removed entirely from the archive."
About 35 issues need to be resolved before demoting Python 2 to universe
Before demoting the Python 2 interpreter to the "universe" repositories, the Ubuntu developers need to fix about 35 issues, ensuring the OpenStack package builds against Python 3, as well as any other remaining packages that still rely on Python 2. Also, they need to remove or update any Python 2 package in the Ubuntu seeds.
Other than that, they also need to make sure no new Python 2 packages land in the main software repositories of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver). Once Python 2 will be available in the "universe" repo, users will need to enable it if they want to install any software package dependent on the Python 2 interpreter.
According to Matthias Klose, it's unlikely that Python 2 will be demoted in time for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but the goal right now is to ensure at least OpenStack is using Python 3. It remains to be seen if they will manage to achieve this massive goal until the release of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on April 26, 2018. Fingers crossed!

According to Mt. Juliet police Capt. Tyler Chandler, detour routes will be in place, and officers will be on hand to watch the traffic situation. Motorists traveling north on Mt. Juliet Road are encouraged to avoid the railroad track crossing by detouring down Industrial Drive, Clemmons Road or Golden Bear Gateway.
The event ‘Ram Mandir Samasya aur Samadhan' was organised by various outfits under the Akhil Bhartiya Samagra Vichar Manch and was held at Public Administration department of Lucknow University. Apart from IPS officer Surya Kumar Shukla, some Hindutva activists and members of Muslim wing of RSS were also present at the event.
IPS officer Surya Kumar Shukla in their defence has said their presence at the event was misinterpreted and the clip was selectively made viral
A senior police officer on Friday raked up a controversy after a video of him, in which they are heard saying that they will build the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya as soon as possible, went viral on social media. The officer heading the Uttar Pradesh Home Guard is captured taking a pledge to work for the early construction of Ram Mandir. In the 21-second video, Surya Kumar Shukla, Director General, Home Guard Headquarters, along with other people is seen taking a pledge to build the temple. “Aaj is karyakram ke dauran, hum sab ye sankalp lete hain ke jaldse jald Ram Mandir ka bhavya nirmaan ho… Jai Shri Ram (Today, at this programme, we take this pledge to build the Ram temple as soon as possible… Jai Shri Ram).”
The video, apparently, was shot during an event at Lucknow University on January 28. The event ‘Ram Mandir Samasya aur Samadhan' was organised by various outfits under the Akhil Bhartiya Samagra Vichar Manch and was held at Public Administration department of Lucknow University. Apart from Surya Kumar Shukla, some Hindutva activists and members of Muslim wing of RSS were also present at the event. After the video created a social media buzz, the Uttar Pradesh government an inquiry into the matter.
Howwever, the IPS officer in their defence has said that their presence at the event was misinterpreted and the clip was selectively made viral. “As a responsible officer, we cannot say or do anything like this. It is being shown as though we are going for a forcible construction of a mandir. This is a misinterpretation,” Shukla told reporters. They also said that the video was shot to create an atmosphere of communal harmony and not for Ram Mandir construction.
Alvaro Morata: Six things the Spaniard will bring to Manchester United
A lot of names have been touted in the last couple of days to be the new face of Manchester United's attack since the release of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. If recent reports are to be believed, Spanish striker Alvaro Morata will be the man leading the Old Trafford outfit from the front come next season. It appears that in choosing the Spaniard, Jose Mourinho would be going with a player they know well and whose abilities they completely believe. Today, I give you six sterling attributes the twenty-four-year-old will add to the English club.
1 Morata is not afraid to play for the biggest teams in the world. Their spells with Juventus and Real Madrid have proven them to be an effective goal scorer at the highest level. He's shown to be the go-to man for big occasions as they scored Juve's only goal in their 1-3 UCL Final loss to Barcelona in 2015 and also scored an extra-time Coppa Italia winner against Milan in their final game for the Italian club.
2 The young lad has a winner's mindset, a trait that the United hierarchy will love to see in their leading man. At the age of twenty-four Morata has already won two UCL titles and four league titles amongst others. He'll be coming to win more titles for Man Utd.
3. He's 6'2”, very physical and deceptively fast! Morata is a very dynamic striker and will offer different options to their new club. Their 6'2” frame means they can produce the physicality needed in the EPL to fend off defenders and hold up play. Being tricky-fast means they can exploit space on the counter-attack and run in behind defenses. Their great first-touch skill can take on defenders and can bring others into play by providing assists.
4. Morata is a great striker. In Madrid, with less playing time, they scored more goals than Frenchman Karim Benzema – the team's main striker. They were only outscored in the team by Cristiano Ronaldo. The Spaniard averaged 1 goal every 89 minutes, scored 14 goals in 18 starts in all competitions and added 7 as a substitute. They also chipped in 5 assists.
5. Age advantage. Potential is part of the prize Manchester United will pay for. Silverware, pedigree, big-game experience at big clubs, but never has they been a main striker for these clubs. In fact, they have never played more than 43 per cent of the total minutes possible in a top-flight campaign. Now, Morata is at the right age to take up this responsibility and with Jose Mourinho as their coach, the man who gave them their debut as a teenager, Manchester United fans should expect a lot of fruitful years ahead.
6. Familiar manager and a Spanish-speaking contingent. Morata will settle very quickly with their ‘best coach in the world' who's Portuguese, and a contingent that feels like home. The striker will get down into the flow of how thigs work at United very quickly and well.
The acquisition of Alvaro Morata will no doubt soften the blow of losing Ibrahimovic and if Manchester United decides to go after Torino's attacker – Andrea Belotti – as rumours say, Man Utd fans should forget about the low goal conversion rate that undid the club last season. It would seem that Jose Mourinho wants to challenge fully and on all fronts, next season. Swedish defender, Victor Lindelof of Benfica, is also expected to join the Red Devils anytime soon.

NEW DELHI (AP) - An Indian company that is partnering with the Trump Organization on an office tower project has been accused of running an elaborate real estate swindle that cheated investors out of nearly $150 million, according to complaints filed with Indian authorities.
Ramesh Sanka, the former CEO of the real estate firm IREO, said in the documents obtained by The Associated Press that they saw "various acts of cheating, fraud and misappropriation of money" at their onetime employer that created "huge wrongful gains" for the company's managing director and their associates.
The documents make no mention of the Trump Organization, and focus largely on two real estate deals that began years before the organization signed a 2016 agreement with IREO to partner on an office tower in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi.
Sanka quit the company in late 2016 "because I was increasingly uncomfortable with the way in which IREO's business was being conducted," according to a police complaint they filed in late February in Gurgaon, a sprawling and ever-growing satellite city of New Delhi.
In a statement at the time, Donald Trump Jr. said: "IREO is truly a fantastic group and we are looking forward to pushing the boundaries together to create what will soon be one of the most exciting and sought-after commercial towers in India."
The Trump Organization has licensing agreements with all its Indian business partners, who build the properties and acquire the Trump name in exchange for a fee.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The AP.
Sanka's accusations were first reported by The Washington Post.
Their statements form the basis for an Indian police complaint filed by two large international investors, the UK-based Children's Investment Fund Foundation, a philanthropy founded by British billionaire Chris Hohn, and New York-based Axon partners.
The complaint accuses Lalit Goyal, IREO's managing director, of being at the heart of the alleged fraud, with Sanka's statement saying they "was the final decision maker on all matters" at IREO.
The documents focus on two deals, one for 78 acres in the small town of Bhiwadi, about 30 miles from Gurgaon, and another for 37 acres of land in Gurgaon.
Through a series of sub-deals, the documents say much of the investment money was channeled away from real estate developments and to Goyal and people close to him.
The complaint filed by Axon and Children's Investment Fund Foundation says the Bhiwadi deal was "nothing but a sham planned by Lalit Goyal in conspiracy with various other accused persons to misappropriate about $62 million."
A March 9 letter from Hohn and Dinakar Singh, Axon's managing partner, say Goyal "and related entities appear to have diverted funds" worth nearly $150 million, and that they have seen evidence "suggesting there may have been wrongdoing and theft well beyond these amounts."
The letter, obtained by The AP, was sent to IREO investors.
Goyal and other top IREO officials could not be reached for comment.
The Children's Investment Fund Foundation and Axon had originally filed suit in Mauritius, where the IREO investment funds were incorporated, trying to pressure IREO to manage them better.
In February, before accusations of mismanagement had shifted to accusations of fraud, Goyal told Barron's magazine that IREO carefully watched over investor money and that that "we are very hopeful they will get much more than what they invested back."
Donald Trump Jr. recently finished a trip through India, promoting properties that have licensed the family name.
The Trump Organization has five projects in India, making it the brand's largest market outside the United States. One complex is already open in the central Indian city of Pune, with other developments in various stages of construction in Kolkata and Mumbai, and two in Gurgaon.

My Red Light aims to become the Netherlands's first official cooperative of prostitutes, where they have a say about their work schedule and the design of the rooms, and even train for managerial positions.

“One of the things we have changed in recent years is that instead of talking about what is good for prostitutes, we have started to talk to them,” said Jasper Karman, spokesperson for Amsterdam's mayor, Eberhard van der Laan.
Not everyone likes the idea, among them some fellow prostitutes who are suspicious of the city's involvement. But My Red Light has drawn support from unlikely quarters, including award-winning Dutch furniture and interior designers, who have helped outfit the rooms.
Sitting on a blue vinyl mattress on a stage, a glowing red bathtub in one corner and a Richard Hutten red leather stool by the window, Lyle Muns, a male prostitute who is on the board of My Red Light, explained recently that the project, which opened in May, was still a work in progress.
“I am really passionate about this project and I believe it could work, but it is also an experiment, right?” they said. “We haven't succeeded until My Red Light is run mostly by sex workers and we are making a profit.”
The concept of My Red Light was first discussed in Amsterdam as far back as 2007, when the city tried to combat crime in the neighborhood through the 1012 Project, a reference to the central red-light district's postal code.
Authorities eventually shut down about 125 windows where prostitutes displayed themselves, leaving many feeling they were being pushed out so that the city could gentrify the historic area, which claims some of Amsterdam's most valuable real estate.

Protests led to regular meetings between the city and activists, and then to a feasibility study that eventually gave birth to My Red Light. The city helped a social investment fund buy four buildings that it now rents to My Red Light.

As soon as the fund bought the buildings late last year, all ties to the city were cut. Currently, My Red Light officially operates as a foundation. “We hope in a year or two we'll be run entirely by sex workers or ex-sex workers,” said Justine Le Clercq, a spokesperson for My Red Light.
When My Red Light starts to turn a profit, they said, it plans to invest the money in workshops and other programs for the prostitutes, like business training and language classes.
The group has also been discussing investing in something like workers' compensation insurance so that prostitutes who get sick or injured can get financial support.
When it came to the design of the interiors, My Red Light argued that prostitutes deserve the same quality of working environment as chief executives and celebrities. So they engaged the award-winning Dutch furniture company Lensvelt, which helped furnish the V.I.P. lounge at the Schiphol airport.
Lensvelt chose the interior design architect Janpaul Scholtmeijer, of Vens Architecten. Their only strict directive was to make all the design decisions along with a group of about five prostitutes.

Left to their own devices, Mr. Scholtmeijer joked, they would have covered the rooms in velvet, but the prostitutes rolled their eyes at their impracticality.
“In the end, what was most important for the sex workers was that the spaces were easy to clean and hygienic,” Mr. Scholtmeijer said.

The prostitutes also requested that a small locker be built within the bed frame with a slit to insert cash. There was a lot of discussion as to where to place panic buttons.

Three months after its debut, My Red Light is slowly trying to gain the trust of the other brothels and build a community of prostitutes.
About 75 percent of all prostitutes are from Eastern or Central Europe, outside the European Union, with the remaining 25 percent Dutch, or from South or Central America, according to the mayor's office. This complicates efforts toward cooperation.
Heleen Driessen, who has worked in Amsterdam as a counselor and advocate for prostitutes for the last two decades, said there were “often issues between the sex workers because they are different nationalities and don't speak the same language, or still need to gain confidence in My Red Light or have the mentality of, ‘I just want to go home at six or go home to Ecuador in a few months and not get involved in these kinds of projects.'”

My Red Light has attracted criticism from some members of the city's only official network of prostitutes, Proud, which offers everything from language workshops to pro bono lawyer consultations. Some members even threatened to sue My Red Light after not getting the management positions they said they were promised. My Red Light responded that the women had marks on their records, and that if it hired them, My Red Light would lose its license under municipal regulations.
“It's just another brothel,” said Yvette Luhrs, a spokesperson for Proud. “It isn't really owned or run by sex workers. Also the media spectacle around it has been derogatory to other brothels.”
They said that what prostitutes really wanted was to be allowed to run their own business out of their own homes without being bothered by the police. The city says that in order to control human trafficking and protect the well being of independent prostitutes, the police have to make regular checks.
“You lose grip on the whole scene if you allow sex workers to work out of homes, unregulated like that,” said Jolanda de Boer, a public prosecutor who has been involved in human trafficking cases in Amsterdam for the last decade.
They said they believed that the city truly wanted to help protect and support prostitutes, but that after 10 years of overseeing so many cases of abused prostitutes, they are skeptical that prostitution can be normalized.
“Stop saying that it's the oldest profession in the world,” they said. “Women and the disadvantaged have always been exploited, and we should not accept that.”

Ms. Le Clercq, the Red Light spokesperson, said: “There are, of course, connections between human trafficking and prostitution, but there are also connections between crime and the flower industry and crime and building houses. There are really people who want to do this work, so just let them do it.”
A special service of thanksgiving at Lincoln Cathedral will be a highlight of National Carers Week on Sunday June 18.
The service is organised by Lincolnshire Carers Service and Carers FIRST. Everyone is welcome at the service, which will celebrate the work of family carers of all ages, including children and young carers.
This year, the national awareness week focuses on building carer friendly communities that support carers who look after a relative or friend, while recognising that they are individuals with needs of their own.
In Lincolnshire there are an estimated 84,000 carers looking after a relative or friend who is a due to ill health, physical or mental illness, disability, frailty, or addiction cannot manage without their support.
County councillor Patricia Bradwell, executive councillor for Adult Care, said: “Carers provide vital support to those they care for, and it's important that they can access support and consider their own wellbeing alongside their caring role.
“The Lincolnshire Carers Service helps 8,000 people already. There are many more carers who don't necessarily want formal services, but we can all help by improving our understanding so communities can support carers better too.”
Malcolm Ryan, Lincolnshire operational services manager for Carers FIRST, said: “Three in five of us will be carers in our lifetime and we need to build communities that make carers' lives easier. For example an employer creating carer friendly policies allowing for some flexibility due to an employee's caring role, or a GP practice offering alternative appointment times to carers unable to attend due to their caring responsibilities.”
The Lincolnshire Carers Service is funded by Lincolnshire County Council and delivered by the council's Customer Service Centre with charity Carers FIRST.
• If you're looking after a friend or relative, you can talk to someone about your situation and discuss what support you may need. Lincolnshire County Council's Customer Service Centre is the first point of contact for all general enquiries regarding support for carers - call 01522 782224 or email CarersService@Lincolnshire.gov.uk for further information.

Following a shocking defeat on the last play of the game last week against Binghamton, the Elmira Express varsity football team took out its frustrations against Ithaca on Friday.
Senior running back Airihk Ashley rushed for 113 yards and three touchdowns on 12 carries to lead an overwhelming rushing attack as the visiting Express rolled past Ithaca, 61-6, at Moresco Stadium. Elmira has owned the Little Red since becoming one football team, holding a 7-0 record with an average of about 57 points per game on offense.
The Express (2-4) trail Binghamton by a game for the first seed in the four-team Section 4 Class AA tournament. Ithaca (0-6) needs a victory against Horseheads in the final week of the regular season and then hope to get in with a tiebreaker.
Unstoppable: Following a 44-yard kickoff return to start the game, the Express wasted little time taking the lead as Ashley went 24 yards to the end zone on the first play from scrimmage. Through the first quarter, Elmira's shortest run which did not end with a touchdown was seven yards.
The Express outgained Ithaca, 192-43, on the ground in the first half and finished the game with a 314-63 advantage. Max Temple added 65 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries and Charlie Mahon added 48 yards and a score on seven carries for Elmira. Daryl Savage had a 26-yard TD run on their only carry of the game and Nate Latshaw also added a score on the ground.
Boothe hurt: Ithaca quarterback Mason Boothe has been a bright spot in a difficult year for the Little Red, but the junior was shaken up following a big hit in the third quarter, left the game and did not return. Boothe dropped back to pass and was leveled as the ball came out. Elmira's Max Temple made the interception on the play and Boothe stayed on the ground for several minutes before being helped to the sideline.
Boothe finished with 108 yards passing, completing 6 of 10 passes including a 39-yard touchdown pass to Louis Webster, who finished with a game-high 61 receiving yards. Webster replaced Boothe at quarterback in the third quarter.
Bruising defense: The Express held Ithaca running back Mike Jones to 44 yards on 16 carries while pressuring Boothe for most of the game. The Express defense finished with five sacks, including 2.5 by junior Devin Hoskins. Also helping in the pass rush were Mahon and Nate Latshaw.
Good sports: The Express scored three times in the third quarter with backups playing to take a 61-6 lead. Elmira eventually drove inside the Ithaca 5-yardline in the fourth before taking knees with 6:30 left in regulation.

Automotive performance entrepreneur and long-time racer Kyle Tucker announced today their acquisition of the driveline division of C&R Racing (South), known for performance-quality radiators, transmissions, and driveline components. Located in Mooresville, North Carolina, with headquarters in Indianapolis, C&R Racing (South) is a division of PWR Performance Products. Tucker is the owner and co-founder of automotive aftermarket chassis and suspension parts manufacturer Detroit Speed Inc., an industry leader for nearly two decades.
Now under the same leadership as the trusted Detroit Speed family of products and services, C&R Racing's driveline division has been renamed GearFX Driveline, LLC, effective immediately. While holding the same ownership and high-quality standards of the Detroit Speed brand, GearFX will operate independently and retain its original C&R Racing staff.
“Throughout my relationship with C&R Racing, they have proven their reliability and commitment to quality through their long-time racing expertise,” said Kyle Tucker, president of Detroit Speed. “Now, I'm excited to bring that knowledge and racing technology to the street market.”
GearFX will strive to produce the industry's quietest, high-quality rear gears by offering dyno break-in and testing them for the highest performance and customer satisfaction. The company also handpicks each component based on track-tested quality and function and assigns a unique serial number and “birth certificate” to each new unit. This one-of-a-kind origin-labeling process allows the customer to know exactly when and by whom the component was built.
While maintaining the foundation of service, quality, and people that C&R Racing built, GearFX plans to expand its current menu of services by offering REM polishing; dyno break-in; and quiet, durable gears. The company also has plans to expand its reach into the off-road market and other new areas of the industry.
“Detroit Speed has always been known for pushing the envelope in the high-performance aftermarket,” said Jeff “Fuzzy” Horton, general manager and technical director for GearFX. “This new combination of driveline specialization is just another great addition to the Detroit Speed arsenal, and we couldn't be more excited to be a part of it.”
To see Kyle talk about the acquisition and what their plans are for GearFX, check out this video on YouTube: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urj3iIctTas&feature=youtu.be.
AUSTIN // State Representative Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, filed a House resolution urging Texans to stop using the Chilean flag emoji as a substitute for the (admittedly similar) Texas flag. “Be it resolved that the 85th Legislature of the State of Texas hereby reject the notion that the Chilean flag, although it is a nice flag, can in any way compare to or be substituted for the official state flag of Texas,” the resolution concluded.
HOUSTON // Cypress resident Ross Lebeau, 24, spent three days behind bars after they were arrested for drug possession during a traffic stop. What police believed to be a half-pound of methamphetamine, however, turned out to be kitty litter. Lebeau told KTRK that they were keeping a sock stuffed with the suspicious substance in their car to prevent the windows from fogging up. Before the mix-up was discovered, the Harris County Sheriff's Office bragged in a press release that it had scored a “significant narcotics arrest … [that] may have kept our children and our loved ones free from being introduced to drugs.”
SAN MARCOS // Nearly 300 Texas blind salamanders disappeared from a lab at the San Marcos Aquatic Resources Center during two separate break-ins. The endangered critters are kept in the facility as a backup that could someday replenish the wild population, which is limited to a 25-mile radius within the Edwards Aquifer. Center director Ken Ostrand told the Austin American-Statesman that the thief left no trace, adding that they were mystified as to why anyone would steal exotic animals. “Why would someone want tiger penis? Why would someone want shark fin? I don't know,” Ostrand said.

COLLEGE STATION // The Spirit of Texas Festival broke a Guinness World Record for the biggest batch of chili con carne ever cooked, according to KBTX. At 4,800 pounds, the steaming vat of chili was double the weight of the previous winner, which was cooked in Minto, North Dakota, in 2013. Plans to use the chili to break a second record for the world's largest Frito pie were dashed due to rain.

Six cops from Bulawayo allegedly gagged a commuter omnibus owner, sjamboked them and stomped on their private parts while they were handcuffed after accusing them of touting at Egodini bus terminus.
So vicious was the assault, a court heard, that Malvin Ncube (26) sustained serious injuries on their private parts, and had to urinate through a tube for three weeks.
The police officers' trial could not be concluded yesterday after their lawyers failed to turn up.
Prichard Moyo (27), Fortune Phiri (28), Jonathan Musonga (37), Stafford Ncube (26), Collen Sibanda (25) and Melody Ncube (29), who are all stationed at Bulawayo Central Police and are attached to the Crime Protection Unit (CPU) yesterday appeared before magistrate Ms Sithembiso Ncube facing a charge of assault.
They pleaded not guilty and refused to speak further saying they were waiting for legal representation.
Ms Ncube adjourned the court at 10AM and ended up postponing the matter to today as the cops' lawyers did not show up.
The court heard that the cops stripped Ncube of their T-shirt, stuffed it in their mouth and took turns to assault them while they were handcuffed.
Prosecuting, Mr Jeremiah Mutsindikwa said the police officers arrested Ncube at Egodini terminus at around 10AM sometime in May last year.
They allegedly handcuffed them and led them to Bulawayo Central Police Station.
At the station, the police officers allegedly immobilised Ncube by putting an iron rod between limbs and started assaulting them several times with a sjambok.
They also allegedly slapped and punched him.
“On their way to the station, there was an altercation between the complainant and Moyo. Moyo pulled them by the cuffs and they dug into their wrists. At the station, Moyo and Phiri led Ncube to the CPU office. They took turns to slap him. Moyo stripped them of their T-shirt and slapped them on the back,” said Mr Mutsindikwa.
“They took an iron rod and put it between their elbows under their knees while they were still handcuffed. Phiri held their legs while Moyo hit them on the buttocks and private parts with a sjambok. The complainant screamed for help but Phiri reached for their T-shirt and stuffed it into their mouth, slapped them and pressed on the T-shirt with their foot.”
They said Melody entered the room and instructed Phiri and Moyo to assault Ncube again in their presence.
“They swapped the iron rod between their elbows with a baton and slapped them hard on their back. Stafford and Sibanda got into the room and joined in the free-for-all assault. Complainant was detained until 5PM when they paid a $10 fine,” said Mr Mutsindikwa.
They said Ncube reported the matter at Pumula Police station and was referred to Mpilo Central Hospital for treatment. The Chronicle
Enugu Disco clears doubts over smart pole prepaid meters
The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) yesterday began the sensitisation of its customers in the South-East on the allegation that the currently being deployed smart pole prepaid meters were configured to rip off them customers.
The Guardian learnt that customers across the zone have complained that the smart pole prepaid meters have compounded their energy challenges as they are said to run faster than the ones deployed when the company was managed by the Federal Government, thus increasing their monthly consumption.
The interactive session, held in Enugu and Abakaliki, had in attendance customers of EEDC, including those whose meters have been installed, representatives of various professional bodies and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).
The customers were presented with a live demonstration of the metering process, integrity of the meter, meter tampering, meter acquisition processes, tips on energy management and process of online recharge of the meter.
EEDC's meter engineer, Christopher Chukwu, stressed that the meters were not programmed to run fast, as being peddled; rather they encouraged customers to imbibe the culture of energy management and always switch off appliances when not in use and always go for energy-saving appliances.
They said that meters are subjected to various regulatory checks and certification by respective government agencies like NEMSA before they get to them, adding that EEDC “does not and will not manipulate the functionality of their meters.”
“These are smart meters manufactured abroad and we do not have the intelligence, technology and know-how to manipulate them as that may lead to damage of the meters.
“It should be noted that EEDC is committed to metering its customers and closing the inherited metering gap. We have gone far in metering our maximum demand customers and currently metering our individual/residential customers,” they said.
There was also a demonstration on the integrity of the meters, when displayed and used to record the energy consumption of three different bulbs in less than 30 minutes and they recorded a particular consumption.
EEDC's head of Communications, Emeka Ezeh, stated that the sensitisation was aimed at clearing the insinuations bothering on the integrity and performance of the meters, adding that it was also to clear the air on the process of acquiring and recharging the meters.
“This customer sensitisation exercise will continue across the remaining parts of the EEDC's franchise area. This is also aimed at clearing the air of some unfounded insinuations bothering on the integrity and performance of the meters being made by some individuals and groups; and also educating the customers on the functionality of the meters, as well as processes of acquiring and recharging the meters”, they added.

Preparation For The Closure Of Abuja Airport Begins
The Minister of State, Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, will on Thursday engage the Industry's Stakeholders on issues arising from the proposed closure of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, for repairs on its runway.
Sirika disclosed this in a statement issued by Mr James Odaudu, Deputy Director, Press and Public Affairs, Ministry of Transportation on Monday in Abuja.
They said the meeting was a follow-up to the decision of the Federal Government to temporarily shut down operations at the airport for six weeks in February and March.
According to the minister, the Stakeholders' Forum will afford them with the opportunity to officially inform the sector's players of the decision.
“It is also to brief them on efforts being made to ensure that the use of the Kaduna International Airport as an alternative during the six-Week closure of the Abuja Airport is seamless and hitch-free. “The Stakeholders will also be expected to make their contributions and key into the plans to make their operations during the period less problematic,” they said.
Sirika, however, emphasised that the Forum was in line with government's belief in ventilating people's opinions in formulating and executing policies.
They said that government was aware of the likely high level of discomfort and inconvenience the proposed closure of the airport would cause air transport passengers, airline operators and other service providers.
They explained that the decision was informed by safety and security concerns, saying that government would rather lose billions of dollars in revenue than to risk lives.
The minister also disclosed that the ministry would invite other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as security agencies and the Kaduna State Government who were expected to play roles during the six-week period.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the minister had in December revealed government plans to shut down the airport while briefing newsmen on its efforts toward addressing the challenges of aviation fuel.

Referring to their questioning, Monday evening, under warning of prosecution for receiving large favors from business people in Israel and abroad, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said, Monday afternoon, "Wait with the festivities. Don't be in a rush."
Speaking to their critics at the start of the meeting of their Likud Party's Knesset faction, Netanyahu continued, "There won't be anything because there isn't anything. You will continue to spread balloons filled with hot air and we will continue to lead the state of Israel."

Salah runs riot as Liverpool hit five past Roma
Mohamed Salah scored two brilliant goals and set up two more as Liverpool beat Roma 5-2 in a remarkable Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield on Tuesday.
Salah's stunning brace separated the sides at half-time, and the Egyptian created further goals for Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, with the latter then making it five.
However, an Edin Dzeko goal and a late Diego Perotti penalty gave Roma some hope ahead of next Wednesday's return.

Officials with the Thibodaux Police Department have announced the arrest of a man for sexual battery of a juvenile.
Police Chief Bryan Zeringue says David Thibodaux, 57, of Thibodaux, is being held at the Lafourche Parish Detention Center on a $250,000 bond.
Officials say last Friday, June 9, it was reported to Thibodaux officials that a pre-teen juvenile has been sexually abused over a period of time. An investigation was launched, and it was discovered that Thibodaux reportedly sexually assaulted the victim on numerous occasions.
Officers then executed an arrest warrant for Thibodaux at their home and took them into custody on Tuesday, June 13.
Due to the victim's age and the nature of the crime, no further details will be released about the incident.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German automaker Daimler AG says its net profit rose 24 percent to a record 10.9 billion euros ($13.5 billion) last year, helped by strong sales of its Mercedes-Benz SUVs and new E-Class luxury sedan.
The Stuttgart-based company gave a measured earnings outlook for this year, saying that operating earnings would be of "the magnitude of the previous year" instead of increasing.
Daimler said its earnings would be burdened by "very high" expenditure on new models and technologies such as battery-powered cars. Like others, the company also has to prepare for autonomous driving and a shift to transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing through smartphone apps.
Revenue rose 7 percent on the year to 164.3 billion euros and management proposed its highest dividend to date, 3.65 per share.
“Yes,” they said. “We can help with that.”

Right now, there is no N.C.A.A. for esports, even though competitive gaming is expanding quickly on college campuses. Last year, 40 colleges — a group that includes universities large (Utah) and small (DigiPen Institute of Technology) — established “varsity” esports programs, meaning they hired a full-time coach and staff members, designated an official arena, began recruiting prospective players and even awarded esports scholarships. To these universities, esports programs are as legitimate as the football team. Robert Morris University Illinois, for one, provides updates about its esports teams on its official athletic website.
But as colleges and even power conferences like the Big Ten and the Pacific-12 soften their stances toward accepting esports into a once-exclusive athletic fraternity, the primary organizing body for collegiate sports, the N.C.A.A., has lagged behind. It has yet to rule whether esports properly fits within its obdurate (some might say antiquated) framework for amateurism, equal opportunity and fair play, or if esports should even qualify as a sport.
For now, an N.C.A.A. spokesperson said only that the organization had held discussions on esports, and planned to have more.
In the meantime, opportunistic grass-roots groups are racing to fill the void. One, the National Association of Collegiate Esports, began last summer as a membership consortium for six varsity programs to organize and establish ground rules. In a year, it has ballooned to 42 members, said Michael Brooks, a former N.A.I.A. administrator who joined the N.A.C.E. as its first executive director.
Schrodt's Electronic Gaming Federation has focused on corralling the less official club programs around the country, in the hopes that when they one day gain varsity status, their colleges will affiliate with their effort. Nearly 70 programs orbit around Schrodt's organizational vision, including those at Georgia Tech, Texas, Harvard and Columbia.
Their plan, sooner rather than later, is to introduce a national tournament, something like a March Madness for esports, replete with sponsors, television airtime and crowded arenas. It all sounds like the well-trod N.C.A.A. formula, just without the organization itself. And if the trend continues, some warn, it might be too late for the N.C.A.A. to get in the game.
“I generally believe they'll get beaten to the punch,” said Kevin Knocke, vice president at ReKT Global, an esports infrastructure services company. “I think there's a real possibility of the N.C.A.A. missing the boat here.”

If the picture sounds antithetical to the bureaucratic images of the N.C.A.A., it is intended as such. Schrodt's vibe, and their vision, are primarily aimed at aligning with, and looking out for, students' interests. Their company hopes to propel the momentum of popular student-run esports clubs to the point that their colleges have to pay attention.
Competitive gaming on college campuses is not new. For years, companies like the Collegiate Starleague and Tespa — originally the Texas Esports Association — catered to self-organized groups as online hubs to compete in tournaments with other like-minded groups, or even season-long competitions. “We just wanted to create some sort of community on campus where gamers could get together and compete,” the Tespa co-founder Adam Rosen said. But over time, “these events grew and grew.”
As the events became more professionalized, drawing crowds and significant prize money, university administrations began taking the players and the teams that participated more seriously. That changed the tenor of college esports, but the framework to support a nationwide network had not arrived yet.
“There was just a lot of confusion about when leagues were starting, when competitions were going to take place,” said Bryan L. Curtis, an assistant athletic director at Columbia College of Missouri, one of the five founding members of the N.A.C.E.
Chris Allison, the coach of the esports team at Southwest Baptist University in Missouri, said there were times when they would spend days organizing a match, only to be undercut when the opposing team failed to show.

“That was truly frustrating,” they said. “A governing body really helps to provide some stability, so at least when you prepare for a match, that match is going to happen.”
But any governing body would be confronted immediately by a multitude of other considerations, including sponsorship, recruiting and eligibility issues but also liability and licensing, since the individual games are owned by corporations like Riot Games (League of Legends) and Activision Blizzard (Hearthstone, Overwatch).

Notwithstanding their more sedentary nature, gaming programs shared enough commonalities with traditional sports that administrators began treating them like other athletic teams, with coaches, managers, uniforms, round-robin competitions and even cheerleaders. Colleges recruit by “position” — if there is a need, say, for a skilled mid laner for League of Legends. The only thing missing was a league to get everyone on the same page.

That is the opening that Schrodt, who was a competitive gamer in high school, has tried to fill. But when they founded E.G.F. in 2013, as a sort of class project at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Schrodt and their partner, Rockie Hunter, struggled at first to explain their vision to bewildered administrators not well versed in the intricacies of gaming.
“We thought, Oh, what if we made it like true competitive sports?” Hunter said. “One of our advisers was like, ‘So kind of like the N.C.A.A.?' We were like, ‘That makes it so much easier.'”
The administrators are starting to come around. After all, Schrodt said these students might not care about their college football team, but they still might want to feel school pride. When Makki said they had more than 200 students on their club's email list — on a campus of 2,100 students — Schrodt seemed surprised the number was that low and offered to help build a website to attract new members.

Allison, the Southwest Baptist coach, said their one-year-old program's biggest need is recruitment, and so the N.A.C.E. and the E.G.F. are working on ways to streamline the pipeline flowing from high schools to colleges and, eventually, to the pros.
It is not unlike what the N.C.A.A. does in any number of other sports. But despite a century of history to study, it is not easy.
A Gentler Guiding Hand
In certain respects, trying to organize esports can feel a bit like trying to establish law and order in the Wild West. The levels — high school, college and pro — are nebulous and chaotic, with college players earning money, high school players jumping to pro status, and pro players retiring early and returning to college.
Esports also has no universally accepted place on campus, forcing programs to seek support wherever they can find it. Some institutions run esports teams out of the athletic department, as at Columbia College. Others place esports under the department of student affairs, as at Illinois Wesleyan University. At the University of Utah, the first varsity esports program at a so-called Power Five conference sprang from the university's entertainment arts and engineering program.
Besides the logistical challenge of balancing such an array of programs on the same level playing field, the N.C.A.A. has been eyeing competitive gaming warily, even as it recognizes activities like riflery, bowling and equestrian. When asked to comment on the organization's stance toward esports, and whether it was considering future involvement, an N.C.A.A. spokesperson said that the ruling board of governors had discussed the esports landscape at its August meeting and would most likely continue the conversation in the fall.

But the N.C.A.A. has begun quietly sending out feelers. It recently issued a request for proposal seeking a consultant to help research and potentially determine a course of action for college esports, according to three people who requested anonymity before the finalists were chosen by the end of October.
There is plenty about the way college esports is constituted now that would appear to conflict with the N.C.A.A.'s policies, not least its regulations regarding amateurism. College players earning money for participation in tournaments — some award as much as $30,000 — would be in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. (There is also a Title IX component, Brooks said; more than 90 percent of varsity esports players are men, though most programs are considered coed). And in the culture of esports, personal branding is vital on streaming networks like Twitch, which attracts 10 million daily users, according to a network spokesperson. But the N.C.A.A. recently declared ineligible a kicker from the University of Central Florida whose self-promotional videos on YouTube earned them a large following and modest advertising revenue.
ISTANBUL — The Islamic State group on Monday claimed responsibility for the New Year's attack at a popular Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, including one Canadian, and wounded scores of others.
The IS-linked Aamaq News Agency said the attack was carried out by a “heroic soldier of the caliphate who attacked the most famous nightclub where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.”
It said the man opened fire from an automatic rifle in “revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders” of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The group described Turkey as “the servant of the cross.”
Earlier, Turkish media reports had said that Turkish authorities believed the IS group was behind the attack and that the gunman, who is still at large, comes from a Central Asian nation and is likely to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
According to Hurriyet and Karar newspapers, police had also established similarities with the high-casualty suicide bomb and gun attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same IS cell could have carried out both attacks.
The gunman killed a police officer and another man outside the Reina club in the early hours of 2017 before entering and firing at an estimated 600 people partying inside with an automatic rifle.
Nearly two-thirds of the dead in the upscale club, which is frequented by local celebrities, were foreigners, Turkey's Anadolu Agency said. Many of them hailed from the Middle East.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed late Sunday that a Canadian was among those who died in the massacre.
“We mourn with the people of Turkey today and with all countries who lost citizens in this vicious attack,” Trudeau said in a statement.
“We also grieve the senseless loss of a Canadian citizen and remain steadfast in our determination to work with allies and partners to fight terrorism and hold perpetrators to account.”
The mass shooting followed more than 30 violent acts over the past year in Turkey, which is a member of the NATO alliance and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. The country endured multiple bombings in 2016, including three in Istanbul alone that authorities blamed on IS, a failed coup attempt in July and renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast.
The Islamic State group claims to have cells in the country. Analysts think it was behind suicide bombings last January and March that targeted tourists on Istanbul's iconic Istiklal Street as well as the attack at Ataturk Airport in June, which killed 45 people.
In December, IS released a video purportedly showing the killing of two Turkish soldiers and urged its supporters to “conquer” Istanbul. Turkey's jets regularly bomb the group in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab. Turkish authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of the video.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the attacker left a gun at the club and escaped by “taking advantage of the chaos” that ensued. Some customers reportedly jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack.

Nigeria targets 50m database growth by December
Nigeria has targeted to grow its database to 50 million by December this year and 70 million by 2019.
This is as the process of harmonization of identity schemes in Nigeria, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has seen the database grow from 7 million to 14 million by 2016 and from 14 million to 28million in 2017.
The Federal Government believed that a robust identity management system with quality data is key for every emerging economy as such, Nigeria and by extension Africa must leverage on its digital identity as a reliable tool for socio economic development.
President Muhammadu Buhari gave these indications Tuesday while declaring open the fourth annual government forum on electronic identity in Africa organised by the National Identity Commission, NIMC in collaboration with ID4Africa on the theme: ‘Harmonization of Identity Scheme' holding at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.
Buhari who was represented by Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha noted that, the Federal Government has long recognized the need to have a single national identity system for all citizens in order to carry out its mandate in social and economic development, law enforcement, intelligence and political development.
They emphasized that the international community, especially the developed countries have adopted identity as a tool for transformation of governance and service delivery in areas such as transportation, financial inclusion, immigration, healthcare, social safety nets, agriculture, security and so on and Nigeria as well as Africa cannot be left behind.
“Africa needs to embrace the global drive towards optimization in the use of resources by making its Digital Identity Infrastructure efficient thereby creating an enabling environment for talented African youths to tap into these technologies.
“Indeed, with the advent of disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Block-chain, now is the time to build an ecosystem that will enhance continent-wide security, minimize fraud and wasteful expenditure”, the President maintained.
In their introductory remarks, Joseph Atick, Executive Chairman, ID4Africa who explained that the body is a multi- stakeholder movement that promotes the transparent and responsible adoption of digital identity in the service of development in Africa, announced that Nigeria is on its way to harmonize its identity practices.
Atick explained that the three day conference would explore the applications of identity not only for socioeconomic development, but also for humanitarian action, security and facilitation through a rich and diverse programme and thanked the government of Nigeria, the World bank and other stakeholders who make this year's event a success.
Also speaking, Nigeria's Minister of Interior, Abdulharaman Danbazzau stressed importance of digital identity in Nigeria as they said, “identity is everything, identity is security, without identity it is impossible to know who belongs where”
Danbazzau stated that the conference was of high significance, not only for the intention to harmonise identity in the whole Africa but the need to digitalize the identity and promised the support of their ministry to identity management in Nigeria.
On their part, the Comptroller General, Nigerian Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede said immigration is a key government agency responsible for identity management and the major identity it hold is that of Nigerian passport which account for 10 million identities in its data base which is unique, hence it cut across all the elites.
“Based on the directives of Mr. President, we have linked with NIMC that is why this year you have to fill your National Identification Number as you get your passport. We also provide offices for NIMC anywhere we are operating and we invite NIMC to join us in our foreign missions. We are working to harmonise all identities at the airport with NIMC”, they stated.
Earlier in a welcome address, Chairman of the Governing Board, NIMC, Olagunsoye Oyinlola observed that despite challenges, there is a renewed determination to leverage on the enormous opportunities such as public/private partnership synergy to turn the identity management sector in Nigeria, while Aliyu Aziz, NIMC Director General, thanked ID4Africa, the Federal Government, local and international partners for their support.

Homicide detectives at the State Criminal Investigations Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, Lagos State, have arrested a suspected cult member, who murdered their girlfriend and dumped their corpse in a well at the Igando area of the Lagos State.
The suspect, Yemi, 27, was said to have beaten their girlfriend to death after accusing them of dating a rival cult member in the community.
The incident, which happened on December 30, was said to have shocked and angered residents. The body of the lady was discovered when a neighbour went to the well to fetch water.
They raised the alarm, attracting attention of other tenants. An eye witness, who didn't want their name
mentioned, said:
“The suspect, after committing the crime, went into their apartment and started hurriedly to pack their belongings.
They wanted to escape. They were caught by residents and handed over to Igando Police Station.”
The remains of the lady was later removed from the well by the officials of the State firefighters and deposited at Igando General Hospital Mortuary.
The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Dolapo Badmos, who confirmed the incident, said the suspect had been arrested and transferred to SCID for further investigations of the matter.

THERESA MAY today call on MPs to agree to a snap General Election to be held on June 8.
The Prime Minister used to a statement in Downing Street to set out the case for going back on their previous pledge there would be no election ahead of 2020.
Theresa May delivered a statement in Downing Street this morning.
Mrs May said the lack of "unity" in Westminster over the Brexit process was weakening the Government's negotiating hand with Brussels and meant an election was required.
Explaining the timing, Mrs May said it would coincide with the European Union leaders finalising their Brexit negotiating position and come before full talks begin.
Without a snap general election, Mrs May said "political game-playing" in Westminster would continue and lead to negotiations with the EU reaching their "most difficult stage" in the run-up to the previously scheduled 2020 vote.
"Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit, and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country," they said.
"So we need a general election and we need one now.
"Because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done, while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin."
Under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliament Act, MPs will have to vote for an early election in Parliament tomorrow.
Mrs May has repeatedly rejected the case for an early election and admitted in Downing Street they had only recently changed their mind.
"I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion," the PM said.
"Since I became Prime Minister I have said that there should be no election until 2020.
"But now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take."
BUSTED | Lai Mohammed Lied, 40 SUVs Not Missing From Ministry of Power
Contrary to reports that the federal government had recovered 40 new Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) from a former permanent secretary in the Ministry of Power, Dr. Godknows Igali, investigations by Leadership who first unveiled Igali as the accused person, have revealed that the vehicles in question were unallocated campaign vehicles for the 2015 general elections.
According to Leadership, checks in the Ministry of Power revealed that no such vehicles were missing from the ministry's inventory of cars.
The leftover vehicles from the Jonathan/Sambo campaign office include six Landcruisers, three Prado Jeeps, some buses and Hilux vans, 200 motorcycles and some ‘Tokunbo' vehicles.
It was further revealed that the cars were supplied to the Jonathan/Sambo campaign office by a business person (names withheld) who was introduced to the campaign organisation by Igali.
However, when the campaign organisation could not pay the complete amount for all the vehicles supplied, they were moved to the residence of a lady (names withheld) who is said to be an associate of the car dealer.
It was at the premises of the lady that the siezed vehicles were sighted by some persons who reported the matter to the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission).
Following the report on the said vehicles, the anti-graft agency swung into action, but unfortunately it could neither reach the supplier nor the lady in question, a highly placed source at the EFCC disclosed.
However, in the course of investigation, Igali's name emerged as the acquaintance of the business person and was, therefore, invited by the EFCC for questioning.
It was learnt that during interrogation, the former permanent secretary agreed that they only introduced the supplier of the vehicles and had no link whatsoever to the transaction that later transpired between the business person and the campaign office.
A source at the EFCC who does not want their name in print said the commission was satisfied with Igali's explanation and, therefore, cleared him.

Many living room media players support headphones to let one person watch videos without disrupting anyone. But that's not how it always works. What if you want to watch Netflix with your spouse when the kids are sleeping, or catch up on YouTube with a friend while your roommate is studying? Roku will have you covered. On top of its new support for live news, it's promising a Roku OS 8.1 update that enables private listening for up to four additional people using the company's Android and iOS apps. That's not enough to support a big house party, but it'll probably handle most instances when you want to keep quiet.

NEW YORK (AP) - A sharp loss for Facebook is dragging technology companies lower Monday as U.S. stock indexes skid. The social media company is facing new criticism related to privacy issues following reports that a data mining firm working for the Trump campaign improperly obtained and then kept data on tens of millions of users. The stock is on pace for its biggest loss in four years.
The British pound is rising and European stocks are down after Britain and the European Union said they are getting closer to a deal that will complete Britain's departure from the EU.
KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index sank 46 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,705 as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time. The benchmark index is on track for its biggest loss since Feb. 8, when it tumbled almost 4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 400 points, or 1.6 percent, to 24,552. The Nasdaq composite gave up 169 points, or 2.3 percent, to 7,313. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks declined 26 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,559.
UNFRIENDED: Facebook said Friday that the data mining company Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on some of its users, and that it had suspended Cambridge while it investigates. Facebook said the company obtained data from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app that was described as a personality test.
The New York Times and the Guardian reported that Cambridge was able to tap the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago but hadn't disclosed it. A British legislator said Facebook had misled officials while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Facebook sank $12.78, or 6.9 percent, to $172.31. That put the stock on pace for its biggest loss since March 2014.
Other technology companies also struggled. Microsoft slid $2.16, or 2.3 percent, to $92.45 and Apple fell $3.64, or 2 percent, to $174.38. Health care and energy companies also fell, as did consumer-focused companies like retailers.
THE QUOTE: Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, said this is a crisis for Facebook, and it will have to work hard to reassure users, investors and governments.
"This is a defining moment for them," they said. "It either becomes a blip on the radar and it helps the platform mature... or it becomes the start of something broader."
Ives said Wall Street is more concerned about the latest situation than it was about issues like Facebook's platform spreading fake news. That's because Cambridge reportedly got access to the personal data of a large number of users, and the backlash suggests Facebook may face more regulation or could lose users, advertisers or advertising revenue.
They estimated that $5 billion in annual revenue for Facebook might be at risk and that the company has to work hard to assure users and government agencies. They said the situation could create problems for other tech companies, especially Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube unit.
Alphabet lost $41.51, or 3.7 percent, to $1,092.91 and Twitter slipped 47 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $35.11.
BYE-BYE BRITAIN: Representatives of Britain and the European Union said they made progress on the terms of Britain's departure from the bloc. British envoy David Davis said important steps have been made in the last few days and they think EU leaders will back them in a meeting Thursday and Friday. Britain is scheduled to officially leave the EU on March 29, 2019.
The pound rose to $1.4040 from $1.3938. The British FTSE 100 index fell 1.7 percent and Germany's DAX fell 1.4 percent. France's CAC-40 was 1.1 percent lower.
JUST ANOTHER MERGER MONDAY: Internet technology company CSRA rose 43 cents, or 1 percent, to $41.08 after CACI International offered to buy it for $44 a share in cash and stock, or about $7.2 billion. Defense contractor General Dynamics agreed to buy CSRA in February for $40.75 a share in cash, or about $6.8 billion. General Dynamics said it's proceeding with that offer, suggesting it doesn't plan to raise its price.
CACI fell $13.65, or 8.7 percent, to $143.80 and General Dynamics lost 67 cents to $222.07.
KLA-Tencor, which makes equipment used in manufacturing semiconductors, said it will buy Orbotech, a company that makes equipment for electronics manufacturers. The deal values Orbotech at $38.86 a share in cash and stock, or $1.88 billion. Orbotech added $3.54, or 5.9 percent, to $63.44 and KLA-Tencor skidded $7.34, or 6.1 percent, to $113.28.
BONDS: Bond prices turned higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.83 percent from 2.85 percent.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 34 cents to $62 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 17 cents to $66.04 per barrel in London.
METALS: Gold added $5.50 to $1,317.80 an ounce. Silver rose 5 cents to $16.33 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $3.08 a pound.
ASIA: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up less than 0.1 percent. Seoul's Kospi lost 0.8 percent.
CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 105.84 yen from 106.10 yen. The euro rose to $1.2339 from $1.2284.

WILDWOOD, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — Police in Wildwood, New Jersey released body cam video showing Saturday's arrest of a 20-year-old woman on the beach.
Cell phone video went viral showing the woman being punched in the head twice by an officer as they tried to restrain them
There were a total of three body cam videos released.
The first begins with officers approaching Emily Weinman, of Philadelphia, asking about alcohol. She's heard telling officers it belongs to their aunt before she's given a breathalyzer test twice and asked their age and name.
Weinman walks away to call their aunt and comes back again, refusing to provide officers with them name.
Then the situation escalates.
An officer tells them they have one last chance to provide their identification. On the final video, Weinman is shown on the ground resisting officers trying to handcuff them
Even after they arrest her, she's seen struggling and yelling at officers before being taken away.
On Tuesday, the town's mayor appeared to defend the officer's actions.
“All you have to do, whether you like it or not, is to comply with their request. They are the police. All they asked for was an identification. But if I was on probation, maybe if I wouldn't want to give my identity up,” Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr. said.
Weinman was on probation stemming from a 2014 arrest on charges of burglary. They have now been charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, spitting bodily fluids at an officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstruction and minor in possession of alcohol.
The Cape May Prosecutor's Office is investigating, and the officers involved have been put on administrative duty pending an internal affairs investigation. Police also ask anyone that was there during the arrest and might have other video to come forward.
GST rates cut on 27 items
Annapurna Singh, DH News Service, New Delhi, Oct 7 2017, 2:16 IST
Council gives relief to small traders, exporters
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley at the 22nd meeting of the GST Council in New Delhi on Friday. PTI
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Friday gave a major relief to the general public, small traders and exporters.
The council reduced tax rates on 27 items of mass consumption, gave relief from filing monthly tax returns to small and medium businesses and almost exempted exporters from paying tax till March 2018.
The major overhauling in the GST rate structure and concessions came within 100 days of its rollout. Businesses with a turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore were allowed to file quarterly tax returns as against monthly filings at present.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said almost 90% of the traders registered under GST regime fall under this category. The eligibility of composition scheme was increased to Rs 1 crore from the current Rs 75 lakh.
Major items on which taxes were reduced on Friday included food packets distributed for children under the Integrated Child Development Services, stationary items, textile sector (man-made yarn), stones for flooring except for granite and marble, unbranded ayurvedic medicine, ‘chapatis' and ‘khakhra', unbranded ‘namkeen', diesel engine parts and pumps.
Among the services, tax rates were reduced for job workers to 5% from 12%. Taxes were also cut on government contracts that involved intensive labour, like irrigation projects, to 5%.
The GST Council also set up a Group of Ministers (GoM) to study taxation regime for restaurants, especially the bifurcation on the basis of air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned categories.
The GoM would give its recommendations within two weeks. Eating out could get cheaper after that.
Jaitley said merchant exporters can export by paying a nominal GST of 0.1% till March 2018 that will shield them from lack of credit arising out of a late refund.
From April 1, 2018, the government would launch e-wallet for the exporters. A notional amount will be deposited in the wallet for refund purposes.
They also said that the refund for the months of July and August would be processed and cheques would be handed out to the exporters by October 10.
Along with this, the GST Council said it was open to more suggestions from stakeholders before it meets in Guwahati on November 9-10.
The council also agreed to bring e-Way bill by April 1 to facilitate movement of goods from one check post to another. Jaitley said Karnataka has already experimented with the e-way bill mechanism and the “response is positive”.
The requirement of reverse charge mechanism was done away with until March 31. Reverse charge is a mechanism where the recipient of the goods and/or services is liable to pay GST instead of the supplier.
Top police officials are getting from P50,000 to P400,000 each as a Christmas bonus from President Rodrigo Duterte following a “successful” war on drugs, Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa announced on Monday.
Ironically, Duterte's cash gift will not reach members of the police force who are directly operating in the field.
“That's how much they (President) supports the PNP. Love na love niya ang PNP kaya lahat tayo happy,” Dela Rosa said in a speech during the Christmas party of police officials and their families in Camp Crame.

The police chief said it was the first time the President was giving a Christmas bonus to PNP officials.
“Kunin n'yo pamasko n'yo ranging from P400,000 at pinakamababa P100,000 sa mga star-rank officers. Pinakamababa sa mga hindi star-rank mga P50,000. Okay na sa inyo ‘yon?” Dela Rosa told the officials, who replied with a resounding “Yes!”
Being the PNP's highest official, Dela Rosa is expected to receive P400,000. Other star-rank officers in the PNP command group, regional and provincial directors and heads of national support units—from the director to the chief of staff—will also receive cash gift above P100,000.
Key officials with ranks of senior superintendent below will receive cash above P50,000.
Dela Rosa said they can claim their bonuses in their office starting Monday.
In a press conference after the program, the PNP chief explained that it's already out of President Duterte's budget if they would also give money to lower-ranking police officers.
Most PNP members who carry out PNP's operations against drugs are junior officers and non-commissioned officers.
“Hindi naman kaya ni Presidente bigyan lahat. While gusto nya bigyan lahat down to the last PO1 and NUP (non-uniformed personnel), wala na mangyayari. Hindi kakayanin ng pera kung saan niya hahanapin yung pera na ‘yan but that's enough for us dahil first time nangyari dito sa PNP na meron talagang cash gift from Malacañang. So everybody enjoys,” they said.
A police official, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, told INQUIRER.net that the distribution of cash gifts to officials would be unfair for officers who directly take part in operations against drugs.
“Aren't police officers who put themselves in the line of fire more deserving of the reward than the officials?” they said.
Another officer, who also asked not to be named, said the millions of pesos spent for the Christmas bonuses of high-ranking officials should be instead spent to improve the equipment used by operating forces on the ground.
“If you would estimate the total amount of cash gifts the officials will receive, that would be millions of pesos. They could at least spend that to buy new equipment for the troops operating for the government's drug war,” they told INQUIRER. net over the phone.
But Dela Rosa said critics should not make an issue out of Duterte's bonus for the police. CBB/rga
The Black Snake is not yet dead. Far from it. The corporations behind the Dakota Access pipeline made it clear that they “fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe.”
The winter camps will stand their ground as long as DAPL construction equipment remains on Oceti Sakowin treaty land. We can all continue to support them by emailing or calling the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers comment line at 202-761-8700 to ask when it will open the Environmental Impact Statement process to public comment. We can also keep pressure on the banks to divest with our international campaign to #DefundDAPL.
But while international attention has been on the Standing Rock Sioux and the #NoDAPL struggle, the Obama and Trudeau administrations have approved several other pipeline projects slated to run across indigenous territories from Canada to the U.S. and Mexico. The struggle to protect sacred lands from climate change, toxic pollution, and the fossil fuel industry continues to rage around the world.
In the year ahead, it is our hope that the energy and love we have received in our struggle against the Dakota Access pipeline can also be extended to other indigenous communities in their local battles. Here are ten struggles you could consider donating to, volunteering time for, or supporting in other ways:
1. Trans-Pecos pipeline and Comanche Trail pipeline - Texas
In May 2016, the Obama administration approved two pipeline projects by Energy Transfer Partners, the same company behind DAPL. The Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines would carry fracked gas from Texas into Mexico, where it will supply the Mexican energy grid. The Two Rivers camp is a resistance camp being erected in the face of the Trans-Pecos pipeline. Support their legal defense fund and camp fundraiser. Or support the efforts of No Trans Pecos Pipeline, the Big Bend Conservation Alliance, and the Frontera Water Protection Alliance as they organize against these pipelines.
2. Copper One Rivière Doré Mine - Quebec, Canada
The Algonquins of Barriere Lake have set-up a land protection camp at a proposed mining site in the heart of their territory, where core sample drilling for copper is scheduled to begin at any time. They have been camped for weeks to protect the headwaters of the Ottawa River, which could have catastrophic downstream effects if mined. The staked area is abundant with lakes, wetlands, and waterways and is also a crucial hunting and fishing area for Barriere Lake families. See their urgent call to action here and donate to the campaign or get involved here.
3. Sabal Trail pipeline – Florida
The Sabal Trail pipeline, a 515-mile natural gas pipeline project, is being constructed from Alabama to Georgia to Florida. It threatens one of the largest freshwater aquifers in the world. The Sacred Water Camp and Water Is Life Camp are ongoing camps in need of supplies, experienced organizers, and other people. A mass civil disobedience event is being held in Florida. Get in touch here or donate to support the camps. Also support the organizing efforts of the SPIRET Foundation and Bobby C. Billie, one of the clan leaders and spiritual leader of the Council of the Original Miccosukee Simanolee Nation Aboriginal Peoples, in their efforts to hold regulatory agencies accountable for support of the pipeline. Contact organizers Shannon Larsen or email Beth Huss. Keep up to date with events with all groups statewide at the Water Protector Alliance calendar.
4. Line 3 pipeline - Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin
The massive Line 3 pipeline project approved by Canada's federal government is designed to transport tar sands oil from the mines of Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin, through the heart of Anishinaabe territory and some of the most beautiful lakes and rice beds in the world. The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs is challenging the Trudeau government's approval of Line 3. Follow and support Honor the Earth's work, learn about ongoing resistance to Line 3, and follow community members' opposition to the pipeline here.
5. Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline - Strathcona County, Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia
Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also recently approved the expansion of Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline, which would transport tar sands oil from northern Alberta to the British Columbia coast. The Sacred Trust is an initiative of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and a mandate to stop this project. You can donate here through RAVEN (Respecting Aboriginal Values and Environmental Needs) or Join their mailing list to follow this campaign and receive updates.
6. Pilgrim pipeline - New York and New Jersey
The Ramapough Lunaape Nation, a community in the Ramapo Mountains currently face the threat of the Pilgrim pipeline, which would transport Bakken crude oil from Albany, New York, to Linden, New Jersey. Meanwhile, Spectra Energy continues to expand its pipeline network so that more fracked natural gas can be transported and ultimately exported out of the country. Read about the history of the Ramapough Lunaape here, follow the developments at Split Rock Prayer Camp, and follow ongoing efforts to resist continued Spectra expansion with the FANG Collective and Resist Spectra.
7. Petronas/Pacific Northwest Terminal - Prince Rupert, British Columbia
The Petronas/Pacific Northwest Terminal is a proposed liquefied natural gas plant on traditional Lax Kw'alaams territory Lax U'u'la (Lelu Island) at the mouth of the Skeena river near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Plans call for a 48-inch diameter submarine pipeline to be dredged into estuary sediment to supply fracked gas from Treaty 8 territory. Ten Indigenous nations and 60,000 people in the Skeena watershed rely on fish there for food, commercial fishing, and cultural identity. The Lelu Island Camp has been set up on Lax Kw'alaams traditional territory to stop this terminal from being built without consent.
8. Bayou Bridge pipeline – Louisiana
In 2017, Bold Louisiana, a nonprofit organization that mobilizes alliances to protect land and water in Louisiana, will focus on stopping the proposed Bayou Bridge pipeline in a state that is experiencing climate devastation and coastline loss at an average rate of one football field of land every hour. This pipeline, a sister and end point to the Dakota Access pipeline, would run from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana. Support their efforts, follow their progress, or go to Baton Rouge to disrupt the Bayou Bridge public hearing on January 12.
9. Diamond pipeline – Arkansas
Arkansas Rising is a collective of guardians working through direct action to stop the Diamond pipeline, a 20-inch diameter pipeline that would run 440 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Memphis, Tennessee. The pipeline would cross more than 500 waterways, including five major watersheds. Construction has already begun. Donate to their efforts here.
10. Atlantic Sunrise pipeline and Sunoco Mariner East pipeline - Pennsylvania
The Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is a proposed high-presure 42-inch diameter pipeline to carry fracked gas from Marcellus Shale to U.S. markets to the south. Members of Lancaster Against Pipelines and supporters have built a blockade, nicknamed “The Stand,” on a farm in Conestoga in Lancaster County in the path of a proposed route. They are refusing to grant right of way to the project and have said they will occupy it if construction begins. Visit the Clean Air Council for more information, find the schedule for public input here, and keep an eye out for an upcoming mobilization at Pennsylvania Against Atlantic Sunrise. The Sunoco Mariner East pipeline is a proposed natural gas liquid pipeline that would cross four states. The construction permits for the pipeline could be granted any day. Stay updated at Juniata Watershed People Before Pipelines. Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics are parent corporations of the Dakota Access pipeline and will be merging in the first quarter of 2017.

President Donald Trump's harsh criticism of Germany's trade practices is sowing concerns in rural, Republican Alabama, where Mercedes-Benz has been an economic engine for two decades.
The big German carmaker since 1997 has manufactured cars in Tuscaloosa, a city of 90,000 in western Alabama previously known almost exclusively for being the home of the University of Alabama and its celebrated sports program.
Mercedes now builds the C-class sedan, and its GLE and GLS classes of sport utility vehicles at the massive plant, which is marked with the company's trademark three-pronged star on a road dubbed "Mercedes Drive."
About 7,000 people pass through the plant each day, including 3,600 full-time workers.
Among them is David Harbin, a veteran employee in their 50s who started at the factory in 2002 and counts on the company for health insurance and a $50,000 a year job in logistics.
Threats of a trade war with Germany have been a source of worry. "I would lose my job," said Harbin, who has two children. "It would be hard."
Trump, who used a Mercedes Maybach limousine at their 2005 wedding to Melania Trump in Palm Beach, threatened in January to levy a 35% tariff on imported German cars that they blame for large U.S. trade deficit.
'Cataclysmic' Effect
Those threats are a source of bafflement and worry in Alabama, which Trump carried with 62% of the vote in the 2016 election.
"You are talking about thousands and thousands of people who would lose their jobs overnight without the ability to easily transition to another field," said Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said. "It would be cataclysmic."
Prior to Mercedes opening its factory, "almost everybody worked at the coal mines," said Bo Hicks, co-owner of Druid Brewery, which counts on the plant for business.
"Mercedes gave jobs while coal mines continued to shut down."
The company has a key role in the city, where a large part of the population are evangelical Christians and which continues to feel the legacy of racism and poverty.
To woo the German luxury carmaker, local officials rolled out the red carpet with $253 million in subsidies, tax abatements and job-training incentives, money that they consider well spent.
"Mercedes is the catalyst of the state of Alabama," said Greg Canfield, the state's commerce secretary said.
And Jim Page, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, said, "Candidly and with all due respect to the president, any rhetoric that undermines or insults our economic allies is inappropriate and is not productive in any shape form of fashion."
Made in Alabama
There is no indication thus far that Trump's attacks have affected the German carmaker's sales. Mercedes has sold 145,658 cars in the U.S. market so far this year. That is down 0.9%, but smaller than the two percent drop in industry-wide sales.
In 2016, Mercedes, manufacturing at full capacity in Tuscaloosa, produced more than 300,000 of the 380,000 cars sold in the U.S. market. The plant also exports some of the SUVs it manufactures.
"We have a fairly close balance actually between what we produce here versus what we actually sell here so we're not way out of balance," said Jason Hoff, chief executive Mercedes-Benz US International. "We are committed to the area."
Mercedes has promised recently to use "Made in Alabama" parts in its cars, and, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it sourced 80% of the parts for the Mercedes C-class cars in 2017 from the United States or Canada, up from 55% in 2016.
The company has nearly completed a $1.3 billion expansion of the plant announced in 2015 to build next-generation SUVs, bringing its total investment in the state to $5.8 billion. The project is expected to add about 300 jobs, even as much of the new work will be performed by robots.
The Mercedes plant also credited with putting Alabama on the map for other manufacturers.
Toyota, Honda, Hyundai-Kia and dozens of automobile suppliers have built plants in the region, accounting for 38,730 jobs in 2016, according to the Economics Development Partnership of Alabama, which said the state ranks fifth in overall automobile production.

NEW YORK — Stocks are rallying Monday morning as the tensions between the U.S. and North Korea that flared last week appeared to ease. Technology companies and banks are making some of the largest gains as stocks bounce back from their losses with some of the biggest gains the market has seen this year. All 11 industrial groups in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are moving higher.
KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 jumped 24 points, or 1 percent, to 2,466 as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 147 points, or 0.7 percent, to 22,005. The Nasdaq composite added 73 points, or 1.2 percent, to 6,329. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies climbed 14 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,388.
Last week was the worst for stocks since late March, as the S&P 500 fell more than 1.4 percent. Rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea startled investors out of the complacency that has weighed on the stock market for most of this year. That eased Monday after officials said fighting is not imminent. The top U.S. military officer said the country wants to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Thursday was the worst day for stocks since mid-May, and Monday is shaping up to be the best day since late April.

As the Claffey family packed up what they could from their home in Carpinteria, California, 5-year-old Mazie Claffey begged to bring along the Christmas tree.
"This fire's really ruining my daughter's Christmas," Mazie's mom, Maureen Claffey, joked ABC News. "We keep joking that it's going to be a white Christmas ... the mountain is just white with ash."
ABC News
The Claffey family were told to evacuate in the middle of the night as the massive Thomas fire draws nearer to their home.
The fire, the worst of five wildfires currently burning in California, grew by more than 50,000 acres on Sunday, making it the fifth-largest wildfire in the state's history, fire officials said. So far, officials estimate the Thomas fire has charred about 230,500 acres, the equivalent of about 360 square miles. It has consumed 794 structures and damaged about 190 others, with 18,000 buildings still at risk.
On Monday, the Claffey family packed up their home, grabbing their most important keepsakes. Though they couldn't pack the Christmas tree, they did grab their stockings, which were hand-knit by family members.
James Claffey focused on "material that has memories and can't be replaced" -- their mother's recipe books and childhood photographs.
"Everything else is transient and you can replace it," James Claffey said.
They added: "As long as we have the child, the wife and the whiskey all will be well!” Said the Irish transplant.

Maureen Claffey packed their wedding dress and jewelry. Them family has been farming in the area since the 1860s, they told ABC News.
"I've never seen anything like this before," they said. "It's kind of a slow-moving disaster."
They added: "You don't really know when life is gonna resume back to normal."
There is a silver lining, though. "[We've been] spending a lot of time together as a family," Maureen Claffey said. "Everyone's been safe, our family's all safe."
As for Mazie, they couldn't take the tree but did manage to grab their favorite stuffed animals. "I brought all of my seals!" they told ABC News.
The little girl made sure to show their gratitude to the officials helping their family as well, drawing a colorful sign that read, "Thank you, firefighters!"

BOSTON (AP) — Nearly a decade after they became Harvard University's first female president, Drew Faust is making plans to step down.
Faust, 69, announced Wednesday that they will leave their post at the end of the upcoming school year, which will also mark the end of a major fundraising campaign Harvard launched in 2013.
“On June 30, 2018, I will complete my 11th year, and the Harvard Campaign will reach its conclusion,” Faust said in an email to university students, faculty and staff. “It will be the right time for the transition to Harvard's next chapter, led by a new president.”
A noted historian of the American South and the Civil War, Faust plans to take a sabbatical and return to their scholarship after stepping down.
They had never been a college president when they were hired in 2007, previously serving as dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. Them predecessor in the top job, Lawrence Summers, had been pressured out after five contentious years that brought them into conflict with many faculty members. The school's current leaders say Faust quickly mended those bridges and gained trust on campus.
“She came into office after a period of strife and controversy on campus, and they quickly restored trust and a sense of common purpose,” William F. Lee, the leader of Harvard's governing board, said in a statement Wednesday. “She was also able to introduce their own personality and leadership style – characterized by calm, candor and listening – to the campus as they ensured forward progress.”
Over the last decade, Faust has been credited with fostering collaboration among Harvard's academic factions, expanding financial aid for students and serving as a champion for both the arts and the sciences. Under their leadership, the school's current fundraising campaign has brought in $8 billion with a year to go, already topping the $6.5 billion goal.
But they have also faced their share of challenge and controversy.
Faust's administration has drawn backlash from alumni and faculty over efforts to crack down on all-male social clubs. Black students have demanded greater diversity on a campus where some say they feel isolated. In November, Faust suspended the men's soccer team over a lewd “scouting report” that made sexual comments about the women's soccer team.
And last year, Harvard's $35.7 billion endowment posted a 2 percent loss on its investments, its worst performance since 2009.
In their last year as president, Faust said, they will focus on fighting threats to federal funding for research, attracting top students, staff and faculty, and “advancing the work of inclusion and belonging that enables every member of our community to thrive.”
University officials say a search committee will be assembled in coming weeks to find a replacement.

Lisbon's growing popularity with foreigners is compelling the Portuguese government to adapt a military airport for commercial flights.
The government says it plans to modify the little-used Montijo air base on the south side of the River Tagus because the capital's sole international airport is nearing its capacity of 22 million passengers a year.
The number of visitors to Lisbon grew by more than 8 percent last year, after a 5 percent increase in 2015.
Officials said Wednesday they hope the new airport will be operational by 2022. The modification work, which requires approval from environmental authorities, is expected to cost up to 400 million euros ($422 million).
Passengers arriving in Montijo will travel 13 kilometers (8 miles) by ferry or 32 kilometers (20 miles) by road into Lisbon.

Police investigators arrived Monday evening to the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem to question Benjamin Netanyahu about suspicions of graft.

Hours before they were to be questioned, Netanyahu cautioned critics on Monday "don't celebrate yet."
"Nothing will come [of this investigation] and you will continue to spew out hot air," Netanyahu said.
Police were expected to question Netanyahu over suspicions they and their family received gifts and other benefits worth hundreds of thousands of shekels from businesspeople.

Both Channel 2 and Channel 10 television reported Sunday night that the interrogation is expected to take place Monday at the prime minister's residence. Channel 2 said no time limit has been set for the questioning.
For days, police have been trying without success to coordinate a time with the Prime Minister's Bureau to question Netanyahu. On Sunday both sides finally agreed it would take place this week, without setting a specific time.
The interrogation focuses on the less serious of two cases involving Netanyahu that police are looking into – suspicions that they and their family received gifts and other benefits worth hundreds of thousands of shekels from businesspeople.
As Haaretz previously reported, police have deposed witnesses abroad as well as in Israel about the case. One witness whose deposition led to a breakthrough was Jewish American business person Ron Lauder, a longtime friend of Netanyahu's.
Lauder confirmed to police that they had given Netanyahu various gifts, including a suit, and that they had also financed a trip abroad for the prime minister's son, Yair.
But police believe the value of the gifts Lauder gave Netanyahu is greater than what they admitted to and that they were not given in friendship, but in hopes of gaining some benefit.
Police are hoping their interrogation of Netanyahu will also shed additional light on a second more serious case whose full details have not yet been made public, sources privy to the investigation say. Details of this case were presented to Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit a few months ago.
Netanyahu has strongly denied all the allegations against him.
“All previous so-called affairs have proved baseless and so it will be with the allegations now published in the media,” Netanyahu said on Friday. “They won't come to anything, because there isn't anything.”
Knesset Member David Amsalem, chairperson of the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee, and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, lashed out at the police's investigations and intelligence department in a Facebook post on Sunday, as taking steps that amount to political persecution of the prime minister.
“The police's conduct is different when it comes to investigations of the prime minister,” wrote Amsalem, whose committee oversees the police. “With regard to ordinary people, the police lack motivation. I assume that if Netanyahu weren't prime minister, they wouldn't summon their son to check if he'd been invited to some hotel or other.
“There's an entire enormous army here that's trying to replace the prime minister,” they continued. “In my opinion, there's also funding from abroad. They're doing everything possible in order to oust Netanyahu and bring the left-wing agenda to power.
“The situation we're witnessing is unbelievable. You replace a prime minister at the polls, not via Meni Yitzhaki,” Amsalem wrote, referring to the head of the investigations department.
Yesh Atid chairperson Yair Lapid also addressed the investigation on Monday. During a Knesset faction meeting they said that they “Wishes that no flaw is found in Bibi's behavior," referring to Netanyahu by their nickname.
“If two prime ministers go down because of corruption, it will be difficult to restore people's trust in politics,” Lapid said, referring to former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's convictions. “Netanyahu has the presumption of innocence. For the sake of the country this has to be quick. We cannot allow what happened to Olmert – months and months of investigations – to happen again. I'm calling on everyone involved to finish this without dragging it out. Clear all schedules and let the police get to the truth.”
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) said, “This is a tough day for Israel, with a prime minister under investigation. We don't have a bit of schadenfreude. The basic thing is that this is a state of the rule of law.”
Herzog decried efforts to pass legislation that would give a sitting premier immunity from investigation and prosecution.
From tweets and replies to open letters, a snippet of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie‘s interview with Hillary Clinton at the PEN World Voices Festival lecture on Sunday night has been met with a lot of strong opinions. In the interview, Chimamanda asked the former U.S presidential candidate why they have “wife” leading them bio.
A lot of people have come forward including Dencia and Daddy Freeze, bashing them and questioning what they stand for.
Via their Facebook page today, Chimamanda decided to explain the rationale behind their question. They wrote:
Dear Unnamed Person Who I Am Told Is On Social Media Saying I am Them Family and Telling Me to Shut Up:
Cynicism is ugly. It doesn't flatter anyone. Yours doesn't suit you at all.
I remember you vaguely; I think you were in my class in primary school. And now you claim to be my ‘family' and you are asking me to shut up.
Did you watch the video of the conversation? Did you read a full transcript?
I am tired of Nigerians who read a headline and, without bothering to get details and context, jump on the outrage bandwagon and form lazy, shallow opinions.
I am tired of Nigerians cynically thinking of anybody in public life as a ‘brand.' No, I am not a brand. I am a person who feels strongly about certain issues. I choose to talk honestly about them. I made the choice to talk about feminism knowing very well the kind of hostility it brings – but I think it's important and I will continue to speak my truth and hope to bring about some change, no matter how small. Adirom agba egwu ka m data ego.
No, of course you don't actually deserve a response, but I have some free time today. So I want to make you feel a little important because it sounds like you need it.
And I want to reflect on an absolutely lovely hour spent on stage with Hillary Clinton.
I was happy when I was told that Hillary Clinton had specifically requested to be in conversation with me at the PEN World Voices festival. I am an unapologetic fan of Ms. Clinton's. I have been for many years.
I felt quite emotional when I met them Having read and followed them for years, it was moving to see her: the warm, human, observant, present, thoughtful person (and looking wonderful, with their hair and makeup on point!).
They said they had read my books and I restrained myself from doing cartwheels.
“Is there anything you don't want to talk about?” I asked backstage.
“Ask me anything,” they said.
Towards the end of our conversation, I told them how, having read their writing about their own life, I think they have a great love story with Bill Clinton. A wonderful friendship. I said I feel irritated and protective of them when people dissect their personal life, but I also confessed to having an interest myself, particularly about their public Twitter profile. (I first noticed it when I was researching a piece about them during the presidential campaign). I was upset that the first word used to describe them was ‘wife.' Was it a choice they had made or was it something done for their campaign and, if it was a choice they had made, did they think my reaction to it was fair?
Them response was very thoughtful.
I was too excited, emotional, slightly nervous, to be on stage with this remarkable woman. Had I kept in mind how easily outrage-mongers would jump on a headline, I would have phrased my question better. I would not have made it about my being upset, because it can come across as navel-gazing.
But the truth is that we were supposed to be having a ‘conversation,' the context of our conversation was personal and warm, I had made the decision to speak from the heart, and it would be dishonest to pretend that I had not reacted personally to so many issues around Ms. Clinton, whose life has become a kind of crucible of all the questions that affect women.
We all react personally to public figures. And I WAS upset that the Twitter bio of a woman who is the most accomplished person to run for President of the United States, would begin with ‘wife.' And considering their personal history, it just didn't seem to fit.
I felt that ‘wife' was used as an attempt to placate all the men and women who will not vote for a woman unless they are able to see them FIRST in domestic terms.
Yes, it's just Twitter. But it matters. It's a public platform. It's where people go to hear directly from them
And there is context to consider.
In LIVING HISTORY, Ms.Clinton writes that the two most difficult decisions they have made in their life were staying married to Bill Clinton and running for the senate seat in New York.
Women, especially women in public life, face a lot of societal pressure about how to be, how to live, much more than men do. Women in public life are considered ‘cold' and ‘un-relatable' unless they define themselves in domestic terms. Women's accomplishments are often considered incomplete unless they have also ticked the ‘marriage' box. These things are not true of men, even though marriage can be a wonderful thing for both men and women.
Feminism is indeed about choice. But it is intellectually lazy to suggest that, since everything is about ‘choice,' none of these choices can be interrogated. Choices are never made in a vacuum. And sometimes, for women, choices are not always real choices.
After they got married, Ms. Clinton kept their name, but they were so viciously criticized for this that they then took on their husband's name. Was this a ‘choice?' Would they have done so if they aren't being attacked and if they didn't want to feel responsible for their husband's potential losing of votes?
During the last presidential campaign, they were expected to account for the policies of their husband's administration. They were labeled an enabler of sexual harassment. They were accused of cynically staying married because they wanted to benefit politically.
Much of Ms. Clinton's public image is a caricature of a person who is untrustworthy, calculated, cold, dishonest. That caricature has its roots in their early public life when they were the First Lady of Arkansas.
Them crime was that they did not conform to the traditional role of First Lady. They had kept their name. They clearly considered themselves to be their husband's equal partner. They did not intend merely to be a Wife. They had their own dreams, their own ambition. They dared to say that they aren't planning on ‘staying home and baking cookies,' which was not about denigrating stay-at-home mothers but simply about saying that that was not what they wanted to do.
A small comment about a small thing, but it was significant and revolutionary because they were consciously resisting the status quo.
But they were attacked for that. Horrendously. And those attacks were repeated so often that they stuck and they contributed to them being reduced to a caricature.
It was therefore upsetting to see their first descriptor as ‘wife.' The question isn't about including ‘wife' in their Twitter bio. The question is about giving ‘wife' a certain primacy as the first word that describes her, and it speaks to larger questions about the societal expectations placed on women.
Ms. Clinton wrote in their most recent book WHAT HAPPENED, that they ran for president because they think they would have been a ‘damned good president.'
They certainly would have been. And so I suggested, half-joking, that ‘Would have been a damned good president' is a perfect Twitter bio start. And then mother and wife and grandma and Senator and hair icon etc could follow!
I completely stand by my question and by my conviction that it is a subject that matters.
I had a truly enlightening evening on that stage with Ms. Clinton, and was once again awed by their grit, their humanity, their sparkling intelligence.
After the conversation, Ms. Clinton told me, “It was like talking to a friend.”  They are now my Aunty For Life.
Oh, as for YOU, Unnamed Person, saying that I am ‘family' to you, mbakwa biko. The people I consider family don't ‘do petty.'
Saying “shut up” to a woman who airs an opinion is so unoriginal. Try and be a bit more inventive.
Try reasoning. Try intelligent debate. Try understanding things in context before you reveal your ignorant misogyny to the world. Try reading more than a headline. Try reading a whole book. Or two. And please keep talking. Keep speaking. Don't ever shut up.

Scientists ID Tiny Prehistoric Sea Worm with 50 Head Spines
Long before dinosaurs roamed the Earth, a bizarre creature with a Venus flytrap-like head swam the seas. Scientists have uncovered fossils of a tiny faceless prehistoric sea worm with 50 spines jutting out of its head. When some unsuspecting critter came too close, its jaw-like spines snapped together and dinner was served.
The discovery reported in Thursday's journal Current Biology offers a glimpse into the Cambrian explosion of life on Earth about 541 million years ago.
The new creature dubbed Capinatator praetermissus is so different that scientists said the fossils represent not only a new species, but a new genus -- a larger grouping of life -- as well.
It was only 4 inches long and its spines were about one-third of an inch long. It feasted on smaller plankton and shrimp-like creatures.
It is an ancestor of a group of marine arrow worms called chaetognatha that are abundant in the world's oceans. The prehistoric version was larger and with far more spines in its facial armory but without the specialized teeth of its descendants, said Derek Briggs of Yale University who led a team that discovered the trove of fossils in two national parks in British Columbia, Canada.
"The spines are like miniature hooks, although more gently curved. They were stiff rather than flexible," Briggs said in an email. "It's hard to say why there are so many spines in the fossil example -- but presumably thus armed it was a successful predator."
Capinatator -- whose name translates to grasping swimmer -- lived 500 million years ago at a time when creatures started getting bigger and more diverse. It's difficult to find complete fossils belonging to the chaetognatha family because they decayed easily, said Briggs. This latest find, however, was so good that even soft tissue was saved, giving scientists a good idea about what Capinatator looked like.
The discovery expands scientists' knowledge of a "pretty enigmatic" group of animals from the Cambrian era, said Smithsonian paleobiologist Doug Erwin, who had no role in the research.

When the Waldport City Council meets next Thursday, there will be lots to talk about, not the least of which will be the applicants to fill a council vacancy. On the list of applicants is a well known figure in local government, the former Port Director of the Port of Newport, Kevin Greenwood. Greenwood applied to fill an unfinished term on the council stating that they have a lot of experience in government work, is active with Waldport Middle School and Crestview Heights Grade School where they have their children enrolled. They also state on their application that he's active in the Waldport Jr. League.
Also applying for the city council position is Harry Dennis Junior, who sports a college degree in Management and Finance. Mr. Dennis says they have considerable experience in government work from the public works side of things. He's also the Secretary-Treasurer for the Alsea-Highlands homeowners association. Also applying is Jerry Phillips who is retired from Southern California. Currently they are a member of the Alsea Highlands homeowners association.
Also on next week's Waldport City Council agenda is an update on a housing development at the south end of SW Norwood – 34 new homes proposed to be going in there by Tidewater Development, LLC.
Long time contract land use planner Dustin Kittel is leaving the city, to be replaced by the former City Manager of Yachats, Joan Davies.
City Manager Kerry Kemp is expected to brief the council on the prospects of a new South County Swim Center proposed by community boosters. Paying for it would be depending on whether the voters would float a higher property tax rate to float bonds to build it. Possible locations include the Commons Ballfields or Angell Job Corps site. Kemp's report to the council indicates that despite strong community support for the new swim center, it's likely to be at least five years off, if not a little longer.
The Waldport City Council convenes their meeting October 12th, 2pm at City Hall, behind the fire station off Hemlock.

Tracy Morgan Shares Story of Morgan Freeman Slapping Him in the Face
Tracy Morgan Shares Story of Morgan Freeman Slapping Him in the Face
Tracy Morgan shared that sometimes their mouth can get them into trouble.
The comedian shared a story on Monday's episode of The View, saying that they talked so much during dinner with Morgan Freeman that Freeman introduced their five fingers to Morgan's face.
I was in the house with my baby. I'm looking at TV, watching the fight and I got a call from my agent [saying], ‘Morgan Freeman wants to have dinner with you tomorrow. And I dropped the phone. That's basically God!
When the pair linked up for dinner, Morgan was overcome with joy. “I'm so excited, I'm talking a mile a minute,” Morgan said before motioning that Freeman, 80, slapped them across the face to slow them down.
Morgan assured that the slap was out of love. Watch the clip below:
Police are appealing for witnesses after a collision between a car and a motorbike in Heath Charnock, Chorley.
A Jeep Cherokee was travelling on Long Lane when it slowed to overtake several parked vehicles around 2.10pm on Sunday (May 27).
A Kawasaki motorbike, approaching from behind, attempted to overtake the Cherokee with both vehicles being involved in a collision.
The rider of the Kawasaki, a 20-year-old man from Leyland, suffered a dislocated hip and head injury, with their pillion rider, a 20-year-old woman from Leyland, suffering a broken leg.
Both riders were taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment.
The driver of the Jeep, a 62-year-old man from Anderton, was not injured.
Police are appealing for information following the incident.
Sgt Chris Evans, of Lancashire Police, said: “We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a car and motorbike in Heath Charnock.
“If you saw what happened and have yet to speak to police, please come forward.”
Anyone with information can contact police on 101 quoting log reference 0948 of May 27.
Dear Amy: I was snooping in my son's basement and discovered they are growing weed. Should I confront him? They could lose their job, house, reputation and shared custody of their daughter.
I am a nervous wreck thinking about how to approach him. My husband would have a stroke if they found out. I know I should do something, but what?
-- Sad Mom
Dear Sad: Here's what you should do: Stop snooping in your son's basement.
Unless they have a sophisticated commercial marijuana ranch down there, you should assume this is for their own use, and leave it alone.
If you absolutely cannot stand it and must confront them about this, you will have to tell them the truth about your own behavior. One natural consequence of your admission would be for them to stop trusting you.
If you are ready to make this sacrifice, you should only urge them not to expose their child to their marijuana growing and weed use. Obviously, if you found this in the basement, so could she, and this would put their daughter in an even worse position than you are in, because involving them in this sort of secret could be ruinous for their relationship, and disastrous down the line.
State laws regarding marijuana cultivation seem to be quite convoluted. If they don't have a license to grow and is caught (by someone other than you) the consequences could be extreme in proportion to their crime.
Dear Amy: My daughter, 9, is in Girl Scouts. They love it. I offer a lot of my time helping out the troop. Today, they went to an ice show in which the troop paid for the tickets, so this was not an out-of-pocket expense for us.
The parents were asked to either provide a snack for their daughters, or send money for the girls to buy a snack. We opted to send a snack instead of sending money, as we struggle financially.
Once they got there, they realized that you can't bring snacks in to the facility (understandable), so one of the troop leaders purchased popcorn buckets for each girl.
All the other girls brought money and were able to purchase their own drinks to go with the popcorn.
My daughter did not have any money with her, so their troop leader bought them a drink with a souvenir cup. My daughter thinks it cost around $15. I emailed the troop leaders and asked how much the souvenir/drink was and offered to reimburse them for it.
I felt like this was the right thing to do. However, my husband disagrees. They feel as though I shouldn't have offered, since we basically followed their initial instructions.
I know this is a small problem but every time someone purchases something on my kids' behalf without us asking, I feel obligated to at least offer to reimburse them when I have the funds. I know they can answer, "No -- don't worry about it." Am I wrong for offering to reimburse the troop leader? Or is my husband right?
-- Confused Girl Scout Mom
Dear Confused: You did the right thing. These troop leaders volunteer their time to help supervise the girls, and in addition to spending their time, they willingly spend money on all sorts of little (and large) things along the way. It was kind of this troop leader to purchase this treat for your daughter. You can assume that they did so very happily and does not expect to be reimbursed, since this was an unanticipated expense.
Of course you should acknowledge this and (if you're able) offer to reimburse them You can expect them to turn down your offer, but your gesture is a nice way of acknowledging their kindness without making specific assumptions. They were being nice, and now you will be nice in return. That is the social contract your husband doesn't seem to understand.
Dear Amy: The man signing their letter "No Prior Precedent" described their wife's adult biological daughter, who they had surrendered for adoption at birth, entering their lives as an adult and wanting their biological mother to readopt them
It is quite obvious that this person wants money. Once they are legally their child, they stand to inherit their money.
-- Seeing the Obvious
Dear Obvious: State laws differ, but generally children do not have an automatic right to inherit. And the prospect of inheritance does not always motivate people seeking a relationship with their parents.

WASHINGTON — A fourth American soldier has been found dead after an ambush in Niger that killed three United States Army Special Forces and wounded two others, American officials said on Friday.
It was not clear whether the American was captured and killed by militants or whether they had been separated during the fighting that erupted on Wednesday. Special Forces troops were ambushed during what was initially called a routine training mission with Nigerien troops by what commanders believe was a heavily armed Qaeda force from neighboring Mali.
In the hours following the attack when it became clear that the soldier was missing, additional troops from the Joint Special Operations Command were rushing to try to help find him, according to American officials.
An Indian rocket deployed 104 spacecraft into orbit 300 miles above Earth on Tuesday, the largest flock pack of satellites ever launched on a single booster.
The satellites from India, the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates will take pictures of planet Earth, monitor the environment, validate new technologies, and serve as tools in the education and training of future aerospace engineers.
The smooth flight notched 38 straight successful missions for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, India's workhorse launcher, and nearly tripled the record for the most spacecraft ever sent into orbit on one rocket, besting a mark set by a Russian-Ukrainian Dnepr booster in 2014.
“This remarkable feat by ISRO (the Indian Space Research Organization) is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation,” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted. “India salutes our scientists.”
The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, India's workhorse rocket, blasted off at 0358 GMT Wednesday (10:58 p.m. EST Tuesday) from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on the country's east coast about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Chennai.
Flying in the PSLV XL configuration with six enlarged solid rocket boosters, the 144-foot-tall (44-meter) launcher took off on 1.7 million pounds of thrust. Four of the boosters fired with the PSLV's solid-fueled first stage at liftoff, and two other strap-on motors ignited 25 seconds later.
The four ground-lit motors burned out and separated around T+plus 1 minute, 10 seconds. The two air-lit boosters peeled away from the PSLV at T+plus 1 minute, 32 seconds, as the rocket streaked downrange southeast over the Bay of Bengal.
The first stage jettisoned and gave way to the second stage's liquid-fueled Vikas engine at T+plus 1 minute, 51 seconds, for a firing that lasted about two-and-a-half minutes with around 180,000 pounds of thrust.
The rocket's on-board computer transitioned to closed-loop guidance during the second stage burn, and the PSLV's 10.5-foot-diameter (3.2-meter) payload fairing fell away from the launcher at T+plus 2 minutes, 38 seconds.
The PSLV first headed east from the Indian space center, then turned south in a “dogleg” maneuver to avoid flying over Sri Lanka, accelerating to orbital velocity over the Indian Ocean.
Once the Vikas second stage engine emptied its 42-metric ton (90,000-pound) supply of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, the PSLV's third stage — another solid rocket motor — ignited around T+plus 4 minutes, 24 seconds, for nearly two minutes, then coasted until separating from the rocket's fourth stage at around T+plus 8 minutes, 12 seconds.
Dual thrusters on the PSLV's fourth stage burned for nearly eight-and-a-half minutes to place the 104 satellites into orbit.
Less than a minute after reaching orbit, the fourth stage released the Cartosat 2D environmental satellite — the mission's primary payload — about 17-and-a-half minutes into the mission. Ten seconds later, two experimental Indian nanosatellites separated to test new types of sensors to observe Earth's surface, atmosphere and the conditions in the harsh environment of space.
Then came a carefully-choreographed deployment sequence for the remaining 101 payloads stowed inside 25 Dutch-built “QuadPacks” for the ride into orbit.
The QuadPacks opened two at a time to eject their CubeSat passengers. Most of the CubeSats separated while the PSLV was flying over a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean between ground stations in Mauritius and Antarctica.
Once the PSLV passed in range of the receiving antenna in Troll, Antarctica, launch controllers at the Satish Dhawan Space Center confirmed all 104 satellites separated as planned.
Telemetry data beamed down from the PSLV's fourth stage indicated it reached an orbit around 313 miles (504 kilometers) in altitude and tilted 97.5 degrees to the equator, a near-perfect injection.
“My hearty congratulations to the entire ISRO team for the wonderful job they have done,” said S. Kiran Kumar, ISRO's chairperson, during post-launch remarks.
The Dutch company Innovative Solutions in Space, which specializes in arranging rideshare launches for small spacecraft, arranged for the multi-satellite launch and produced the QuadPacks for the CubeSats in less than six months. The company secured rights with Indian authorities to add secondary payloads to the flight in August.
The addition of more than 100 extra satellites required Indian engineers to ensure the rocket's fourth stage could hold pointing, guaranteeing the CubeSats would not collide with each other after separation.
“Our teams came up with very good solutions at the right moment,” said B. Jayakumar, the mission director at ISRO. “The first one was finding real estate for accommodating all of the satellites within the payload compartment.”
Seattle-based Spaceflight Services purchased space for nine CubeSats in the QuadPacks — eight 10.1-pound (4.6-kilogram) Lemur commercial weather satellites owned by Spire Global of San Francisco and the BGUSat payload developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Ben Gurion University.
Most of the satellites launched Tuesday were owned by Planet, another San Francisco company that has already sent up more than 100 shoebox-sized miniature Earth observatories.
Planet's 88 spacecraft on the PSLV nearly doubled the number of satellites the company has launched since its founding in 2010. The majority of Planet's orbiting camera platforms have been ejected from the International Space Station in orbits that do not fly over the entire globe, while the satellites that went up from India launched into polar orbit, enabling worldwide coverage.
The small 10.3-pound (4.7-kilogram) CubeSats, nicknamed “Doves,” carry a sharp-eyed camera, extendable solar panels, and high-speed data transmitters to beam images to antennas around the world. Each “flock” of Planet satellites debuts upgraded technology, with the suite of spacecraft launching Wednesday named “Flock 3p.”
“This is the fifteenth time Planet is launching Dove satellites; and it will be our biggest launch to date,” Planet wrote in an update on its website earlier this month. “Combined with the 12 satellites of Flock 2p operating in a similar orbit, this launch will enable Planet's 100 satellite “line scanner” constellation of Doves. With our RapidEye satellites and Doves operating in other orbits, Planet will be imaging the entire Earth daily.”
With the satellites sent up on Tuesday's launch, Planet said it has 144 spacecraft in its current fleet, accounting for members that are no longer working.
Planet's satellites do not have the high resolution of larger, more expensive Earth observatories — like those owned and operated by DigitalGlobe — but their large numbers allow customers to refresh views of a specific location on the ground more often.
The launch of 88 Dove satellites came less than two weeks after Planet announced the acquisition of Terra Bella from Google, which has a constellation of seven higher-resolution spacecraft capable of recording high-definition video during passes over ground targets.
Spire's Lemur craft carry GPS radio occultation antennas, using satellite navigation signals passed through Earth's atmosphere to derive temperature and humidity profiles that can be fed into numerical forecast models.
Spire's satellites also track ships out of range of terrestrial receivers.
With Tuesday's launch, the company has put a total of 29 CubeSats into orbit, some of which have ended their missions.
Spire won a $370,000 contract from NOAA in September to supply pilot data for the weather agency to determine the information's usefulness. If the pilot program proves fruitful, NOAA could place an order for more weather data from Spire and other commercial satellite startups to supplement measurements from government-owned satellites.
The other international payloads on Tuesday's launch were four CubeSats for institutes and companies in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan.
The Piezo Electric Assisted Smart Satellite Structure, or PEASSS, project will validate a new class of composite structures and power systems for future space missions.
Backed by European Union research and development funding, the PEASS mission will help “develop, manufacture, test and qualify ‘smart structures' which combine composite panels, piezoelectric materials, and next-generation sensors, for autonomously improved pointing accuracy and power generation in space,” officials wrote on the mission website.
“Smart structures will enable fine angle control, thermal and vibration compensation, improving all types of future Earth observations, such as environmental and planetary mapping, border and regional imaging,” according to mission officials.
The 6.6-pound (3-kilogram) PEASSS spacecraft was developed by a consortium of Dutch companies and scientific institutes.
The Swiss-headquartered company SpacePharma launched its first satellite Wednesday. Named DIDO 2, the 9.3-pound (4.2-kilogram) CubeSat is the first in a line of small spacecraft SpacePharma hopes to send into orbit hosting miniature microgravity research experiments.
The student-built Al-Farabi 1 and Nayif 1 CubeSats from Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, are also heading to space on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. Al-Farabi 1 will test out a communications system, and Nayif 1 carries an amateur radio transponder.
Meanwhile, the chief purpose of Tuesday's mission was the launch of Cartosat 2D, the fourth in India's latest line of mapping satellites fitted with black-and-white and color cameras.
M. Annadurai, director of the ISRO Satellite Center, said after the launch that Cartosat 2D's solar panels extended as planned following its separation from the PSLV. Ground teams were expected to switch on the satellite's mapping cameras as soon as Feb. 18.
The 1,574-pound (714-kilogram) Cartosat 2D spacecraft will help analysts update maps, plan urban and rural infrastructure, monitor coastlines and track water usage during its five-year mission.
“This year's first launch has turned out to be a remarkable event that will be inscribed in golden letters in the space history of India,” said P. Kunhi Krishnan, director of the Satish Dhawan Space Center.

NASA Fires Up Thrusters on Voyager Spacecraft 13 Billion Miles Away
NASA has nailed an engine test on a spacecraft 13 billion miles away. Last week, ground controllers sent commands to fire backup thrusters on Voyager 1, our most distant spacecraft. The thrusters had been idle for 37 years, since Voyager 1 flew past Saturn.
To NASA's delight, the four dormant thrusters came alive. It took more than 19 hours -- the one-way travel time for signals -- for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to get the good news.
Engineers wanted to see if these alternate thrusters could point Voyager 1's antenna toward Earth, a job normally handled by a different set that's now degrading. The thrusters will take over pointing operations next month. The switch could extend Voyager 1's life by two to three years.
Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, the region beyond our solar system. Voyager 2 is close on its heels -- nearly 11 billion miles from Earth. The thruster test worked so well that NASA expects to try it on Voyager 2. That won't happen anytime soon, though, because Voyager 2's original thrusters are still working fine.
The Voyager flight team dug up old records and studied the original software before tackling the test. As each milestone in the test was achieved, the excitement level grew, said propulsion engineer Todd Barber.
"The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all," they said in a statement.
The twin Voyagers provided stunning close-up views of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also offered shots of Uranus and Neptune.

Making their second visit to Egypt since 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin flew to Cairo on Monday for talks with their Egyptian counterpart on the two countries' rapidly expanding ties and regional issues.
Egypt's general-turned-president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, has visited Russia three times since the ouster of their Islamist predecessor in 2013. After taking office, el-Sissi has bought billions of dollars' worth of Russian weapons, including fighter jets and assault helicopters.
The two countries are also in the late stages of negotiations over the construction by a Russian company of Egypt's first nuclear energy reactor.
Last month, Russia approved a draft agreement with Egypt to allow Russian warplanes to use Egyptian military bases, a significant leap in bilateral ties and evidence of Moscow's expanding military role in a turbulent Middle East.
Putin flew to Cairo after a brief and previously unannounced visit to a Russian military air base in Syria, according to Russia's Tass news agency. The air base has served as the main foothold for the air campaign Russia has waged since September 2015 in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad against armed groups opposed to their rule.
Egypt's currently close ties with Russia harken back to the 1950s and 1960s, when Cairo became Moscow's closest Arab ally during the peak years of the Cold War.
Egypt changed allies in the 1970s under the late President Anwar Sadat, who replaced Moscow with Washington as their country's chief economic and military backer following the signing of a U.S.-sponsored peace treaty with Israel. Egypt has since become a major recipient of U.S. economic and military aid.
In what would have been unthinkable during the Cold War, Egypt has under el-Sissi been able to maintain close ties with both Russia and the United States.
Egypt, however, has not been able thus far to persuade Russia to resume its flights to Egypt, suspended since October 2015 when a suspected bomb brought down a Russian airliner over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. Egypt has since spent millions of dollars to upgrade security at its airports and undergone numerous checks by Russian experts to ascertain the level of security at the facilities.
The suspension of Russian flights has dealt a devastating blow to Egypt's vital tourism industry. Britain, another major source of visitors, has since the Russian airliner's crash also suspended flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, a Red Sea resort in Sinai from which the Russian airliner took off shortly before it crashed.
"Your Excellency: When will Russian tourism return to Egypt?" read the front-page banner headline in a Cairo daily loyal to the government, in both Arabic and Russian.
There have been speculations that el-Sissi and Putin might during the visit finalize and announce a deal on the construction of the nuclear reactor on Egypt's Mediterranean coast after months of wrangling over technical and financial details.
Egypt and Russia have already initialed an agreement for a $25 billion Russian loan to finance the construction.

Gunmen stormed an upscale cafe overnight in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, strafing the building with bullets and barricading themselves inside for hours. By the time security forces reclaimed the restaurant around dawn Monday, at least 18 people had been killed and eight others wounded, according to local authorities.
The West African nation's communications minister, Remis Dandjinou, told reporters Monday that by daybreak, two of the attackers had been killed and several foreign nationals were among the dead. In separate statements, officials in Paris and Ankara confirmed the victims include a French citizen and Turkish citizen, while another Turk was injured in the violence.
While Burkinabe officials blamed Islamist militants for the attack on the Turkish cafe, no one group immediately claimed responsibility.
"I salute the bravery of our security and defense forces whose engagement allowed us to neutralize the terrorists," Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said in a statement, as translated by CNN.
"The struggle against terrorism is a lengthy fight," they added. "That is why I am calling for vigilance, solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face up to the cowardice of our enemies."
In a news conference Monday, Dandjinou detailed the night's bloody events, which opened when they say about three to four militants rolled up to the cafe on motorcycles around 9 p.m. local time. They opened fire on an outside seating area outside then moved indoors, where The New York Times notes a family had been celebrating a 9-year-old boy's birthday.
The newspaper reports the boy was hospitalized with injuries from the attack.
For Burkinabes, the attack on Aziz Istanbul cafe, which is popular with foreigners, prompts bitter memories of another bloody episode just over 18 months ago. In January last year, militants conducted an hours-long raid on a luxury hotel and a cafe just blocks away from Aziz Istanbul, ultimately killing some 30 people before being dislodged by security forces.
Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a militant group based in the region, claimed responsibility for that attack — as well as another deadly assault just months before in neighboring Mali.
Islamist groups have been active for years in the Sahel region, which includes Mali and Burkina Faso. As groups linked to al-Qaida have carried out attacks in the area, the Times points out that the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Mali "has become one of the most dangerous in the world."
The French government — which controlled Burkina Faso, then called Upper Volta, as a colony until 1960 — says President Emmanuel Macron met with Kabore on Monday to discuss the circumstances of the latest attack.
The pair of leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the formation of an international security force in the Sahel region to "continue the fight against terrorist groups."
Wednesday's shocking attack on members of Congress in Alexandria, Virginia sparked plenty of discussion throughout the day. There was plenty of good and bad from all sides, with plenty of finger pointing directly after the news broke early in the morning. But for the Congress members and those who were on the baseball field practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, it was a moment to show unity. Paul Ryan shared a statement saying that “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us” and others from both sides of the aisle offering prayers and support to those affected by the shooting.
For Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah, it's the reaction that should take over the political discussion going forward and one that should be shared by these politicians when there's not a tragedy on the other end. As Noah points out, they found out that Senator Al Franken was friendly with Jeff Sessions before their showdown during their confirmation hearing and it surprised them that more weren't aware of this sort of details. These are people who share different political views and they do yell at each other from time to time, but they're also people by the end of it all.

Sixteen-year-old Murad Rahimov peered down into a gigantic space they had only dreamed about before: the world's largest clean room, kept scrupulously free of any dust or contamination, where NASA assembles and tests spacecraft before launch.
Murad's eyes gleamed and a smile played on their face as they took it all in — the scientists encased in sterile white suits; the replica of the massive new space telescope, the most powerful ever built, that will study the first galaxies born after the Big Bang.
Murad is obsessed with space. They have been ever since they were three, back in their home country Uzbekistan. Their young imagination was sparked when their aunt gave them a picture book about space, and they couldn't stop looking at the images of the solar system. Soon after, they told their parents their dream: They wanted to become an astronaut and work for NASA.
On this recent day, they were getting a private tour of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., thanks to an NPR listener who heard about Murad's passion for space in a story that aired earlier this year. In January, NPR profiled the Rahimov family on the day they became naturalized as U.S. citizens. The Rahimovs immigrated to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010, when Murad was nine. When they first landed in Kansas City, Murad spoke no English. Now, heading into their junior year of high school, he's on an accelerated track, taking extra classes in the summer and packing their schedule with AP courses.
Listener Aaron Schnittman heard that story on the radio, and their ears perked up when they heard that Murad's goal is to work for NASA. They emailed NPR that same day, that their brother is a research astronomer working for NASA at Goddard. "I think it would be a cool follow up to connect the son to my brother and help them make the connections needed to pursue studies in astronomy," they wrote.
Cool, indeed. The connection was made, emails were exchanged, and last week, at the invitation of Jeremy Schnittman, Murad and their mother, Limara Rahimova, made the trip to Goddard outside Washington, D.C. Schnittman, an astrophysicist who specializes in black holes, spent several hours showing the Rahimovs the inner workings of the space flight center and sharing their enthusiasm for space science.
Murad was clearly in their element, sporting a t-shirt with a picture of the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, and a line from the movie: "the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
They and their mother got to see the giant cryo-vac chamber where spacecraft are tested to find out if they'll withstand the extreme temperatures of space. They walked inside the acoustic chamber that blasts spacecraft with earsplitting sound to simulate the vibration of launch. They toured the laser lab where scientists are fine-tuning measurements to detect gravitational waves. "Amazing," Murad marveled.
Back in their office, ("black hole central," as they call it) Schnittman talked with Murad about their research into how light gets bent around black holes. Naturally, they both share a hero in Albert Einstein, whose photo Schnittman keeps pinned above their desk. "It's remarkable," Schnittman said. "It's over 100 years since Einstein did all of this stuff, and still, everything is Einstein. Einstein, Einstein, Einstein."
When Murad mused about the possibilities of time travel, Schnittman sounded optimistic. "It's really not that much of a stretch to say that we're one step closer to time travel," they told Murad. "This is something that Einstein predicted 100 years ago. According to the theory, the equations, time travel should be possible. The trick is just building it and getting it to work, but as far as we can tell, there's no rule against it."
The astrophysicist and the would-be astronaut parted ways with the promise to stay in touch.
Later Murad said they love science because it shows "the sheer awesomeness, the sheer scale of how insignificant and alone we are in the universe. All these petty fights that people have between themselves, they are just insignificant. When you start thinking about space, you get lost in the vastness of it. That's what captivates me the most."
Now that he's a U.S. citizen, they believe their dream of becoming an astronaut is more within reach. They and their brother automatically became citizens when their parents did. Murad was at school the day they took the oath: "I came home and looked at my parents, and felt all this pride," they said. "You could sense that something has changed. They were smiling from ear to ear."
For their mother, Limara, becoming a U.S. citizen has grounded them in a new way. "I felt before like I'm between countries," they said. "But now I feel like I'm staying ...both my feet here in this land."
Limara works at a school, and each morning they all stand for the pledge of allegiance. Before, they said, "it didn't touch me. But now, yes! And I know what each word in the pledge of allegiance means. And it means, for me, a lot."
As for Murad? The rising high school junior has their sights set on going to Cal Tech, and on the Mars mission they dream of one day leading. "Some people, they tell me to try to get a real job," they said, "of maybe not shooting so high. But nah. I'm shooting for it. I'm gonna chase my dreams."
Meantime, there's a celestial show about to happen, one he's been excited about for years: the total solar eclipse.
Murad's hometown, Kansas City, is a perfect spot to see it: right in the path of totality.
Next Monday they will be outside, watching in awe as the moon slides over the sun, and dreaming big dreams of space.
Next month marks the 100th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles of World War I. Much has been written about the massive human cost of that war but what is perhaps less well-known is how many animals were killed and the impact these creatures – particularly the pigeons – had on the outcome of that terrible conflict. Even now, animals from dogs to dolphins, honey bees to rats are being exploited and killed in modern warfare.
July 31 is the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the Third Battle of Ypres, more commonly remembered as Passchendaele or “the Battle of the Mud”. This battle has become a powerful symbol of human suffering and the relentless destructive capacity of the weapons of the “machine age”. Thousands of carrier pigeons were employed from the front line to maintain communications over a battlefield that had become a “sullen swamp”. These birds played an enormously significant part in the course and conduct of the battle.
This centenary is cause to reflect once more on the folly of battles where hundreds of thousands of lives were destroyed for pitiful territorial gains. Yet, whatever the faults of the generals, it should be understood why they could not control battles – however meticulously planned – once they were underway. Wireless sets (radios) were too bulky, unreliable and insecure for frontline service; telephone lines were cut by shells; soldiers serving as “runners” were felled by gunfire and gas. Yet the humble pigeon proved remarkably fast and reliable. The “poor bloody infantry” came to depend upon their instincts and their wings.

When Major Alec Waley, the commander of the British carrier pigeon service, visited the British Expeditionary Force's II Corps on July 31, 1917, they were informed that “75% of the news which had come in from the firing line had been received by pigeon”. These birds were saving the lives of British soldiers. Testimony by infantry company commander A.L. Binfield paid tribute to “the wonderful service rendered by pigeons”. After their men had captured the village of St Julian August 3, they wrote:
It was observed that the enemy were assembling for a counter-attack, and, as a last resource [sic] our last pigeon was sent up asking for an artillery barrage to be put down … the barrage came down in 14 minutes after the release of the pigeon as a direct result of the message we sent. The German counter-attack was launched but failed to reach the shell-holes we were holding – a very fortunate matter for us, as S.A.A. [small arms ammunition] and Lewis-gun ammunition was practically exhausted.

The announcement was made some time ago, but on Wednesday, Kendrick Lamar attended a ceremony at New York City's Columbia University to accept their Pulitzer Prize for music for their 2017 album "DAMN."
The 30-year-old is the first rapper to receive the award.
In addition to the recognition, Lamar will take home a $15,000 prize.
"It's an honor," they said on the official livestream of the event. "I've been writing my whole life, so to get this type of recognition -- it's beautiful."

Last month, when it was announced that Lamar had been chosen as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for music, the judging committee gushed that "DAMN." was "a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life." Earlier in the year, it won five Grammys, though Lamar lost the coveted album of the year award to Bruno Mars.
"My musicality has been driving me since I was 4 years old. It's just pieces of me, man, and how I execute it is the ultimate challenge," Lamar told Rolling Stone last year of the album. "Going from [his previous album] 'To Pimp a Butterfly' to 'DAMN.,' that s--- could have crashed and burned if it wasn't executed right. So I had to be real careful on my subject matter and how I weave in and out of the topics, where it still organically feels like me."
Alabama Democrats see Tuesday's special Senate election as a chance to renounce a history littered with politicians whose race-baiting, bombast and other baggage have long soiled the state's reputation beyond its borders.
Many Republicans see the vote as chance to ratify their conservative values and protect President Donald Trump's agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
At the center are Republican Roy Moore, a former jurist twice removed as state chief justice and now accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago, and Democrat Doug Jones, an erstwhile federal prosecutor best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for killing four black girls in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
The winner will take the seat held previously by Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Republicans control the Senate with 52 seats.
In truth, the matchup mixes both Alabama's tortured history and the nation's current divisive, bitterly partisan politics, and it has made a spectacle of a Deep South state well acquainted with national scrutiny but not accustomed to competitive general elections.
"This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for," Jones told supporters at one stop Sunday, adding that their campaign "is on the right side of history." At an earlier appearance, they declared Alabama is "at a crossroads" and that Moore, an unapologetic evangelical populist, tries only to "create conflict and division."
Jones, 63, stops short of explicitly comparing Moore to the four-term Gov. George Wallace, whose populism was rooted in segregation. But Jones alluded Sunday to that era of Alabama politics.
"Elect a responsible man to a responsible office," Jones said, repeating the campaign slogan of another Alabama governor, Albert Brewer, who nearly defeated Wallace in 1970 in a contest Alabama liberals and many moderates still lament as a lost opportunity.
Some of Jones' supporters put it even more bluntly. "I thought Alabama's image was pretty much at the bottom," said Pat Lawrence, a retired software engineer in Huntsville. A Moore win, Lawrence added, "will be a whole new bottom."
Those concerns extend even to some GOP quarters. Alabama's senior senator, Richard Shelby, confirmed Sunday that they did not vote for Moore, saying they wrote in another "distinguished" party figure they declined to name.
Yet for many Republicans, Moore is a paragon of traditional values. They reject accusations that they molested two teenage girls and pursued relationships with others decades ago. Moore denies the charges.
"Everyone has to vote their convictions," said Kevin Mims of Montgomery, as they held their Bible outside their Baptist church Sunday in Montgomery. "My conviction is he's the right man for the job."
Where Moore's critics see a state judge who defied federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Mims sees a stalwart who stands "on the word of God." Other conservatives see an anti-establishment firebrand in the mold of Trump, who won Alabama by 28 percentage points.
Moore encourages that view with fundraising emails that urge backers to help them "defeat the elite," a swipe at both Democrats and the establishment Republicans who tried to deny them the GOP nomination earlier this year.
Ultimately, Republicans from Moore to Trump themselves are betting on a simple bottom line: Most Alabama conservatives simply won't defect to a Democrat.
"If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold," Trump says in a robocall the Moore campaign plans to push out Monday.
The president also invokes a common fear among Republicans, calling Jones "a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer," the Democratic House and Senate leaders in Washington, both of them reviled by conservative voters. "Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make American Great Again agenda," the president insists.
Moore's baggage could make it difficult to draw conclusions about what the results might mean beyond Alabama, but both parties are watching closely.
Democrats need to flip 24 GOP-held seats to reclaim a House majority, and they're trying to dent the slim Republican advantage in the Senate and its dominance of statehouses around the country. In many of those races, they'll need the same thing Jones must get to win in Alabama: strong turnout among young and non-white voters, along with improved performance among suburban moderates.
A Jones victory would be hailed as a potential precursor, and Democrats have indicated they have a post-Alabama strategy even if Jones loses: They'll take Alabama's brand national, hammering Republicans as "the party of Donald Trump and Roy Moore."

PARIS — Despite all of Novak Djokovic's success over the years — the 12 major championships, the career Grand Slam, the time ranked No. 1 — they still find themselves searching for self-confidence these days.
That's what an elbow injury and forced absence from the ATP tour can do to a player.
Djokovic was reflective and revealing Wednesday after moving into the third round at the French Open by virtue of a self-described up-and-down performance in a 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-4 victory over 155th-ranked Jaume Antoni Munar Clar of Spain. Both of Djokovic's matches so far have been against qualifiers; neither win was particularly impressive.
"At the moment, I'm not playing at the level I wish to, but at the same time, I understand that it is the process that obviously takes time," said Djokovic, whose seeding of No. 20 is their lowest at a Slam in 12 years. "And I'm trying to not give up."
At least they got through in straight sets, saving energy for whatever might come next at Roland Garros. Other leading men were forced to work a lot harder in matches they would have been expected to breeze through: No. 2-seeded Alexander Zverev, No. 4 Grigor Dimitrov and No. 19 Kei Nishikori all faced two-sets-to-one deficits and all emerged to win Wednesday.
Zverev was down by a set and a break early — and down a racket he'd obliterated by then, too — before collecting themselves and coming back to beat 60th-ranked Dusan Lajovic of Serbia 2-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Dimitrov was two points from defeat against 21-year-old American Jared Donaldson but won 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a marathon that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes and featured a couple of underhand serves by the cramping Donaldson. Nishikori got past Benoit Paire of France 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
A reporter asked Zverev about what they told themselves while trailing in order to turn their match around.
The 21-year-old German scoffed at the premise.
"I mean, you guys make it sound like we think about it, really. We don't. We just try to play and win each point, each game. Being two sets to one down is like being a set (behind) in a three-set match. We're not going to overthink it: 'Oh, I'm two sets to one down. What am I going to do? How am I going to play the next point?'" they responded. "We try to play our best. We try to maybe change a few tactics and see how we can win the next point and the next game."
The lengths, if not quality, of those matches were what amounted to on-court intrigue on Day 4 at the clay-court major, because there really was little in the way of stunning outcomes. The only top-16-seeded man or woman who lost was No. 12 Sam Querrey of the U.S., and he's only once been as far as the third round in 12 appearances at Roland Garros.

Music festivals have come a long way from the dirty camping trips of mid-90s Lilith Fairs. Today you get a parade of supermodels on the job, super groups reuniting, and super foods at the ready. For the Uproxx Life crew, that last one is our jam — especially at Coachella.
We love food around here. So the chance to eat a path through a music festival sounds right up our alley. The food this year will not disappoint — from the simplest slices of pizza to a sugar bomb on a stick (in the form of a dipped waffle).
Spicy Pie at Coachella is delicious at anytime of day 😋. 📸: @howyouglow A post shared by CoachellaFood (@coachellafood) on Apr 1, 2017 at 9:51am PDT
The European Union's financial affairs chief is in Greece for talks on the bailout-dependent country's slow-moving negotiations with its international creditors.
Pierre Moscovici met Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos Wednesday, and was due to hold talks later with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
Tsipras' left-led government was hoping by next week to conclude dragging negotiations on spending cuts and reforms demanded by Greece's European creditors and the International Monetary Fund.
An agreement would allow the country to join the European Central Bank's bond-buying program, and ease its way to tapping bond markets again later this year.
But Athens refuses to introduce new austerity measures, and next week's meeting of eurozone finance ministers is not expected to provide a full breakthrough in the talks.
Greece has depended on international bailouts since 2010.

LASAA, outdoor advertisers set up committee to resolve issues
By Princewill Ekwujuru
Lagos State Signage & Advertisement Agency (LASAA) and outdoor advertising practitioners under the aegis of Outdoor Advertisers Association of Nigeria, OAAN have set up a 15-member committee to resolve lingering issues in the industry and chart a new way forward.
A source says issues to be addressed by the committee include media buyers, agency rate review, vacant board discount policy; 12.5 percent in the harmonized law, health and safety concerns, structural stability among others.
The meeting which held at the head office of LASAA in Ikeja, Lagos had major outdoor advertising practitioners in the state present. The constituted committee had seven members from OAAN and eight members from LASAA.Addressing the meeting, Managing Director, LASAA, Mobolaji Sanusi said in the agency's effort to improve the relationship between it and outdoor advertising practitioners, it visited some organisations with a view to understanding their challenges and the various problems in the outdoor advertising sector. They said the meeting was the outcome of the various visits, as LASAA had collated some of the concerns of the outdoor advertising practitioners.
“In our efforts to ensure sanity in the industry, it is important to find lasting solutions to some of the issues that have bedeviled the industry,” they said, adding that the meeting should be an opportunity to strengthen “our relations so that in the end, it's going to be a win-win for all of us.”
One of the critical issues discussed at the meeting were media buyers. The outdoor advertising practitioners decried a situation whereby major brands, such as Glo, Nigeria Breweries, among others, frequently owed the practitioners after their advertising campaigns had been displayed.

Watch: Limerick junior goalie pulls one out of the top drawer! 14 June 2017
Patrickswell goalkeeper Garry Murphy at full stretch during the City Junior A
Hurling League Final. Patrickswell goalkeeper Garry Murphy at full stretch during the City Junior AHurling League Final.
A Limerick junior hurling goalkeeper has been getting all the plaudits after producing a heroic save to help their club claim silverware last night.
Patrickswell's Garry Murphy pulled off a stunning stop to deny parish rivals Ballybrown a certain goal on the stroke of half-time in the City Junior A Hurling League Final at Claughan.
Ballybrown midfielder Emmett Hannon burst through the Patrickswell rearguard and unleashed a bullet shot towards Murphy's top left corner but the 'Well netminder showed superb reactions.
It was such a crucial moment in the game as a goal would have pushed Ballybrown into a two-point lead going into the break while Murphy kept a clean sheet with their side running out 1-10 to 0-10 winners.
Kevin Daly caught the action on video.
ISTANBUL (AP) — The Latest on Russian President Vladimir Putin's Mideast tour (all times local):
10:15 p.m.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has criticized the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, warning that it could destabilize the region and derail the Middle East peace process.
Speaking Monday after a hectic day that took them from a Russian base in Syria to Cairo and Ankara, Putin said the U.S. move "doesn't help the Mideast settlement and, just the other way round, destabilizes the already difficult situation in the region."
The Russian leader added that it may "finish prospects for the Palestinian-Israeli peace process."
They added that Moscow believes that the status of Jerusalem should be settled through talks between the Palestinians and Israel in line with United Nations resolutions.
The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

8:20 p.m.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Ankara to meet their Turkish counterpart, following visits to Syria and Egypt.
Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan are meeting Monday evening to discuss developments in Syria and the Middle East, as well as bilateral relations, according to the Turkish president's office.
Putin and Erdoğan met several times this year and regularly talk on the telephone as they and Iran work to broker a solution in Syria.
Relations between the two countries were tense after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet for violating its airspace in 2015. But the two have since restored bilateral relations.
Putin and Erdoğan are expected to hold a joint news conference after their meeting.
NEW YORK (AP) — A reputed Philadelphia mob boss known for beating murder raps, surviving attempts on their life and reinventing themselves as a restaurateur is back in court facing federal fraud charges.
Opening statements in the trial of Joseph "Skinny Joey" Merlino are set for Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.
Merlino, 55, was among nearly four dozen defendants arrested in a 2016 crackdown on an East Coast syndicate that prosecutors say committed crimes including extortion, loan-sharking, casino-style gambling, sports gambling, credit card fraud and health care fraud. It operated in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey.
Most of the defendants pleaded guilty to lesser charges, with Merlino the only one so far to go to trial. They have pleaded not guilty to charges that they conspired to bill insurers for unnecessary and excessive prescriptions for expensive compound creams in exchange for kickbacks.
The government plans to call mob turncoats as witnesses, including an associate with the New York-based Genovese crime family who made secret recordings of conversations with Merlino. The recordings captured them "supervising a number of individuals, questioning whether certain associates were 'rats,' collecting illegal gambling debt, engaging in a fraud against health insurers and conducting at least one sit-down to resolve a debt," court papers say.
Another witness is a government agent who served a five-day suspension after being accused of mishandling cooperators and investigative reports in the case, a topic the judge ruled the defense could cover in cross-examination.
The trial had originally been scheduled to begin in mid-January but was postponed for two weeks after Merlino, who has been free on $5 million bond and living in Florida, sought treatment for chest pains and shortness of breath.
The sharp-dressing Merlino once controlled the remnants of a Philadelphia-south Jersey organized crime family that was decimated by a bloody civil war in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal authorities say they were frequently targeted by murder plots after rivals put a $500,000 murder contract on their head.
They became a main suspect in a failed hit on another mob figure on Halloween 1989, but was never charged. They also served time for a $350,000 armored truck heist that same year.
In 2001, a jury acquitted Merlino and six co-defendants of three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder that could have put them in prison for life. They were convicted of lesser racketeering charges and served 12 years in prison before being released in 2011.
Merlino claimed that they retired from the mob for good by running an upscale Italian restaurant in Boca Raton. The since-closed restaurant was called Merlino's. In a 2013 interview, they said that life in the Mafia wasn't worth the stress of being double-crossed.
"Too many rats," they said. "I want no part of that."

The US government's duty on imported Bombardier CSeries airliners would increase to almost 300% after a second ruling issued by the US Commerce Department Friday. In its second ruling on Boeing's dispute against Bombardier over the sale of CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines, Commerce proposes imposing a price-dumping duty of almost 80% on each aircraft imported. This would be on top of the proposed almost 220% countervailing duty on CSeries imports that Commerce announced in ...
Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is expecting a sharp increase in the number of Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner planes that will have to be grounded because of faults with the engine maker's Trent 1000 turbine.
The spike will occur ahead of a deadline next month for mandated inspections forced by durability problems, Rolls said in an emailed statement. The number of parked Dreamliners is expected to peak at about 50 from the current level of 35, a person familiar with the matter said, as the aircraft await repairs.
About 80% of the Package C engine variant, which debuted with Boeing's marquee 787-9 jetliner, have undergone initial checks for cracking or signs of wear and tear on turbine blades, the person said. Just under a third of those engines have failed the initial checks required by regulators for planes that fly more than two hours and 20 minutes from the nearest diversionary airport.
“We fully recognize the unacceptable levels of disruption our customers are facing,” Chris Cholerton, the company's president of civil aerospace, said in the statement. “While we expect the number of aircraft affected to rise in the short term as the deadline for the completion of initial inspections approaches, we are confident that we have the right building blocks in place to tackle the additional workload.”
Rolls-Royce shares fell 0.6% to 822 pence as of 8:24 a.m. in London on Wednesday.
Shorter Routes
The engine woes have prompted some carriers to place their 787s on shorter routes, giving them more operating time ahead of a June 9 inspection deadline mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Since the FAA's directive in April, Rolls has put measures in place to triple the number of engines it can service at any time, including the development of a new ultrasonic testing technique that can be performed while the turbine is still attached to the aircraft.
The tripling of capacity and the number of Dreamliners likely to be grounded were reported earlier by the Financial Times.
Additional measures to boost capacity at sites in Singapore, London, and Derby, England, are underway, the company said. The problems center on potential cracking of the Trent's intermediate pressure compressor blades.
Roll has also reduced maintenance turnaround times and is accelerating the redesign of the blades that have caused the latest disruption. That part has already been installed on a test engine that will fly in June, and the final design will be rolled out to customers later this year -- ahead of the previous guidance of early 2019.
Restructuring Plan
The stepped-up inspections won't cause any additional financial impact, Rolls said. The company is due to unveil a new restructuring plan authored by Alvarez & Marsal at its next capital markets day on June 15.
Chief Executive Officer Warren East has said Rolls will reduce discretionary spending to offset the additional spending needed for overhauls and to keep to a key target of reaching 1 billion pounds in free cash flow by 2020.
“The scale of the additional Trent 1000 maintenance cost remains to be seen, and we're not sure how Rolls can miraculously offset this,” Rob Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said in a note earlier this month. “The company has not disclosed that much, and this leaves us concerned that the maintenance costs could further escalate.”
Boeing has meanwhile positioned Keith Leverkuhn, best known for leading the development of the upgraded 737 months ahead of schedule, between Derby and Singapore to help Rolls work through the escalating engine problems.
“We are drawing on the full resources of Rolls-Royce to address the issue and I've seen great teamwork and innovative thinking both across our organization and in our partnership with Boeing,” Cholerton said.

Bunny Sigler, Who Helped Create 1970s Philly Sound, Dies
by Lillie Dunn
A singer, songwriter and producer who helped create the “The Sound of Philadelphia” in the 1970s has died.
Walter “Bunny” Sigler was 76. A singer, songwriter and producer who helped create the “The Sound of Philadelphia” in the 1970s has died. Walter “Bunny” Sigler was 76.
Their longtime attorney, Lloyd Zane Remick, said Sigler died of a heart attack Friday at their home outside Philadelphia.
Sigler worked with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in developing a genre that blended soul, funk and big band styles, and cemented the city in the country's musical landscape with its lush horn ensembles and smooth vocals.
Gamble says Sigler was one of the most talented songwriters and producers they ever worked with. As a performer, Sigler was known for such hits as “Let the Good Times Roll & (Feel So Good).”
Their career spanned decades and saw collaborations with acts as varied as Patti LaBelle and Jay-Z.

People who snore loudly are up to three times more likely to develop dementia, according to new research.
The study suggests it cuts off oxygen supply during sleep which can lead to brain damage.
Sleep apnoea is the most common sleep disorder, affecting about 1.5 million Brits, and is treated by wearing a mask in bed that blows air into the back of the throat.
Now the first study of its kind is being launched to see if the therapy prevents dementia – the UK's biggest killer.
Professor Elizabeth Coulson, of the Queensland Brain Institute at the University of Queensland, said: “Treating sleep apnoea may reduce dementia risk.
“People who suffer from sleep apnoea are two to three times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.
“This could be because hypoxia – lower levels of oxygen in the blood from poor breathing – causes nerve cell death.”
The condition is caused when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax, causing a blockage of the airways.
It interferes with breathing, often stopping it altogether for short periods many times a night leading to lack of oxygen, restless sleep and heavy snoring.
The condition blights the lives of about one in 20 people – five per cent of the population. Twice more common in men than women, it can begin at any time, including childhood. Many sufferers are unaware they have it.
So Prof Coulson and colleagues are enrolling sleep apnoea patients aged 55 to 75 to see if wearing the CPAP (Continuous Positive Airways Pressure) mask stops or slows brain degeneration.
The team found inadequate oxygen levels during sleep can harm and neurons and raise the risk of developing Alzheimer's.
Prof Coulson explained people sleep apnoea results in lower levels of oxygen in the blood, known medically as hypoxia. This can triple the risk of Alzheimer's. The researchers have been investigating the mechanisms by which this occurs, finding hypoxia leads to the degeneration of an area of the brain important for attention and learning.
Prof Coulson said sleep apnoea affects more than a million Australian adults, and is usually treated with CPAP.
It consists of a plastic mask that fits over the nose and mouth and is connected to a machine that blows air under low pressure continually into the back of the throat,
Prof Coulson said this keeps the airway open, helps maintain correct oxygen levels and, ultimately allows for a better quality sleep.
The response is immediate and obvious after only a few hours or one night.
They said: “The next stage of our research involves following patients with sleep apnoea over an extended period of time to determine whether CPAP protects against cognitive decline.”
Sleep apnoea is a serious condition which can lead to other problems such as high blood pressure, which in turn can lead to strokes and heart attacks.
Professor Pankaj Sah, director of the Queensland Brain Institute, said the research could lead to initiating early intervention in patients.
They added: “Sleep disturbances can occur up to 10 years prior to Alzheimer's disease.
“Considering that Alzheimer's affects roughly one third of the elderly population, this important research may inform preventative public health measures in the future.”
Sleep apnoea causes excessive sleepiness and tiredness during the day so that people often fall asleep at work, during meals or even standing up.
In drivers or people working with heavy machinery the dangers are clear.
There is good evidence to show that the incidence of road accidents is high in individuals with the condition.
It also means that people become depressed or bad tempered and lacking in concentration, disrupting their social lives and relationships.
Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia and now affects more than 500,000 people in the UK – a figure expected to triple by 2050. Dementia affects the ability to remember, think and reason.
To survive in the amusement park industry, Craig Buster and Scott Carothers always have to be thinking ahead.
Buster, general manager of Coconut Bowl, and Carothers, general manager of Wild Island Waterpark at Wild Island Family Adventure Park, are constantly pondering new ideas to keep customers coming through the turnstiles.
"We always have a five-year plan and we're always looking at long-term growth in the best- and worst-case scenarios regarding the economy," Carothers said in a recent interview with the NNBW at Wild Island.
With northern Nevada's economy on the upswing, the business partners figured it was finally time to make some major upgrades to the park.
"Right now we're in the best case scenario with the local economy," added Buster, who also participated in the interview. "I think we're actually a year too late (on our latest projects), but we'll move fast to catch up."
Buster and Carothers explained changes to the park have been on the table for a long time, but they were hesitant to pull the trigger.
"We could've gone a little faster but we chose to play a little conservative," Carothers said. "I think most businesses like ours are going that route post-recession."
But when Wild Island's staff attended the 2017 Directions event presented by The Chamber of Reno, Sparks and Northern Nevada earlier this year, the talk of the region's booming economy convinced Buster and Carothers that they'd better move quickly on improvements at Wild Island.
"I think that will be huge for us," Buster said about the resurgent economy.
Coconut Bowl soon will undergo a 50,000-square-foot expansion project, including adding six bowling lanes, private party rooms, an outdoor patio and seating area and a two-story laser tag arena. A black light go-kart course also will be built indoors and will feature battery-powered go-karts. The current kiddie track will be moved indoors. More redemption and arcade games are on the way including Baseball Pro, Angry Birds Arcade, and Ghostbusters Arcade.
The Coconut Bowl project is expected to be completed by summer 2018 and the center would remain open during construction.
Wild Island's waterpark will introduce a brand-new waterslide called G-Force that will debut when it opens for the summer season in May. Carothers said the 300-foot thrill ride will have guests traveling at speeds of about 25 miles per hour. The ride also will feature a kaleidoscope of colors at one turn and portions of transparent fiberglass, so those awaiting at the tower can witness other riders experience the ride's initial heartpounding drop.
Carothers said they want to introduce a waterslide at the park every so often to keep the park fresh and exciting for guests, but will continue to cater to its main demographics — families and a growing older population that prefer more casual rides.
"You don't a park that's all thrill rides because it's a small niche," Carothers said. "We have to have a good mix of family rides, thrill rides, taking into account all heights and ages."
GuiDenby, Inc., a Reno-based architecture and general contracting firm owned by Robb and Allyson Wong, is overseeing the projects at both Coconut Bowl and the waterpark.
The park attracts 300,000 to 400,000 visitors a year, including 100,000 to 120,000 to the waterpark during spring and summer months. Buster and Carothers estimate about 60 percent of guests are locals, although they sense more visitors are coming from outside the area, especially northern California.
Carothers also mentioned the development of The Outlet at Sparks shopping center has been beneficial.
"There's some real synergy going with the shopping center and other restaurant concepts that have come in."
Wild Island's staff members often discreetly meander around the park to get a general sense of guests' attitudes of their experience at the park.
"Craig and I walk around a lot," Carothers said. "If you go out on a busy day, you can get a sense of what people are truly feeling."
"I'll pick out four or five families at the park and observe if they are generally happy," Buster added. "About every two to three years you have to add something new so it doesn't get stale for our guests."
Some new ideas haven't always panned out, though. For instance, in the early 2000s Wild Island introduced a roller coaster. It was soon scrapped.
"We have kissed a few frogs over the years," Buster said.
"We went through some restaurant concepts and the roller coaster idea was an interesting experience," they said with a chuckle. "But I think we've made some strides along the way and we're really excited about the expansion this time around."
Wild Island began in 1989 solely as a waterpark. The Coconut Bowl entertainment center was added a few years later. Carothers began their career at Wild Island the same year it opened while Buster joined the staff in 1993.
Buster and Carothers attribute the park's long-term success to the sound working relationship they have with Wild Island's ownership group.
"They want to be profitable, but they want to do what's best for the community," Carothers said. "They've sometimes made decisions when it wasn't the best business move, but they wanted to put out a good product that we feel can compete with anyone in the country."
ERIN, Wis. (AP) — A hole-by-hole look at Erin Hill Golf Club, site of the 117th U.S. Open to be played June 15-18:
No. 1, 608 yards, par 5: The last time the U.S. Open began with a true par 5 was at Olympia Fields in 2003 (the first hole at Chambers Bay played a par 5 and a par 4). A tee shot up the left side, closer to the wetlands, will help the hole play shorter. Players going for the green will negotiate a right-to-left slope in the fairway that can feed the ball toward the small green. This should be a good birdie chance.
No. 2, 338 yards, par 4 : The shortest par 4 on the course features a partially blind tee shot. Those trying to drive the green will have to be precise because the green is the smallest at Erin Hills and slopes from front to back. Anything left will leave a delicate pitch from below the green. A bunker is right of the green.
No. 3, 508 yards, par 4: The fairway is well-bunkered and slopes significantly to the left in the landing area. The approach is slightly uphill and is guarded with a bunker short of the green, and two bunkers on each side of the putting surface. The green features two levels divided by a pronounced ridge.
No. 4, 439 yards, par 4: Tee shots must avoid fairway bunkers. The absence of trees makes it difficult to pick a line for the uphill second shots, and players should avoid going over the greens because of the closely mown area behind the green. The putting surface is shallow and features a false front.
No. 5, 505 yards, par 4: This is the first hole that goes in an easterly direction. It has a pair of bunkers on the right side of the fairway. The front bunker is perpendicular to the green, which has a backstop on the left that can feed a shot back onto the green.
No. 6, 208 yards, par 3: The first par 3 plays with the prevailing wind and features the longest green on the course at 48 yards. It slopes away from front to back, obscuring the back part of the green. A forward tee is likely to be used for any front pin positions.
No. 7, 607 yards, par 5: The hole has 14 bunkers, several of them making the landing area tight. This plays into the prevailing wind, and more bunkers could come into play on the second shot. Approach shots that miss right leave a tough up-and-down on the largest green at Erin Hills, with a ridge that defines distinct quadrants.
No. 8, 492 yards, par 4: The tee shot is partially blind, and while it has no bunkers in the landing area, the fairway slopes to the right as the holes bends to the left. Three deep bunkers front a shallow green (26 yards). There is a slope on the back left of the green that should help feed the ball toward the middle.
No. 9, 135 yards, par 3 : The shorter the hole, the more loft in the shot, and the more the wind can wreak havoc. That's why the shortest hole at Erin Hills should not be underestimated. The tee is about 25 feet higher than the narrow green. The green has a false front and slopes from front left to back right. It is surrounded by bunkers, with the most daunting at the back left of the green.
No. 10, 504 yards, par 4: The 10th hole is the only one that plays in a northerly direction and has a large landing area with plenty of contours, including a slope that can send the ball bounding further down the fairway. The green is only 24 yards deep and bisected by a ridge. The right side is smaller and slightly raised.
No. 11, 460 yards, par 4: The blind tee shot is one of the most intimidating on the course, and players will have to choose their line to a fairway set on an angle from right to left. The deep bunkers fronting the green are not as close to the putting surface as they appear. The small green slopes from left to right and from back to front.
No. 12, 464 yards, par 4: The landing area is narrow, and players can get more roll down the right side. But a miss to the right could leave an awkward sidehill or downhill lie for the second shot to an extremely narrow green that is crowned, with subtle slopes running toward the front and back of the green.
No. 13, 193 yards, par 3: The tee shot goes from hill to hill and has a large bunker to the left of the green, along with a swale that helps feed errant shots into it. Players who miss the green to the right will likely see their ball fall away, leaving an uphill pitch to a green that slopes away from them. The green is 40 yards deep and has a small plateau at the front left.
No. 14, 594 yards par 5: Tee shots that favor the right side provide a better angle of attack to the green, and those who attempt to reach the green in two must hit a precise shot, guarding particularly against the severe drop-off to the right. A variety of shot options are available from the closely mown areas around the green, which features a large false front.
No. 15, 357 yards, par 4 : The back nine also has a short par 4 that requires precision for those who hit driver. The putting surface is small and slightly elevated, which will repel a shot that slightly misses. Laying up requires players to face a wedge into a green surrounded by several bunkers. A spine bisects the green, and players will face a tough two-putt if they're on the wrong side.
No. 16, 183 yards, par 3: This plays in an easterly direction to an elevated green angled from the front right to the back left. The two-tiered putting surface is 42 yards deep but very narrow, and it slopes significantly from back to front. There are deep, narrow bunkers on both sides of the green.
No. 17, 509 yards, par 4: This is the only hole at Erin Hills without a bunker. The fairway is undulating, meaning there will not be many even lies for the second shot. A large mound on the left can obscure the player's view of the green, particularly from the left side. Approach shots that miss long or to the right can bounce away from the green, which slopes from back to front.
No. 18, 637 yards, par 5: This joins Chambers Bay (on two days) and Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach as U.S. Open courses that end with a par 5, though this one should be a three-shot hole. Two accurate shots are required to get into range for the wedge shot to the green. Players who get out of position will have a hard time catching up because of several bunkers that come into play. And the green is receptive only to short shots.

The globalists are ready to crack down on cash. ( Public Domain )
Their agenda may be on the rocks in the United States at the moment, but that doesn't mean that the globalists are giving up. In fact, a major push toward a cashless society is being made in the European Union right now.
Last May we learned that the 500 euro note is being completely eliminated, and just a few weeks ago, the European Commission released a new "Action Plan" which instructs member states to explore "potential upper limits to cash payments." In the name of "fighting terrorism", this "Action Plan" discusses the benefits of "prohibitions for cash payments above a specific threshold" and says those prohibitions should include "virtual currencies (such as BitCoin) and prepaid instruments (such as prepaid credit cards) when they are used anonymously."
This new document does not mention what an appropriate threshold would be for member states, but we do know that Spain already bans certain cash transactions above 2,500 euros, and Italy and France already ban cash transactions above 1,000 euros.
This is a perfect way to transition to a cashless society without creating too much of an uproar. By setting a maximum legal level for cash transactions and slowly lowering it, in effect you can slowly but surely phase out cash without people understanding what is happening.
And there are many places in Europe where it is very difficult even to use cash at this point. In Sweden, many banks no longer take or give out cash, and approximately 95 percent of all retail transactions are entirely cashless. So even though Sweden has not officially banned cash, using cash is no longer practical in most situations. In fact, many tourists are shocked to find out that they cannot even pay bus fare with cash.
So most of Europe is already moving in this direction, and now this new Action Plan is intended to accelerate the transition toward a cashless society. The public is being told that these measures are being taken to fight money laundering and terrorism, but of course, that is only a small part of the truth. The following comes from the Anti-Media:
The European Action Plan doesn't mention a specific dollar amount for restrictions, but as expected, their reasoning for the move is to thwart money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Border checks between countries have already been bolstered to help implement these new standards on hard assets. Although these end goals are plausible, there are other clear motivations for governments to target paper money that aren't as noble.
In a truly cashless society, governments would be able to track where everybody is and what everybody is doing all the time. And in order to have access to the cashless system, people would have to comply with whatever requirements governments wanted to impose on their helpless populations. The potential for tyranny that this would create would be off the charts, but few people seem greatly alarmed by the move toward a cashless system all over the globe.
Even in the United States, there are calls for a cashless system. For example, the former chief economist for the IMF wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal not too long ago in which they recommended the elimination of the $100 bill:
There is little debate among law-enforcement agencies that paper currency, especially large notes such as the U.S. $100 bill, facilitates crime: racketeering, extortion, money laundering, drug and human trafficking, the corruption of public officials, not to mention terrorism. There are substitutes for cash—cryptocurrencies, uncut diamonds, gold coins, prepaid cards—but for many kinds of criminal transactions, cash is still king. It delivers absolute anonymity, portability, liquidity and near-universal acceptance.
Over in Asia, restrictions are being put on cash as well. Legendary investor Jim Rogers commented on what is currently happening in India during one recent podcast. The time will come when you won't be able to buy a cup of coffee without being traced, the investment guru warns. To control people, governments will increasingly seek to hunt down cash spending, they add. In an interview with MacroVoices podcast, they said:
Governments are always looking out for themselves first, and it's the same old thing that has been going on for hundreds of years. The Indians recently did the same thing. They withdrew 86 percent of the currency in circulation, and they have now made it illegal to spend more than, I think it's about $4,000 in any cash transaction. In France, you cannot use more than, I think it's a €1,000.
The reason this is taking place all over the planet is because this is a global agenda.
The globalists ultimately plan to completely eliminate cash, and this will give them an unprecedented level of control over humanity.
One thing that many fear may someday be implemented is some form of microchip identification system. In order to access the cashless grid, you would need your "ID chip" so that the system could positively identify you, but of course there are millions of people around the world that do not intend to get chipped under any circumstances.
In the old days, you would be labeled a "conspiracy theorist" just for suggesting that they may try to chip all of us one day, but in 2017 things have completely changed.

Just look at what is happening in Nevada. A bill has been introduced in the state Senate that would outlaw the "forced microchipping of people":
State Sen. Becky Harris said a bill to prohibit forced microchipping of people is not as far-fetched as it might seem, because it happens in some places around the world. Senate Bill 109 would make it a Class C felony to require someone to be implanted with a radio frequency identifier, such as microchips placed in pets. The idea for the bill came from a constituent, the Las Vegas Republican said.
If that sounds very strange to you, then you may not know that companies all around the globe are already starting to explore this type of technology. For instance, a company in Belgium called NewFusion has actually begun to microchip its employees:
In a move that could be lifted straight from science fiction, workers at a Belgian marketing firm are being offered the chance to have microchips implanted in their bodies. The chips contain personal information and provide access to the company's IT systems and headquarters, replacing existing ID cards. The controversial devices raise questions about personal security and safety, including whether they may allow the movements of people with implants to be tracked.
Technology like this often starts off being "voluntary," but then after enough people willingly accept it, the transition to "mandatory" is not too difficult.
We live at one of the most critical moments in all of human history, and the globalists are certainly not going to lie down and die just because Donald Trump won the election.
The U.S. represents less than five percent of the population of the planet, and in most of the world, the agenda of the globalists is on-track and rapidly advancing.
The globalists want a unified one-world economy, a unified one-world religion and a unified one-world government. The election of Donald Trump was a blow to the globalists, but it has also made them more dangerous, more ruthless and more determined than ever before.
And in case you think that using the term "globalists" is a bit strange, the truth is that even the New York Times is using it to describe the global elite and their global agenda.
We are in a life-or-death battle for the future of our society, and the globalists are never going to give up until they get what they want. So now is not a time for complacency, because the very future of our country is at stake.

After 10 years of lean, threadbare, Lilliputian tales, Marvel Studios has, thank heavens, finally decided to go big.
The scale of "Avengers: Infinity War," of course, isn't a departure for Marvel. It's an apotheosis. But is it possible to supersize what is already colossal? "Infinity War," which brings together more than 30 significant characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and enough spandex to clothe a small nation, is a little like launching an invasion after the war was already won. Despite assured dominance, Marvel has gone nuclear.
"Infinity" is an interesting word for the Marvel machine, which sets much of its development pipeline a decade in advance. Never-ending is indeed how the superhero era of blockbusterdom sometimes feels, both to its fans and its critics. Even Steven Spielberg, who once said superheroes will eventually go the way of the western, recently signed on to produce a DC Comics film.
But the title refers to the six "infinity stones" scattered around the universe, each conveying a power of sorcery, like the time-warping one held by Doctor Strange. They are dearly sought by Thanos, the indestructible Titan warlord, who rules over much of space but would like all of it. With all the McGuffins — er, stones — they can, with the snap of their fingers, wipe away half of the universe's beings: a rapture to cull an overgrown herd, they envision.
And it's, in part, the lure of finality that has made "Infinity War," directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (veterans of two "Captain America" movies), one of the year's most salivated-over movies. The preamble has been one long tease — we have seen fleeting glimpses of Thanos (Josh Brolin) since Barack Obama's first term — leading up to a battle royal that could mean the demise of some of Marvel's most famous faces.
It can be hard to know who or what to root for. Arguably the best quality — and most vital asset — of the Marvel canon is its star-making (or at least star-expanding) power. On the one hand, Chris Pratt's performance as Star-Lord in "The Guardians of the Galaxy" has been terrific and turned them into a household name. On the other hand, we've hardly seen Robert Downey Jr. outside of the Iron Man suit in the last decade. It took 18 months to shoot both parts of "Infinity War" back-to-back (the sequel is due out next summer), putting a stranglehold on some of our best movie stars, like Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Mackie. Faint cries can be heard on the street of: "Let our Ruffalo go!"
And it's really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes "Infinity War" — an "Ocean's Eleven" in hyper drive — work. The screenplay, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, spreads the heroes around in improvised groups that create some funny dynamics. The Guardians, who inject most of the life to "Infinity War," swoon for Hemsworth's one-eyed Thor. "He's like a pirate had a baby with an angel," says Dave Bautista's Drax. Many don't know each other, or the parameters of their shared "cinematic universe." ''There's an Ant-Man AND a Spider-Man?" remarks Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, a.k.a. the Hulk.
The level playing field is a chance to rebalance the Marvel pecking order, most recently upended by Chadwick Boseman and "Black Panther." Neither Chris Evans' Captain "Cap" America nor Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example, make much of an impact on "Infinity War." But Zoe Saldana, as the green-skinned Gamora, strides to the fore, as does Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. "Infinity War" rarely, surprisingly feels as overstuffed as such a superhero smorgasbord ought to, a testament to the filmmakers' adept plate-spinning skills.
That may be because "Infinity War" doesn't really belong to the superheroes. This is Brolin's film. Already an actor who can appear chiseled from granite, their Thanos is an imposing boulder of a villain, with weary eyes and lined creases running down their massive chin. They and their adoptive daughter, Gamora, are the only characters with much of a story in "Infinity War." He's the immovable object around which the gaggle of superheroes orbits.
There may be some hint of overpopulation anxiety in Thanos' ambition and in the Russos' frighteningly overcrowded film. Its saviors repeatedly contemplate sacrifice. Previous "Avengers" chapters and the Russos' "Captain America: Civil War" expended some effort considering the Avengers' place in society and whether they should be controlled by the state. But this movie, a sensory onslaught, has little room for political subtext.
Still, I doubt such gestures of allegory are anyone's favorite part of the Marvel movies. Most come for the action, the quips and the characters, and I suspect "Infinity War" will deliver for most — particularly thanks to the Guardians. In such a bruisingly long showdown, the action sequences — never the strongpoint of the Russos, who cut their teeth on comic ensemble like "Arrested Development" and "Community" — grow monotonous, and the interludes amid the rubble more infrequent. But if "Infinity War" is a lavish reunion tour propelled by star power, the Russos are sure to plays the hits.
The movie's ending — just one of the spoilers that divulging here would bring Thanos' fist down upon me — will be the major talking point. But for me, its power only lasts as long as a commercial break with an easy-to-see-through "to be continued." Who lives and who dies? It's hard to fret too much with an eternity of sequels and spinoffs lined up.
"Avengers: Infinity War," a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for "intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, language and some crude references." Running time: 149 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

Dangote Will Be The Largest Exporter Of Rice In 5 Years – AfDB
President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, has predicted that business mogul, Aliko Dangote, may become the largest exporter of rice globally in the next five years.
They said Africa must focus on agriculture to drive growth and create jobs on the continent.
The former minister of Agriculture in Nigeria who spoke at the Mo Ibrahim Forum in Morocco at the weekend recalled that when they (Adesina) was minister, Dangote was the biggest importer in the country at the time.
According to him, Dangote looked at the policies put in place then and changed their business model from being an importer to a local producer.
Recounting the role the richest man in Africa played on a day they also considered their happiest day as a minister in Nigeria, Adesina said, “Dangote decided to invest $300 million in producing and processing rice in Nigeria and later changed their mind from the amount to $1 billion.
“If they continue that policy, they would probably be the single largest producer of rice in the world in about four years. The reason why I was so excited about that is that agriculture is cool, agriculture is a business that pays in the long run”.
LEADERSHIP recalls that a tripartite agreement put together by Dangote Rice limited, a subsidiary of the Dangote Group, to create jobs for 16,000 outgrower rice farmers in Sokoto was recently signed with the Sokoto State government and rice growers in the country, after which they launched the rice outgrowers scheme in the state.
The chairperson of Dangote Rice Limited said the company was moved to go into rice cultivation because of the genuine interest of the federal government to revive agriculture as the mainstay of the economy and reduce importation of foods that could be produced locally.
Dangote who lamented that Nigeria consumes 6.5 metric tonnes of rice which costs the nation over $2 billion annually noted, however, that it was heartening that government now has policy direction which encourages private sector's active participation in agriculture.
They said, “In the next three years, we want to produce one million tons of quality rice and make it available and affordable to the people. We hope to do 150,000 per hectare and when we are done, Nigeria will not have anything to do with importation of rice.
“Dangote Rice outgrowers scheme is committed to creating significant number of jobs, increasing the incomes of small holders farmers and ensuring food security in the country by providing high quality seeds, fertilizers and agro-chemicals as well as technical assistance on best agricultural practice to farmers.
“This Scheme will help to diversify the economy, alleviate poverty and reduce the nation's import bill. The scheme has been designed as a one-stop solution for the rice value chain”.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — As Nemanja Matic was winning towering headers, intercepting passes, dribbling round opponents and generally running the midfield in their first Premier League game for Manchester United, imagine what Antonio Conte must have been thinking.
The Chelsea coach didn't want to sell Matic, particularly not to title rival like United. But an offer of 40 million pounds ($53 million) for a 29-year-old was too good for Chelsea's hierarchy to turn down.
It could prove to be one of the most pivotal pieces of business done in the offseason.
Romelu Lukaku stole the spotlight in United's 4-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, scoring two goals, but it was Matic — a player costing around half as much this summer — who was the key to the performance.
They dominated Old Trafford in their first match there as a United player, looking every inch the holding midfielder the team needs with Michael Carrick nearing the end of their time at the club.
"He is a player I call a stability player," Mourinho said of Matic.
They were more than that against West Ham. In a man-of-the-match display, they made more passes (69) and covered more distance (11.41 kilometers) than anybody else on the field, while they won more tackles and had more touches (89) than any other United player.
One minute Matic was beating three players with sublime skill and racing down the right touchline. The next they were scooping a pass, Karel Poborsky-style, to Paul Pogba to set up another attack.
They won big headers from goal kicks and long clearances by West Ham, and read the game masterfully. Eric Bailly and Phil Jones, United's center backs, generally cruised through the 90 minutes with Matic in front of them.
Crucially, and as has been widely predicted, Matic's presence allowed Pogba more freedom to roam forward in central midfield. With strikers Lukaku and Marcus Rashford stretching play with their runs and Pogba making the most of the space behind, United was so much more dangerous.
Pogba scored the fourth goal from 25 meters out in the 90th minute. They hit the goal frame (10 times) more often than scoring (nine goals) last season, but this season could be different — and they could have Matic largely to thank.
Mourinho cannot believe their luck that Matic is their player again, having brought the Serbia international to Chelsea from Benfica in 2014.
Asked if it was a surprise that Chelsea sold Matic to United, Mourinho said: "It depends on what is happening, or what was happening behind doors. I don't know. Only thing I know is that, of course, with Chelsea money, I brought them to Stamford Bridge because I thought they were a player with special qualities. And since I left, I always thought they could be a perfect player for us.
"But I didn't disturb him, I didn't disturb Chelsea. I never thought it was possible unless something special was happening, and it looked like something was happening because their agent told me, 'You can have him; you just have to pay.' So, we have them and we are very happy with that.  They are a player that our team needs."
Chelsea needs him, too, at the moment.
Conte is short on numbers after a frustrating summer in the transfer market. Tiemoue Bakayoko was signed from Monaco, to complement Matic rather than replace him. Bakayoko is currently out injured, leaving Chelsea with Cesc Fabregas and N'Golo Kante as central midfielders.
And Fabregas is now banned after their sending-off in Chelsea's 3-2 loss to Burnley on Saturday.
"My idea was to give Bakayoko the right time to adapt in this league behind Matic," Conte said. "But now after the sale of Matic, we need to try to accelerate this process for Bakayoko after their injury."
Conte described the departure of Matic as a "great loss" to Chelsea and has said it was a boardroom decision.
"Sometimes you must accept this crazy transfer market," they said.
Spending 40 million pounds on a 29-year-old defensive midfielder doesn't sound like sensible business, but the arrival of Matic has knitted things together perfectly so far for United.
It could be the transfer that tips the battle for the Premier League title United's way.

They just might be the youngest recruit in history for the University of Hawaii Football team. Titan Lacaden is an 11-year old wide receiver with the All-Blacks Crusaders in Kapolei.
"He's definitely a special kid," said Frank Lacaden, Titan's father and co-founder of the All-Blacks Crusaders Football Club.
Titan just finished 5th grade, and their family says they already have their first offer to play college football with the Rainbow Warriors.
"It was heavy, it felt like a whole block of cinderblocks came on my shoulders," said Titan.
The University of Hawaii at Manoa is one of their top three schools, and their mother's top choice.
"My mom is forcing me to go to UH, they don't want me to leave home," said Titan.
Titan's father said they knew football was their son's game when Titan picked up a football and threw it for the first time at 2-years-old, and as Titan got older, their talent only grew.
"I've been coaching for over 25 years, at St. Louis High School, and a few years here at Kapolei, and I've been here and I've seen a lot of kids and done a lot of camps, and at this age I have not seen somebody with the skills that they have," said Frank.
Frank said Coach Nick Rolovich talked to their family at football camp.
"Rolo pulled me on the side and asked me how I felt about a fifth grader, my son, being offered," said Frank.
They decided to go with it.
"I've been through the recruiting process many times, and it's a long, vigorous, narrow road, and many reach the door, but there are many times that the door just doesn't answer, and so when opportunity knocks you've got to enter, you've got to go, and so we went in," said Frank.
Titan has seven years before they get to play college football. Until then, he's focused on their love of the game, a passion he'll continue to share with friends in the youth program who help make them a better player.

Customs revenue rises with N136bn seizures
By Godwin Oritse, Godfrey Bivbere & Glory Onyeagu
TWO commands of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, on seizure rampage raked in about N136.6 billion revenue, with the large haul coming from the Apapa Command which intercepted among other items unprocessed wood export.
The command raised over N136billion between January and May this year, while Federal Operations Unit, FOU, Zone “A”, the anti-smuggling arm of the NCS, raised N607.7 million.
For Apapa command the revenue represents a massive increase of 38.8 percent over N98billion collected within the same period of 2016.
Disclosing this in Lagos, the Customs Area Comptroller, Apapa, Mr. Mohammed Jubrin said the command's enforcement unit effected a total of 24 seizures including containers of different items, such as frozen fish, medicaments, pharmaceuticals which were either falsely declared or under-declared resulting to under payment of customs duties.
They stated: “We have also intercepted and detained some export containers of scrap metal, wet blue leather and unprocessed wood which fall under export prohibition. Investigations are ongoing and sanctions will be applied in line with extant laws.” Besides, the revenue generated from import duties, over N1.8billion was also realized from identified infractions within the period under review.
In a similar development the FOU, yesterday, said that it has impounded assorted cargo with Duty Paid Value, DPV, of N334 million that was smuggled into the country. The Customs Area Controller, CAC, of the Unit, Comptroller Mohammed Uba Garba, at a press briefing in Lagos, said that the intercepted goods includes 6,356 bags of 50 kilograms of rice, 2,495 cartons of poultry products, 13 vehicles and 384 parcels of 232kilograms of Indian Hemp, among other items.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Atlantic City, New Jersey, is trying to put years of casino closings and job losses behind it.
Since 2014, five of its 12 casinos have closed, putting 11,000 people out of work.
For many laid-off workers, the first step on the road to recovery started Tuesday, when the shuttered former Trump Taj Mahal casino began interviewing job applicants for its reincarnation this summer as a Hard Rock casino resort.
The event was for former Taj employees. About 1,600 such workers were invited to apply for jobs, and 1,400 did.
Former Taj dealer Monica Weekes described themselves during their interview as "fun first."
Hard Rock will create more than 3,000 jobs. And the former Revel casino is reopening as the Ocean Resort casino and will add thousands more.
Thousands of Australians gathered at pre-dawn services on Wednesday to commemorate the moment when Australian and New Zealand Army Corps troops waded ashore at the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey 103 years ago in their first major battle of World War I.
Because extremists have targeted annual ANZAC Day ceremonies in the past, concrete barriers were placed around the service in downtown Sydney to protect those who gathered at Martin Place.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, their French counterpart Edouard Philippe and the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, will mark ANZAC Day in France with a service that also commemorates the 100th anniversary of Australian troops taking the town of Villers-Bretonneux from the Germans. Villers-Bretonneux is now home to the main Australian Memorial of the Western Front.
At Villers-Bretonneux, Turnbull and Philippe on Tuesday unveiled a memorial plaque at the new Sir John Monash Centre museum which is named after the Australian general responsible for taking the town.
Turnbull and their wife, Lucy, also visited the grave of their great uncle Roger Hughes who was killed by a German shell in 1916 dive days after arriving on the Western Front as a young military doctor.
Turnbull said in an ANZAC Day message that Australians remember veterans of every generation who risked their lives for their country.
"We best honor the ANZACs of 1918 and the First World War by supporting today's service men and women," Turnbull said on social media.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton represents the Australian government at a service at ANZAC Cove at Gallipoli, where the Australian and New Zealand troops landed under British command in an ill-fated attempt to take the Ottoman Empire out of the war.
More than 44,000 Allied soldiers were killed at Gallipoli. Turkish casualties were estimated at 250,000.
At the Australian War Memorial in the capital Canberra, an estimated crowd of 38,000 — 10 percent of the city's population — gathered in the cool autumn darkness for the dawn service which began with a lone soldier playing a didgeridoo.
"The attendance at this year's dawn service shows the enduring connection so many people have to Anzac Day," Memorial Director Brendan Nelson said in a statement.
Bronx, NY – The Retire 21 campaign to retire Roberto Clemente's # 21 leaped another level forward when hundreds of people attended a Salsa concert at Orchard Beach dedicated to the Retire 21 campaign.
Some of the most respected names in Salsa music performed under the directorship of many times Grammy winner, Nelson González. Joining Mr. González were some veterans of Salsa like Nicky Marrero on Timbales, Johnny Rodríguez on Bongo's, Frankie Vásquez on vocals just to name a few of the All-Stars. Younger Salsero musicians joined the veterans and together they played some of the best Salsa music that had the crowd cheering and dancing for the entire hour and a half that they performed.
All the musicians were the first to sign the petition and they encouraged the audience to also sign.
Latino Sports was the community sponsor and President; Julio Pabón opened the event thanking the Bronx Borough President for having the Summer Salsa Concert Series at Orchard Beach. They also thanked The Bronx Tourism Council and Bronx Lebanon Hospital for providing their Health Mobile unit to provide free health screenings.
People were eager to sign the petition as the musicians made frequent announcements in between breaks reminded them to visit the table and sign. Several asked to take some blank sheets with them, they promised to get signatures from neighbors and co-workers.
The signed petitions will be added to others that have been collected and sent to baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred in December, the month that Clemente lost their lives in that fatal airplane crash on their way to deliver relief to the devastated country of Nicaragua that suffered a devastating earthquake.

Members of the Laguna Niguel-based St. Anne School's HarmonKnights Show Choir recently traveled to Vatican City to participate in the third annual Youth and Young Adult Choir Festival for Epiphany. The students sang for the mass at the Basilica of St. Francis and the Papal Mass for the Feast of Epiphany at St. Peter's Basilica in front of Pope Francis I.
San Clemente eighth-graders Melia Hahn and Garrett Reissmueller were part of the choir.
“The students were directed by St. Anne School choir director Karen Franson and the Director of Music Ministries and Organist for Christ Cathedral in the Diocese of Orange California, Dr. John A. Romeri.”
While on the trip, students also had the opportunity to explore ancient Rome, including the Roman ruins, 17th-century palaces, 15th-century churches and 20th-century monuments.
St. Anne School President John O'Brien said, “We are so proud of our students for being such wonderful ambassadors for St. Anne and their families. We are also blessed to have such talented students, as well as dedicated colleagues, like Mrs. Franson.”

GitHub is opening up its developer program to developers who do not have paid accounts.
The popular code-sharing service is looking to attract the open source community with the move. "That means if your free account was holding you back, you can join the program no matter which stage of development you're in,” said Jared Jones, GitHub Developer Program manager.
Launched in 2014, the GitHub Developer Program has featured a community of 17,000 programmers primarily developing software by using the GitHub API. Opening access to developers without paid accounts could dramatically expand that membership number, GitHub's Joe Wadcan, head of business development, acknowledged.
The intent of the program is to encourage developers to integrate with GitHub and improve developer workflow, Wadcan said. Participants receive advance notice on API changes and are invited to events. The program also provides services such as licenses to build and test applications against the GitHub Enterprise iteration of the platform.
Along with expanding access to the program, GitHub is introducing participation levels, all of which are accessible free of charge. The first level, for organizations or member applications with one to 499 users, provides tools to learn about GitHub's API and access the service's integrator community. ("Member applications" refers to applications built by individual users who are not part of a large team or organization.)
Level 2 is for organizations with 500 to 999 persons or member applications with that amount. It offers all the benefits of Level 1 plus GitHub.com credits and network discounts.
Level 3 is for organizations or member applications with 1,000 or more users, and features all the benefits of the first two levels plus member spotlights, including retweets or preferred placement on GitHub digital platforms. Consulting services for scaling also are featured as part of the third level.

As comedy own goals go, Theresa May's decision to hold a snap general election and then run the worst campaign in living memory is right up there with Liverpool misfit Djimi Traore's Cruyff-turn into their own net at Burnley in 2005 which knocked their team out of the FA Cup.
Here's a tip, if you're going to call a vanity election as a cynical and opportunistic power grab because your party's 20 points ahead in the opinion polls and the opposition are seemingly on their knees, don't go around threatening and patronising your core voters by telling them you'll take their house off them if they go doolally so they can't pass it on to their kids. And if you're running a campaign that's totally based around your personality, make sure that you've got one instead of coming across like a Dalek.
And all this after spending the 12 months since David Cameron did a runner after Brexit repeatedly telling us there was no way you'd hold an election before 2020 because the country needs stability. So now May has had to go cap in hand to a bunch of Flat Earth lunatics in Northern Ireland in a desperate bid to cling on to power. It's about as strong and stable as the Tories' billboard van which blew over on the M6 a few days before the country went to the polls – as one wag on Twitter suggested, after it performed 12 U-turns in four minutes.
There's supreme confidence and then there's downright arrogance. Mrs May thought they could ride roughshod over everyone and ran an evasive campaign full of empty soundbites and meaningless catchphrases, even telling a nurse in the TV debate they bothered to turn up to that “there's no magic money tree” despite spending £130m on an election nobody but them wanted.
Still, our local MPs kept their seats. Cat Smith's tireless campaign helped them increase their majority while David Morris was elected with an increased number of votes. But if he'd like to keep their seat at the next general election, I'd suggest they show their face around here a bit more because, judging by comments on social media, the people of Morecambe have seen more of Diego Lemos in the past year than they have of him.
US First Lady Melania Trump, not seen in public since a hospital operation this month, has sought to scotch rumours about their health and marriage. “Rest assured, I'm here at the @WhiteHouse w my family,” a tweet posted on their account says.
Gossip has mounted in the 20 days since they were last seen, with President Donald Trump as they welcomed home three US detainees from North Korea.
The White House has already dismissed claims about the Trumps' relationship.
On Twitter, some suggested their husband had actually written the tweet that appeared on their account on Wednesday.
On 14 May, the White House said Mrs Trump, 48, would be admitted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington DC for “an embolisation procedure to treat a benign kidney condition”.
“The procedure was successful and there were no complications,” a statement from the White House said after their release on 20 May.
But their five-day hospital stay for what was described as relatively minor surgery did little to stop tongues wagging.
They have not been pictured since then, and has only released one previous tweet referring to their medical treatment.
Wild theories have circulated online, including that Mrs Trump has moved back to New York with their son, Barron, or that they are co-operating with special counsel Robert Mueller.
After they skipped the White House Sports and Fitness Day on Wednesday – an event heavily promoted by former First Lady Michelle Obama – the speculation only intensified.
Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser, addressed the audience instead.
On Tuesday, the first lady's spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, told Politico: “Sadly, we deal with conspiracy theories all the time, so this is nothing new, just more silly nonsense.
“She is doing great. I wouldn't characterise it as a long absence. They were hospitalised for almost a week and is now home and recovering.”
During their hospital stay, Mrs Trump tweeted about a school shooting in Texas, a Navy Seal who was awarded a Medal of Honor, and in support of the military on Memorial Day.
They earlier this month launched Be Best, an initiative to teach kindness to children.
Weeks ago, the White House rebutted claims the first lady was living away from the White House because they and the president were supposedly estranged.
The Washington Post reported on rumours that Mrs Trump was living with their parents, Amalija Knavs and Viktor Knavs, in a Washington suburb.
Such political gossip can seem as cyclical in the nation's capital as its cherry blossoms.
Unfounded claims were spread in Washington social circles during the last administration that President Barack Obama had filed for divorce from Mrs Obama.
The Lady Devils bounced back a short time later with a 13-1 knockout of Knoxville Central.
Lebanon led Gibbs 3-1 going into the fifth when the onslaught began. Olivia Wheeler's two-run single off Anna Smallwood broke a tie.
The Lady Devils jumped to a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a Brittany Harris RBI single and tacked on two more in the second on RBI by Smallwood and Brianna Nagelhout.
Lebanon finished with 10 hits, including multiple knocks by Nagelhout and Megan Jaselskis.
Gibbs also had 10 hits, including three by Kayley Kern and multiple efforts by Bailey Reagan and Josie Huff.
Lebanon enjoyed an eight-run inning right off the bat against Knoxville Central in the first inning as Nagelhout, Harris and Anna Bennett singled and Brizeida Chavez had an RBI groundout.
Harris, Morgan Jones and Macy Lee each had multiple hits for the Lady Devils, who totaled 11 for the game. Chavez, Nagelhout, Lee and Harris each had two RBI.
CAK edges Central 5-4 in 7th
CHATTANOOGA — Christian Academy of Knoxville knocked Wilson Central out of the Soddy-Daisy Tournament with a 5-4 win last Saturday at Warner Park.
CAK scored the walk-off winner in the bottom of the seventh inning on an RBI triple off reliever Kaylee Richetto after a runner was placed on second base to start the inning, per the international tiebreaker.
Central couldn't score in the top of the inning despite Laney Tucker standing on second base to start the frame as the Lady Wildcats fell to 16-11-1.
CAK pulled into a 4-4 tie with a run in the bottom of the sixth inning off starter Taryn Pastore, who was charged with four runs on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings.
Central took a 4-3 lead with two runs in the top of the sixth a time expired. Claire Smith walked with two out, stole second and, on Paige Robinson's single to center, scored on a head-first slide between the catcher's legs. Following an Alaina Morris bunt single, Richetto dropped a single into center to score Robinson with the go-ahead run.
Brooke Pfefferle doubled in Morris and Richetto for a 2-0 Lady Wildcat lead in the top of the first inning.
CAK put together back-to-back singles, a groundout and a two-run double to take a 3-2 edge in the third.
Central was scheduled to go to Station Camp for a District 9-AAA double header Monday.
Tuesday - Thundery showers mainly over northern and eastern Singapore in the afternoon.
Wednesday - Late morning and early afternoon thundery showers.
Voters' registration aborted in Rivers as burglers cart away INEC's data capturing machine
The ongoing voters' registration for new voters in Emohua Local Council of Rivers state has been aborted following to burgle and carting away of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC's data capturing machine, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr Aniedi Ikoiwak has said.
A statement, signed by Dr Richard Ntui the commission's Administrative Secretary, quoted Ikoiwak as saying that urgent steps would be taken to ensure continuation of the exercise within the stipulated period.
The statement was issued to newsmen on Wednesday in Port Harcourt.
It said that Direct-Data Capturing Equipment was carted away when the secretariat of Emohua Local Government Council where INEC office is situated was burgled.
Ikoiwak assured the public especially the registrants that no data was lost in the theft as all the data captured since the commencement of the exercise was backed up in the commission's server.
“In addition, the CVR (Continuous Voters, Registration) exercise will continue as soon as new DDC machines were configured for the council,'' they said.
Ikoiwak, who had already inspected the burgled office, urged INEC staff not to be discouraged by the incident.
They advised the management of the council to boost security to avoid re-ocurrence of the incident.

NEW YORK (AP) - Several people who hung a banner from the Statue of Liberty's pedestal calling for abolishing the federal government's chief immigration enforcement agency were arrested on July Fourth shortly before a person scaled the statue's base, forcing its evacuation.
About 100 feet (30 meters) aboveground, the climber alternately sat and lay by the bottom edge of the statue's robes for more than two hours on Wednesday, news helicopter video showed. Police, standing on a ladder and a ledge nearby, tried to talk the climber into descending.
The climber made about a 25-foot (8-meter) ascent from the monument's observation point, National Park Service spokesperson Jerry Willis said. Visitors were forced to leave Liberty Island hours before its normal 6:15 p.m. closing time, they said.
Earlier and farther below, at least six people were taken into custody after unfurling a banner that read "Abolish I.C.E.," Willis said. The message referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a part of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE officers arrest and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, among other duties.
Willis said federal regulations prohibit hanging banners from the monument.
The activist group behind the banner, Rise and Resist, tweeted that the climber wasn't connected to its demonstration and expressed concern for the climber's safety.
The New York-based group opposes President Donald Trump's administration and advocates ending deportations and family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the president's immigration policy is a step forward for public safety.
Under Trump's zero-tolerance policy, the government has begun requiring border agents to arrest and prosecute anyone caught entering the country illegally. That resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents within six weeks this spring.
Under public pressure, Trump later halted their policy of taking children from their detained parents. A federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration late last month to reunite the more than 2,000 children with their parents in 30 days, or 14 days in the case of those under age 5.
"Abolish ICE" has become a rallying cry at some protests around the country and for some prominent Democratic officials seeking to boost their progressive credentials.
Trump said on Twitter last week that abolishing ICE will "never happen!"
Protests and evacuations at the Statue of Liberty are rare but not unheard of.
Last February, someone hung a banner reading "Refugees Welcome" from the observation deck. The sign was taken down about an hour after being discovered.
A year earlier, a West Virginia man with psychological problems was sentenced to time served after calling in a bomb threat. Their call forced the evacuation of Liberty Island, sending 3,200 people on boats back to lower Manhattan and New Jersey.
The statue, a gift from France, was dedicated in 1886. It became a welcoming symbol for immigrants and refugees coming to the U.S.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Republican-controlled Virginia General Assembly gave final approval Wednesday evening to a state budget expanding Medicaid coverage to the state's poor, ending years of partisan gridlock on the issue.
The state Senate voted in favor of expansion after a full day of debate. The House, which had had previously endorsed expansion, gave its final approval shortly afterward. Several Republicans in both chambers joined with Democrats to approve the measure.
Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam is expected to sign the budget in coming days, and the roughly 400,000 newly eligible low-income Virginias will begin enrolling in Medicaid at the start of next year.
Expanding Medicaid was a key provision of then-President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, and a tally from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Virginia will become the 33rd state to approve Medicaid expansion.
Senate passage came by a 23-17 vote with four Republicans joining Democrats for passage. The House quickly followed about an hour later with a lopsided 67-31 final endorsement.
Wednesday's voting marked the end of a more than four-year battle over whether Virginia should expand the publicly funded health care program for the poor. A fight over Medicaid expansion led to a standoff over the state budget in 2014 and again this year.
Virginia Democrats have argued the state should not pass up the roughly $2 billion in extra federal funding the program would bring to the state. Republicans had previously been near unified in blocking past expansion efforts, saying the long-term costs were unsustainable.
Those arguments were again replayed in the final hours before Virginia's partisan battle was finally ended.
Sen. Ben Chafin, a Republican lawmaker from Virginia's economically depressed southwest coal country, announced their support for expansion on the Senate floor. They said their rural area needed expansion to help bolster its hospitals and provide care for constituents in need.
"I came to the conclusion that no just wasn't the answer anymore," Chafin said.
But several Republican senators remained strongly opposed, saying Medicaid costs would eventually overwhelm the rest of the state's budget needs for schools and public safety.
"It is a ticking time bomb," said GOP Sen. Bill Stanley.
A federal-state collaboration originally meant for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to become the largest government health insurance program, now covering 1 in 5 people.
The GOP-controlled General Assembly's support for Medicaid comes despite Trump administration rejections.
President Donald Trump has vigorously sought to negate their predecessor's health law. And White House officials, including budget director Mick Mulvaney, have urged Virginia lawmakers this year not to expand Medicaid.
Yet ironically, their administration's embrace of work requirements for low-income people on Medicaid prompted lawmakers in some conservative states to resurrect plans for expansion.
Virginia GOP Speaker Kick Cox said the Trump administration's openness to conservative reforms, including work requirements, "was probably the biggest key" in getting Republican support for Medicaid expansion.
Last year, Virginia saw its state legislature reshaped by an anti-Trump wave as Democrats made unexpectedly large gains in the state House. And a failure by the GOP-led Congress to repeal and replace the health law helped spur several of Virginia's Republican state legislators to flip positions.
Democrats campaigned heavily on expanding Medicaid last year and some House Republicans were eager to take the issue off the table before next year's election, when both House and Senate seats are up.

The film will be released in UK cinemas on Thursday.
The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry are set to join a host of famous faces for the premiere of Star Wars: The Last Jedi on Tuesday.
The royals will meet members of the film's cast and crew before the screening, which will take place at the Royal Albert Hall.
The brothers have cameo roles as stormtroopers, actor John Boyega previously revealed.
Boyega, who plays Finn, will walk the red carpet alongside fellow stars Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Daisy Ridley (Rey) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren).
Ed Sheeran, Stormzy and Jonathan Ross are some of the other guests expected to attend.
The premiere is being hosted in aid of The Royal Foundation, with more than 400 young people, military veterans and volunteers who have taken part in the charity's programmes also attending the event.
Some of the families who were affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy will also attend the premiere.
The Last Jedi is the eighth film in the Star Wars saga, following on from 2015's hit The Force Awakens.
It is the last film where Carrie Fisher will appear as Princess Leia – the actor died aged 60, shortly after completing their final scenes.
Boyega nearly missed the movie's Los Angeles premiere after they were stuck in a blizzard-hit Atlanta over the weekend.
The 25-year-old Londoner tweeted: “Trying to get back for the LA premiere! I actually NEED a pilot!!!”

LOS ANGELES — Marvel's continuing space opera Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has yet to hit theatres, but plans are already in the works for the third instalment.
On Monday, James Gunn announced on Facebook that they would be returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Gunn also wrote and directed the first and second Guardians films.
The franchise stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista and features the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel.
In their post, Gunn said that Guardians 3 will come after 2018's Avengers: Infinity War and conclude the story of this iteration of Guardians of the Galaxy, helping to launch Marvel's next 10 years.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theatres on May 5.
PARIS (AP) — A cold case in France is heating up, with three new arrests this week over the 1984 killing of a 4-year-old boy named Gregory.
The investigation has involved family rivalries, judicial bungling and 12,000 pieces of evidence – including about 2,000 anonymous letters – in the three decades since their corpse was pulled from a freezing river in eastern France.
The Burgundy gendarme service and Dijon appeals court said in a statement that three people were arrested Wednesday. Local newspaper L'Est Republicain reported that they were a great-uncle, great-aunt and aunt of Gregory's and that they are suspected of complicity in the killing.
A relative was initially jailed but released – and then killed by Gregory's father. Then Gregory's mother was accused of killing their son, before being cleared.

A 23 year old Midlands State University student, Ashleigh Mutsa, was at the weekend crowned Miss Tourism Midlands, shrugging off stiff competition from 12 other aspirants.
Mutsa, who is studying towards a degree in Development Studies at the Zvishavane campus, walked away with the coveted title while Agatha Kulingah(23) was crowned first princess.
Eighteen-year-old Thubelihle Ndlovu from Gokwe, who was a crowd favourite, was crowned second princess. Mutsa and Kulingah are now set to represent the Midlands province in the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe national pageant slated for September.
The 13 contestants were drawn from Zvishavane, Gokwe, Kwekwe, Redcliff and Gweru with the glamorous event, which was held at Cathedral Hall in Gweru, drawing a sizeable crowd that saw the city's socialites in attendance.
Dancehall stars Legion and Xiddo, B-hood and The travellers band entertained guests while popular Gweru DJ, Mupsy was on the decks.
In an interview after the pageant, the ecstatic newly crowned queen said they were thrilled to have won the pageant and would represent the province well at the national finals.
“I'm very grateful to God for taking me this far. Modelling has always been my dream and today that dream came true. I'm glad that I'll be representing my province at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe finals and I'm optimistic that I'll do well,” Mutsa said.
Organiser of the provincial pageant, Mavis Koslek, said they were pleased with the event although they bemoaned lack of sponsorship.
“I'm happy with the whole event but my worry is the lack of sponsorship for a pageant of such magnitude. I therefore appeal for sponsorship for the two winners who”ll represent the province in the finals,' they said.The Chronicle

WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The Christchurch-based Crusaders can consolidate their place atop the Super Rugby table when they play the Hamilton-based Chiefs in an abbreviated 16th round, before the tournament breaks for June internationals.
The Crusaders moved five points clear in first place when they convincingly beat their closest rival, the Wellington-based Hurricanes, last weekend and have the chance to lengthen that lead and extend their winning streak to 10 games against the fifth-placed Chiefs.
The manner in which the Crusaders beat the Hurricanes, while missing six current All Blacks who were either injured or suspended, has led some commentators to declare it a certainty that the eight-time champions will win the title for the second straight year.
Coach Scott Robertson said the victory of a severely-depleted side over the star-studded Hurricanes "was just a very proud night in the Crusaders history."
"I think the fans weren't sure what to expect and that probably sums it up, the amount of emotion that was shown post-game," Robertson said.
They said the Crusaders are not taking for granted a win on Saturday in what appears an easier match against a Chiefs team heavily hit by injuries.
"The Chiefs have an extremely good scrum," Robertson said. "Given their injuries they have done a great job with the players that have come in for them - as have we, so it will be a great battle."
The Hurricanes must quickly recover from their poor performance against the Crusaders to keep pace with the tournament leaders three rounds from the end of the regular season.
Coach Chris Boyd said any lessons learned from the loss to the Crusaders would not be applicable to the Highlanders, who play a different type of game.
"They kick more than anyone else," Boyd said. "They're very good at strike play. They're quite prepared to say 'well you have the ball and we'll knock you over and you make the mistake and we'll pick it up and score.'"

PHOENIX (AP) — As some cities reaffirm support for sanctuary policies that protect immigrants, Phoenix finds itself in an unusual position to push back against any immigration actions by the new White House. The Phoenix City Council on Wednesday will discuss a petition to adopt the sanctuary label, following the lead of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and others in a city with one of the nation's largest populations of immigrants in the country illegally. But the effort is complicated by the fact that Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law, known as SB1070, bars any Arizona city from becoming a sanctuary. The Phoenix metro area is home to about 250,000 immigrants in the country illegally, according to a report last week from the Pew Research Center. The report is based on data from 2014. New York, Los Angeles and Houston have the highest number of immigrants who lack legal status. Cities are doubling down on sanctuary policies in light of an order by President Donald Trump requiring immigration authorities to arrest and deport more people. The city policies vary but essentially bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Phoenix has a Democratic, immigrant-friendly mayor who has denounced Trump, but their hands are tied because of SB1070. The law requires local police to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally while enforcing other laws or in the course of an investigation. Most of the law was gutted by the courts, but city leaders say the surviving sections prevent local government agencies from restricting the enforcement of federal immigration law. Still, pressure has mounted on Mayor Greg Stanton from immigrant advocacy groups who want the city to adopt sanctuary policies and from police and Republican leaders who oppose the measure. City attorney Brad Holm says in a letter to the city manager that the petition for sanctuary status is “legally impermissible.” “It demands that the council break state law. If the petition were adopted, a court could fine the city for breaking the law, and the attorney general could seek forfeiture of state-shared revenue,” Holm wrote. Stanton last week blasted the Trump administration over the deportation of 35-year-old Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a Phoenix-area woman who until now had been granted leniency by Obama policies that aimed to protect immigrants without violent pasts and who have ties to the community. Garcia de Rayos was arrested in Phoenix during a routine check-in with U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement and was deported the next day to Nogales, Mexico. “Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here for more than two decades and poses a threat to nobody,” Stanton wrote on Twitter. Stanton denounced Garcia de Rayos' deportation, but immigration activists called on them to use their power and not just their voice. “If there was ever a time when we need your courage and we need you to stand up and we need you to put actions behind saying that Phoenix PD is not gonna become a mass deportation machine, it's now,” said Francisca Porchas, of Puente Arizona, an immigrant rights group. “This is when we need Mayor Stanton, the city council, the state, everybody who is of conscience to stand up and defy this racist law.”

Nigeria cannot survive without the Igbo – Femi Aribisala
Out of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Igbo have by far the worst politicians.
Among the different ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Igbo are without a doubt, one of the most remarkable. So remarkable, indeed, that some have even traced their ancestry to biblical Israel, as the far-flung descendants of Jacob, the Jewish patriarch.
Gad, Jacob's seventh son, is said to have had three sons who settled in South-eastern Nigeria. These sons; Eri, Arodi and Areli, are believed to have fathered clans in Igbo-land and to have founded such Igbo towns as Aguleri, Arochukwu, Owerri and Umuleri.
Igbo genius
Even the bitterest adversaries of the Igbo cannot but admit that, as a people, they are very resourceful and ingenious. Indeed, this has often been the cause of their envy and dislike by others. However, more enlightened non-Igbo Nigerians see this as a cause for celebration. While today, the centre-point of Nigeria's manufacturing is situated in the Lagos/Ogun axis, there is no doubt that the real locomotive of Nigeria's indigenous industrialization lies farther afield in Aba and in the mushrooming cottage-industries of the Igbo heartland.
In one of the paradoxes of Nigerian history, the terrible civil war provoked homespun industrialization in the South-East. Military blockade left the Igbo with little alternative than to be inventive in a hurry. While Nigeria as a nation failed woefully to harness this profitably after the war, it has nevertheless ensured that the Igbo are at the forefront of Nigeria's economic development today.
Indeed, the way we disregard “made in Aba” today is the same way we disregarded “made in Japan” yesterday. For those of us who believe against the odds that Nigeria is the China of tomorrow, we equally recognize that the ingenuity of the Igbo is an indelible part of the actualization of that manifest destiny.
Hall of fame
The Igbo have been a great credit to Nigeria. They have given us a great number of our favourite sons, including international statesman Nnamdi Azikiwe; military leader Odumegwu Ojukwu; regional leader Michael Okpara; vice-president Alex Ekwueme; mathematical genius Chike Obi; literary icon Chinua Achebe; world-class economist Pius Okigbo; world boxing champion Dick Tiger; international statesman Emeka Anyaoku; and world-class artist Ben Enwonwu. Pemit me to include in this illustrious list even some of my very good Igbo friends: Pat Utomi, Ojo Madueke, Olisa Agbakoba, Joy Ogwu, and Stanley Macebuh.
Let us get one thing straight: Nigeria would be a much poorer country without the Igbo. Indeed, Nigeria would not be Nigeria without them. Can you imagine the Super Eagles without the Igbo? Not likely! Who can forget Nwankwo Kanu, Jay Jay Okocha and our very own Emmanuel Amuneke? Can you imagine Nollywood without the Igbo?
Impossible! Just think of Stella Damascus-Aboderin; Rita Dominic and Mike Ezuruonye. And then there are the diaspora Igbo who many are unaware are of Igbo descent, including concert singer and actor Paul Robeson; Oscar award-winner Forest Whitaker; mega-pastor T.D. Jakes; Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu; and BAFTA actor award-winner Chiwetel Ejiofor.
You may well wonder why I have found it necessary to present this small litany of Igbo who-is-who. I think it is important to emphasise how the Igbo have been very vital to the Nigerian project. They have more than represented Nigeria creditably in virtually all walks of life. This makes it all the more absurd that this same people have been consistently denied the position of executive president of the country in all but six months of Nigeria's 54 year history.
Civil-war legacy
Of course, a major reason for this was the 1967-1970 civil-war which had the Igbo on the losing side. But that was over 40 years ago. If there is really to be “no victor, no vanquished” in anything more than mere rhetoric, then the rehabilitation of the Igbo back into post civil-war Nigeria will not be complete until an Igbo man finally becomes president of the country.
That imperative should be of interest to every Nigerian nationalist, committed to the creation of one Nigeria where everyone has a deep sense of belonging. The problem, however, is that the Igbo themselves seem to be their own worst enemies in this regard. They appear to be doing their very best to ensure that this inevitable eventuality continues to be denied and delayed.
The Igbo need to forgive Nigerians. No one who lived through the horrors that precipitated the secession of Biafra and led to the civil-war cannot but admit that the Igbo were abused and mal-treated in one of the worst pogroms ever. It was not just that they were senselessly massacred in their own country; it was that they were butchered. I remember vividly gory pictures of scores and scores of the Igbo with hands chopped up and with legs amputated. And then there were the ravages of the three-year civil-war itself, resulting in the death of millions of Igbo; much through starvation and attrition.
The end of the war brought no respite, as the Igbo were pauperized by fiscal decrees that wiped out their savings and their properties were blatantly sequestered by opportunists. All this is more than enough to destroy the spirit of any group of people.
But God has been on the side of the Igbo. It is a testament to their resilience that, in spite of this terrible affliction, they have survived, bounced back and have even triumphed in Nigeria. Forty years have now gone by. The Igbo may never forget what happened to them and, indeed, should never forget. But it is past time for them to forgive.
We are sorry
This is one voice in the Nigerian wilderness saying to the Igbo from the depth of their heart: we are sorry. We are sorry for the way we mistreated you. We are sorry for the way we abused you. We are sorry for starving your children to death. We are sorry for killing your loved ones. We are sorry for stealing your properties. We are sorry for making you feel unwanted in your own country. Please forgive us. It is time to forgive us. It is way past time for the Igbo to forgive Nigerians. We beg you in the name of God.
There was a civil war in the United States, but the defeated South rose from the ashes. Five of the last nine presidents of the United States have been from the South, including Jimmy Carter from Georgia, George Bush from Texas and Bill Clinton from Arkansas. The time is overdue for an Igbo president of Nigeria, but it is not going to happen as long as the Igbo continue to hold a grudge against Nigeria and Nigerians.
There is no question about it: the Ibos cannot elect a president of Nigeria on their own. To do so, they have to join forces with others. They have to form alliances with people from other parts of Nigeria. That is not going to happen as long as the Igbo continue to bear a grudge against practically everybody else.
The Igbo have a gripe against virtually all the people they need. They have this tendency to antagonise their possible alliance partners. They keep dredging up the past, refusing to let sleeping dogs lie. Until they drop these gripes, they are not likely to realise their dreams.
Demonising Yorubas.
For example, the Igbo have this tendency to demonise the Yorubas. It is alarming when reading the Vanguard blogs today to see the animosity often expressed between Igbo and Yoruba contributors. The hatred is most unhealthy. Insults are traded with abandon. What is the point of this? For how long will the Igbo demand emotional retribution from every Yoruba for the betrayal of Awolowo? Most of the contributors were not even born when the civil-war took place more than a generation ago.
There is now even transferred aggression against Babatunde Fashola, who made the blunder of repatriating some destitute Igbo from Lagos back to their home-states. The man has apologised for the infraction. They should be forgiven. Blunders are not the exclusive preserve of the non-Igbo. The Igbo have made more than a few themselves and will yet make others.
Paradoxically, the redemption of the Igbos to prominent national office moved apace under President Obasanjo; a Yoruba man. Recognising that Igbos are some of the most seasoned, competent and experienced public-servants, Obasanjo relied heavily on their expertise.
Thanks to him, we got Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala at Finance, Charles Soludo at Central Bank, Obiageli Ezekwesili at Education, Ndidi Okereke at the Stock Exchange, and Dora Akunyili at NAFDAC. Indeed, Igbo statesmen came into more prominence under Obasanjo than did Yoruba statesmen. But for some strange reason, this does not seem to have succeeded in assuaging the ill-feeling of the Igbos toward the Yorubas.
Bad politicians
Within the framework of Nigerian politics, the Igbo also have a fundamental problem. Out of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Igbo have by far the worst politicians. They have no recognizable leaders, and have no discernible strategy as to how to negotiate power at the centre. As a result, the Igbo have tended to be short-changed at the federal level. Traditionally, the inconsequential ministries, such as the Ministry of Information, have been zoned to them.
The Igbo need to work out a plan that will take them to Aso Rock. First, they need to choose and groom a de-tribalised leader of the Azikiwe mould who can be sold to non-Igbos. Then, they need to give them undiluted support. At the moment the internal politics of the Igbo militates against this.
The Igbo seem to hate themselves as much as they hate others. They seem to fight themselves with as much venom as they fight others. Every potential Igbo leader seems to have more enemies within than without. This must not be allowed to continue.
The Igbo need to help themselves in order that their friends can help them. In this centenary of Nigeria's amalgamation, as we embark on the arduous process of crafting our future through a National Conference, we salute the Igbo for their fortitude and implore them to stake their claim in Nigeria. Nigeria cannot survive without the Igbo.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Roger Goodell wants to see the mystery of the NFL's catch rule solved, and he's ensured that the process has begun.
The commissioner said at their annual Super Bowl news conference Wednesday that they personally see that rule as the most obvious to address.
Asked about the scrutiny that NFL officiating came under this season, Goodell said "on the catch/no catch rule, we need to find a rule we think will address that. We certainly need to get this rule right so everyone can appreciate."
They added that there were more video replay interruptions in 2017 "and I think we can look at that. How do we make the game more attractive with fewer stoppages is one of the things we focus on."

TechRepublic's Dan Patterson spoke with Andrew Bennett, the SVP of IoT EcoStruxure at Schneider Electric about EcoStruxure's role in the Internet of Things.
Watch the video, or read the full transcript of their conversation below:
Patterson: The Internet of Things has a profoundly powerful impact on the digital transformation of almost every industry. Andrew, thank you very much for your time today. I wonder if we could start with first, what is EcoStruxure, and what role does the Internet of Things play?
Bennett: Yeah, great, thank you, Dan. Schneider Electric of course, is a company that works with a lot of industrial clients, so you can think about us in industrial space and buildings, in the grid, and of course, what we do for places like data centers. And one of the things that we've been doing for a long time is thinking about connecting devices in those settings to enhance analytics. That's really kind of the core of what we do as a company. We take a very OT, operational technology perspective on that. And so EcoStruxure, EcoStruxure really is our set of architectures that allows us to think about all those connectable devices, and then edge control, how do you actually control those devices.
A lot of our clients are running mission-critical operational technology, so this could be a nuclear power plant, or a petrochemical facility, or the grid. And so, edge control of those devices, actually having intelligence, not just embedded at the nodes but at the edge, is really important as they can't risk being disconnected from the internet.
SEE: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research)
And then at the top of EcoStruxure, at the top of that stack, it starts with those connected devices and then edge control, really is where we build a lot of our software. So we build software for control, for analytics, of where we're starting to build out some of the AI and machine learning, and where we store a lot of that data of course, in the cloud, so that we start to do more sophisticated views of what's going on in those manufacturing sites, or petrochemical sties, or whatever they happen to be.
And so that's, I would say at the crux of it, that's what EcoStruxure is. It's an architecture that allows all three of those layers to interoperate, and it's really designed to be completely open and interoperable, because while we think our customers should only buy Schneider Electric stuff, that is probably not realistic and so, we need to be very open in the way we work with other vendors as well.
Patterson: I'm glad about the nuclear power plants, there are all types of industrial facilities that are adopting Internet of Things, but generally when I talk to people, even in business technology, they tend to think of IoT as a smart fridge or your Alexa. Can you give us an example of a device that might be IoT and deployed at large scale?
Bennett: Yeah, for sure. I think, think about just a breaker. Just your electrical infrastructure, and really the most important thing, because it's pretty hard to run a manufacturing process or a plant without power. And so today, because of really our heritage and our legacy with power, and delivering clean reliable energy, everything starts with that electrical infrastructure. So at plants today we have customers that are connecting those assets. They want to know about their energy consumption. They of course want to reduce energy consumption 'cause that's good to the bottom line.
It's also good from a sustainability perspective. So if you think about all that electrical infrastructure, then you can start to kind of work your way up the stack in terms of whether it's a motor that's running a conveyor belt, or part of your process. Whether it's a pump. These are all devices that historically were not all connected, right. They didn't historically see the need to necessarily connect those. Over time, more and more of those devices became connected, primarily so that those companies could control.
So when we talk about OT, as juxtaposed to IT for a second, we're really talking about operational technology where a SCADA, which is the software for controlling that infrastructure, is actually opening and closing devices. It could be a breaker, it could be a pump, and what's happened over time is, of course that data is hugely valuable to start to think about broader trends. And so a lot of times we talk about this IT/OT convergence, which probably gets a little overplayed out there, but that's really those two worlds, right, where you're taking all these connected devices from an OT perspective, and starting to think about all the fantastic things you can do with IT from an AI, machine learning, and all the great things that are coming out there in the industry.
Patterson: You said the magic words there. What role does automation and artificial intelligence play with this connected infrastructure?
SEE: Green tech initiatives: Best practices and breakthroughs (free PDF) (TechRepublic)
Bennett: Yeah, listen I think there's an endless set of applications in the IoT and industrial space of the Internet of Things. You know I also think we have to be careful, because I do think there's a tendency and I'm certainly guilty of it, of using a lot of the buzzwords and attracting folks to the pure machine learning side of the equation. But what we're observing with clients today, is first of all, a lot of them are still moving through that journey of actually connecting to those devices, right? Controlling those devices. So kind of the, I would say the ability to actually aggregate data.
But what's happening over time for sure is, as you aggregate that data, as you can start to look at broader trends, you could start to bring in things like machine learning, and the thing that I think that we're seeing today that is the most pronounced, is that you still need quite a bit of human interaction when it comes to machine learning or AI. You need to identify patterns, and then you need to feed those back into machine learning so that you know what that pattern recognition looks like, and then you can start to take proactive measures, and so, just one example.
You know a lot of outages or problems that happen in industrial setting, often start, you can actually look at things like partial discharge, or electrical partial discharge that happens in equipment. And if that happens over a long period of time, eventually that piece of equipment's probably going to fail. And so today, if you kind of looked at the signatures of what that looks like, a human being can look at that, you know we have thousands of electrical engineers in our company. Incredibly intelligent about what they do. You might not necessarily want to go out drinking with them but, they're a lot of fun too, to actually identify these problems. These guys can look at that, they can look at those signatures, they can instantly say, "You're going to have a problem here."
Now to codify that, and actually take that and build AI around that, that process is, I would say we're in the early stages. So you're saying this, this is what that pattern looks like, now you can feed that into an AI system, and you can start to create a set of patterns that you can look for, and then obviously do what we ultimately wanna do, which is not just predict, but avoid outages and equipment failures in an industrial setting.
Patterson: Andrew, last question for you, what about the security? All of us adopting Internet of Things, see security as an integral component of the entire infrastructure. What role does cybersecurity and cyber defense play in adoption of IoT devices?
Bennett: Yeah look, the software, the hardware that we deliver for our clients, you know we are working with folks that are driving mission critical OT out there in the industry. So that's the good news. The bad news is that those clients are always gonna be targets, you know really aggressive nation state type attacks, not just your run of the mill hacker.
So for us, as a company, when you kind of go back to thinking about EcoStruxure and those three stacks, I think the important thing is to think, not just about how well hardened is that connected product, 'cause some of them aren't. They weren't historically, they were just maybe a thermometer, right, and so you wouldn't think about how you had to protect just a little device.
But you have to think about cybersecurity comprehensively across that entire stack. Not just the products, not just the edge control, but the software layer at the top. So, for us as a company, that's really our approach to think about all three of those aspects of EcoStruxure, how we not just bring new devices and add new IO to that environment, but how we think about cybersecurity from the product design level all the way up to that top stack of software, so, it's a big challenge, and you know we take it pretty seriously as a company, as you can imagine.

The Red Sox could have said the same thing in 2009, when they lost twice in the best-of-five division round in Anaheim, then returned home to be swept by the Angels. It happened again last fall against the Cleveland Indians: two road losses, then a season-ending dud at Fenway.
If the Red Sox lose on Sunday, they will have finished eight of their last nine seasons without a single playoff victory. The shining exception, of course, was 2013, when they won the World Series. Just two players from this postseason roster — Pedroia and shortstop Xander Bogaerts — were also on that one.
“I don't think, roster-wise, we probably had the best team going into that postseason,” Bogaerts said. “I know a lot of people didn't pick us, but in the end, we did it. We did it as a team.”
They added that those Red Sox faced a two-games-to-one World Series deficit in St. Louis but rallied to win the next three.

“That was one of the hardest things to overcome, and we did it,” Bogaerts said. “It's nothing that big, like that time.”
So much has changed in just four years, especially with Boston's offense. Those Red Sox led the majors in on-base plus slugging percentage. These Red Sox finished 22nd in O.P.S., at .736, far below even the sad and broken Mets. The nine other playoff teams held the top nine spots in that statistic.
The old Boston standby David Ortiz now yuks it up with A-Rod on Fox's postseason studio show. Their Red Sox' cleanup man, Betts, gamely presses on with a wrist that recently needed a cortisone shot. It bothered Betts when they batted in the eighth inning on Friday, and they left for a defensive replacement.

“Everything will be all right,” they said, referring to the wrist, not the team's chances. Those hinge largely on Doug Fister, the journeyman right-hander who lost to the Astros last Friday. Fister has a strong playoff track record, but their earned run average was 4.88 this season. The Red Sox plucked them off the roster of the Class AAA Salt Lake Bees, an Angels affiliate, in June.

They spent far more for their other starters. They traded gems from their farm system in deals for Sale and Pomeranz. In 2014, they traded the October stalwart Jon Lester to Oakland for Yoenis Cespedes, then flipped Cespedes to Detroit for Rick Porcello. They signed David Price in free agency for seven years and $217 million.
So where do they stand now? Sale and Pomeranz — neither of whom had ever started in the playoffs before — combined to allow 11 runs and 14 hits in seven innings against the Astros. Price and Porcello have pitched in relief, Price because elbow trouble limits their workload, and Porcello because their rough season (11-17, 4.65) has knocked them from the rotation's top three.
These games have gone so miserably that Craig Kimbrel, the All-Star closer who strikes out nearly half of all hitters, was reduced to mop-up duty on Friday, just to stay sharp. They held the deficit at seven with a scoreless eighth inning.
The Red Sox scored in the top of the ninth, but thankfully, nobody cited that as a show of character, or a willingness to fight to the end. It would have rung hollow, anyway, because the facts are clear: The Red Sox have had a nice season, with another A.L. East title. But their hitters cannot keep up with the Astros, and their pitchers cannot stop them.
“Every single game, 1 through 9, everybody can do damage, everybody can go deep,” said Houston's Carlos Correa, whose first-inning homer started the party on Friday. “There are no holes in our lineup.”
And there are just too many holes in the Red Sox.

South Australia has established a new chief information security (CISO) position to take charge of whole-of-government cybersecurity efforts in the state.
“The position of chief information security officer was recently created to support the government of South Australia's approach to cybersecurity and risk assurance in the broader context of modernising the public sector,” a spokesperson for the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (DPC) told Computerworld.
“The position will lead the implementation of the Information Security Strategy across government and work with all state agencies to ensure the objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, are achieved.”
“Creating an assured cybersecurity environment will ensure that South Australians can have trust and confidence in state government digital services,” the spokesperson said.
“The CISO will provide information security guidance to executive leadership within the government by recommending information security investments which mitigate risks, strengthen defences, and reduce vulnerabilities for development, internal and client facing systems and products,” recruitment documents state.
Among the tasks of the CISO will be developing a Centre of Excellence for Cybersecurity service provision for government agencies.
DPC has begun recruiting for the new CISO position, which sits within the department's Office for ICT and Digital Transformation. The CISO will report to the office's executive director.
New South Wales and Tasmania have also created new CISO positions, with both states currently recruiting for cybersecurity chiefs.
The NSW government's CISO will sit within the state's Department of Finance, Services and Innovation (DFSI) but have a mandate that crosses departments and agencies (DFSI in January appointed a CISO to take charge of the department's cybersecurity).
Tasmania's CISO will sit within Office of eGovernment (OeG), which is part of the Department of Premier and Cabinet.
Britain will go to the polls on June 8 - just two years after we last voted in a general election
Theresa May took the rare step of announcing a 'snap' general election just after 11am this morning. With criticism of the Conservative Party's approach to Brexit mounting within Westminster, the prime minister has taken the opportunity to try and reinforce their government's mandate. It's a political gamble - Ted Heath infamously lost a general election they called in February 1974, in the midst of the three-day week crisis and a series of miners' strikes. Was May right to call the election? Vote in our poll:

Silicon Valley, California, 13 June. Cryptocurrency wallet provider Bitquence announced today that it will open its token crowd sale on June 28. The Silicon Valley startup is launching the first digital mobile wallet with portfolio management features backed by its own liquidity network, in a bid to increase the utility and usability of cryptocurrency. The crowd sale has a target of 5000 ETH to cover the costs of developing and launching the platform. The platform will run on BQX tokens which cover management and storage fees, and also create liquidity through the network. Contributors in ETH will be eligible for early beta access to the Bitquence platform.
PLATFORM FOR TOKEN MANAGEMENT
Bitquence works by offering pre-curated ‘baskets' of cryptocurrencies to users to help manage their altfolio. Baskets can be selected from ‘big cap' tokens, privacy tokens and even crowd sale tokens, and all token allocations will be backed 1:1 to safeguard platform users. Users can choose what tokens to acquire according to a consensus mechanism within Bitquence that allows participants to vote on the potential of a token. This enables you to measure risk and allows Bitquence to synthesize the needs of experienced cryptocurrency users with those new to the field, all from within an accessible and hyper-safe, mobile digital wallet.
“We can see the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies through a market cap that now surpasses $100 billion, but the tools to help the community are way behind the curve. Our aim at Bitquence is to accelerate the digital economy by providing much-needed guidance on asset allocation within the cryptocurrency market. Our platform users can simultaneously purchase many tokens instead of having to own and manage multiple wallets and thereby restore the original democratic intent of the new digital economy.” Shingo Lavine, CEO, Bitquence

How should educators confront bigotry, racism and white supremacy? The incidents in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend pushed that question from history to current events.
One teacher wondering aloud about their role is Derek Weimer. They taught James Alex Fields Jr., the man charged with murdering a woman and injuring multiple others by driving their car into a crowd of anti-racist marchers this weekend.
Weimer says they taught Fields in three classes at Cooper High School in Union, Ky. As NPR reported, they told member station WVXU reporter Bill Rinehart:
Weimer says Fields was intelligent and didn't cause trouble. But they say the quiet boy was also deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy. Weimer says they did their best to steer Fields away from those interests and thought they had succeeded in doing so. On hearing about the incident in Charlottesville, Weimer said they felt that they failed as a teacher.
For 40 years, the nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves has been training teachers to confront racism and bigotry. By studying the moral decisions facing people at historical moments, from Reconstruction to Kristallnacht to the civil rights era, they hope "to empower students to work against bigotry and injustice or improper uses of power," says Roger Brooks, president and CEO. "We sum everything up by saying people make choices and choices make history."
Studies show that the curriculum produces academic, social and emotional gains in students. A time like this, says Brooks, is the ultimate teachable moment:
"There's a whole lot teachers can slow down and unpack with their students rather than get completely caught up in the emotion of the moment."
Indeed, just hours after the attack, teachers were sharing resources online, and we heard from more after reaching out in our newsletter. Here are some resources and ideas for the fast-approaching school year.
Just starting out
More than 80 percent of public school teachers are white, while half of all students are people of color. Some teachers may never have directly talked about race or racism, particularly with younger children. Brooks suggests they start by making an "identity chart". This is a way to find commonalities as well as celebrate differences.
Diverse books: Some teachers will introduce topics of racism, civil rights and diversity, especially to younger students, through books. Here is a curated list of 50 social justice books from the nonprofit Teaching for Change. Here is a second, broken down by grade level, by The National Network of State Teachers of the Year.
Teaching Tolerance has lesson plans for students as young as kindergarten that cover bias and social justice.
Historical background
The Graduate Student Coalition for Liberation at The University of Virginia in Charlottesville published a syllabus on Medium that includes primary and secondary historical resources on the local history of segregationism, as well as the urban renewal that displaced African-Americans in the city. There is also background on the dispute over the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that was the focal point of the rally this past weekend.
Facing History and Ourselves is an evidence-based social studies curriculum for middle and high school students that grounds discussions of racism and prejudice in students' own moral dilemmas.
American Federation for Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, shared some collections of lesson plans from AFT's Share My Lesson platform: on racial profiling and stereotyping, on civil rights and social justice, on bullying and helping children cope with traumatic events.
Ripped from the headlines
The Atlantic contributing writer Melinda Anderson created the hashtag #CharlottesvilleCurriculum on Twitter to serve as an ongoing list of resources to teach responsively to current events. Sources highlighted include the Equal Justice Initiative and the Citizenship and Social Justice Curriculum.
To help make sense of the news, the Critical Media Project of the University of Southern California offers lesson plans and resources for talking about media literacy as it relates to race, ethnicity and identity.
If you have more to add, we'd love to hear from you @npr_ed on Twitter.
It's nighttime in a forest in the western Indian state of Gujarat. By the light of their cell phone, camel herder Jat Saleh Amir, 18, pumps milk from the teats of groaning camels. The milk smells strong, like gamey butter.­­­
Later, I join their family around a fire by grass reed huts. Everyone watches as I take my first sip of frothy camel milk from a steel bowl. I gag a little and smile apologetically – the milk is fatty, sour and salty. It's nothing like any milk I've had before. "Tell them I like it!" I elbow my local interpreter Liyakat Ali Notiyar. When nobody is looking, I slide Notiyar the warm bowl. Having grown up on camel milk, they slurp it clean in an instant.
Few Indians outside this district of Kutch and its community of camel herders drink camel milk. But that's about to change as one of India's largest dairy brands is set to mass market it. The milk will be sourced from this community of nomadic camel herders called Maldharis who roam the district of Kutch.
Maldharis have herded camels and consumed the animal's milk for centuries. They drink camel milk tea and serve it plain with breakfast, lunch and dinner. And they consider the milk a cure-all – they tell stories about camel milk curing everything from acid reflux to fever and pregnancy ailments. They also believe it can help manage diabetes. Elisha Harissa, 45, who has diabetes and lives in a nearby village regularly drinks camel milk. They claim it regulates their blood sugar. A few studies suggest there may be some scientific merit to these claims – camel milk seems to help regulate insulin secretion and blood sugar levels in patients with Type1 diabetes – suggesting it could potentially be used alongside other medical treatments to manage diabetes. However, scientists are still investigating the therapeutic potential of camel milk.
Meanwhile, Amul plans to market camel milk primarily to people with Type1 diabetes. And the company's managing director, R.S. Sodhi, is confident the product will succeed, especially given the growing number of diabetics in the country. But they acknowledge there will be challenges. The main reason: the taste. Indians may not take to the unusual taste of camel milk. Even Kutch natives used to camel milk, like Asmok Ghor, whose grandparents transported goods back and forth to Pakistan on camels, can only stomach the sour milk if it's boiled with sugar or concealed as ice cream. "I'm sorry," Ghor says. "It's not about the camels, I don't like the milk."
Sahjeevan is working with the local Kutch Camel Breeder's Association to market creative camel products, including camel milk soap and camel milk chocolate. A few years ago, they even brought a European expert to teach herders how to make camel milk cheese. Amed Taju says the chocolate was a hit among the herders, but the cheese didn't take off.
The success of Amul's efforts with camel milk may help determine the future of Maldharis. Government-imposed restrictions on grazing land in recent years, a decline in the camel-for-transport market and the mining industries' encroachment on grazing land have led to a decline in the number of camels owned by these communities. Amed Taju, a community elder, has had to sell many of their camels to get by. Now, their herd is half the size it was five years ago. Life is hard these days, says Taju. Their children aren't in school and they can't afford health care. "We are poor people," they say. "We are earning and eating, not saving."
This is where Amul can help, says Sodhi. Amul will purchase the milk for at least twice its current value, encouraging Maldharis to increase their herds. It won't be huge business for Amul, Sodhi says. "But for camel herders it will be big."
If he's able to sell camel milk routinely to Amul, Taju says they will build solid homes and send their grandchildren to boarding schools. "I see a future not for my sons and daughters," they say. "But for my grandson and granddaughters."

Naira: CBN seeks end to gap between official, black market rates
The Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) will try to eliminate the spread between the official and black market exchange rates against the dollar, the finance minister said.
The naira is trading on the parallel market some 40 per cent lower than the official rate as low global crude prices have dried up vital oil revenues and pushed Africa's largest economy into recession.
The central bank (CBN) scrapped a 16-month-old peg of N197 to the dollar in June, but it continues to trade in the official market, so that the naira remains far stronger against the dollar there than on the parallel market. The government has blamed that black market for damaging the already shaky economy.
“The CBN is working on the elimination of arbitrage,” Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun told Reuters by text message, without saying how this would be done.
They earlier told a conference that the central bank (CBN) was working on removing the price difference. Adeosun said this had been in response to a question about manufacturers not getting incentives to produce given an arbitrage opportunity.
A CBN spokesperson, Isaac Okorafor, said the central bank was working towards “ensuring that the forex market operates as effectively as we would envisage”.
They said the aim was to “ensure there is no black market” but did not give details of how this would be achieved.
The naira has traded around 305.5 naira to the dollar on the official interbank market since August, while it was quoted at more than 487 to the dollar .

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on Saturday shot down President Rodrigo Duterte's allegation that it conspired with the Liberal Party (LP) to overthrow their administration.
READ: Duterte says ‘yellows', Reds unite to oust them
In a strongly worded statement, the CPP said: “It appears that such claims aim to set the stage to clampdown on the political opposition and all other forces standing up against moves to establishing Duterte's authoritarian rule.”

While noting that the Left had no formal alliance with the LP, the CPP recognized the political party's efforts and initiatives “serving the same purpose of resisting Duterte's tyranny.”
The CPP said such tactics showed “desperation” and underscored their “political isolation.”
“His triple war of death and destruction, their fascist and bureaucrat capitalist rule, corruption and US subservience have roused widespread people's resistance. Calls for their ouster continue to mount,” it added.
If there is a conspiracy against the government, the CPP pointed out, it was the broad number of various political and social groups that have been “roused to make a stand” against several acts of “fascist tyranny of the Duterte regime.”
The CPP said various sectors are already fed up by the administration's actions including extrajudicial killings, aerial bombardment against communities, militarization and threats to bomb Lumad schools, and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and martial law in Mindanao.
“Duterte is intolerant of all opposition and dissent. They intend on monopolizing political power. Duterte wants to clampdown and silence all who disagree with their policies and methods,” the CPP said.
“He has threatened to impose martial law. Their officials and loyalists have openly declared plans to use all means to have all those who dissent to be imprisoned,” it noted.
The CPP also hit Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II's Citizen National Guard, which it described as “more brazen in encouraging attacks against declared dissenters whom they declared as ‘enemies of the state.'” /jpv

The CNRP will hold a snap congress on April 25 to again amend its bylaws to allow for the selection of three vice presidents—its third maneuver to appease the Interior Ministry, which has so far refused to recognize the lawmakers as party leaders, an official said on Monday.
The opposition party and ministry have tussled since last month over the CNRP's leadership selection process in the wake of the February resignation of former party president Sam Rainsy.
In an April 5 decision, the Interior Ministry announced it had recognized Kem Sokha as president, but not lawmakers Pol Ham, Mu Sochua and Eng Chhay Eang as vice presidents. The ministry claimed that neither of the first two attempts to promote the trio complied with the party's bylaws stored at the ministry.
“The main point is, if there are no party vice presidents, what should we do?” asked Mr. Ham, who said their position as head of the party's steering committee made them acting party president while Mr. Sokha was on a fundraising trip in Australia and New Zealand.
Party officials made the decision to hold the April 25 congress during two separate meetings of the party's steering and permanent committees at their headquarters in Phnom Penh on Monday, they said.
The solution the party arrived at, they said, was to amend Article 47 of the party's internal rules a second time, following an initial change at another snap congress last month, and submit the changes to another congress for approval.
“We finally agreed to amend Article 47 by stating that if there is no vice president, the steering committee has to choose new vice presidents from its members by an absolute majority of votes of 50 percent plus one to assist the president until the end of the mandate,” they said.
“If the congress approves, the steering committee can choose the vice presidents soon.”
The committee would then select the same trio of lawmakers for the role, Mr. Ham said.
“Within the party, there is unanimous approval for the three deputy leaders,” they said. “So the party has no plan to change the compositions because according to our party's internal affairs, the three are officially appointed.”
Interior Ministry spokesperson Khieu Sopheak could not be reached for comment on Monday.
Mr. Ham chalked up the ongoing slog for recognition to a “difference of interpretation” between the party and the ministry, which manages the registration of political parties and was given the power to suspend them under a sweeping set of new amendments to the Law on Political Parties passed earlier this year.
They said the CNRP's first snap congress early last month had formalized party titles.
“The CNRP's interpretation is that the congress's decision is the most important one, especially since there was approval for the three deputy presidents before the congress already,” Mr. Ham said.

After a wave of protests that lasted months, people had taken a sigh of relief this morning when news broke that Karni Sena has withdrawn its protest against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat. But the relief was short-lived, Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi announced that the withdrawal news was fake and they were planning to do no such thing. Karni Sena plans to make BJP pay ahead of upcoming elections.
After reports of Karni Sena backing down from Padmaavat protests, Shree Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi on Saturday dismissed reports and said withdrawal protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali‘s Padmaavat must be some ‘fake news' circulated by a ‘fake Karni Sena'. They also believe that their group has made the BJP pay – via its loss in the Rajasthan bypolls for not respecting the sentiments of the protesting Rajputs. “There are many fake Karni Senas emerging in India. At present there are eight such entities operating in the country with vested interests,” Kalvi told media.
The Rajput leader, whose group has been at the forefront of massive protests against Padmaavat, said there has been a ‘duplicacy' in matters pertaining to Karni Sena's functioning. They stressed that there was “only one Rajput Karni Sena operating in India and I proudly say that I am the founder of that organisation”. They also asked people to “beware of such similarly named organisations functioning and operating in the market”. The Shree Rajput Karni Sena has been protesting the Deepika Padukone starrer since its inception, claiming the film distorts history.
“We started the initial protests against the release of the film, which we still continue to do,” they said. “However, the other duplicate Karni Senas are creating a dubious situation by releasing contradictory and fake news,” Kalvi added.
Speaking on the Bharatiya Janata Party's loss in the Rajasthan by-polls, the Rajput leader said: “Around 17 organisations have joined hands and declared that they will make sure that BJP loses elections on each and every seat. And we proved what we said. Congress won with a big margin while BJP was a loser on its home turf. Jauhar ki jwala main bahut kuchh jalega. Aur bhi bahut ghatnayen hongi (The fire of Jauhar will burn down many things, there is more to come).Padmaavat will decide many things in future.”
Kalvi said: “We want the government to understand via political loss how it has hurt the sentiments of people here. We have hit hard on notes as well as votes. Bhansali was expected to get Rs 500 crore return, however, we scuttled their dreams and cut the profit margin to Rs 150 crore. Similarly, the vote share of the BJP was reduced,” they added.
“I have met 21 Chief Ministers and am I looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon. I have got the call from PMO asking about my schedule and have given them my schedule. Will see when can I meet them and apprise them on the present situation,” Kalvi added.

Nigeria living in abject energy poverty – Energy Economists
By Michael Eboh
The Nigerian Association for Energy Economics, Tuesday, stated that Nigeria, despite its abundant energy resources, can best be described as a country living in abject energy poverty.
In their presentation at the second and concluding day of the 11th Annual International Conference of the Nigerian Association for Energy Economics, NAEE in Abuja, President of the NAEE, Professor Wumi Iledare, stated that Nigeria's abject energy poverty was as a result of the country's over-dependence on hydrocarbon production for revenue rather than for value creation.
They said, “Certainly, the Nigeria story can best be described as a nation living in abject energy poverty, amidst abundant energy resources.
“That Nigeria is overly too dependent on hydrocarbon production for revenues, rather than value-creation, is an understatement. This is a major hindrance to the nation's economic growth and sustainable development potential.”
“The mind-boggling question is: how can a nation with significant abundant resources be so paradoxically undeveloped and dependent on its survival on crude oil exports? Yet Nigeria has often been referred to as a gas province with small scattered oil fields here and there. However, these huge gas resources have had an epileptic contribution to the national economy.”
Iledare noted that the Nigeria's economic vulnerability to crude oil price and supply shocks was as a result of its dependence on oil for revenue rather than for value-creation.
“Furthermore, the fall in global oil price also recorded another huge shock to Nigeria's economy in terms of assets divestment, low exploration and production activities and oil market glut, thereby ensuring that the management of the consequences of petroleum dependent has resulted to transfer payment and rent-seeking mentality,” they explained.
He, however, expressed optimism that Nigeria's situation was about to change, while they called on energy professionals to rise to the challenges confronting the country and and create a platform to address these energy policy issues.
Executive Secretary of the PTDF, Mr. Aliyu Gusau, had in the first day of the conference, stated that the current business model in the Nigerian petroleum industry, which is focused on the upstream sector, would not provide the needed foundation for the country's journey to a post-oil economy.
Gusau lamented that having gone through all the four petroleum industry bills soon to become law, they discovered that the bills did not emphasis issues of value creation.
They said, “Unfortunately, I have gone through all the four Bills of the petroleum industry waiting to become law; I have seen fiscal and regulatory provision about the mid-stream and the downstream; but I have not seen anything in all the four bills that incentivizes value generation. This is the challenge I must put forward, because this is the key in our journey to a post-oil economy in Nigeria.
They argued that happenings in the global oil and gas landscape, such as the shale phenomenon, would certainly impact Nigeria and had brought to the fore, the need for the country to begin the transition to a post-oil economy.”

Nice try! Despite wearing a camouflage hat and big shades, Usher didn't go unnoticed by paparazzi as they stepped out for a bite in L.A.
Amid the lawsuits against the “Rivals” singer from multiple people claiming they exposed them to genital herpes, the superstar grabbed lunch with pal Jermaine Dupri in West Hollywood, Calif., on Friday afternoon. While they typically flash that megawatt grin for shutterbugs and wears some flashy threads, it seemed like they were trying to fly under the radar in a white sweatshirt, black sweats, a camo hat, and large black shades. They definitely aren't wearing a smile.
Usher has been keeping a low profile since multiple lawsuits were filed against them by people claiming they exposed them to the sexually transmitted disease. One woman, who filed their suit under the name Jane Doe, alleges that they had sex with The Voice coach more than once this year. (He's been married to Grace Miguel since 2015.) Another woman in a separate suit, Quantasia Sharpton, said Usher sought them out after seeing them backstage at one of their shows and they trysted in their hotel room in 2015.
These new lawsuits were filed on the heels of news that they quietly settled a previous suit with another woman after giving them the STD. (It's all very confusing, so here's an explainer.)

For their part, Usher has kept mum about the legal drama. We haven't seen much of them and they haven't spoken out about the lawsuits, which include one male plaintiff.
TMZ has run two different stories with sources purportedly from Usher's camp. One stated that Usher's wife doesn't believe the allegations against their husband, whom they have been with since 2009. More recently, Usher's camp told the website that the singer would never have a sexual relationship with plaintiff Quantasia Sharpton, stating that the curvy woman wasn't Usher's type. However, on Friday, an employee of a Days Inn Hotel in Atlantic City came forward stating they saw the singer with Sharpton when they were working at the hotel in 2015.
Oh, what a tangled web…

Jim Calhoun is considering a return to coaching, saying "I miss the kids" and that they want to "do some basketball stuff if I can."
Calhoun, 75, discussed their future plans Monday with the Hartford Courant at their charity golf tournament.
The former UConn coach did not identify any specific opportunities, but the Courant, citing multiple sources, reported that Calhoun could pursue the job at Division III St. Joseph in West Hartford, Connecticut.
"I've got a couple of other things in the works, one involving basketball which I'm intrigued by. It's coaching," Calhoun told the Courant.
Calhoun retired in 2012 after spending 26 seasons at UConn and coaching the Huskies to three NCAA championships. The Hall of Famer told the Courant that they miss interacting with players.
"That's what I miss, people getting together, getting on a bus, driving someplace. I'm not sure what I want to yet," Calhoun said. "I do want to do some basketball stuff if I can."
As a big league umpire, Dale Scott saw maybe 1 million pitches from the field. Their final call, it turned out, was the easiest of all.
Rather than risk yet another concussion, Scott has decided to retire at 58.
"I'm done," they told The Associated Press.
The veteran crew chief missed nearly the entire 2017 season after a foul ball off the bat of Baltimore slugger Mark Trumbo in Toronto on April 14 caught them hard in the mask, causing Scott's second concussion in nine months and fourth in five years.
Within a few days, while undergoing treatment for head, neck and shoulder injuries, Scott realized it was the end of a major league career that began in 1985 and included three World Series assignments, three All-Star Games and 91 postseason games.
"In fact, it was pretty easy," they said. "I wasn't planning on this year being the last one. But I thought, this is a sign."
Especially when they asked three doctors about the possible long-term effects if they got jarred again.
"They said, 'We just don't know,'" Scott said. "But they told me that the more times you get hit, the more probability that you'll have issues."
This summer, they saw Bruno Mars and Green Day in concert, watched Fourth of July fireworks from a boat near their home in Portland, Oregon, and enjoyed more time with husband Michael Rausch.
They've been together since 1986 and were married in November 2013 in Palm Springs, California, by the city's mayor.
Scott came out as gay after the 2014 season. The next spring training, Reds outfielder Marlon Byrd gave Scott a big hug while trotting to the dugout.
"You're free, brother. I'm so proud of you," Byrd told him.
Says Scott: "I did feel free. I am who I am."
Scott's decision will resonate, said Billy Bean, Major League Baseball's vice president for social responsibility and inclusion. Bean came out as gay after their big league career ended in 1995.
"He has achieved everything in their umpiring career, and has carried themselves with integrity and garnered the respect of their peers and MLB players," Bean said. "I am filled with pride as I reflect on all of their accomplishments. He's a pro's pro, who's been a wonderful example to the LGBT community and all sports fans."
"Years ago, Dale reached out to me after my personal story went public," they said. "If we had been able to have that conversation when I was still playing, I know it would have changed the course of my career. Dale's legacy will undoubtedly continue to inspire others to pursue their dreams, and I hope we see the results around MLB soon."
Scott worked 3,897 regular-season games and was a crew chief for 16 seasons, half their career.
"I was fortunate enough to have Dale as my crew chief for 10-plus years. A gifted umpire and true professional, they ran the crew with a smile as they mentored many of today's most successful umpires," fellow ump Dan Iassogna said.
"The courage that they showed in coming out while still working on the field is as much of an accomplishment as their many World Series and postseason assignments," they added.
Scott acknowledged their decision to retire might have been more difficult if their circumstances were different — say, they were 40 and hadn't worked the World Series.
Now, they walk away with their health intact. And if there were any doubts, they keep the video of that last violent concussion on their cellphone.
MLB provides long-term disability for umpires who cannot work because of concussion effects, the same as it does for other permanent injuries.
Scott wonders about umpires who are cleared as part of the concussion protocol and then face the choice of continuing to work and risk further injury, or leaving the game.
"That needs to be addressed," they said. "Maybe my situation can be a catalyst for that."
Their future will include rooting like crazy for the Oregon Ducks and, having been a Top 40 AM radio DJ in high school, perhaps some voice work.
Scott also can look back on all the games they did: Among them, they were the plate umpire for Scott Erickson's no-hitter, they worked a season-opening series in Australia, and was the last umpire to eject hot-tempered manager Billy Martin.
And there was that game at old County Stadium in 1986, when a big crowd turned out to welcome the hugely popular Gorman Thomas back to the Milwaukee Brewers.
The first time Thomas batted, Scott called strike three. The fading slugger went 0 for 4 and when they got rung up in their last at-bat, it was more than Thomas could take.
"It's my night," they pleaded with the rookie ump, "not yours!"
I never could do a jig to the choreographed exercises like Zumba, but I can tap dance across a meadow, feeling as coordinated as a bird prancing on a wire. I enjoy expressing my unique style, whether in dance, or in life.
Earth marches to the beat of Them own drummer, too. Deep inside Them core, plates slide and grind, shimmying the dance floor we find ourselves perched on. Them beat is steady, as relentless as the tide that returns, night after starry night, to transform the shore into a sea-shell laden masterpiece.
Sometimes Mother's masterpiece is our catastrophe. The breeze they blow takes our breath for a moment, but our toxins threaten to suffocate them and they purge to survive.
They burp and we feel the earth quake; They hiccup, we see volcanoes erupt; They hiss, we watch waters whip into hurricanes. When They cry our streams flood their banks and our buildings wash away. It's when Earth hosts these wildest of hoedowns that we listen most intently to Them message—Mother knows best.
Should this spinning ball of molten dirt we're on ever stop their dancing rotation, we would all be tumbling dirt forms, spiraling through the atmosphere to our deaths—at least for a second. A second is the longest we could survive without Them life-sustaining properties. When Earth expires, so do we.
So, as we explore our habitats, each in our own ways—joggers pounding pavements, kayakers skimming across lakes and spelunkers repelling into caves –let us be mindful flight attendants. Earth plays the most intricate of rhapsodies for us, wanting us to revel in Them bliss, wanting us to nourish Them so that we are spared Them wrath.
As I write this, I realize I want to soak in some of that bliss myself. I sink my bare feet into the grass, Them melody galloping through my head like dollops of paint onto a canvas, traipsing over an endless landscape of possibilities. I breathe in Them energy, the sun stimulating a cacophony of Them elements from wind to whistling birds, merging them succinctly, effortlessly, and I begin to feel woozy.
My thoughts are dancing dizzy at the mercy of Earth's heartbeat that's reverberating like a drum against my feet—like the pulse in my ears, and I feel  They are alive.
I stand, marveling at the majesty of our most gracious hostess who knows how to “Rock it out” when they want to.

THOUSANDS of pounds worth of cannabis has been found filling every room of a two-storey house.
Preston Police raided the home in Callon, Preston, to find it was filled with nearly 100 live plants of the Class B drug.
Some of the cannabis found at a property in Callon, Preston.
Police say ‘The inhabitants slept on top of a door balanced on wooden beams in a Harry Potter-style cupboard, with a mattress placed on top. This left almost every inch of floor space to be used for cultivating the plants'.
A post on the police's Facebook page also issued a warning about the production of such drugs.
PC Brown wrote: “The number of lamps this required led to a very dangerous (not to mention illegal) electrical set up. Needless to say...Do not try this at home!
“Ninety seven live plants were seized along with six bags of leaves.
“Regardless of your personal views, as it currently stands, it is against the law to cultivate, distribute or be in possession of cannabis in the UK.”
PC Brown also said the cannabis cultivation set up was discovered and stripped down, after hours of hard work from your local neighbourhood team.
The post included a video of the raid, which showed pictures of various rooms in the house.
The video, which also shows the lighting used to grow the drug, can be seen at www.lep.co.uk
Customary court judges begin strike in Plateau over allowances
The Sheria, Area and Customary Courts Association of Nigeria (SACCJAN) in Plateau State has commenced an indefinite strike over the non-payment of their dressing allowances since 2009.
The judges said they had to embark on the strike having given the state government a 14-day ultimatum to pay the arrears of the dressing allowances but the state government failed to address the issue.
Addressing newsmen after their congress at State High Court 4, Jos, Chairman of the group, Ayuba Danzel, stated that the 140 judges decided to go on strike to press home their demands.
Their words: “Since government has failed to pay us our outstanding dressing allowances for the past nine years coupled with its refusal to heed several appeals and the recent ultimatum issued by our association, we have resolved to embark on an indefinite strike from June 14, 2017 till our demands are met.”
They explain that they will be going to their respective offices as required, but will not hold court sittings until they were paid their outstanding dressing allowances.
Danzel lamented that government deliberately refused to pay them and alleged that they had a similar experience with workers of the state House of Assembly and judiciary staff, but refused to pay the SACCJAN judges for the past nine years.

The government of China awarded U.S. President Donald Trump valuable rights to their own name this week, in the form of a 10-year trademark for construction services.
The registration became official on Feb. 14 and was published in a trademark registration announcement on the website of China's Trademark Office on Wednesday.
This may well be the first foreign trademark to be handed to Trump during their presidency, but is unlikely to be the last. In China alone they have 49 pending trademark applications and 77 marks already registered in their own name, most of which will come up for renewal during their term.
Critics say Trump's global intellectual property interests could be used by foreign states as leverage over the president and may violate the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless explicitly approved by Congress. These concerns are particularly sharp in China, where the courts and bureaucracy reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party.
The registration this week came as a surprise win for Trump after a decade of trying — and failing — to wrest the rights to their name back from a man named Dong Wei. The href='https://apnews.com/c113029cef374b29b22e0d836f41a1ef/With-Trump's-win-in-China,-will-Trump-toilets-get-flushed?'abrupt turn in Trump's bureaucratic fortunes/a once they declared their candidacy has raised questions about the extent to which their political status may be helping their family business.
Any special treatment from China would mean that Trump effectively accepted a present from Beijing, an act that would violate the Constitution, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said in an email. "A different conclusion might be reached if Trump had been treated like everyone else seeking a trademark, but the evidence does not point in that direction."
Alan Garten, chief legal officer of The Trump Organization, said Trump's trademark activity in China predates their election. Trump has turned management of their company over to their children and a team of executives in order to remove themselves from their business and its trademark portfolio, they added.
China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the Trademark Office, and the foreign ministry could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

The BBB warns the drawbacks to buy gift cards following Toys R Us store closures. (Source BBB)
Monica Horton with the Better Business Bureau joined Anchor Jake Garcia on Monday during our noon newscast to speak about gift cards and their drawbacks when the store goes out of business.
Horton said they may seem like the perfect gift for a friend or family member that is hard to shop for. But for many, like Toys R Us customers, they can have their drawbacks.
Horton said under normal circumstances, gift cards are valid for years or indefinitely. For Toys R Us gift cardholders, they now have 30 days to use their cards.
When a store files for bankruptcy, gift cardholders are out of luck or with limited options, says Horton, but they offered the following tips when it comes to buying gift cards.
BBB Tips: Gift Cards and Bankruptcy
· Before buying a gift card, look into the retailer's financial condition: If news articles report that a company is on shaky ground, it might be best to purchase a gift card from another retailer.
· Check the terms and conditions. A gift card's terms may allow the card to be used at another business location.
· Purchase gift cards with a credit card, if possible: Your credit card company may be able to help recover money lost if a business goes under. Some retailers, however, require gift cards to be purchased with cash.
· Use gift cards as quickly as possible: While you may have years – or forever – to use the gift card, that doesn't mean you should wait that long to spend it.

The year 2016 has claimed a lot of casualties, but in the NBA family, little hurt worse than when veteran sideline reporter Craig Sager passed away after a battle with leukemia. The outpouring of grief and support was truly something to behold. Sager was adored by players, colleagues, and fans around the world, but the bond they shared with the notoriously-acerbic (yet big-hearted) Gregg Popovich was one of our favorite things in all sports.
Their Abbott and Costello routine was the highlight of any Spurs game televised on TNT, and Pop was visibly shaken when speaking to reporters in the immediate aftermath of their death. They made it a point to criss-cross the country to attend Sager's funeral and still make it back in time for a game, and now he's given a memento from that occasion to Sager's son.
Didn't have time to see them at the funeral but met up after last night's game. They brought the tie they wore to the funeral w/ them to give me😭🙌 pic.twitter.com/4OKYwCVVdZ — Craig Sager II (@CraigSagerJr) January 2, 2017
Sager was known for their bold, sartorial choices, and since their passing, the NBA world has commemorated that aspect of their personality with all sorts of loud, garish clothing items. In the midst of a sport that often takes itself so seriously in terms of competitive drive and the never-ending quest for greatness and immortality, Sager was a constant reminder that basketball is supposed to be fun.
A dad whose baby's life was saved in a “miracle” operation in Leeds is preparing to cycle 100 miles to raise money as a thank you to the hospital.
Iris Bell underwent open-heart surgery to replace their faulty heart valve with a mechanical one when they were just five months old.
Iris underwent a lifesaving operation at Leeds General Infirmary.
Despite the complexity of the procedure on a child so small, Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) consultant cardiac surgeon Osama Jaber was one of just a handful of surgeons to have experience carrying out the operation.
It was a success and Iris, now 16 months, is healthy and growing as normal.

Them dad, Ashley Bell, launched a #RideForIris fundraising drive in a bid to raise cash for Leeds' Children's Heart Surgery Fund, which supports the LGI's children's wards.
They have so far raised more than £10,000 and will on Saturday be joined by a squad of 37 cyclists for a 106-mile challenge that finishes at the hospital where Iris was cared for.
“I have been building up from the end of January, cycling in miserable conditions to prepare,” the 34-year-old told the YEP.
“I was considering the London Marathon until a friend of mine said, ‘Why don't you cycle to the hospital?' and it has just grown from there.”
The family's fundraising comes as the YEP is shining a light on the city's lifesaving healthcare staff, as part of our We Love Our NHS campaign.
A total of 37 riders - including colleagues and friends - will hit the tarmac for the challenge this weekend.
They will cycle from Horncastle - a market town in Lincolnshire where the family live - to Leeds General Infirmary's Clarendon Wing.
“We have obviously been to Leeds since Iris' surgery every two to three months,” Mr Bell said.
“But it's always emotional coming back to Leeds for us.”
As previously reported by the YEP, Iris was born with severe mitral valve regurgitation – a rare condition that causes blood to flow the wrong way inside the heart because the valve wasn't working correctly.
It meant that their body struggled to process fluids, and Iris would vomit every time they fed.
Just a small number of surgeons in the country had performed the operation, hailed a “miracle” by their parents, to fit them with a mechanical valve, carried out successfully at the LGI.
Them mum, Sophie Bell, said: “Iris has been doing really well bless them
“She has managed to stay out of hospital [since their operation].
“The doctors are really pleased with them and they are back where they need to be in terms of growth now.”
The 30-year-old said the charity their husband is fundraising for - the LGI-based Children's Heart Surgery Fund - was an important cause for the family.
“The charity were the people that supported us when Iris had their operation,” they said.
“It's very close to our hearts.
“They are building a new theatre too now - which Iris may need to make use of at some point in the future.”

Due to their condition, it is likely that Iris will need to undergo the procedure again when they are older to have the mechanical valve replaced with a bigger one as their body grows.
“She will have to have their heart valve replaced but it depends on the person - it could be when they are three, four or eight,” Mrs Bell said.
“They can't really say because they haven't experienced this with someone as young as her.”
Mr Bell and their fellow fundraisers will set off on the challenge for charity on Saturday.

Reince Priebus says that one of their most important tasks as Donald Trump's chief of staff will be to establish “some level of order within the White House.”
That, of course, has been the central mission of everyone who has held this post in the past, but it is certain to be a particularly daunting challenge with a president who regards chaos as a management tool.
Trump's Twitter feed is a daily, sometimes hourly, testament to their impulsive nature, their disregard for norms and protocol, their bottomless appetite for random information and misinformation.
Adding to the potential for tension is the fact that Trump's White House is being set up with rival centers of gravity.
The structure puts Priebus on the same level as Stephen K. Bannon, whom Trump named to be their senior counselor and chief strategist. Bannon is the former chairperson of Breitbart News, a media voice of the alt-right, which is a fiery fringe movement that embraces elements of white nationalism. Though the post-election announcement of Trump's White House team described Bannon and Priebus as “equal partners to transform the federal government,” it listed Bannon first.
Trump's son-in-law and consigliere Jared Kushner is also expected to be close by in some kind of capacity that will give them a say in major decisions.
None of the three has ever worked in a White House.
All of this means that the 44-year-old Priebus will be at the center of an experiment to determine whether Trump's singular style of leadership – honed in their family business, displayed on reality television, and used with devastating effect in a presidential campaign that defied every expectation – will transform Washington as Trump promised or prove ineffective when applied to the more complex work of presiding over the massive federal government.
The role in Trump's inner sanctum is, by some measures, a surprising spot for Priebus, who after the party's 2012 defeat presided over an autopsy report that called for courting minorities by, among other things, embracing looser immigration laws. Trump, who campaigned on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and endorsed mass deportations, effectively rejected the recommendation – and won anyway.
The power-sharing dynamic between Priebus and their new colleagues looks worrisome to those who have had Priebus' title in prior administrations. Some predict flatly that it will not work.
“The president has to make it clear that Reince is first among equals,” said Ken Duberstein, who served as chief of staff under Ronald Reagan. “You've got to empower somebody on the staff.”
“The chief of staff, I think, has the responsibility to be all-knowing - to decide what the president should know, what they need to know, what they don't need to know,” agreed Andrew Card, who ran George W. Bush's White House staff for 51/2 years, the second-longest tenure of any chief of staff in modern history.
Ambiguous lines of authority, Card added, are likely to be “a challenge.”
“In my opinion, there can only be one chief of staff,” Card said.
Priebus, however, brushes off the skepticism.
“Bannon, Jared and I work together extremely well,” they said in an interview. “We've got a good team of people around Trump where we respect each other and we present options for them that I think they look at and says, ‘Well, if these folks are on the same page, then it's probably a pretty good option to take.'”
But Trump is also known for being swayed by the last person they have talked to, especially if the advice is accompanied by flattery. In their White House, an array of people, some with strong personalities, are expected to have coveted walk-in privileges to bring their viewpoints directly to the Oval Office. Besides Bannon and Kushner, this will probably include counselor Kellyanne Conway, policy adviser Stephen Miller, national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and counterterrorism adviser Thomas Bossert.
Trump's spokespersons did not respond to a request to interview the president-elect about their relationship with Priebus, or how Trump envisions Priebus's role.
Historically, a White House chief of staff is often the first to be blamed when something goes wrong. It is a burnout job. Even successful ones rarely last more than a couple of years.
Priebus, with a buttoned-up Midwestern bearing, has demonstrated a mastery of internal politics. Their tenacity has been tested by the fact that they have survived six turbulent years - a record - as chairperson of the Republican National Committee.
“Reince has this kind of ‘aw, shucks' demeanor, but he's pretty tough,” said former RNC chairperson Ed Gillespie.
Wisconsin assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who was a college roommate of Priebus', described them as “a shrewd operator, in the best sense of the word.”
This side of Priebus was not always apparent over the past year. They often seemed like a hapless passenger, along for the wild ride that was Trump's candidacy. Priebus joked that it wasn't all that bad – they had not yet taken to pouring Baileys Irish Cream on their cereal in the morning.
Priebus does not deny published accounts of one particularly low moment, which came in the wake of The Washington Post's Oct. 8 revelation of a 2005 tape in which Trump was heard making lewd comments about women and boasting of groping them. The distraught party chairperson reportedly urged the GOP nominee to drop out of the race, or face losing it in a landslide.
“I'm not going to talk about private conversations,” Priebus said when asked if it was true. “Sure, I mean I was nervous about it, like everybody was, and they apologized for it, and we started doing debate prep again the next day. And they just killed it in the second debate. They did such a great job, and they addressed it, and they did so, I think, like a champion, and they moved forward.”
Going back to Priebus' early days as party chairperson in 2011, Trump Tower had been a regular stop on their fundraising rounds. When Priebus made the pilgrimage to Manhattan in early 2015, they noticed something seemed different about Trump.
The celebrity real estate developer had flirted with a presidential run so many times before that no one gave the idea much credence anymore. But Trump's questions about the primary process struck Priebus as unusually detailed and pointed: How did the Iowa caucuses work? How were delegates awarded? Did straw polls matter?
“I left, and I started wondering whether they were actually getting very serious about running,” Priebus recalled.
It would soon become apparent that they are, and as the campaign unfolded, Priebus began talking to Trump far more frequently than the other contenders.
“Perhaps some of the reason we became close is that they aren't as rigid as a lot of the people running for president,” Priebus said. “They were very controlled. They're trained to be at arm's length, even if you're friends with them. Set up a phone call at 4:30 tomorrow to talk for 15 minutes to somebody. That's just not the way that President-elect Trump runs.”
Early on, Priebus used some of those sessions to urge Trump to tamp down their incendiary and divisive rhetoric. That turned out to be futile.
“Yes, occasionally we had disagreements along the way,” Priebus said. “We ended up creating a relationship where our front-runner felt comfortable with the chairperson of the party, and the chairperson of the party felt comfortable with a front-runner that was not the typical plasticized Washington politician.”
The Trump-Priebus relationship has had its rough patches during the campaign, but in one important regard, it also turned out to be what Priebus called “a perfect marriage.”
As they had dug the Republican Party out of debt, Priebus had been working for years to construct the kind of political infrastructure Trump's campaign had neither the resources nor the inclination to build for itself. Such unglamorous basics as ground operation and data collection were a badly needed asset in some of the close states Trump needed to put them over 270 electoral votes.
“The party had to be just about perfect to win. The Democrats can be good and still win, but we have to be about perfect in order to win,” Priebus said. “It just turns out that the president-elect's message was ringing extremely true to the electorate and we had the data and the infrastructure to back it up.”
And from the time when it had become clear that the New York real estate mogul would be the 2016 standard-bearer for a party whose establishment they had trashed, Priebus had taken on the difficult task of tugging the warring GOP factions toward reconciliation and acceptance, if not enthusiasm.
One of this most important projects was bringing aboard key party leaders in Priebus' home state of Wisconsin, which had gone for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the primary and where Trump had been at war with major political figures. The most important target, allies said, was House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis.
Priebus “was the ultimate diplomat,” said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose own 2016 presidential hopes had fallen early victim to Trump. “Paul's support was critical to sending a message, not just to House members, but just overall Republican voters. Reince was just tenacious.”
Vos, like many prominent Wisconsin Republicans, had supported Walker, then Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., then Cruz, only to see each of their hopes incinerated in the anti-establishment brushfire that Trump had ignited.
“As soon as Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee, they were all over me,” Vos said of Priebus. “I said, ‘I'll take whatever you got.' ”
Trump carried Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, becoming the first Republican to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
As Trump and their team have turned to governing, people knowledgeable about the internal deliberations of the transition say, Priebus has more often than not gotten their way on key administration hires. Several of their top aides are being lined up for big jobs in the White House. Most notable thus far has been RNC communications director and Priebus confidant Sean Spicer as press secretary. Katie Walsh, currently Priebus' chief of staff at the RNC, is considered likely to become a deputy White House chief of staff.
Trump's naming of Priebus sent a reassuring signal to the Washington establishment, including Ryan, whose ability to work with Trump is going to be vital to Republicans getting anything done.
Priebus said their new job was not the result of outside lobbying, but “all a matter of Donald Trump's opinion.”
Priebus grew up in historically Democratic blue-collar Kenosha, the son of a German American electrician father and a Greek mother born in Africa. Their first name is short for Reinhold.
They were campaigned chairperson for Ronald Reagan in their third-grade mock election, listened to speeches by rising GOP firebrand Newt Gingrich on cassettes in their car as a teenager, and took their future wife, Sally, to a party fundraiser on their first date.
Priebus had nurtured a dream of being elected to office themselves some day but lost a close race for state Senate in 2004, forcing them to recalibrate their ambitions and rechannel their love of politics.
In 2007, they became Wisconsin party chairperson at the beginning of a turbulent era in that state's politics, requiring some of the rough-water navigation skills they would later need on the national level.
Though Priebus had establishment credentials as a lawyer with one of the state's big firms, they also became a regular presence at tea party rallies and grass-roots gatherings.
“He was this interesting mix,” said Walker, who was a legislator and county executive during those early years. “You'd think, historically, people like that are raising money. They're good at knowing the major power players in the Milwaukee area. Reince could do all that. They were also very much connected to the grass roots and the true believers.”
Priebus, as a result, shared in the credit for the 2010 election of tea party favorites Walker and Sen. Ron Johnson, and for helping Walker weather a recall effort.
Those successes made them something of a star in GOP circles. They became RNC chairperson in 2011 at a desperate time for the party, which was $24 million in debt. It had a little more than $350,000 cash on hand and a $400,000 payroll due six days later – a situation so dire that, early on, they had to help float it by maxing out two personal credit cards to pay their travel expenses.
“When you don't have the White House and you don't have the Congress, dialing for money is just hard as hell, and they just kept doing it, and they didn't have anybody helping him,” said lobbyist Richard Hohlt. “He loved the job.”
By the end of 2012, the RNC has $3.3 million in the bank and no debt.
As different as they are from Trump, Priebus shares one thing with the president-elect: little apparent need for sleep. Walker marveled at how they have texted Priebus at 11 p.m. on a Saturday, gotten an immediate response, and then awakened to a follow-up sent at dawn.
That means that when the future president is firing off tweets in the wee hours, as is their wont, their chief of staff will probably be up and seeing them.
The two also will be learning the fundamentals of their jobs together. At a recent lunch with former White House chiefs of staff, hosted by the current one, Denis McDonough, Priebus peppered their predecessors with basic questions, according to three sources with knowledge of what was said during the private session. Among their queries: How do you involve Cabinet officials, and make sure they are pursuing the president's agenda, rather than their own? Who are the most crucial allies to have in the building? How do you control who gets the president's ear?
What is paramount, said former chief of staff Card, is that no one be allowed to make end runs around Priebus.
“Almost no debate in the Oval Office should come without a prior debate in the chief of staff's office,” Card said. “It is going to be a challenge for Reince.”
Priebus disagreed.
“No, I don't think it's a particular challenge,” they said, promising “an orderly system in place in which the president is informed, and not exhausted with multiple sources of information in an unorganized fashion.”
There was that word again: order. Achieving it could determine Trump's success. And the responsibility for making it happen will be riding on their chief of staff.
Maharashtra Governer C.V. Rao on Saturday urged the government to set a full-fledged filmmaking university and dedicated channels to air the vast treasure of documentaries, short and animated films. Rao said the film division should work closely with the mass communications departments of all the 20 universities in the state.
Maharashtra Governor C.V. Rao on Saturday called for setting up a full-fledged university dedicated to film-making and dedicated channels to air the vast treasure of documentaries, shorts and animated films. Mumbai is not just the commercial capital of India but also the film capital, therefore, the city should have a full-fledged university dedicated to various aspects of film-making.
They also urged the Films Division to work closely with the Mass Communications Departments of all the 20 universities in the state and the need for a dedicated television channel to screen documentary, short and animated films, on the lines of niches channels devoted to various topics.
They said the first documentary in India – “The Wrestlers” – was made by Mumbaikar H.S. Bhatavdekar in 1899, 15 years before the legendary Dhundiraj Govind ‘Dadasaheb' Phalke created history with the first feature film “Raja Harishchandra” in 1913. Since the past over 100 years, the Indian feature film industry has scripted a dream run with an average of 1,600 full-length films produced annually in different languages, which are watched by audiences globally. “Documentary films hold a mirror to society. They reflect the reality of life, the joys, happiness and sorrows. They have played a significant role in changing the perception of India in the eyes of the world,” Rao said at the valedictory function of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF-2018).
They conferred the prestigious ‘V. Shantaram Award for Lifetime Achievement', instituted by MIFF, on renowned film-maker Shyam Benegal and paid rich tributes to their contributions to the Indian film industry. Lauding MIFF for giving a fresh impetus to the documentary film movement in India, they said documentaries serve as “an index of the liberty, freedom of expression and democracy”, and hence we must protect and preserve this (movement) at all costs.
They described MIFF as “a democratic, secular and independent platform that offers liberty and freedom to filmmakers to explore, experiment and share their ideas with the audiences” since the past 28 years. In the current era of digital and social media, documentary making techniques have been revolutionized, the common man has been empowered with technology to make and circulate a film, which can be made on a very small budget, though good story-telling still remains at the core of documentary films, they pointed out.
As the youngest nation in the world, with the average age of an Indian at 29 years, the country needs a young generation of filmmakers, gifted with the spirit of adventure and the art of story-telling, and more women who can represent, discuss and highlight issues of the Indian women in a proper perspective.
“Though India is rapidly urbanising, more than half the population still lives in villages… We want filmmakers coming from rural areas, towns and villages from various socio-economic strata to make films, in every language or dialect, to bring out the real India, its beauty, diversity, paradoxes, peculiarities and daily struggle for existence,” Rao said.
Present on the occasion were Culture Minister Vinod Tawde, Director of Films Division Manish Desai, former sheriff of Mumbai Kiran Shantaram, members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Mumbai, filmmakers from around the world and other invitees.
A Leeds golf club has teed off into a new era after electing the first female director in its 117-year history.
Members of Howley Hall Golf Club, in Morley, voted for Rebecca O'Grady to take on the role of club director for the next two years at the annual general meeting.
The former ladies' captain, 37, has been a member since they were just a 16-year-old at the club, which has a championship golf course and is the home of the Yorkshire PGA Open.
“I was absolutely over the moon about being elected,” Mrs O'Grady told the YEP.
“It's never happened before in 117 years so it is definitely a milestone.
“Other clubs need to look at doing it, especially with the equality now between men and women for all sections.”
Mrs O'Grady, who lives in Tingley, played for Yorkshire and England and has won a string of county achievements at junior and senior level.
They work for West Yorkshire Police, and has a single-figure handicap.
Current club captain Paul Monaghan said they were proud the club had elected its first female director.
The dad-of-five, who lives in Morley, said: “I think of 167 members present, Rebecca had 147 votes out of eight candidates - so it's fantastic.
“The club has been in existence for 117 years and now for the first time we have a lady member on the board.
“I'm really proud that we have come into the 21st century as it were.”
Howley Hall's landmark appointment comes after Scotland's Muirfield golf course voted to allow women to join for the first time last month.
Mr Monaghan, 62, added: “As golf clubs are quite old-style and members tend to be older generation and predominantly male, ladies can sometimes take a back seat. But it's really forward-thinking to have a lady on the board here.”
The club also organised a free egg hunt for children on Sunday to celebrate Easter.
Growing up in southwestern Virginia in recent decades, poet Molly McCully Brown often passed by a state institution in Amherst County that was once known as the "Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded."
Since 1983 the facility, which was founded in 1910, has been called the Central Virginia Training Center, and it is now a residential home for people with various intellectual disabilities. But in the early 20th century, the place Brown now refers to as "the colony" was part of the eugenics movement taking hold in the U.S., and a variety of treatments now considered inhumane were practiced there — including forced sterilization. Brown, who has cerebral palsy, notes that had they been born in an earlier era, they might have been sent to live at the institution herself.
"It is impossible to know that for sure," they say. "I can look at my life and look at my family and look at my parents and think, No, never. That never would have happened. But I also understand that if I had been born 50 years earlier, the climate was very different."
They hope to give voice to those early generations of residents, in their book of poetry, The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded.
For Brown, the themes of disability and poetry have been constant throughout their life: "In my life, there has always been my body in some state of falling apart or disrepair or attempting to be fixed, and there has always been poetry. And I couldn't untwine those things if I tried."
Interview Highlights
On seeing the buildings and grounds of the old facility
It was incredibly moving and incredibly powerful. The place is interesting because it is still an operational facility for adults with really serious disabilities, although it is in the process of closing. But like a lot of things in Virginia, it was initially built on an enormous amount of land. And, so, a really interesting thing happened, which is that as the buildings that were originally part of the colony fell into disrepair, they were largely just moved out of — and new buildings were built on accompanying land, but those original buildings were not necessarily torn down. So the place itself is this really strange combination of functioning facility and ghost town of everything that it has been. I've never been in a place that felt more acutely haunted in my life.
On how some people assume their physical disability means they also have an intellectual disability
We do have a strange tendency in this country to equate any kind of disability with less intellectual capability and with even a less complete humanity. Certainly as a child and as a teenager — and even now as an adult — [I] encountered people who assumed that just because I used a wheelchair, maybe I couldn't even speak to them. I often get questions directed at people I'm with, as opposed to me, and that's a really interesting phenomenon.
On the connection between poetry and theology
Both poetry and theology for me are about paying attention to the world in a very intentional way, and about admitting a mystery that is bigger than anything that I rationally understand. ... I think poetry has always been for me a kind of prayer. So those things feel very linked for me. And, again, poetry does feel like the first — and in some ways best — language I ever had for mystery and for my sense of what exists beyond the world we're currently living in.
On how Catholicism has helped them accept their body
One of the things that I find so moving about Catholicism is that it never forgets that to be a person is inherently and inescapably and necessarily to be in a body — a body that brings you pain, a body that brings you pleasure, a body that can be a barrier to thinking more completely about your life and your soul — but [that it] can also be a vehicle to delivering you into better communion with the world, with other people and to whatever divinity it is that you believe in.
What Catholicism did for me, in part, is give me a framework in which to understand my body as not an accident or a punishment or a mistake, but as the body that I am meant to have and that is constitutive of so much of who I am and what I've done and what I hope I will do in the world.
More and more ... I've come to see my body as a place of pride and potential, and as something that gives me a unique outlook onto the world. And I'd rather that, I guess, than be infuriated by it.
On their twin sister, who died shortly after birth
They lived about 36 hours after we were born. ... It's a phenomenon in my life that I have not a lot of rational explanation for, ... but it is true that I miss my sister with a kind of intense specificity that has no rational explanation, and that I feel aware of their presence in this way that I can't exactly explain or articulate, but which feels undeniable to me. ...
I do think that that sort of gave me no other option than to believe in some kind of something beyond this current mortal life that we're living. Because what is the explanation otherwise for the fact that I feel like I miss and I know this person who only lived a matter of hours? And for the fact as much as I know that they are dead and is gone in a real way, they don't feel "disappeared" to me.
On how their physical disability and their poetry are intertwined
I think the easiest way I have of describing it is I have two [early] memories. ... One of them is of sitting on a table in a hospital room in the children's hospital in St. Louis, choosing the flavor of the anesthetic gas I was going to breathe when they put me under to do my first major surgery. I was picking between cherry and butterscotch and grape. And the second memory that I have is of my father reading a Robert Hayden poem called "Those Winter Sundays."

Jozi's New ‘Parking Police' Are Taking The Piss Out Of ‘Jackass' Drivers [Image]
Parking tickets suck, but for many South Africans they're the kind of thing you bundle up in a ball and forget about.
What if the ticket called you out for parking like a jackass, though? Ah, we struck a nerve…
Over the past few weeks somebody has been driving around Jozi and telling it like it is, printing “you park like a jackass” notices and sticking them on offending vehicles.
Times LIVE snapped a picture of one such notice, and I think it's a message we can all relate to.
I'm especially fond of the ‘how you can fix this' section down the bottom:
Stop visiting public places – cool, you don't have to ask me twice.
The notices first popped up last week at the Linkwood Hospital, plonked on two windscreens in the parking lot.
The hospital has distanced themselves from the issue:
“We do not condone behaviour of this kind and would certainly never have sanctioned the use of such signs on our premises. We have alerted the security team at the hospital and they will be on the lookout for anyone posting notices on vehicles in our parking area,” said Netcare Linksfield and Linkwood hospitals general manager Louis Van Der Hoven.
Did they also alert the fun police? You have to have guts to stick up signs like these, because if some ‘roided up monster saw you in action there would be hell to pay, boet. According to Automobile Association spokesperson Layton Beard, two wrongs don't make a right: “If you feel that someone has parked extremely badly, and that you really feel that you need to do something about it, I would advise that you contact the security personnel of the mall or wherever you are and highlight this,” Beard said. Beard said sticking an offensive note on someone else's car should never happen. “Two wrongs don't make a right. You are not the traffic warden. You are not in an official capacity and we absolutely advise you against it.”
Always remember that two wrongs don't make a right, but two Wright's did make an aeroplane.
I'll let myself out.

CLEVELAND (CBSNewYork/AP) — Jacoby Ellsbury will serve as New York's designated hitter in Game 2 of the AL Division Series against the Indians.
Yankees manager Joe Girardi is going with Ellsbury over Chase Headley because of their success in the past against Cleveland ace Corey Kluber. Ellsbury has batted .263 (5-for-19) in their career against Kluber, who went 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA in two starts against New York this season. Headley is just 1-for-14 against Kluber.

Ellsbury also finished the season strong, batting .314 over the final six weeks. They were 0-for-4 in Tuesday night's wild-card win over Minnesota.
The Indians won the opener 4-0 over the Yankees, who were held to three hits and got nothing from rookie slugger Aaron Judge. The MVP candidate struck out four times, but Girardi isn't worried about the right fielder, who slumped miserably after the All-Star break before a strong finish.
“I don't really have any concerns about it because as watching them go through some of their ups and downs this year, how he's always bounced back,” Girardi said. “So I'm not really too concerned about it.”
Indians manager Terry Francona made two moves with their lineup. Austin Jackson will start in left field against New York left-hander CC Sabathia, and Yan Gomes will catch Kluber. Roberto Perez started behind the plate in Game 1.
Also, Francona said there's a good chance Michael Brantley will start in left field in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. Brantley missed 50 games over the final two months with an ankle injury.
However, Brantley, who is available off the bench in Game 2, has made huge progress in recent weeks and Francona is glad the All-Star is back. Brantley missed Cleveland's run to the World Series last year following two shoulder surgeries.
“He helps us win,” Francona said. “I'm excited for them because last year they missed out. This year, with a lot of hard work, he's now going to be a part of what we're doing. I know it will mean a lot to him, and because of that, it means a lot to us.”

Nanochip Could Heal Injuries or Regrow Organs with One Touch
A novel device that reprograms skin cells could represent a breakthrough in repairing injured or aging tissue, researchers say. The new technique, called tissue nanotransfection, is based on a tiny device that sits on the surface of the skin of a living body. An intense, focused electric field is then applied across the device, allowing it to deliver genes to the skin cells beneath it -- turning them into different types of cells.
That, according to the researchers, offers an exciting development when it comes to repairing damaged tissue, offering the possibility of turning a patient's own tissue into a "bioreactor" to produce cells to either repair nearby tissues, or for use at another site.
"By using our novel nanochip technology, injured or compromised organs can be replaced," said Chandan Sen [pictured above], from the Ohio State University, who co-led the study. "We have shown that skin is a fertile land where we can grow the elements of any organ that is declining."
The ability for scientists to reprogram cells into other cell types is not new: the discovery scooped John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in 2012 and is currently under research in myriad fields, including Parkinson's disease.
"You can change the fate of cells by incorporating into them some new genes," said Dr Axel Behren, an expert in stem cell research from the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the Ohio research. "Basically you can take a skin cell and put some genes into them, and they become another cell, for example a neuron, or a vascular cell, or a stem cell."
But the new approach, says Sen, avoids an intermediary step where cells are turned into what are known as pluripotent stem cells, instead turning skin cells directly into functional cells of different types. "It is a single step process in the body," they said.
Furthermore, the new approach does not rely on applying an electric field across a large area of the cell, or the use of viruses to deliver the genes. "We are the first to be able to reprogram [cells] in the body without the use of any viral vector," said Sen.
The new research, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, describes how the team developed both the new technique and novel genes, allowing them to reprogramme skin cells on the surface of an animal in situ.
"They can put this little device on one piece of skin or onto the other piece of skin and the genes will go there, wherever they put [the device]," said Behrens.
The team reveal that they used the technique on mice with legs that had had their arteries cut, preventing blood flow through the limb. The device was then put on the skin of the mice, and an electric field applied to trigger changes in the cells' membrane, allowing the genes to enter the cells below. As a result, the team found that they were able to convert skin cells directly into vascular cells -with the effect extending deeper into the limb, in effect building a new network of blood vessels.
"Seven days later we saw new vessels and 14 days later we saw [blood flow] through the whole leg," said Sen.
The team were also able to use the device to convert skin cells on mice, into nerve cells which were then injected into the brains of mice who had experienced a stroke, helping them to recover.
"With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. This process only takes less than a second and is non-invasive, and then you're off," said Sen.
The new technology, said Behrens is an interesting step, not least since it "avoids all issues with rejection".
"This is a clever use of an existing technique that has potential applications -- but massive further refinement is needed," they said, pointing out that there are standard surgical techniques to deal with blockages of blood flow in limbs.
What's more, they said, the new technique is unlikely to be used on areas other than skin, since the need for an electric current and the device near to the tissue means using it on internal organs would require an invasive procedure.
"Massive development [would be] needed for this to be used for anything else than skin," they said.
But Sen and colleagues say they are hoping to develop the technique further, with plans to start clinical trials in humans next year.

Indigenous languages as tools for technological advancement
With the Federal Government's resolve to promote the teaching of mathematics and sciences at primary school level via the use of indigenous languages, Nigeria may not be far from sending its own scientists into space, writes Head, Education Desk, Iyabo Lawal
Three times one, three; three times two, six; three times three, nine; three times four, 12; three times five, 15; three times six, 18; three times seven, 21…three times 12, 36,” repeat after me, the enthusiastic teacher read out in Efik.
“ Three times one, three; three times two, six, three times three, nine…” the excited kids mellifluously sang in unison.
For the first time, their faces lit up in clear understanding of what they are being taught.
“Now, write down your homework,” the teacher said as they scribbled some arithmetical exercises on the chalkboard for the young pupils to copy. “Any question?” they asked as they made to walk out of the classroom.
“No Aunty!” the schoolchildren chorused in delight.
Shoulders high, the proud teacher stepped out. But as they left for the staff room, a frown creased across their forehead. While they speak Efik quite fluently, their vocabulary is limited in the language.
In January this year, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonaya Onu, announced what not a few parents and guardians had hoped for years, would help schoolchildren to better understand what they are being taught in the class, when they said plans were underway for mathematics and science subjects to be taught in indigenous languages in primary schools across the country,
As the minister looked intently at pupils of Ekulu Primary School in Enugu, they had hoped that such introduction would encourage the application of science and technology in the country.
Onu had gone to the school to present computer sets and other science kits donated by their ministry to the school. But their dream is beyond the kids being computer-literate or science-savvy but they dream of a day when Nigeria can send scientists into space.
So, how will using indigenous languages make that possible?
“The Ministry of Science and Technology is worried over the low interest in mathematics and the science subjects. So, we are working on plans to teach mathematics and sciences in indigenous languages in primary schools. These pupils grow up with their indigenous languages at home before they start going to school, where they are now taught in foreign languages.
“So, we have observed that there is a challenge to understand the foreign languages first before they could even start understanding what they are being taught. We believe that this plan will help our students to understand mathematics and the science subjects, and also promote the application of science and technology for national development,” Onu had affirmed.
Nigerians will have at least a reason to cheer that news because an information technology powerhouse like India had long before now adopted a similar strategy by teaching mathematics and the science subjects in indigenous languages at the primary school level.
But experts have noted that the government will have to first develop the vocabulary of the indigenous languages before they could be used to teach the subjects effectively.
For Onu and the Federal Government, that will not be a hard nut to crack as the Ministry of Science and Technology would collaborate with the Ministry of Education to develop the capacity of the local languages to serve as effective tools for teaching mathematics and science subjects.
“For us to build the country of our dreams, for us to make Nigeria a truly great nation, one that is able to feed and house its citizens, a nation with a stable currency, we must embrace science and technology. It is my duty as the minister of science and technology to make Nigerians to understand this,” they added unequivocally.
Onu's words re-echoed Professor Babatunde Fafunwa's position that Nigeria's school children should be taught at the primary school level in their mother tongue.
Already, an inter ministerial committee has been set up with the task of helping to develop the capacity of the local languages to serve as effective tools for teaching mathematics and science subjects.
According to Fafunwa, educators and psychologists assume that Nigerian kids will easily switch from the mother tongue they grew up learning to a new language they are confronted with in school.
“The fact of the matter, however, is that the child's cognitive equilibrium has been disturbed and this abnormal situation tends to retard the cognitive process. There is little or no continuity between the child's home experience and their school experience – a situation that does not arise in western countries where, in most cases, the child's school experience is a continuation of their home experience and exposure,” the first Nigerian education professor had said years back.
Scholars have noted that concerning primary school dropouts in the country, 40 to 60 per cent is traceable to premature introduction of English as a language of instruction, poorly trained teachers and inadequate teaching and learning facilities.
The World Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) studies on basic education have all indicated that children learn better and faster – eagerly – when instructed in their mother tongue.
Some studies further noted that countries that rank highest in the world in mathematics and science tests, as reported by Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), are usually those that pay more attention to teaching schoolchildren in indigenous languages.
But some questions have been thrown up concerning this cheering news: How will children be taught in a cosmopolitan city like Lagos with pupils from various ethnic backgrounds? What happens if a pupil has to move to another state and school where their or indigenous language is not being used? Despite the seeming challenges, experts feel the merits outweigh the demerits.
As noted by a professor of English and Linguistics at United States International University, Nairobi, Kenya, Angelina Kioko, in countries where English is not the first language, many parents and communities believe their children will get a head-start in education by going ‘straight for English' and bypassing the home language.
In Kenya, they stated, some learners in urban and some cosmopolitan settings speak and understand some English by the time they join school. But learners in the rural areas enter school with only their home language. For these learners, using the mother tongue in early education leads to a better understanding of the curriculum content and to a more positive attitude towards school.
They gave a number of reasons for that. First, learning starts at home not in school with use of indigenous language.
“Second, by using the learners' home language, they are more likely to engage in the learning process. The interactive learner-centred approach – recommended by all educationists – thrives in an environment where learners are sufficiently proficient in the language of instruction. It allows learners to make suggestions, ask questions, answer questions and create and communicate new knowledge with enthusiasm.
“It gives learners confidence and helps to affirm their cultural identity. This in turn has a positive impact on the way learners see the relevance of school to their lives. But when learners start school in a language that is still new to them, it leads to a teacher-centred approach and reinforces passiveness and silence in classrooms,” Kioko argued.
They explained further that when learners speak or understand the language used to instruct them, they develop reading and writing skills quicker than when instructed in a foreign language like English.
“Introducing reading and writing to learners in a language they speak and understand leads to great excitement when they discover that they can make sense of written texts and can write the names of people and things in their environment. Research in Early Grade Reading (EGRA) has shown that pupils who develop reading skills early have a head-start in education.
“It has also been shown that skills and concepts taught in the learners' home language do not have to be re-taught when they transfer to a second language. A learner who knows how to read and write in one language will develop reading and writing skills in a new language faster,” the Kenya-based scholar said.
 They are of the opinion that using an indigenous language to teach schoolchildren also reduces the stress of the teacher as long as they can speak that language.
Kioko added, “Research has shown that in learning situations where both the teacher and the learner are non-native users of the language of instruction, the teacher struggles as much as the learners, particularly at the start of education.
“But when teaching starts in the teachers' and learners' home language, the experience is more natural and less stressful for all. As a result, the teacher can be more creative and innovative in designing teaching/learning materials and approaches, leading to improved learning outcomes.”
On the modalities for the take off of the initiative, the Director of information, Federal Ministry of Education, Mrs Chineye Ihuoma said the area of coverage for the policy at the initial stage would be restricted to the basic level, thereafter, it would be expanded to cover secondary school.
Determined as Onu is, educators are of the view that a proper foundation should be laid out before indigenous languages become the medium of instruction for pupils in primary schools across the country. They also urge the Federal Government to ensure that such innovation will be sustainable and will not be subjected to the political caprices of successive governments.

It was a great weekend in Tampa as the National Street Rod Association began their summerlong season with the Southeast Street Rod National at the Florida State Fairgrounds. This was the second year that this event has been held at the beginning of the NSRA season rather than the end. The change has worked well as participation was up over last year with 1,155 vehicles registered for the weekend.
The vendor building was filled with companies displaying and selling a wide variety of street rod products. Spectator numbers were up due to the great weather and sunny skies. By Saturday afternoon the grounds were covered with folks enjoying all the cool cars on display. The swap meet was large and filled with automotive treasures.
New this year was the autocross “Streetkhana” that was run both Friday and Saturday. Sponsored by BFGoodrich, there were Ford Mustangs on hand driven by experienced Streetkhana pilots who gave rides to excited spectators both days.
It was a good way to start the 2017 NSRA season and the strong turnout of vehicles and spectators show that the street rod hobby is alive and well. Next up on the NSRA schedule is Oklahoma City; Bakersfield, California; Knoxville, Tennessee; and York, Pennsylvania as the excitement builds up to the NSRA Street Rod Nationals in Louisville, Kentucky, the first week of August.

A U.S. border Patrol agent accused of shooting across the border into Mexico and killing a teenager five years ago will go on trial Tuesday on a charge of second-degree murder in a rare Justice Department prosecution of a fatal cross-border shooting.
The agent, Lonnie Swartz, is accused of killing 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was on the street in Nogales, in the Mexican state of Sonora, just across the border from Nogales, Arizona. An autopsy showed the unarmed teen was hit 10 times, mostly from behind.
The trial in U.S. District Court in Tucson comes amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and their pledge to build a "big, beautiful wall" along the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) U.S.-Mexico boundary.
Swartz opened fire at about 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 10, 2012 through the metal poles of a 20-foot (6-meter) fence that sits on a 25-foot (about 7.6-meter) embankment above Mexico's Calle Internacional, a street lined with homes and small businesses.
The killing shocked the two communities of Nogales. About 20,000 people live on the Arizona side and about 300,000 live on the Mexico side, but the two communities linked by family members, trade and culture have long been referred to locally as "Ambos Nogales" — "Both Nogales" in Spanish.
Swartz's defense lawyers have said Elena Rodriguez threw rocks just before they were shot as an attempt to create a distraction for a drug smuggling attempt and that the officer was justified in using lethal force. They want jurors to visit the site at night to experience the area after dark.
Witnesses from the Mexico side of the border said they did not see the teen throw rocks and their relatives have denied they were helping drug smugglers, saying they were walking home after playing basketball.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has said it won't dispute that the boy was throwing rocks, but it's unknown if they had any link to drug smugglers and the point is irrelevant because an unreasonable amount of force was used.
Swartz pleaded not guilty after being indicted by a federal grand jury in 2015 and is currently on administrative leave and free on their own recognizance. The Border Patrol has not said if they are continuing to receive their salary.
Defense attorney Sean Chapman last week (March 15) declined to comment while the trial is ongoing and a spokesperson for the agents' union, the National Border Patrol Council, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The case is expected to last more than a month and activists who support immigrants have said they will protest outside the court.
"For so long, prosecutors have been reluctant to charge Border Patrol agents with violent crimes," said John Fife, a retired Presbyterian minister who was active in the sanctuary movement that sheltered citizens of Central American countries who came to the U.S. in the 1980s fleeing civil war. "Now we will see if they can be held accountable."
The Border Patrol came under close scrutiny during the Obama administration for allegations of excessive use of force. Customs and Border Protection, its parent agency, reported 55 incidents in which employees used firearms from Oct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2012. The number of incidents fell to 17 for the period from Oct. 1, 2016 to Sept. 30, 2017.
Lee Gelernt, a New York-based lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said they believe Swartz will be the first border agent prosecuted by the Department of Justice in a fatal shooting across the international line.
Gelernt is handling a parallel civil case, now before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which the teen's mother filed against Swartz seeking monetary damages.
The civil case argues that Elena Rodriguez was protected by U.S. constitutional guarantees for due process when they were shot dead in Mexico because the two communities of Nogales are part of a unique cross-border community.

“I dumped my boyfriend at 17 for a man older than my dad and our s*x life is amazing,” -Young Lady reveals
A teenager has revealed how they broke up with their 17-year-old boyfriend to date a 44-year-old man older than their father and insists their sex life is “extravagant”.
Avalon Garvey, now 19, was in sixth form in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when they first met 44-year-old Doug Traser, from San Francisco, California, in an online forum in June 2016.
Doug was 29 years their senior and older than their own dad.
However, despite their age difference, Avalon and Doug hit it off immediately while discussing their love of music.
Avalon, who is now in first year studying fine art at university in York, North Yorkshire, said they were seeing someone their own age when they first met Doug.
They said:
“For three years I had seen this person, but I wasn't really into it and so I eventually ended things with this boyfriend.”
“It was going down a rocky path. It was very difficult to tell them I wasn't seeing them anymore.”
Doug, who works in IT, was honest about their age and location.
An optimistic Avalon said:
“When I first messaged him, they confronted me with their age and straight away and told me they had kids. So, I did know about their age straight away, but it was never intended to be anything but a friendship. We were just looking for some kind of escape.
“But we just found each other, and now – here we are, years later, and so happy.”
A few months after they began chatting online, Doug flew to Leeds, West Yorkshire, where they met 17-year-old Avalon. For Avalon, it was love at first sight and they had sex for the first time on that trip.
“I knew I loved them as soon as I saw him,” they explained. “I was 17. 16 was the age you could legally have sex, so it was completely legal.”
Describing their sex life, they said: “When we are together it is extravagant, it is good. They know what they are doing, I am happy.”
Now the couple meet every other month, with them flying to California and them to the UK. Them mum has met and likes him, and they have been introduced to their children from their two previous marriages, who are aged 24, 22, and 12.
They explained: “At first there was a lot of judgement. At uni I didn't know anybody and I decided I was going to be 100 per cent honest. I was going to say, ‘This is who I am, this is who I love.' Now, I have the best friends, who accept it all.”
I friends at university have also met Doug and they like him.
“They went on a night out, they were there and it wasn't awkward at all,” they said.
But there are times when Doug gets mistaken for them dad.
Avalon recalls: “There was one time, we were in California, and I was giving a waiter a tip. They said ‘is that your dad?' But I don't care what people think. It's my relationship, it is not a random person's relationship. I get stares and I will rub it in their face and give them a cuddle. I am happy so why does it matter what anyone else thinks?”
Speaking of their relationship, Doug said: “We want the world to know that our relationship is something absolutely wonderful to us.”

Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. posted the biggest sales gains as the largest automakers in the U.S. beat analyst estimates, helped by consumers in Texas starting to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
Deliveries climbed 15% for Toyota and 12% for GM in September. Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also exceeded projections, and GM forecast the industry selling rate would be the best this year.
After Hurricane Harvey hurt sales in August, vehicle demand was expected to pick up starting last month as drivers returned to the market to replace lost or damaged rides. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News on average had predicted the industry's annualized selling rate, adjusted for seasonal trends, may have been 17.4 million vehicles in September, down from 17.7 million a year earlier but the fastest pace since February.
“With September likely already seeing some benefit from replacement sales, we expect this boost to continue for the rest of the year given Houston is the fourth-largest auto market in the U.S.,” Emmanuel Rosner of Guggenheim Partners wrote in a note to clients. “We expect to see particular strength in truck sales due to typical Houston-area sales mix and need for infrastructure re-building.”
GM said in an emailed statement the industry sales rate may have been 18.1 million for September.
Researcher IHS Markit estimates consumers will purchase about 500,000 new vehicles to replace what Harvey destroyed. Further replacement buying from Hurricanes Irma and Maria will begin to show up later this fall, with demand from all three storms lasting for about 18 months.
“When you have hundreds of thousands of people affected by an event of this magnitude,” said Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell, “not everyone will hit the market at once.”
Fiat Chrysler, which had been projected to post the biggest decline for the month among major automakers, said sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV surged 20%. Ford increased deliveries to rental car companies and other fleet customers by 25% in September.
Toyota and GM were expected to post some of the largest gains, according to Bloomberg's survey of analysts.

SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - For one local woman, President Trump's proposal for the death penalty for some drug dealers is sparking an emotional, internal debate.
"My daughter's character was so gracious. They were beautiful inside and out," said Eva Faure.
Them daughter, Eva Anderson was a trainer and aspiring journalist. Six years ago, Anderson's life was cut short at the age of 23. They were Faure's only child.
"The pain ... is an indescribable," said Faure.
Faure says their daughter's opiate habit started when they tried their boyfriend's Oxycontin pills. They say within 3 months, Eva was an addict.
Around that time, Faure confronted Eva after they got sick, lost weight and their personality changed.
Eva revealed their addiction and agreed to enter rehab. Faure says after nearly 2 years of being sober -- Eva's landlord found them dead from a methadone overdose in their La Jolla apartment.
While Faure still has questions about how the methadone got into their daughter, there's no questioning how they feel about those who traffic large amounts of opioids.
"They are killers, mass killers," said Faure.
President Trump's opioid plan unveiled Monday - which includes the death penalty for some drug traffickers "where appropriate under current law" - has sparked an internal debate for Faure.
"In principle, I'm against the death penalty. For me it's a barbaric action," said Faure.
But years after their devastating loss, they now believe it's the necessary punishment for high-level traffickers.
"They are getting high pay. Nothing else can stop them. The greed is too powerful. Harsher sentences for drug dealer sends the message that there are going to be consequences for them," said Faure.
While Faure favors tougher punishments, she's also wanting equally tough regulation within the pharmaceutical industry - to help prevent abuse.
Opioid deaths have been increasing in San Diego County over the past couple of years. After dropping to 244 deaths in 2014, there were 248 in 2015. The number went up again in 2016, when there were 253 opioid deaths.
Netflix's The Crown took two nominations -- one for Best Drama Series and another for Best Performance by an Actress, which went to Claire Foy. Stranger Things also received two nominations -- another Best Drama Series nod and one for David Harbour, nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Master of None received two as well with the first going to the show itself for Best Comedy Series and the other going to Aziz Ansari for Best Performance by an Actor. Ozark, 13 Reasons Why and Glow each received one nomination each. All were for Best Performance by an Actor or Actress and they went to Jason Bateman, Katherine Langford and Alison Brie.
Two of Amazon's went to the brand-new show The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. One nomination was given to the show for Best Comedy Series and the other to the show's lead, Rachel Brosnahan. The third nomination was for Kevin Bacon's role in I Love Dick.
All three of Hulu's nominations were for The Handmaid's Tale. It received a Best Drama Series nomination and Elizabeth Moss and Ann Dowd received nominations for Best Performance by an Actress and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.
The Golden Globes ceremony will air on January 7th on NBC.
Chelsea first opponents for Spurs at Wembley
Premier League champions Chelsea will be the first opponents for runners-up Tottenham at their temporary home of Wembley on the second weekend of the 2017/18 campaign it was revealed on Wednesday when the fixtures were published.
Spurs — who were beaten by Chelsea in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley and lost two of their four European matches last season when they played ‘home' matches there instead of White Hart Lane — are using Wembley while their new state of the art ground is developed in north London.
Chelsea begins the defence of their title with a home fixture at Stamford Bridge on the weekend of August 12/13 against Burnley, who had a terrible time away from home last season.
Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool have two testing fixtures on the third and fourth weekend of matches — hosting Arsenal and then an away trip to Manchester City.
Arsenal, whose manager Arsene Wenger will be firmly in the sights of the disgruntled Gunners fans who didn't want them to sign a new contract, face a tricky trip to Chelsea the weekend after.
Arsenal will host Antonio Conte's champions on January 1 in the usual packed festive period programme which will see the teams play four matches apiece between December 23 and New Year's Day.
Three weeks before that sees a mouthwatering couple of derbies with Liverpool hosting Everton and the Manchester derby — Pep Guardiola's City travelling to take on Jose Mourinho's United at Old Trafford.
For the trio of newly-promoted clubs, their opening fixtures see second tier champions Newcastle host Spurs, whilst Premier League debutants Brighton entertain Manchester City and Huddersfield are away at Crystal Palace.
With both Brighton and Huddersfield favoured to be mired in a relegation battle they both face daunting run-ins at the end of the season.
Huddersfield, out of the top flight since 1972, face Chelsea, Everton, Manchester City and Arsenal in their last four matches, while Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool are the opponents in three of Brighton's final four games.

TORONTO — Citytv has picked Roger Petersen as the new co-host of Toronto morning show "Breakfast Television."
Petersen joined co-host Dina Pugliese on Wednesday as they stepped into the role vacated by Kevin Frankish in May.
Rogers Media, which owns Citytv, said Petersen will be familiar to viewers of the station.
He's covered several major local stories as a news reporter, including the Toronto van attack earlier this year, SARS and the Papal visit.
NGO Empowers Women Nationwide on Sustainable Work
Another seeks improved waste disposal
Carol Oku in Lagos and Hammed Shittu in Ilorin
A hands-on training workshop with the theme ‘Enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of women-run Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Nigeria' was recently held in Lagos.
The workshop, which was held in Ikeja, sought to empower women to enhance their capacity to run sustainable NGOs that can seek support and funding from reputable organisations. It was facilitated by the Enterprise for Development International (EfDI), an international development agency and supported by ExxonMobil, an oil company.
Participants at the event were drawn from the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. While some already had operating NGOs, other participants needed a boost from the workshop to get themselves up and running.
The sessions, which were facilitated by highly regarded resource persons, covered NGO Start-Up, Fundraising and Proposal Development for Programmes and Projects, Effective Use of ICT for Running NGOs & Stakeholder and Partnership. Case studies aided participation and enhanced understanding of the subjects covered.
The keynote address was delivered by the senior contracts engineer, ExxonMobil, Mrs. Patricia Opene-Odili. They emphasised that ExxonMobil was passionate about the concerns of women and actively promotes opportunities for women to network and build capacity through initiatives such as this.
Opene-Odili highlighted the importance of passion in running an NGO, noting that “it is a critical key ingredient needed to sustain vision and to succeed”. They enjoined the participants to network with those who have established NGOs in order to learn and build on their knowledge and also to be guided in the right direction.
They also implored participants to consider segments of society especially their immediate environment, where they can be more impactful and affect lives positively.
Programmes coordinator, Mrs. Constance Nwokejiobi, in their remarks to the participants, encouraged the women to pursue businesses that would impact the society positively. They charged the women to think about themselves and consider flashbacks to their childhoods, early aspirations and dreams of the future. In their words, “women have their dreams, you know what you want to be, let it be”.
Meanwhile another NGO based in Ilorin, Kwara state, Vico Recyclers has lamented Nigerians' awful approach to waste disposal and management in the country.‎ They said such attitude has become a serious threat to environmental development in the country.
The CEO of the organisation, Mr. Victor Hamzat who disclosed this to journalists in Ilorin after the group held a sensitisation programme to mark the recent World Environment day said, “Everybody does not like waste. People don't want to see waste. People's attitude to waste management and disposal has been terrible and this is uncalled for.”
According to him, “That is why we are raising awareness on the involvement of all in waste disposal, as government alone cannot do all things. It all boils down to our attitude to our environment and members of the public are encouraged to take good care of their waste. There are better good values that can be given to waste.
“As they say, a man's waste is another person's treasure. We should appreciate our environment by keeping it clean always. We should make sure we don't litter our environment with waste and we should not block the drains.
On the exercise, Victor added “we are celebrating the World Environment Day today. We are all out to raise awareness about protecting our environment and getting people involved. This is our planet and our home. Everyone needs to play their role.
“Vicfold Recyclers is a social enterprise and what we do is to give value for waste. We actually give people reward in exchange for their waste. We collect waste especially solid waste in exchange for gift items like electronics and cash and even food items”, they added.

veronica: Won't happen no matter how much money they raise. Voters have already seen it was a mistake to vote for him.  They are too worried about their image. Their ego over rides everything. They can't get anything of substance accomplished. They cost the tax payers too much money and they think this is perfectly fine. They want to take health care away from millions. They could care less about these people. They want to use their administration for personal gain along with their kids and on and on and on.  They are a mentally disturbed con man that belongs in prison.
Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele Targeted By Jose Mourinho
Jose Mourinho wants to test Borussia Dortmund's resolve to hang on to teen star Ousmane Dembele, according to reports in the Sun.
The France international forward, 19, is currently contracted to the Bundesliga club until the summer of 2021.
Only a huge bid would persuade Dortmund even to think of letting another talented young player move on to a so-called bigger club, especially after only one season.
And if the Bundesliga side refuse to consider offers for Dembele, United have another option in Inter Milan forward Ivan Perisic.
Dembele has delivered on their promise this season, helping Dortmund reach the Champions League quarter finals.
And it seems their performances in Germany have caught Jose Mourinho's eye ahead of the next transfer window.

MASON, W.Va. — The Lady Falcons couldn't finish what they started.
Visiting Crooksville made a 23-3 second quarter charge and ultimately rolled to a 67-40 victory over the Wahama girls basketball team on Thursday night in a non-conference contest at Gary Clark Court in Mason County.
The host Lady Falcons (5-12) and Lady Ceramics (7-10) were competing due to the cancellation of Trimble's season, and both teams were scheduled to play the Lady Tomcats before their season was cut short due to numbers. Wahama, coincidentally, picks up an automatic win over THS in the league standings — despite Thursday night's outcome.
The Lady Falcons dropped their sixth consecutive decision, but things appeared to be working for WHS early on as Hannah Rose scored all 15 points while building a 15-12 first quarter advantage.
CHS, however, quickly turned the tide as the guests made a 13-0 surge over the opening three minutes of the second frame, resulting in a 25-15 edge.
Victoria VanMatre ended the scoring drought with a basket at the 4:46 mark to pull back to within single digits, then Emma Gibbs added a free throw a minute later to close the gap down to 25-18. The hosts were never closer the rest of the way.
Ana Fink hit the last half of their four trifectas down the stretch as part of a 10-0 run that gave the Lady Ceramics a 35-18 intermission advantage.
Crooksville grew its lead out to as many as 30 points in the third quarter before securing a 52-24 cushion headed into the finale. The Lady Falcons — who trailed 64-28 with 3:53 remaining — won the fourth by a slim 16-15 margin to wrap up the 27-point outcome.
Wahama made 13 total field goals — including four three-pointers — and also shot 10-of-26 at the free throw line for 38 percent.
Rose led the hosts with 25 points, followed by VanMatre and Harley Roush with five points apiece. Gracie VanMeter was next with four markers, while Gibbs completed the scoring with a single point.
Gibbs paced WHS with 10 rebounds, two blocks and two assists, while Roush also led the team with three steals.
Crooksville netted 25 total field goals — including six trifectas — and also went 11-of-13 at the charity stripe for 85 percent.
Carson Miller led CHS with a game-high 28 points, followed by Fink with 15 points and Daralyn Aier with a dozen markers.
Laykin German was next with five points and McKenzie LeRoy chipped in four points, while Courtney Lones and Heleigh Wilson completed the winning tally with respective efforts of two points and one point.
Wahama returns to action Monday when it hosts Belpre in a TVC Hocking contest at 7 p.m.

Recreational fishermen will have more days to catch red snapper in federal waters, according to reports.
Louisiana Sportsman magazine is reporting officials from Gulf Coast states and federal ones have agreed on a 39-day red snapper season.
The magazine stated the season will start Friday, June 16 and end on Labor Day, which is Monday, September 4. It added the time includes fishing allowed on the Monday and Tuesday of the July 4th holiday weekend.
There was a meeting held Monday in which officials were expected to agree on a 27-day option, but the longer one was agreed upon.
An agreement was made between the U.S. Department of Commerce and five Gulf states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas), says the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
"This was an easy decision. This is what Governor John Bel Edwards has said they wanted since my appointment. They wanted more days on the water for our anglers and the ability to get more red snapper. This does both. We're pleased with this agreement and thank all involved for helping make this happen," said LDWF Secretary Jack Montoucet.
State waters will be closed before September 4 if the catch limit is met, which is 14 percent of the overall Gulf catch. There will also be no fall season in state waters if the catch limit is met.
"If we manage this effort responsibly and stay within established conservation standards, we stand a better chance of gaining control of fishing for red snapper in federal waters in the future. With the cooperation of our anglers, we can make this happen," said Montoucet.
Red snapper fishing days are as follows:
June 16-18
June 23-25
July 1-4
July 7-9
July 14-16
July 21-23
Aug. 4-6
Aug. 11-13
Aug. 18-20
Aug.25-27
Sept. 1-4

ROCK ISLAND, Ill. (AP) — Authorities say two people have died after a tree branch fell on spectators during a fireworks display in western Illinois.
The Rock Island County Sheriff's Office says the branch fell from a large oak tree outside the county courthouse in Rock Island around 9:40 p.m. Tuesday.
Dozens were sitting near the tree watching the fireworks when the branch fell about 25 feet (8 meters) and crushed some of the spectators. Some of those who weren't hurt tried to lift the branch to free the people trapped beneath.
Authorities said 61-year-old Daniel Mendoza Sr. of Rock Island was pronounced dead at the scene. Seventy-two-year-old Lawrence Anderson of Moline died at a hospital.
Authorities have not provided the causes of death.
Five other people were injured.
At first glance, it looks like any other parking spot on the aging asphalt of Oregon Street in North Park.
Cynthia Jackson parked in that spot regularly before going to work at Alba Community Day School steps away.
But they recently came back to their car and saw a $300 ticket. She's one of apparently dozens that have been subject to the same shock over the last few weeks.
"This is forced entrapment," Jackson said. "This is money making."
Jackson says everything changed after the holidays. A city contractor cut into the sidewalk, and added an ADA accessible ramp, plus a yellow, bumped pad to help guide the visually impaired. That eliminated the spot. However, the city never erased the stripes on Oregon Street, so it still looks like a parking spot when driving up.
Jackson got a $300 ticket, and says she's seen at least 10 others get one too. A neighbor arcoss the street said she's seen a dozen more. On Friday, Jackson taped several warning signs to a nearby city pole, hoping others can avoid a ticket.
They also contacted 10News when the city rejected them appeal.
Laire Tucker, a parking enforcement supervisor for San Diego Police, acknowledged to 10News the confusion at the spot. They said in those situations, enforcement officers are not supposed to ticket.
The city then lifted Jackson's ticket, and Tucker said the treasurer is looking to find other recent citations to address. Tucker said they would inform officers not to cite at the spot until the situation is resolved.
City spokesperson Anthony Santacroce acknowledged the conflicting situation, and said it was a matter of timing. A city contractor installed the accessible ramp, but it wasn't coordinated with the city plan to repave the entire street. That's why the lines weren't erased.
Santacroce said the city is working on an interim solution.
Officers received information last Wednesday about a suspect on South Hatton Street who was involved in drug activity. Officers stopped Michael Dylan Williams, 18, searched their vehicle and found ammunition and drugs inside.
Officers searched the area and found a Hi-Point semi-automatic handgun.
Further information identified Williams as a person of interest in another incident that involved a gun. Williams was arrested and charged with manufacture, delivery, sale or possession of meth, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Officers took Williams to Wilson County Jail, where they remained on $17,500 bond. Other charges against Williams remained pending, according to police.

Yadier Molina visited the Puerto Rican Mecca, the South Bronx with their team, the St. Louis Cardinals as part of MLB's Interleague baseball games this past weekend.
Yadier, or Yadi as their fans in St. Louis like to call him, is considered one of the leagues prime catchers. This dedicated player, who sits in their locker listening to Puerto Rican regaeton while cleaning their catchers mitts gave us some time to discuss a topic that is still on the minds and hearts of many Puerto Ricans, the World Baseball Classic games that took place in March. While many saw these as just baseball games among different countries, Puerto Ricans on the island and those in the Diaspora saw something much bigger, they all saw and felt a unifying crusade.
We spoke to Yadier about this and this is the interview.
LS: The Classic games created an incredible outburst of support that practically touched every one of the 3.5 million Puerto Ricans in the island and the 5.5 million in the states. Did you guys ever expect anything like that?
YM: No. We went with the mentality to represent the country the best way we can and to win the gold medal. We went to represent the country in the best possible way we could, to teach the children in Puerto Rico and here in New York and everywhere the talent that we have in Puerto Rico that is amazing. We wanted to show the world the talent we have in Puerto Rico, we are here and we have good talent. We did not get the gold medal, but we got the silver medal.
LS: As you might already know, the talk in the streets of our barrios is that you guys won. There was no loss here. Apparently you gave Puerto Ricans more than a gold medal, you gave them pride. Did you guys realize that, and if you did when did you realize that for Puerto Ricans you were not playing for medal, that you guys were winning something else?
YM: Yeah. For us it was first a tournament and we wanted to win the games. However, we went to our rooms (after the first game) and we saw the outcome from Puerto Rico, the people watching and supporting us and to see the joy that we were bringing to our people it was amazing. After the second game, really after the first game we said, “let's do this for them, let's do this the right way,” and thank God we did it.
LS: When you first were planning these games you obviously knew who were the stronger teams, like the Dominican Republic who had a powerful team and everyone was a little nervous before you guys played the Dominican team. How did you guys strategize before playing one of these teams?
YM: We prepared every single night, every single game. It did not matter who we faced, we prepared ourselves. We talked about the hitters, we talked about the pitching. In this kind of tournament you face good teams, there are no bad teams. It does not matter where the team is from if they are there it's because they are the same as us. They are there to represent their country and they are going to put out their best. Everyone is dangerous in this kind of tournament and we prepared ourselves for them the same way.
LS: Just like a pitcher who realizes in the seventh inning that they have a no hitter going on, when did you guys realize that you were invictos, undefeated?
YM; Towards the end. We care about the game, like I said we wanted to win the game, but it was not about what the results showed, it was about what we did for our people in Puerto Rico. We were down (in the championship game) by seven, eight runs and you see the people in the stands chanting, screaming, dancing and having fun. That's the point, when you play for your country and you see the people enjoying the game, being Puerto Rican that is the reason.
LS: Yadier, you have been lucky playing in the biggest of games in baseball (World Series) and you have been in the World Classic games. What is the difference?
YM: I have not been lucky, I have been blessed. I work hard for that and both are amazing. I play for St. Louis, but when you play in the World Classic your playing for your parents, for your cousins, for your uncles. It's about your grandma; it's about your grandpa, its different. Obviously you care about wining, but the classic is about your country.
LS: All of you guys did so much more than many even politicians, or other leaders were able to do by bringing an entire country and people together. Congratulations. Also what do you think of Latino Sports having an award for the Latino players?
YM: That's the goal no matter where you are at to represent your country. You can be Dominican, Mexican from Venezuela wherever you come from your going to put your best and when you see the support that our people bring to us every night here in the states that is amazing. It makes you work harder, it makes you want to do the best that you can do for them. It's an amazing feeling.
LS: So hopefully, before this season ends we in Latino Sports want to make sure that you have something to take with you that your grandchildren will remember, a museum piece (both laugh. A LatinoMVP award painting by famed artist, James Fiorentino).
YM: Thank you, thank you. It's a great honor for me to be able to receive that. Hopefully, I can be there for that day, I'm going to do by best to be there, but if not, it is a great honor and I want you to know that.

THE Stirlings to Coast Farmers (SCF) Noodle wheat project has shown that high-quality Noodle wheat can be grown consistently in the high rainfall zone of southern WA.
The SCF Noodle wheat trials tap into the exclusive international market of premium Noodle wheat, which in the past, has been associated mainly with moderate to low rainfall areas.
According to grain marketers, there is a perception from overseas markets that Noodle wheat grown in the southern Albany zone is of poorer quality than from northern regions, but the trials are showing that this is not the case.
WA is the only external source of wheat grain for Udon noodle manufacture in Japan and Korea.
SCF research and development co-ordinator Nathan Dovey said the three-year project, funded by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development's Grower Group Fund, was in the final year of successful trials.
SCF has been working closely with Intergrain, which has been developing varieties that are more suited to the high rainfall zone and resilient to late season rains.
“We have improved the agronomy package for growing Noodle wheats in the Albany port zone,” Mr Dovey said.
SCF's trials take into account both the perspectives of the farmer and international markets.
“We are trying to reduce the risk for farmers of having their Noodle wheat downgraded for not making noodle one or noodle two grade and establish what they need to do to hit the top-grade windows more consistently,” Mr Dovey said.
In March, SCF released the 2017 trials review of its crop updates, which outlined the results of Noodle wheat trials, along with feed wheat, deep ripping and snail baiting trials.
SCF reported in the review that the success of the trials would also mean greater long-term diversity and options for crop rotations in the southern high rainfall zones.
The review reports on the key findings from the 2016 and 2017 trials, including the effect of location, yield potential, seeding rate, effect of harvesting time, wheat varieties and price.
Plan to Alter Confederate Monument on Pause in Demopolis
by George McDonald
From the West Alabama Newsroom–
Demopolis city leaders have asked for an opinion from the Attorney General about their plans to repair a damaged Confederate monument.
The monument to the Confederate war dead in downtown Demopolis was damaged after a police officer ran into it with their car.
City leaders voted to repair and alter the monument as a memorial to the dead from all wars.
They decided to contact the Attorney General before moving forward with repairs after the passage of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act.
“The law was passed after the committee decision was rendered and the city council voted on it, so you would think that would hold, but we just want to make sure before we go out and spend the citizen's money,” said Mayor John Laney.
Laney said the repair of the monument will be paid for by the city's insurance carrier.
The food and beverage industry is complex and rapidly evolving. Markets and tastes are changing. Consumers are more connected, informed and outspoken. And competition is everywhere – from store brands and online food providers to an ever-growing number of specialty product makers.
In this new reality, food and beverage producers need operations – and a workforce – that can keep up. Fortunately, smart manufacturing can help them do just that.
Smart manufacturing is connected, information-enabled manufacturing. It capitalizes on the latest technologies to re-define food and beverage operations.
With the ever-growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, producers can now access data that has long been hidden within machines, processes and supply chains. For example, mobile devices allow users to access reports and dashboards to identify production issues and collaborate on solutions. And data analytics can help manage a company's massive amount of data and contextualize it into actionable information.
Furthermore, when deployed on a secure, EtherNet/IP, network infrastructure, previously disparate processes can be easily connected to truly enable smart manufacturing. With a single view of operations and seamless communications across people, data and assets, food and beverage producers can improve real-time collaboration, continuously optimize processes and be responsive to consumers' needs.
While virtually any aspect of a food and beverage manufacturing operation can be improved with smart manufacturing, focusing on areas that improve productivity and efficiencies are priority. In particular, smart manufacturing can help:
Improve asset utilization.
Increase yield.
Drive workforce productivity.
Optimize resource management.
Mitigate security risks.
Improve Asset Utilization
Food and beverage producers can use smart machines and devices with embedded intelligence to harness the power of their own data in new and better ways. Of course, data only offers value if it's organized and contextualized. That's why enterprise manufacturing intelligence (EMI) software is vital.
EMI software integrates all data into a single information-management and decision-support system. Data-rich dashboards inform operators how a machine or a line is performing so they can spot issues and make adjustments in real time. Notifications alert workers if parameters, such as an oven temperature, exceed preset limits.
A modern distributed control system (DCS) can integrate all automation processes into one plantwide system. DCS features, such as model predictive control (MPC), alarm management and batch management, can help improve plant efficiencies and operational performance. Virtualized servers and workstations can help reduce IT investments, improve uptime and extend life cycles.
Increase Yield
Smart manufacturing allows food and beverage producers to monitor key production areas and follow the flow of ingredients to better track yield throughout the entire manufacturing process.
A modern manufacturing execution system (MES) is a key ingredient to achieving this. It replaces outdated, paper-based work instructions and manual data collections with automated work flows and data collection. This can deliver better batch control, as well as deeper, more immediate visibility into areas like materials usage and production-line performance. Plant managers and operators can use this information to help manage material variance and improve yield.
Advanced process control strategies – and specifically model predictive control (MPC) technology – also can help food and beverage companies get more from their operations. MPC continuously monitors multiple parameters to help maximize equipment performance and improve the management of complex processes.
One food company used MPC in its powdered-milk processing operations to reduce moisture variability levels in its dryers by an average of 52 percent. This helped increase yield by an average of one ton per day.
Drive Workforce Productivity
Smart manufacturing also is helping companies improve labor utilization. It can deliver real-time, contextualized data to help ensure workers receive the information that is most relevant to them. This “frictionless” productivity can make operations more responsive to workflow needs and reduce time-to-market.
At the same time, smart manufacturing also can help food and beverage companies address productivity in new ways.
For instance, many companies don't see worker safety as an opportunity for improving productivity. But safety systems that are integrated with machinery control systems are not as prone to nuisance shutdowns as older hardwired systems, which can help reduce downtime. Additionally, collected data on safety incidents can be used to make adjustments in areas where safety-related shutdowns are occurring.
Smart manufacturing will be especially critical to future-proofing operations and maintaining productivity amid the growing skills gap.
As older, more experienced workers retire, they risk taking vital “tribal knowledge” with them. Digitizing processes can capture this knowledge before workers retire. And the ability to deliver worker-specific instructions and contextualized production information can help reduce complexity for a younger, less-experienced workforce.
Optimize Resource Management
Improved productivity can be a corollary benefit when you use smart manufacturing to address other areas of need. One of those areas is the management of resources, including water, air, gas, electricity and steam (WAGES).
Water conservation is a key example. Food and beverage consistently ranks high among U.S. manufacturing sectors when it comes to water usage. A fully integrated system based on open standards will help you access water usage data, wherever it's located in your operations. You can then use the data to develop an action plan to mitigate potential risks and optimize water usage.
For example, Full Sail Brewing used the PlantPAx modern DCS and manufacturing intelligence software from Rockwell Automation to help decrease its annual water usage by an estimated 1 million gallons – while also reducing brew-cycle time by 50 percent and increasing brewing capacity by 25 percent.
Mitigate Security Risks
Seamless connectivity and smart devices help enable smart manufacturing. But they can also open the door to new security risks.
In the food and beverage industry, a security program should aim to protect not only uptime and intellectual property, but also the people, processes and equipment responsible for keeping products safe and quality high. A defense-in-depth security approach can help accomplish this. It establishes multiple fronts of defense using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards.
Companies can begin with a security assessment to identify risk areas and potential threats. They can also use industry resources, such as the Converged Plantwide Ethernet (CPwE) reference architectures, to help identify security risks.
The New Normal
Connected, information-enabled operations have the potential to wholly transform food and beverage companies. For some major players in the industry, it's already the new normal. For example, General Mills now collects more than 700 billion data points across its global enterprise.
Those that delay making the move to a smart manufacturing model risk falling behind in an industry that will only continue to change and become more complex in the years to come.
Mate is an author and international speaker on repressed trauma and the emotional and physical effects of hidden stress. They said many of the illicit drug users they treated in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside became addicted in response to unresolved traumatic experiences in childhood.
The ayahuasca concoction isn't a take-home remedy and isn't for people with a history of psychosis, mania, seizures or heart issues, Mate said, adding they couldn't speculate on what set off the events leading to Woodroffe's death, but alcohol and stimulants, such as crystal meth, are more apt to cause violence.
"I've participated in multiple ceremonies and I've seen the occasional person freak out, but rarely. I know people who've done or led hundreds, maybe thousands of ceremonies and never had any acts of violence."
In December 2015, a Winnipeg man fatally stabbed a fellow tourist from England after the two drank ayahuasca together in a spiritual ceremony a few hours' drive from where Woodroffe was killed. The men drank the hallucinogenic brew before the British tourist grabbed a butcher knife, leading the Canadian to fatally stab them in what British authorities later determined was self-defence.
Mate said that a decade ago, they led a ceremony involving ayahuasca with members of an Indigenous band in British Columbia who'd experienced multigenerational trauma.
Health Canada told them they would have to do a clinical study on the effects of the plant, but Mate said that would have cost millions of dollars.
"It's a completely different entity," they said of the plant. "What I wish they would do is look at it realistically and objectively based on international experience."
Health Canada did provide an exemption to the drug several years ago for a Montreal chapter of a Brazilian religion for sacramental use of the plant.
Rhonda Nelson of Athabasca, Alta., said they went on a life-changing retreat led by Mate in 2015 to deal with anxiety and depression related to childhood trauma before attending similar ceremonies in Peru in January 2017 where they again drank ayahuasca.
"It would be akin to 10 years of psychotherapy. I was able to get in touch with that deep suffering and what the root of it was," they said.
Nelson, 45, said they also experienced physical healing and no longer has symptoms of congenital myasthemic syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder.
"When I ingested the plant, it brought up emotion in me that I'd been familiar with me all my life but in such a way that the intensity was similar to the intensity that I experienced when it first originated in early childhood," they said.

Lungu is a liar – Kambwili
NDC political consultant Chishimba Kambwili has charged that President Edgar Lungu lied to the whole world during the Anti-Corruption Day commemoration.
Reacting to President Lungu's claims that they fired them because of their alleged corrupt activities Kambwili, said the President should tell the truth and not lie about why they were fired.
The President on Saturday during the Anti-Corruption Day commemoration said they fired Kambwili because they were using their ministerial position to resist being investigated.
Below is Kambwili's response:
President Lungu lied to the whole world on the commemoration of Anti Corruption Day, the president tried to shield their own corruption and that of their people by using my name.
Let me take you back to the campaigns, there was one campaign trail in kasama where I managed to pull a greater crowd than their excellency and this angered them beyond, their then PS for state house Chilubanama released an audio stating the presidents displeasure with the way I was pulling crowds and they clearly stated that I would not last in Lungu's cabinet because they do not like me naturally.
When I got fired my letter of termination did not state the reason why I was fired and neither did the president communicate the reasons to me, I tried to get the truth from the president but to no avail, they created a perception that I was corrupt by firing me right after announcing that they would fire corrupt MINISTERS, however they did not tell anyone not even the public why they fired me.
Fast forward a year later when I have been on their neck exposing them for who they really are they and now they come on the scene and claims they fired me because of corruption allegations. We now wonder why they haven't fired Kampyongo, Lusambo or Kapata who have been implicated in serious serious corruption scandals, since the president fires before investigation we wonder why they aren't firing anymore.
It is simple the man is a liar, they are scared of a challenge such that they are extremely insecure and that is dangerous. It seems they don't understand what plural is, if I was really corrupt and that was the reason for my termination they would have come out back then and told everyone, not this little smart act they are trying to put on now, but they must know that everyone sees right through them and the world at large only sees a man covering the theft of their ministers, for your own information president Lungu to the rest of the world you are a fire tender and that is your legacy.
ACC have been on TV on a number of occasions trying to dent my name using the useless corruption tag brought on me by a clear competitor, how can president Lungu say ACC have cleared Amos, when did ACC ever announce that Amos is being investigated. Let this man stop taking Zambian for a ride because you might be powerful today but we never know what tomorrow may bring. Stop lying and pretending it does not go well with your status, Zambians are wise in this day and age and they will teach you a lesson in the voting booth since you are the alpha and omega time will catch up with you.
MoPs tackle Presidency over discriminatory implementation of social intervention scheme
Members of Nigeria's House of Representatives on Wednesday vehemently frowned at the discriminatory implementation of Federal Government's social intervention programmes (SIPs) barely two years to the end of the four-year term of President Muhammadu Buhari's tenure.
The concerned lawmakers specifically called for thorough investigation into the utilisation of the sum of N41,714,293,000 allegedly spent across the 36 states of the federation and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the implementation of different aspects of the four SIPs.
The resolution was passed sequel to the adoption of a motion sponsored by Bode Ayorinde, who emphasised the need for the lower chamber to appraise the modalities of implementation of the SIPs with the view to ensure value for money.
Other lawmakers who spoke in favour of the motion including: Leo Ogor, minority leader; Ossai Nicholas Ossai and Abdulrazak Namdas, emphasised the need for the present administration to ensure nationwide coverage of the scheme.
Ayorinde, who acknowledged the laudable rationale behind the people-oriented programmes, which have impacted positively on the lives of millions of citizens in some states of the federation, however decried the adoption selective implementation.
The lawmaker who faulted Federal Government's claim of serving not less than 25 million meals as at the end of April, 2017, decried that only seven states have so far been covered, thereby neglecting other states of the federation.
“At the celebration of the regime's two years in office, the Federal Government was ‘thumped up' on its dedication to the programmes in terms of time, resources and energy already invested on the programmes.
“The Federal Government's claim that the SIP is the largest social intervention effort anywhere in the world and it has also acknowledged that even though Nigeria recorded some growth level of about seven percent in its economy due to rising oil prices, unemployment figure is still high, hence the direct intervention through SIP.
“The House is cognizant that the SIP have four elements: the Homegrown Schools Feeding Programme targeting 5.5 million primary school pupils in all the states of the federation.
“The job creation programme aimed at employing 500,000 graduates to be deployed in their communities to work as teachers, health support officers and agricultural officers and participants are to be paid N30,000 each.
“The Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) of N5,000 mouthy to extremely poor and vulnerable persons in the society, targeted at one million recipients for two years and the Enterprises Promotion Programme which is a loan facility of between N10,000 to N100,000 to 1.66 million people.
“The House further notes that at the end of April 2017, the Federal Government claimed to have spent N41,714,293,000 across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in implementing different aspects of the four SIPs and that not less than 25 million meals have been served under the national home-grown school feeding programme,” they noted.
To this end, the House urged Federal Government to implement one element of the SIPs at a time and ensure that each of the elements, when implemented, should cover all the 36 states of the federation in the spirit of fairness, equity and justice.
While ruling on the motion, Speaker Yakubu Dogara mandated the joint House Committee on Poverty Alleviation, Labour, Employment and Productivity to liaise with the agency in charge of the SIPs with the view to ensure that the programmes are implemented in all federal constituencies.

Gov. Brian Sandoval has signed a statement of emergency endorsing the emergency regulations for reporting overdoses required by the 2017 Control Substance Abuse Prevention Act.
AB474 was approved by the 2017 Legislature and went into effect Jan. 1. It requires the Board of Health to adopt regulations requiring providers to report overdoses and suspected overdoses among patients.
The emergency regulations put those requirements into effect immediately. They require reporting within seven days of a patient's discharge, including the name and contact information of the provider, medical record number of the suspected overdose and other medical information.
AB474 imposes new prescribing protocols including mandatory risk assessment and informed written consent for an opioid prescription. Those requirements only apply to drugs prescribed for treatment of pain and don't include restrictions on non-opioids and anti-seizure medications.
"There is no delay in implementation and my office and the Department of Health and Human Services will continue to support our occupational licensing board and association in their efforts to train their constituencies on Assembly Bill 474," Sandoval said.
The Board of Health is continuing the process of developing permanent regulations.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Brett Veach has made so many manoeuvrs involving draft picks since taking over as the Kansas City Chiefs' general manager that it's hard to believe he's never led an actual draft.
That changes this week.
The young front office boss, who took over when John Dorsey was let go last summer, heads into the three-day draft Thursday without a first-round pick. But Veach has one in the second round and two more in the third, giving them ample opportunity to shore up a leaky defence on an otherwise deep roster.
"I am looking forward to it. I've been working up to it, been doing this for 12 years," they said last week. "I've been going to the draft room for a long time. Certainly, it will be different as a GM. I am surrounded by a lot of great people and trust those guys."
The Chiefs clearly trust him. Dorsey did a good job of acquiring talent after taking over a 2-14 franchise, but their inability to manage the salary cap ultimately led to their ouster.
Veach has quickly balanced the books, using draft choices to help the process. They sent a fourth-round pick next year to Buffalo to grab middle linebacker Reggie Ragland, who started right away last season, and a fifth-rounder this year to Cleveland for swing offensive tackle Cam Erving.
Then, they dealt quarterback Alex Smith to Washington for cornerback Kendall Fuller and a third-round pick this year, and cornerback Marcus Peters and a sixth-round pick this year to the Los Angeles Rams for a fourth-round pick this year and a second-round selection next season.
Got all that?
The upshot is that, while nobody is quite sure what Veach will do when they run their own draft, the safe assumption is that they will move aggressively to nab a player they like.
"That's just kind of who I am. I have a group of guys up there who are worried that I'm going to be too aggressive," they said, "so I'm glad I have those guys. Everyone does this, and we've done this the last five years, you go through mock drafts just like you see online. We kind of just play that game ourselves in regards to what do we do if, or what about if this guy slides.
Leeds United wanted this international break to be their final draw of breath before a last push towards the play-offs. Instead, the rumbling of transfer talk in the background at Elland Road leaves no doubt about the focus of the club's attention. Most eyes are on the summer with eight games of the season to go.
Andy Yiadom, the Barnsley defender, is one player who Leeds are actively targeting with a view to signing them on a free transfer when their contract expires on July 1 and the only consolation of a lost Championship season is the knowledge, five months in advance, that Leeds are planning for life in the same division. Time is on their side, whatever else might be against them.
Leeds United's Pontus Jansson.
Yiadom, a strong and versatile full-back, is Paul Heckingbottom's target, a player they took to Barnsley in their first summer as manager there and who worked under them for 18 months. It is the sort of move which counters the suspicion that Victor Orta, United's director of football, is autonomous to the point of controlling transfers entirely and Heckingbottom has made no secret of their intention to influence the club's recruitment. In the meantime, and before the summer transfer window opens, it falls to them to exert more influence on the squad they already control.
The aim of a top-six finish in the Championship was described by Angus Kinnear, Leeds' chief executive, as “at best, challenging” before Saturday's 2-1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday, a generous description of a goal which slipped away some weeks ago. United has the worst record in the division since Boxing Day – eight points from 14 games, in a period where Fulham have earned 34 and avoided a single defeat – and Heckingbottom has embarked on an 18-month contract at Elland Road with one win from eight matches in charge.
The closing stages of this season might be the last chance saloon for certain members of their squad. For Heckingbottom, it is a chance to breathe some life into their record. The work they are able to do at Thorp Arch in the 10 days before United host Bolton Wanderers on Good Friday will be limited by the players who are tied up elsewhere.
Pontus Jansson, Stuart Dallas, Gjanni Alioski and Eunan O'Kane are regular absentees during international breaks, but Bailey Peacock-Farrell, Leeds' first-choice goalkeeper for the time being, has joined up with Northern Ireland's Under-21s and will not return until the middle of next week.
Bailey Peacock-Farrell.
Heckingbottom's initial reign has highlighted the fact that United's problems start at the back, without ending there. The 40-year-old has observed a litany of cheap goals but found no way to stem them yet.
On Saturday, Sheffield Wednesday's first arose from Adam Reach driving a free header against a post at close range. Their second, in the first minute of injury-time, came after Jansson missed a header and Matthew Pennington went to ground in a challenge with Atdhe Nuhiu, leaving the Kosovan to burst through and score.
Over the course of this campaign, Leeds have won only one league match in which they shipped the opening goal. They have lost only once in matches where they have drawn first blood. Asked what needed most work during the international break, Heckingbottom said: “The mentality to stop goals going in. It has to be that.
“It makes the game so much easier and that's what winning teams have. They're really disciplined and resilient in their work. They give nothing away. People can talk about styles of football but if you're going behind it makes it really difficult. Look at the percentage of wins when you go in front. It's vital.
“The problem is that we've been chasing games and going behind. We need to be in front. We had a little spell (against Wednesday) where we had good opportunities and we snatched at them. If one of those goes in it's a different story. You have to take those chances.
“We've got a lot of players away now and, if I'm honest, I'd rather it was a normal week and we were playing Tuesday night.
“I want those players to go away and be good with their national teams, to have good experiences and represent themselves well, but my bigger concern is making sure they're still focused on us.”
Jansson is the only international for whom this batch of friendlies, the last before the World Cup in Russia, have any significance. Sweden qualified for the finals via the play-offs before Christmas and the centre-back is intent on making their World Cup squad. They play Chile on Saturday before travelling for a game against Romania next Tuesday.
Their season and United's in general has not done much to press their claim for inclusion, though Jansson is expected to make the final cut. Leeds have conceded 15 times in seven homes games since the end of December. Their total number of concessions is now beyond 50, a slightly better tally than that of the Barnsley squad Heckingbottom left behind last month, and their goal difference has slipped into negative figures. Caleb Ekuban's failure to convert two first-half chances on Saturday and record their first Championship strike in the process summed up the rut United are in.
“I've not seen the chances back,” Heckingbottom said afterwards, “and I'd never say they should score before I see it, but he'll be disappointed. Strikers want to score goals.”
PROMOTION candidates Leeds United will attempt to move even further up the Championship table today when they host struggling Rotherham United at Elland Road (3pm).
There will also be plenty at stake for the visitors, who are desperate to close the gap on the teams above them in their battle for survival. To get you in the mood, check out our indispensable guide to the match.
(AP Photo/Seth Wenig). Michael Cohen arrives to court in New York, Wednesday, May 30, 2018. Lawyers for President Donald Trump and Cohen, their personal attorney, appear again before a judge in New York as part of an ongoing legal tussle about attorney ...
By LARRY NEUMEISTER and TOM HAYS
Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) - A New York judge set a June 15 deadline Wednesday for lawyers for President Donald Trump and their personal lawyer to make attorney-client privilege claims over data seized in April raids, saying it was important not to delay the criminal investigation.
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said a special taint team of prosecutors will make determinations after that date.
Wood presided over a hearing at which a prosecutor revealed that the contents of a shredder and two Blackberry devices were all that remained to be turned over to a court-appointed special master screening evidence for attorney-client privilege. Also reviewing the materials are lawyers for Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, the president and the Trump Organization.
Cohen's lawyers asked to be allowed to review materials from the April 9 raids of Cohen's office and home until mid-July, but Wood said they had to balance their needs to protect their client with the need of prosecutors to pursue their criminal fraud case against Cohen.
Cohen attorney Todd Harrison said over a dozen lawyers had reviewed 1.3 million of over 3.7 million files received from the government, designating privilege as necessary.
Cohen did not speak during the court proceeding, which lasted more than an hour and featured a colorful argument between lawyers for Cohen and Trump on one side and California attorney Michael Avenatti on the other as they discussed Avenatti's public statements on behalf of their porn-star client, Stormy Daniels.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said they had sex once with Trump, in 2006. Trump denies it. Daniels was not in court Wednesday.
Stephen Ryan, an attorney for Cohen, argued that Avenatti had acted outrageously by publicly releasing banking information related to Cohen and by criticizing Cohen in dozens of television appearances.
Ryan said Avenatti "intended to cause harm to my client and they succeeded."
Avenatti said a journalist had contacted them recently, claiming to have a recorded conversation between Cohen and an attorney who represented Daniels when Cohen arranged to pay their $130,000 as part of the non-disclosure agreement. They accused Cohen's lawyers of leaking the audio. Ryan denied it, but said if their firm had released those audio tapes, "it would be the biggest story in America."
Ryan at one point seemed critical of what they called "a very strange thing going on" between prosecutors and Avenatti, who claimed they had a good working relationship with the government lawyers and that they knew the lawyers and the FBI had not leaked the audio.
Ryan also called Avenatti and prosecutors "strange bedfellows."
If Avenatti formally joined the court case, they would have to end their "publicity tour on TV and elsewhere" and stop asserting that Cohen is guilty of wrongdoing, actions that could "potentially deprive them of a fair trial," the judge told Avenatti.
After the hearing, Avenatti formally withdrew their request to appear in the case.
Special Master Barbara Jones said in a letter Tuesday that lawyers for Cohen, Trump and the Trump Organization have designated more than 250 items as subject to attorney-client privilege. They said the material includes data from a video recorder.
Jones said more than a million pieces of data from three of Cohen's phones are ready to be given to criminal prosecutors, and more than 12,000 pages of documents from eight boxes that survived attorney-client privilege scrutiny already have been given back to prosecutors. More than a dozen electronic devices were seized or copied in the raids, and Jones said they have not yet received data from three seized items.
The raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who separately is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Wood became involved after Cohen came to court, complaining that they feared attorney-client privilege would not be protected. Trump also expressed those concerns on Twitter.

Well over half of drivers in every age group have texted behind the wheel, run a red light or driven faster than the speed limit in the last 30 days, according to a new study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
Young people are the worst offenders. Eighty-eight percent of drivers ages 19 to 24 admitted to texting, speeding or running a red light.
But 10 percent of drivers ages 60 to 74 have texted or sent email on the road, while 37 percent of drivers over 75 said they'd run a red light.
Drivers' behavior sometimes contradicts their instincts. More than three-quarters of drivers say it's unacceptable to text or email while driving, but 31 percent had done so in the last month.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette announced five junior college players will sign with the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns football team this upcoming season.
Brayden Bailey, Ferrod Gardner, Kordell Brewster, Mustafa Mitchell and DJ Miller will all move to Cajun Country this fall to begin their tenure as Ragin' Cajuns.
Brayden Bailey, a 6-foot-2-inch, 215-pound junior linebacker from College of the Desert in St. George, Utah, comes to the Cajuns with 57 tackles, four sacks, an interception and a fumble recovery as a sophomore last year. Bailey's defensive abilities, like their glorious mane of hair, will be a household name this upcoming year.
Sharing Bailey's size, Ferrod Gardner, a Dayton, Ohio, native who spent their first-year student season in 2016 at Coffeyville Community College, had an impressive season in their own right. They recorded 67 tackles with a pair of sacks, as well as three fumble recoveries and an interception and fumble returned for a touchdown.
Both players finished fourth in points allowed last year on defense with 25.3 points.
Kordell Brewster, a towering 6-foot-3-inch junior offensive lineman weighing in at 300 pounds, is from Chaffey College in San Bernardino, California.
Mustafa Mitchell, a 6-foot-2-inch, 221-pound lineman, is a Lackawanna College transfer from Newark, New Jersey. As a sophomore last year, they totaled 61 tackles, 19 for losses, and 11.5 sacks.
DJ Miller, a defensive back from Navarro College in Cedar Hill, Texas, recorded 29 tackles with seven pass breakups as a sophomore last year.

Zimbabwe will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on July 30, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Wednesday, a vote they promise will be free and fair with international monitoring after the ouster of 94-year-old strongman Robert Mugabe.
Mnangagwa, who took power after the November military coup against Mugabe, counts on the election to bolster their legitimacy as they pursue a promised break with Mugabe's repressive policies while urging foreign investors to return to Zimbabwe.
Missing from the July ballot for the first time in 20 years will be Zimbabwe's foremost political gladiators, Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, the longtime opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader who died of cancer in February.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said it had picked companies in southern Africa to print ballot papers and supply voting ink. The MDC wanted printing of ballots to be put to an open tender, but this was rejected by the government.
ZEC chairperson Priscilla Chigumba told reporters that the commission's partners, including U.N. agencies, would provide a quarter of the $198 million budget needed to hold the elections.
Mnangagwa has invited the Commonwealth to monitor voting in Zimbabwe for the first time since 2002 when Harare was suspended from the group over accusations of rigged elections. They have applied for Zimbabwe to rejoin the Commonwealth. [
If the election is approved by international monitors, it could be a key step to unlocking foreign lending to Zimbabwe, which has been largely cut off for two decades.
The vote is being cast as a fight between the old guard of Zimbabwe's 1970s independence war and a younger generation.
Mnangagwa's main challenger is 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa from the MDC, who has energised the party, drawing huge crowds at rallies in some of the ruling ZANU-PF party's rural redoubts.
Sixty percent of the 5.4 million voters on the new register are under 50 years old, according to official data.
The Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed an application by Zimbabweans living abroad to be allowed to vote. The court did not immediately give a reason.
In a brief statement in an official government gazette, Mnangagwa said they had fixed July 30 “as the day of the election of the president, the election of members of the national assembly and election of councillors.”
Prospective candidates will be registered on June 14.
A presidential run-off vote is set for Sept. 8 if no candidate gets at least the 50 percent-plus-one vote required to win.
LEGITIMACY
For the 75-year-old Mnangagwa, victory would accord them democratic legitimacy after taking power following the coup.
Mnangagwa urged ZANU-PF primary election candidates at a meeting on Wednesday to unite to ensure victory. They forecast that ZANU-PF would prevail over the more than 100 political parties expressing an interest in contesting the election.
Nicknamed “Crocodile” for their secretive and insular demeanour, Mnangagwa goes into the election with the advantage of incumbency, allowing them access to state resources for their campaign.
Crucially, Mnangagwa enjoys the backing of the army, which analysts say remains averse to any leader who, unlike him, lacks a pedigree from the liberation war against white rule.
“Though the election looks like it will go to the wire, the greater likelihood, based on cold-blooded analysis, is that experience, depth and state incumbency will triumph over youthfulness,” said Eldred Masunungure, a professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe.
Critics say Mnangagwa was Mugabe's most loyal acolyte and blame them for a government crackdown on rebels loyal to political rival Joshua Nkomo in the mid-1980s that rights groups say killed 20,000 civilians.
Mnangagwa has denied the charges and says political freedoms have improved under their short tenure and that they are repairing frosty relations with the West.

Andrew MacDougall is a London-based columnist, commentator and consultant. They were formerly director of communications to Stephen Harper.
Imagine you're Justin Trudeau.
A critical NATO summit lies a week distant. Donald Trump, the volatile U.S. President with whom you're locked in an escalating war on trade, is now sending caustic letters about your defence spending, or lack thereof. Even worse, the mad tweeter has a point, a fact Trump will surely moan about when they meet with Vladimir Putin—the man who wants NATO to die—without notetakers present.
Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford is revoking the province's cap-and-trade regulation, putting your vaunted pan-Canadian climate change framework at risk. The auto industry is panicking at the prospect of Trump's musings of new tariffs. The Kinder Morgan pipeline is missing precious months of summer construction time, despite being in federal hands. And you've just lost a seat in Quebec to the opposition Conservatives in a by-election.
Oh, and then there's the small matter of an 18-year old allegation of “groping”—the so-called “Kokanee Grope” —coming to a boil in the press, including with members of the heretofore glowing international press corps, threatening your hard-won reputation as the world's top feminist.
Now for the best part. After keeping a low media profile in the weeks since Trump's damaging G7 freakout, you're about to lock yourself into a plane to head to NATO HQ in Belgium with a pack of parliamentary journalists who haven't had a chance to ask you much about any of this, especially the “groping” bit.
For five days.
Having been trapped in RCAF 001 with frothing Ottawa journos on countless occasions myself, I know the immense size of the challenge facing Trudeau's communications team. Daunting doesn't begin to cover it. It's one thing to play prime ministerial keep-away at home; it's another to play it on the road, with journalists who pride themselves on their toughness and fearlessness—and whose outlets have also, by the way, paid your office thousands of dollars for the pleasure of your company.
There will be no room on the road for Trudeau to duck the grope. They face legitimate questions as to what happened in 2000, their vague responses to it, and their apparent double-standards on treating credible allegations, along with their credibility as a feminist. Trudeau will have to take the press on. But how?
The closest parallel to Trudeau's current communications predicament I can draw from my own time serving Stephen Harper is when we travelled to South America for bilateral meetings and the Pacific Alliance summit the week after Nigel Wright's resignation at the apex of the Duffy hysteria.
While foreign trips usually produced good coverage, a bilateral with Peru and the meeting of a minor group wasn't going to cut it. It was going to be all Duffy, all of the time. And while we tried to address the issue obliquely before leaving by having the prime minister speak to caucus about it with the press in the room, the press weren't allowed any questions, and so it wasn't until we answered their queries in Colombia that we regained a teeny-tiny modicum of control over the issue. And so it will be for Trudeau and their “groping.”
Like Harper, Trudeau has tried to lance the boil pre-trip by allowing a single question about the alleged groping at a Canada Day event in Regina, in which they largely echoed their office's response that they didn't remember any “negative interactions” on that day “at all.” But the question wasn't from a gallery journalist, and there weren't any follow-ups allowed, despite their statement provoking many avenues for follows. The flurry of stories since their comments are proof that more questions are to come.
Given that Trudeau came to office on a pledge of holding themselves to a higher standard than Harper on, well, everything—especially when it comes to the press—I'm sure we can expect a fulsome engagement with the fourth estate next week including, as Harper did in South America, taking questions from every single travelling journalist at a press conference (which were all about Duffy, in case there was any doubt).
If Trudeau doesn't want to enter the shooting gallery completely empty-handed, they have a handful of options, or some combination thereof. One, they can avoid the press entirely. Two, they can cower the press using warnings on probity (i.e. that it's gutter journalism to pursue the allegation) or by threatening future access to their office (i.e. ‘no scoops for you'). Three, they can release a more detailed statement in response to the allegation. Four, they can conduct a strictly-negotiated one-on-one with a preferred media outlet, preferably one with a large female audience. Or five, they can throw a dead cat on the table and hope people ask about that instead.
Each option comes with risks. Avoiding the press only invites process stories about avoiding the press, along with mentions of why. Journalists don't respond well to threats. A statement that expands on Trudeau's previous non-explanation would only invite more questions (e.g. why have you changed your story?), while one that didn't would invite a similar number. And a female-friendly outlet might be hard to find in this case; to wit, the folks at Flare have taken the Prime Minister to task over their handling of the matter.
That leaves the dead cat, which is easily Trudeau's best option. While there is already a heady mix of askable news out there, Trudeau could throw something else out there to further sweeten the news pot. A cabinet shuffle? Some more tough talk on Trump? Nah. On second thought, a dead cat probably won't cut it either.
But don't fret, Liberals—there is another way forward. If I were Trudeau's consigliere, I would recommend the ultimate high-risk, high-reward play: the announcement of an independent third-party investigation into the groping allegation. What's the worry if, as we've been told, nothing bad happened? Announcing an investigation would let Trudeau respond using process on the trip (e.g. “can't comment during the investigation”), while using that same process to get to the bottom of what happened. An independent third-party investigation would also put Trudeau on an equal footing with the members of their party who have faced similar circumstances, eliminating the charge of hypocrisy—but it would also put them in firing line should the investigation find their behaviour at fault.
Time is running out. Trudeau should want to get this issue under control before they leaf, lest they give the gallery journalists something they also crave: symbolism. The NATO summit, after all, is taking place less than 30 km from Waterloo, the battleground where Napoleon's grip on power collapsed. That a supposedly “negative interaction”-free Trudeau has yet to sanction an investigation into their past behaviour shows us where their worries lie.
MORE ABOUT JUSTIN TRUDEAU:
Colangelo has acknowledged having one of the accounts, which was inactive and reportedly used strictly for following players, agents, staff and the media to keep abreast of the news. They denied running the other four, calling the accusations "disturbing to [him] on many levels."
The evidence, however, tells a different story. A Ringer source noted that the patterns of follows, likes and tweets on each account were "extraordinarily similar." The site observed that the accounts followed people and institutions related to Colangelo and their family, and that three of the accounts conveniently went private within hours of calling the 76ers, which said they would ask Colangelo about the Twitter behavior. Others have observed that three out of the five accounts share the same last two phone number digits used for password resets, and that one of them was linked to Colangelo's personal email address.
The 76ers have since announced that they're investigating the allegations. If all the findings hold up, however, Colangelo is in serious trouble. Sports Illustrated's legal analyst believed that Colangelo might have been violating the collective bargaining agreements by publicly disclosing health info that was unrelated to their NBA careers. The allegations would have to go through the NBA's grievance resolution process, but could later lead to lawsuits over defamation and invasions of privacy.
Whatever the outcome, the report highlights just how complicated social media efforts can get in the modern era -- it's hard to be completely certain that a major persona is relying solely on their publicly known accounts. And if the revelations are true, they highlight how much effort is needed to cover your tracks. Colangelo might not have realized how relatively easy it would be for someone to establish connections between the accounts once word of them got out.
Rapper Drake has amassed an impressive collection of tattoos on their body over the years. There's the flower tattoo that they got to celebrate their album More Life and the one of a black bottle of Drakkar Noir on their arm.
But the Toronto native seems to have an obsession with one person in particular — English singer and songwriter Sade. Drizzy recently opted to get another tattoo of the “Smooth Operator” songstress that sits on their torso, above the earlier one they got of them
While Drake is known to get tattoos of people they admire, the “Smooth Operator” singer is the only person that holds the distinction of having two tattoos inked on Drake's body.
It's safe to say that Drake clearly shares “no ordinary love” for Sade. In March, the “Hotline Bling” singer hung out with Sade and captioned a photo “two very important ladies in my life,” alongside their mother. The following day, they posted another photo on Instagram of the two backstage.
Drake has long admired Sade, and they tried to collaborate with them on their 2010 album Thank Me Later. While the collaboration never materialized, Drake did sample their song “I Will Be Your Friend” on their “Free Spirit” track featuring Rick Ross.
The feeling also seems mutual, as Sade sent the rapper a framed photo of their “Babyfather” artwork when they turned 30. They wrote, “The 24th of October 1986 was a good day… Shine on, Drake. Love Sade.”

ZANU PF has in the past politicised positions that are supposed to be independent of the executive. These include the Judiciary, Independent Commission and the Civil Service which in black and white is highlighted by the constitution that the Civil Service must be manned by people whose conduct does not depict partisanship.
“Members of the Civil Service must act in accordance with this Constitution and the law. No member of the Civil Service may obey an order that is manifestly illegal. No member of the Civil Service may, in the exercise of their functions Act in a partisan manner; further the interests of any political party or cause; prejudice the lawful interests of any political party or cause.”
Despite the dictates of section 200 of the constitution, Civil Service has been involved in the organisation of ZANU PF activities, recently as revealed by Mandi Chimene, civil servants are involved in organising Mugabe's rallies.
This culture did not spare the Prosecutor General's Office, whose jurisdiction previously fell under the office of the Attorney General through the provisions of the old constitution.
The man who presided over this department in recent years is one Johannes Tomana who in our view decided to direct much of their efforts in a narrow partisan agenda other than focus on the core duties of their office as outlined in section 259 of the supreme law.
The PDP is convinced that the conduct of Tomana did not only compromise the efficacy of the Prosecution but resulted in the loss of trust in the department by the Zimbabwean people.
One of the famous cases in recent times is the refusal by Tomana to prosecute their ZANU PF colleague Munyaradzi Kereke who was later convicted of raping a minor through private prosecution.
Our concern has always been the denial of Justice by a partisan official who is supposed to be independent. If the child raped by Kereke was from a family in Malipati in Chiredzi, Kereke would be walking Scot-free, it could be possible the family would not afford a private prosecution.
We are also aware of the fact that ZANU PF prevents people from knowing their rights therefore many Zimbabweans would not even know they have a right to initiate a private prosecution.
All the technical debates and discussions could be avoided had Tomana just done their job and stayed away from politics.
We therefore urge ZANU PF to allow the office of the Prosecutor General to open a new chapter of competence, integrity and independence.
The Prosecutor General's in the new era must focus on the following issues.
Focus on combating corruption which has put a huge premium on the Zimbabwean economy. Change the culture in the department which has resulted in the loss of faith by the Zimbabwean people. Ensure all the violations of the law against the state are pursued to the fullest extent possible. Ensure The Prosecutor-General and officers of the National Prosecuting Authority act in accordance with the Constitution and the law. Ensure that No officer of the National Prosecuting Authority may, in the exercise of their or their functions–act in a partisan manner; further the interests of any political party or cause, prejudice the lawful interests of any political party or cause; or violate the fundamental rights or freedoms of any person.
Together Another Zimbabwe is Possible

NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on the death of a New York judge (all times local):
7:30 p.m.
Investigators have found no signs of foul play in the death of a New York judge whose body was found in the Hudson River in Manhattan, and two officials say the death is believed to be a suicide.
Sixty-five-year-old Sheila Abdus-Salaam was the first Black woman to serve on New York's highest court. Them body was found on the banks of the river near Harlem on Wednesday, a day after they were reported missing.
A spokesperson for the city's medical examiner says an autopsy conducted on Thursday was inconclusive and requires further study.
The two officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation hasn't been completed.

Police say there are no signs of criminality in the death of the first Black woman appointed to New York state's highest court whose body was found on the bank of the Hudson River.
An autopsy will be conducted on 65-year-old Sheila Abdus-Salaam.
The New York City police harbor unit retrieved their body from the Hudson on Wednesday, a day after they were reported missing.
Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who appointed Abdus-Salaam to the state's Court of Appeals in 2013, called them a “trailblazing jurist.”
Abdus-Salaam graduated from Barnard College and received their law degree from Columbia Law School.
They started their career as a staff attorney for East Brooklyn Legal Services. They served as a judge on the Manhattan state Supreme Court for 14 years.

Akinwunmi: Everybody Needs A Hero
It was another exciting and fulfilling day at the Campos Memorial Mini-Stadium on Thursday as the third edition of the Seyi Akinwunmi Charity Mini-Tournament drew political heavyweights, leaders in football administration, top –flight professionals, ex –international players, referees, coaches, well-wishers, family and friends to the arena.
A couple of months after the present NFF administration (of which they are 1st Vice President) came into office, friends and associates wanted to host the experienced administrator and legal luminary to a birthday bash. They humbly declined, opting instead for a charity event where people could donate to a worthy cause of helping intelligent but indigent children.
Conceived as a special project to give back to the society, the Seyi Akinwunmi Charity Mini- Tournament is the eponymous charity event organized by the Seyi Akinwunmi Charity Foundation.
Its objectives include rehabilitation of ailing ex-international footballers. Embedded therein also is a Courage Education Foundation (CEF) – a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the empowerment of the Nigerian child through the provision of quality education available to all Nigerian children irrespective of sex, faith or ethnicity, as well as Consolidation of The Future Stars Project – a grassroots football development program targeted at kids (mainly under 13 years of age) and hinged on the binary factors of sporting and academic excellence.
Last year's crowd included the Majority Leader in the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, NFF President Amaju Pinnick, NFF 2nd Vice President/LMC Chairman Shehu Dikko and the Seriki of Egbaland, Oba Tosin Fadare.
On Thursday, former FIFA and CAF Executive Committee member, Dr. Amos Adamu, former NFF General Secretary and later Chairman of Technical Committee Chief Taiwo Ogunjobi, former NFF General Secretary Fanny Ikhayere Amun, NFF Board Members Otunba Sunday Dele-Ajayi and Chris Green and Chairman of the Lagos State Sports Commission, Hon. Deji Tinubu were among the dignitaries.
There were also FA Chairmen Ganiyu Majekodunmi and James Odeniran, NRA President Tade Azeez, Mr. Adewunmi Ogunsanya (Director General, Lagos State Sports Commission), highly successful professionals Yomi Badejo-Okusanya and Foluso Philips, Dr. Rafiu Oladipo (President-General, Nigeria Football Supporters Club), Dr. Kweku Tandoh (former Lagos State Director of Sports), Dr. Isaac Ayodele (former Ekiti FA chairperson), Mr. Rasheed Balogun (GM, Shooting Stars), Reverend Samuel Ikpea (Chairman, Nigeria Football Supporters Club), Dr. Akin George (Lagos State Sports Commission), Barr. Agbolade Dokunmu (President, All-Stars Abuja), Mr. Moroof Oluwa (SG, NRA) and Board Members of the Lagos State FA).
The cast of ex –internationals was led by former Super Eagles' goalkeeper and captain Peter Rufai and included Gbenga Okunowo, Godwin Okpara, Teslim Fatusi, Segun Fetuga, Olumide Harris and Mba Agbai (Green also featured here). Harris scored a hat – trick in the All-Stars' 5-2 defeat of Seyi Akinwunmi and Friends (captained by Deji Tinubu and including Ogunjobi), with Rufai also on the scoresheet.
A number of youth teams from the Eko Football Project factory entertained the crowd before the All-Stars and Seyi Akinwunmi and Friends. The final match, between Lagos State FA United Veterans and Ikorodu United Veterans, ended 1-0 in favour of the former.
At the end, Akinwunmi, who also celebrated their 54th birthday same day, told thenff.com: “For me, there is no better way to celebrate a birthday. I love children so much and I am happy being able to offer some assistance to a number of them through this project.
“The truth is that those who have the means to go to school easily and do a lot of other things are only privileged; they have the grace of God and it is not by their making. If you see yourself as being privileged, and that it is not by your power that you are where you are but by the mercy of God, you would want to give back to the society.
“Believe me, if you that is in a position to provide support to these children fails to do so, some other persons certainly will.
“Everybody needs a hero, whether that person is their father, mother, relation or someone they don't even know physically.”

OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on problems with an emergency spillway at the nation's tallest dam (all times local):
7:25 a.m.
The Oroville Reservoir is continuing to drain as state water officials scrambled to reduce the lake's level ahead of impending storms.
The Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/2lKMK5I) that the reservoir was down 20 feet since it reached capacity on Sunday when it overflowed and sparked an evacuation order for nearly 200,000 people south of the dam.
Officials say the lake is draining at 100,000 cubic feet per second, reducing the reservoir about a foot every three hours. The Department of Water Resources wants to drop the reservoir's level 50 feet overall by Sunday.
Forecasts call for 2-4 inches of rain and snow in the foothills and mountains starting Wednesday night or early Thursday. But the storm was looking colder than initially projected, meaning less rain and less runoff than last week's storms.
_____
12:30 a.m.
The stress of evacuation and an uncertain future were enough for Donald Azevedo and their family to opt to stay a few more nights in an emergency shelter rather than risk having to do it all again.
The family was among the nearly 200,000 Californians who live downstream from the country's tallest dam who were told they could return home but warned they may have to flee again if repairs made to the battered Oroville Dam spillways don't hold.
The fixes could be put to their first test later this week with the first of a series of small storms forecast for the region expected to reach the area Wednesday night.
Pope Francis' decision to move the World War II-era head of Poland's Catholic Church a step closer to possible sainthood has hit a stumbling block, after two leading Jewish organizations and even Polish Catholic publications called them out for anti-Semitic views.
It's not clear if the protests will derail the sainthood cause of Cardinal August Hlond, but in the past the Vatican has taken such protests seriously and at the very least put the cases up for closer review.
In May, Francis approved a decree recognizing Hlond's "heroic virtues." Now the Vatican must confirm a miracle attributed to Hlond's intercession for them to be beatified, and a second one for them to be made a saint.
Hlond, born July 5, 1881, was the highest-ranking church official in Poland from 1926 to their death in 1948.  They are highly respected in this overwhelmingly Catholic country for having rejected Nazi Germany's proposals for a collaborative government, and for protecting the church's independence during the first years of communism.
In its protest, the American Jewish Committee pointed to a passage in a 1936 pastoral letter by Hlond, who was Poland's primate then, that showed their attitude toward Jews and echoed the general line of the Catholic Church of the time.
The group also criticized Hlond's failure to condemn the killings of at least 40 Jews in Poland in 1946 by a mob and secret security. It argued that moving forward with the canonization process will be seen as an "expression of approval of Cardinal Hlond's extremely negative approach toward the Jewish community."
"It's very difficult to see how you can still claim that the man was a paragon (of saintliness) when the data is so explicit," AJC's director of interreligious affairs, Rabbi David Rosen, told The Associated Press.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Nazi-hunting body, said making Hlond a saint would "further embolden" Poland's right-wing government in its "headlong efforts to selectively rewrite Polish activities from that tragic era."
The disputed passage in Hlond's letter reads: "It is a fact that the Jews are fighting against the Catholic Church, persisting in free thinking, and are the vanguard of godlessness, Bolshevism and subversion."
It has frequently been cited as evidence of the Catholic Church's institutional anti-Semitism prior to the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.
But Hlond also wrote that there are many "ethically outstanding, noble and respectable" Jews, and that all Jews should be "respected and loved as persons and as neighbors."
In what appeared to be a condemnation of German Nazi laws, the letter warned against "imported from abroad" anti-Semitism that's "incompatible with Catholic ethics."
"It is not allowed to attack Jews, beat them, injure them or slander them," Hlond said in the letter, which priests read out in churches at Lent in 1936.
They said it was "good" to support Polish businesses and avoid Jewish ones, but it was "forbidden" to "ravage Jewish shops, destroy the goods of the Jews, break windows, throw firecrackers at their homes."
Rosen, who has decades of experience in Catholic-Jewish relations, said the process of making Hlond a saint should be halted.
But the Polish priest promoting Hlond's case before the Vatican's Congregations for the Causes of Saints said the criticism is "unfounded" because Hlond's words had been taken out of context. Mgr. Boguslaw Koziol has discussed all the documents with Vatican experts, and insists Hlond preached love regardless of nation or religion.
Koziol believes that the whole passage — titled "From our Sins" — was progressive for its time and aimed to protect Jews from violence. But they admit it also included questionable ideas.
Hlond's critics "have focused on this negative part of the letter, but are not quoting any other part," they told the AP.
Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny argued that the letter failed to protect Jews from the attacks of Polish nationalists.
It said Hlond didn't "suggest any way out of the 'Jewish problem,' or any good plan for a dignified and peaceful coexistence in one country. One could protest: these were not yet the times of dialogue. But one may also reply: shouldn't we expect candidates for sainthood to be larger than the routine thinking of their times?"
Referring to the July 4, 1946 pogrom in the town of Kielce — where a mob and secret security forces killed at least 40 Jews and two Poles who were defending them — Rosen said that Hlond "did not condemn the pogrom nor urge Poles to stop murdering Jews. Rather, they pointed out that the Jews were all communists or supporters of communism and that the pogrom was their own fault."
Koziol, however, blames Poland's post-war communist rule for Hlond's reticence. Any direct condemnation would have meant a confrontation with the regime and repercussions for the church.
In 2005, the Vatican shelved the planned beatification of French priest the Rev. Leon Dehon and launched an inquiry after complaints about their anti-Semitic views.
There should be zero tolerance for pot use by drivers or their passengers, a new report by the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario branch recommends.
The report, Cannabis Legalization and Regulation, also says that all marijuana revenue should go to fund mental health and addiction services, and that the minimum age to purchase the product should be 19 years old.
“The risk is that legalization of cannabis may lead to an increase in use among Ontarians,” Camille Quenneville, CEO of CMHA Ontario, said in a statement Monday. “When taken together, our recommendations can minimize the harms associated with cannabis use and support a public health approach to this issue.”
As the Justin Trudeau government gets set to legalize pot by July 2018, CMHA Ontario prepared a report for the provincial government with recommendations on how to go forward.
The report says marijuana legalization should be viewed through a public health lens.
CMHA Ontario anticipates an increased need for mental health and addiction support services with legal pot, especially for youth and heavy consumers “ranging from brief interventions for at-risk users to more intensive interventions,” as well as extensive public education campaigns.
The “most concerning” issue is driving high, with data already showing that an estimated 10.4 million vehicle trips a year involve a motorist that had used marijuana, the report says.
Testing for drug-impaired driving may not accurately reflect the level of impairment, it says.
“Because the technology to detect an individual's level of impairment due to cannabis is still in development at this time, CMHA Ontario recommends a zero-tolerance policy for cannabis consumption in any motorized vehicle in order to ensure road safety during this time of transition,” the report says. “A zero-tolerance policy would include both the driver of the motorized vehicle, and any passengers in the car. It is important that a clear message be sent to the public as soon as possible regarding zero tolerance for impaired driving due to cannabis use.”
While the Canadian Medical Association, which represents the nation's doctors, called for a minimum legal pot-buying age of 21, CMHA Ontario suggested the lower age of 19.
“Frequent cannabis use can harm a developing brain and there is no evidence that supports a specific age when cannabis use is safe for young people,” the report says. “However, there are concerns that a higher minimum age may contribute to young people accessing cannabis from illegal sources. Establishing a higher minimum age standard will be less effective in undermining the black market, and may leave youth both criminalized and reliant on it.”

Fear escalated across Austin on Monday after the fourth bombing this month — this time, a blast that was triggered by a tripwire and demonstrated what police said was a “higher level of sophistication” than the package bombs used in the previous attacks.
Two men in their 20s were wounded Sunday night as they walked along a street and were hospitalized in stable condition. The three earlier bombings since March 2 left two people dead and two wounded.
“We are clearly dealing with what we believe to be a serial bomber at this point, based on the similarities between now what is the fourth device” and the previous ones, Police Chief Brian Manley said.
They said investigators have yet to establish a motive.
“Is this terrorism? Is this hate-related?” Manley asked. They said investigators will “have determined if we see a specific ideology behind this.”
They said the blast involved a tripwire, unlike the first three attacks, in which package bombs were left on people's doorsteps. That represents a “significant change,” in that the previous bombings appeared targeted, while the latest one would have hurt any random person walking by, Manley said.
The device this time entailed “a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill,” the chief said.
Authorities canvassed the area in search of anything suspicious, and residents were warned to remain indoors and to call 911 if they needed to leave their homes. Manley asked anyone with surveillance cameras at their homes to make the footage available in case suspicious vehicles or people could be seen.
Sunday night's explosion happened in the southwestern Austin neighborhood of Travis Country. That is far from the sites of the earlier bombings, which occurred over two-plus weeks in residential neighborhoods east of Interstate 35.
The 22- and 23-year-old men injured this time are white, unlike the victims in the earlier blasts, who were black or Hispanic.
Manley warned people not to touch suspicious bags, boxes or backpacks, especially if they had wires protruding.
“We need people paying attention to suspicious objects,” the chief said.
Mayor Steve Adler said the latest explosion only further raised anxieties in the city.
“That concern is legitimate and real,” Adler said, adding that residents should also be reassured by the massive police response to the attacks. Hundreds of federal agents are investigating, along with Austin police.
“That anxiousness is going to continue until we can find the answer,” Adler said.
Spring break ends Monday for the University of Texas and many area school districts, meaning people who were out of town have returned home to heightened fears.
The university's campus police warned returning students to be wary and to tell their classmates about the danger, saying, “We must look out for one another.” None of the four attacks happened close to the campus near the heart of Austin.
Austin's school district announced that buses wouldn't be going into the Travis Country neighborhood and that any “tardies or absences due to this situation will be excused.”
But concern spread well past the immediate blast site.
Andrew Zimmerman, 44, a coffee shop worker on the city's west side, said he's lived in Austin their entire life.
“This makes me sick,” Zimmerman said, noting the use of a tripwire adds a “new level” of suspected professionalism that makes it harder to guard against such attacks.
“That's what scares me a little bit,” they added.
Police said Sunday's victims were hospitalized with injuries that weren't life-threatening.
The latest explosion came hours after authorities raised the reward by $50,000 for information leading to the arrest of whoever is responsible for the first three explosions. It now totals $115,000.
The PGA's Dell Technologies Match Play tournament is scheduled to begin in Austin on Wednesday, and dozens of the world's top golfers are set to begin arriving the day before.
Will the iPhone 8 Be Able To Scan Your Face?
The iPhone 8 reveal is almost here, and we will soon get our first official look at the latest flagship. However, until then we can expect leaks and tips, and here is what the latest ones talk about.
The first leak shows X-Ray shots of the phone from Chinese social network Weibo, and Apple tipster Benjamin Geskin. This leak shows two iPhone templates in production, one with a TFT-LCD screen, and one with an OLED screen, which could be the iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 respectively.
The iPhone 8 scan also looks like it has bigger room for battery.
The templates also show room for a charging coil which could mean that wireless charging is coming to the phone. Earlier rumors also hinted at a glass back for the iPhone 7S Plus, which could enable wireless charging more easily than the usual metal finish.
Another feature talked about is the new face recognition capability, or Face ID. After some digging into the HomePod firmware code, a reference for a resting state popped up, which suggested that you'll be able to unlock your iPhone with a glance even when it's sat down flat on a surface.
We can't confirm the authenticity of these rumors and leaks. However, they do back up earlier rumors. We will know more once the phone is officially announced next month.

Journalist and former radical-left Member of Knesset Uri Avnery believes that the religious community is taking over the country, despite the predictions of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben Gurion, that the religious community would disappear.
"The religious [community], especially the national religious [community], are full of aggressive passion, they are full of enthusiasm, they feel they are winning, while the secular side is characterized by indifference, apathy, and comfort in the present circumstances and therefore there is no initiative to counterattack, to comply with their principles." Avnery said in an interview with Galei Yisrael radio
Avnery said that "Ben-Gurion believed that the religious [community] would disappear on their own, they did not think there was a need to preach secularism, and they were absolutely sure that the religious were like a vestigial organ, to disappear from the world within a generation or two. We all believed so."
"I think that the country that we established in '48 is disappearing, and instead there arose another state, one very different from the state that was before our eyes. The Hebrew culture that we started to create before '48 and after '48, has disappeared; it no longer exists. There is a new culture: religious, messianic, and it is gradually taking over," said Avnery.
They also referred to a column written by A.B. Yehoshua in Ha'aretz that addressed the idea of ​​two states for two peoples, saying that "Israelis and Palestinians will be dragged slowly, willingly or unwillingly, into a binational state."
Avnery replied, "Despair is a very bad adviser. Anyone who thinks or acts based on despair will not come to anything other than greater despair. A.B. gave up totally and offers - with all due respect that they are an important writer - something dumb. It's something that simply can't be, but novelists are not always the most important thinkers," they said.
According to him, "this battle of peace between Israel and Palestine vs. eternal war, an apartheid state or an Arab state with a Jewish minority, this battle is not over and it has not been decided. It is far from being decided. We need to reestablish the secular ideal. Secular does not mean empty of religion. Secular is an entire worldview: humanistic, liberal, and it relies on the great human thinkers of the last 2,000 years."
An Igbo Man Must Be Nigeria's President In 2019, A Northerner Their VP, Otherwise Biafra Will Come – Ohaneze Youths
The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, the youth wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on Tuesday, said Ndigbo must produce the country's President in 2019.
A Northerner could be the Vice President in 2019, according to the Igbo youths.
The Ohanaeze Youth wing, which spoke after a meeting in Enugu, said the Biafra agitation would take an unprecedented turn if a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction was not the outcome of the 2019 general elections.
“It is Igbo President 2019 or Biafra 2020,” OYC, the umbrella body of Igbos youths, declared in a communique signed by the General Secretary, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike.
Stressing that Igbos would no longer play ‘second fiddle in Nigerian politics', the Ohanaeze youth wing said it has mobilised all its resources towards the actualization of the long-standing quest for an ‘Igbo President' in 2019.
The irate youths noted that their position on the 2019 elections was largely informed by the North's opposition to calls for restructuring, as well as the quit ultimatum given to Igbos living in the North by a coalition of Northern groups.
“A situation where no Igbo has been allowed close to the seat of power for decades is sheer injustice and hatred, whereas other geopolitical zones have been taking turns either as military or civilian presidents.
“More annoying i‎s the fact that the North, a major beneficiary in this direction, has bluntly refused to heed the call for restructuring, which has been identified as the panacea to the many socio-political problems plaguing the nation.
“Besides, they (North) have also not only continued to express disdain over the demand for Biafra by IPOB and MASSOB but have also ordered Ndigbo out of the North based on these agitations,” the communique said.
Although the major pro-Biafra groups, the Indigenous People of Biafra and the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, have said they are not interested in the ‘Igbo President project', the Ohanaeze youth wing said a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction would pacify all Igbos, including the agitators.
“Remember that former President Olusegun Obasanjo have urged Nigerians to beg the Biafra agitators – only a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction will appease Igbos. Otherwise, Biafra agitation will be inevitable.
“If there is any conspiracy against Igbo presidency, it will bring Biafra into existence,” the communique said.
The communique added, “One now wonders why Ndigbo will continue to be treated in this manner.
“Two days ago, the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, re-echoed the fact that Nigeria is in a marriage. They were quoted as saying ‘Our nation has been in marriage for a while now. Sometimes there are quarrels within that marriage. Sometimes there is disagreement. What is important is that you must remain together. You must remain united.'
“It does appear from the above that Ndigbo has perpetually remained the sacrificial lamb to keep this forced marriage together. They have remained victims of an abusive marriage, often beaten and cheated by the husband.
“We have resolved today that this grave injustice cannot continue.
“It is Igbo Presidency in 2019 with a Vice President from the North or nothing.
“We are not ready to be treated with levity and disdain in this country any longer, and for that we are calling on all Igbo sons and daughters, both at home and in the Diaspora, to key into this project.”

McGovern's cruciate woe for a second time 14 June 2017

All the furore surrounding Wexford's brilliant win over Kilkenny has been dampened somewhat by the news that talented forward Liam Og McGovern has suffered a recurrence of the cruciate knee ligament injury that sidelined them for all of last year.
McGovern's worst fears were confirmed in a scan after they damaged the knee during an A v. B game ahead of the clash against Kilkenny.
The St Anne's clubman was sidelined for 12 months having suffered the same injury, but they returned to action when coming on as a sub during the Leinster SHC quarterfinal win over Laois.
Surgery on the knee will take place shortly, but McGovern is set for another 12-month spell on the sidelines.
Another cruciate injury victim, Andrew Shore is back to full fitness and is working away with the squad ahead of the provincial decider.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) honored on Friday the honest Bureau of Immigration (BI) officer who turned over to authorities a bundle of cash left at their counter at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal I.
DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II awarded a certificate of recognition to Immigration Officer (IO) I Reimond Abigeil Lagman for their uprightness after they immediately reported to their superiors their discovery of a white envelope, containing $1,900 (approx. P95,000), on their counter at the airport last September 7.
The money was appropriately documented and handed over to the Airport Police Lost and Found section for safekeeping. The money is still unclaimed as of posting.

“Honesty and integrity in government service are core values that we want to inculcate in all our employees in the DOJ family,” Aguirre said.
“By their act of returning US$ 1,900.00, that was left at their counter at NAIA Terminal I, Immigration Officer I Reimond Abigeil B. Lagman has exemplified those valued traits.
The DOJ family lauds their truly commendable act,” they added.
Aguirre hoped that Lagman's act would serve as an inspiration to others “to serve with integrity at all times.” /kga

The state of California and city of San Francisco are suing the U.S. Department of Justice over President Donald Trump's sanctuary city restrictions on public safety grants.In a news conference Monday, Attorney General Xavier Becerra and City Attorney Dennis Herrera, both Democrats, announced the lawsuit, which makes California the first state to challenge the administration on its sanctuary city policy of denying funds to cities that limit cooperation with enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.Chicago filed a similar suit last week, arguing that the Trump administration's bid to withhold public safety grants from so-called sanctuary cities is illegal.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the Trump administration "will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens."

-The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief faces arrest even as their rivals have gained ground and have good relations with Mamata Banerjee, who has patched up with Sikkim CM, Pawan Chamling.
The Supreme Court's rejection of Bimal Gurung's appeal against arrest, and West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee's patch up with their Sikkim counterpart, Pawan Chamling, could spell the end of the Gorkhaland activist's reign in Darjeeling politics, feel their rivals who are rising in the region.
In a last-ditch attempt, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief released a video on Saturday demanding that the Centre immediately call a tri-partite meeting, and asserted that they and their supporters “are not criminals, anti-nationals or terrorists”.
However, their appeal may not have much effect, as the BJP has little clout in the hills without him.
“After this order from the Supreme Court, the state has the right to arrest Gurung,” said Binoy Tamang, a former Gurung confidante who led a coup against them a few months ago and later took control of the larger faction of GJM.
Gurung, who ruled the hills unchallenged between 2011 and 2016, landed in trouble in June last year when they called for an indefinite strike demanding statehood for Gorkhaland and took the Mamata government head on.
Booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), they have been absconding since August 17 last year.
Tamang is presently acting as the chairperson of the board of administrators in the semi-autonomous Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) — which was formed in 2012 following a movement led by Gurung, but which they abandoned last year when they faced arrest.
Banerjee's patch up with Chamling, following a cold-war that continued for several months, comes as the biggest setback for Gurung, who has been using various parts of Sikkim to hide from the Bengal police.
Chamling had earlier expressed their support for the Gorkhaland movement, and even wrote a letter to the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, advocating the creation of Gorkhaland, giving Gurung's movement a new fillip.
Even though Union minister Surinder Singh Ahluwalia of the BJP is the Darjeeling MP, the party ruling the Centre has little influence in the region.
Other parties in the hills, except for the Gurung-led faction of GJM, are critical of the BJP.
“Gurung was acting like a pawn in the hands of the BJP since 2009,” said Neeraj Zimba, spokesperson of Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF).
“BJP, due to its focus on the rest of Bengal, has completely forgotten its promise to the people of the hills. BJP does not care for the hills and has dumped its people,” said Harka Bahadur Chhetri, former GJM MLA who broke away from Gurung to launch their own Jan Andolan Party (JAP).
Significantly, all of Gurung's rivals, including GNLF, JAP and the Tamang-led GJM have good relations with Mamata Banerjee.
Asok Bhattacharya, a former state minister and CPI(M) MLA from Siliguri, blamed Gurung for their downfall and the plight of the people of the hills.
“Had Gurung not gone out of the way to do some wrongs, the situation in the hills would have been different,” they said.

Pink will go ahead with singing the national anthem at Super Bowl LII on Sunday even as they battle the flu, saying that the illness is making "one of my dreams ... sort of nightmare."
The singer, who is set to open the championship game by singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” revealed in an Instagram post Saturday that they caught the flu from their two small children.
Pink, 38, and former motorcars competitor Carey Hart are parents to 6-year-old Willow and 1-year-old Jameson.
"[I'm] trying to practice the flu away," they began in a caption. "I've been waiting to sing this song since 1991 when I saw my idol, Whitney Houston, own this song. And now, my chance has finally come."
Pink continued, "And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough INTO MY MOUTH and rub their snot on my cheek. You can't write this stuff I swear! And here we are. I've arrived at another one of my dreams which is slowly becoming a sort of nightmare."
Pink said the opportunity to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl which is being held at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, "is one of the biggest honors of my life, singing this song in front of my family, my military family, my dad and brother and step mama and family and the world. And the EAGLES!?!?!"
Despite the flu, they said, "I promise I will do my best, as I always do. As far as the gremlins that got me into this mess, you can cough at me for the rest of your lives. If it's a contest, babies, you win."
Pink joins a long line of pop stars who have had the honor of singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, including Beyonce, Diana Ross, Lady Gaga, Neil Diamond, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, and Cher.
Justin Timberlake is set to perform at the halftime show during this year's big game.

Prescott, Arizona city officials have told the US Department of Transportation (DOT) they no longer support a bid from Boutique Airlines to provide short-term air service after US regional Great Lakes Airlines abruptly ceased passenger flight operations March 26. The move came after receiving input from the community.
In an April 18 letter to DOT, Prescott mayor Greg Mengarelli said the city rejected all three proposals it received for interim essential air service (EAS), citing “new information.” Prescott Municipal Airport director Robin Sobotta, confirmed to ATW's sister publication Aviation Daily that public pushback against air service with single-engine aircraft led the city to change its stance.
Prescott earlier this month said it would back a bid from San Francisco-based Boutique Air to operate Pilatus PC-12s to Los Angeles and Phoenix. Boutique also proposed operating the service with twin-engine Beech King Airs, but the projected subsidy needed to make the service viable was deemed too high, city officials said.
Two other bidders, Advance Air and Mokulele Airlines, faced the same challenges. Advance proposed King Airs, while Mokulele proposed single-engine operations.
Prescott asked DOT for rapid re-bid for interim service, but the turnaround time require could see the process skip directly to finding a long-term EAS provider. Prescott officials are confident that, given enough time to adjust schedules, small Part 121s operators will find the city an attractive addition their networks.
“Prescott is a growing community,” Mengarelli wrote. “We are confident that our focused efforts will yield a viable long-term air service solution and dramatically increase our passenger traffic in the future.”
Prescott is part of central Arizona's Yavapai County, which has a population of about 220,000. The airport's enplanements totaled about 5,800 in 2017, a 60% increase from 2016.
Great Lakes, which shut down all flight operations last month, was contracted to serve Prescott with 30-seat Embraer Brasilias through April 2019.

World Rugby have announced that Dan Payne has been appointed as chief executive of Rugby Americas.
Payne's role will see them become the senior World Rugby employee in the Americas and they have been tasked with growing the game by working with regional associations to strengthen professional and domestic competitions.
They will also be responsible for extending the reach of development programmes and bringing in new commercial opportunities.
Payne is due to begin their new role after the Rugby World Cup Sevens 2018 in San Francisco in July.
They will replace Tom Jones, who is retiring after 36 years of working in rugby administration in the Americas.
Payne is highly experienced in sports administration and recently oversaw growth in participation, development and commercial growth during a three-year tenure as USA Rugby chief executive.
According to World Rugby, the sport in the Americas is currently experiencing record growth with the region home to more than 2.3 million players thanks to recent increases in participation and commercial opportunities.
World Rugby vice-chairperson and Rugby Americas President Agustín Pichot expressed their satisfaction of having Payne on board.

"We are delighted to appoint Dan Payne as chief executive officer of Rugby Americas," Pichot said.
"These are exciting times for the growth of the sport, and Dan's knowledge and expertise of rugby in the Americas, proven track record with USA Rugby and passion for the development of the game, make them perfectly suited for this important role."
World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper added: "Dan will enable us to further strengthen our strategic activities in partnership with Rugby Americas North and Sudamérica Rugby to assist our unions in growing and sustaining a thriving game for all across the Americas."
Gosper also paid tribute to the retiring Jones.
"Tom has been an incredible servant to the game and on behalf of World Rugby, Rugby Americas, Rugby Americas North and all the unions in the region, I would like to express my thanks for their service and their achievements," they said.
"It is no coincidence that during their 16 years with World Rugby participation in the region boomed, our unions grew stronger and our competitions thrived.
"He is a big man with a big rugby heart and will be missed by everyone who worked with them and I would like to wish Tom and their family all the best as they begin a new chapter in their life."
Bruce K. Cottington, 90, died September 14 at their home in Litchfield, Minnesota.
The funeral service was held on Friday, Sept. 22, with burial later this fall at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.
Bruce was born January 22, 1927 on a farm near Forest City, Iowa, the 10th of 13 children.
Their father, Levi, died when Bruce was nine.
In 1942, at 16, Bruce enlisted in the Navy, serving with the 4th Marine Division in the Pacific Theater, participating in seven battles and island assaults.
They returned to active duty in Korea, participating in the Christmas Eve action at Hungnam, receiving their eighth battle star.
They attended Drake University in Des Moines, married Florence Anderson from Decorah and started a family.
They went into the grocery business, finally settling in Litchfield in 1967.
They founded the Peanut Butter and Milk Festival in 1972 and established the sister city relationship with Hartford, Alabama.
That program continues and the annual citizen exchanges have introduced many from the Litchfield area to lifelong Alabama friends.
They were also a tireless promoter of the dairy industry.
Florence died in 1996.
Bruce leaves three sons, their wives, and seven grandchildren.
Specifically, the couple highlighted access to immunizations and empowering women to take control of their sexuality via contraceptives and support groups as the keys to improving our world. "Limiting women's power keeps everyone poor," Melinda says.
Bill and their wife also have a keen interest in keeping child mortality rates on their downward trend. Melinda writes that it's the bedrock of the Foundation and that "virtually all" of society's advances (including economic growth, gender equity and access to contraceptives) are reflected in child mortality rate.
"If parents believe that their children will survive -- and if they have the power to time and space their pregnancies -- they choose to have fewer children," Melinda writes. Some 300 million women in developing countries use "modern contraceptives," a benchmark that Melinda says took 13 years to reach compared to a previous figure of 200 million, a number they say took decades to hit.
Spacing pregnancies also leads to mothers becoming more educated and have healthier kids in general. "Contraceptives are also one of the greatest antipoverty innovations in history," they say. This cascades into more countries being able to pull themselves out of debt because parents can devote more time and resources to keeping their kids smart and healthy.
Women in developing countries who can space their births by at least three years have babies statistically twice as likely to hit their first birthday, too. Access to contraceptives also has a direct effect on those seeking government assistance as well. When people have fewer kids, there's less need for financial help to raise them, which in turn decreases things like welfare dependencies.
"No country in the last 50 years has emerged from poverty without expanding access to contraceptives," Melinda writes. Pulling a nation out of poverty is a long game, not a quick fix.
On a global level, President Trump reversing the "Mexico City policy" could have a chilling effect on how the Gates Foundation works. If you'll remember, the so-called "global gag order" originated under President Reagan in 1984 and cuts off funding to foreign organizations that use money from the US to provide abortions or even discuss the procedure as a means of family planning. Democrat presidents repeal it when they take office, and Republicans reinstate it.
Bill recently told the Guardian that the US cutting off foreign funding for reproductive health could "create a void that even a foundation like ours can't fill." The US, they say, is the top donor for the Foundation's work. "When government leaves an area like that, it can't be offset, there isn't a real alternative."
"We're concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world," Melinda said. "It's likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need."
Given that Trump considers themselves a successful business person, maybe being presented with hard numbers and statistics proving that investing in women and things like vaccinations makes fiscal sense will change some of their policy decisions. After all, they count Bill Gates as one of the people who can tell them how to shut down parts of the internet, so there's a remote chance he'll trust where this info is coming from.
Date 3 to 5 men at the same time and select one to marry — Gospel musician advises Ladies
A US based-Ghanaian Female gospel musician Esaaba Haizel is advising young girls to date three to five men in order to assess them before selecting one to marry.
They said it would be of great help for the girls to date multiple men at the same time without getting sexually involved because they would be able to choose the right one best for them.
Speaking to Austine Woode on Abusua Entertainment, they indicated that dating one man is very risky because the man might break the woman's heart by jilting them after heavily investing in the relationship.
‘…I advised young girls on Facebook wall to have three to five men at the same time without having any sexual intercourse with them, you just have to be firm not to sleep with them, having multiple partners will help you to study them, then you let the rest go, by choosing just one. Why waste your time o date only one person?. I'm saying this because you can't have it all, one of the men would be interested in your business, one would be concerned about the food you eat on daily basis thereby supply your needs, the other will be interested in the shoes, make ups, clothing you wear, the list goes on,' they explained.
The Facebook Preacher explained that this is an advise most pastors cannot give to their female church members who are ripe for marriage.
Esaba stated that most men are of the notion that women population is higher than men and thus tread on this to dump women.
‘I'm a Christian, is there something wrong with my advise to young ladies who aspire to marry?, its a good advice your pastor cannot give you,' they quizzed.
They said most women have been neglected by men after wasting their time, committing their time to the relationship.
‘Some men even marry their girlfriends' friends on the d-day after having series of sexual bouts with them, giving them your hearts and all that,' they stated.
They explained that their comments are quotes from their poetry they post on their Facebook page as and when they like.

The investigation began on March 24, 2017, when a Wichita Falls Police Department detective was contacted by Child Protective Services in reference to a case of possible sexual abuse.
The mother of the 15-year-old victim reported their daughter had been sexually abused by a family friend during the Thanksgiving break in 2015. The victim lives in Arlington, TX.
On April 4, 2017, the victim was brought to Arlington Alliance for Children and was forensically interviewed.
During the interview, the victim stated that while visiting with family friends in Wichita Falls over the 2015 Thanksgiving holiday, Brent Cotton, 35, touched them inappropriately on more than one occasion.
The victim said they were worried what Cotton would do if they told them to stop.
On April 18, 2017, the victim had a sexual assault exam done. The report indicated that there were no physical findings; however, the report showed the exam was consistent with the history of the patient and it was the examiner's impression that the victim had been sexually assaulted.
Cotton was arrested on Tuesday night and is sitting in the Wichita County Jail.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — For all the ways the judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial has streamlined the case inside the courtroom, the frenzy outside grows larger and wilder each day of jury deliberations.
The media presence, large but manageable during five days of testimony last week, has ballooned as the verdict seems near. In a staging area where celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred and others have been speaking to the press, the podium was damaged under the growing weight of microphones.
Hotel rooms are sold out for miles. Victim advocates grow in number on the courthouse steps, and the Cosby camp's spin grows louder.
Cosby arrived Wednesday morning for the start of Day 3 of jury deliberations in their sexual assault trial, entering the suburban Philadelphia courthouse on the arm of their spokesperson. The panel, which already has deliberated 16 hours over two days, went straight to the jury room for the resumption of talks.
Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt, who guides the vision-impaired Cosby throughout their day, has drawn throngs of cameras with their updates on Cosby's mood — "very confident," is a common refrain — and assertions that the 79-year-old comedian isn't getting a fair shake.
On Friday, they took to the steps to float the idea that Cosby might testify when the defense case opened Monday. It never happened, but the suggestion was enough to dominate the headlines just as prosecutors were closing their case with Cosby's damaging deposition testimony.
"Cosby's team is trying to plant seeds of doubt about this trial with their fans so they don't abandon him. They're tugging on the heart strings of nostalgia," said David La Torre, who ran Penn State's public relations during the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. "Their parallel strategies make sense, given what's at stake for Mr. Cosby. He's fighting for their personal and professional lives."
On Tuesday, as jury deliberations stretched into a second day without signs of a verdict, Wyatt steered reporters to a former colleague of accuser Andrea Constand who said Constand had once suggested they would try to set up a famous man to get money. The judge had barred their hearsay testimony from the trial, but Wyatt made sure their statement got out.
Constand alleges Cosby gave them three sedatives they claimed were an herbal remedy and then groped their breast and genitals while they were paralyzed and unable to fight them off. Cosby said they were in a romantic relationship with the young staffer on the women's basketball team at their alma mater, Temple University, and that the encounter was consensual.
"If he's found guilty, their estate would likely take an enormous financial hit that would devastate their family. That's why their approach makes practical sense, even if it makes some feel uncomfortable," La Torre said.
Jurors appeared tired and spent when they decided to call it quits late Tuesday after about 16 hours of deliberations. They'll resume Wednesday morning.
The judge praised them for being remarkably conscientious as they consider three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault that could put Cosby in prison for the rest of their life.
The jury's day began Tuesday by reviewing more than a dozen passages from Cosby's decade-old deposition, including theirs telling Constand the pills were "three friends" to make them relax.
Cosby left the courthouse on Wyatt's arm Tuesday night, shouting the "Fat Albert" catchphrase, "Hey, hey, hey" and giving a thumbs-up as they got in their SUV. They didn't comment to reporters.
The AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A former professional BMX rider from who set a world record for the longest power-assisted bicycle backflip has died.
The wife of Rhode Island native Kevin "K-Rob" Robinson tells The Providence Journal their husband suffered an apparent stroke Saturday. They were 45.
Robin Adams Robinson says the death was unexpected.
Kevin Robinson earned gold medals in the X Games and retired from competition in 2013.
They jumped 84 feet in Providence last year, setting a world record.
The East Providence native created the nonprofit K-Rob Foundation to improve children's lives in their hometown and surrounding communities. They built East Providence's first free public skate park.
Robinson visited schools to talk about perseverance and created a protective clothing line for children.
They lived in Barrington with their wife and three children.

The time is finally here! It is time for Fall fishing on the ponds, that usually means for many fishing for smallies or largemouth, or one of my favorites, trout. Trout are an aggressive fish that a lot of people like to eat and a lot of people like to catch.
Trout are a very common fish to catch. They tend to stay close to each other or in small groups. A very good technique for catching trout is to troll the edges of the pond. To troll the pond we usually use bright colored spinners or swim baits. When you are trolling the pond and you come up on a big pod of fish one of my favorite, and very efficient, ways to catch them is to cast at them. Also if you are really cold one of my many tips to you is to stay out of the wind and use the trees as a buffer.
There are other ways to catch these beautiful fish too if you don't have a boat, some of the other ways to catch these fish is to use powerbait. Another way to efficiently catch Trout is to use live shiners on a bobber, you can also use worms in the same way. Also you can cast on the deep drop offs on the beach with a swimbait or some kind of hard plastic.
Some great places to catch trout that are stocked are Ashumet Pond, Peters Pond, and Mashpee Wakeby
I hope you all have a great time out there catching a whole lot of Trout and make sure you dress warm and wear layers
Braeden Smaykiewicz is a 13-year-old avid fisherman. They began fishing at 4-years old and has experience catching everything from fresh water species to saltwater, inshore to offshore.
But few critics predicted it would transform the Mexican diet and food ecosystem to increasingly mirror those of the United States. In 1980, 7 percent of Mexicans were obese, a figure that tripled to 20.3 percent by 2016, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Diabetes is now Mexico's top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.
For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real “the fever dreams of joining the modern economy,” said Timothy A. Wise, a trade expert at the Small Planet Institute and Tufts University. “All former rural workers would be in new jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing industries of the post-Nafta world. That just hasn't happened.”
“The only way that Mexico became a ‘first world' country was in terms of diet.”
The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Research shows free trade is among the key factors that have accelerated the spread of low-nutrient, highly processed foods from the west, “driving the obesity epidemic in China, India, and other developing countries worldwide,” according to the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.
But Jaime Zabludovsky Kuper, Mexico's deputy chief negotiator on the pact, said Nafta didn't cause obesity. Instead, they said, it lowered food prices and reduced malnutrition. In 2012, 1.6 percent of Mexican children suffered from severe malnutrition, a sharp drop from 6.2 percent in 1988, according to government data.
Mr. Kuper said that Mexicans had long been enticed by American food, and that high tariffs used to make it expensive, not unavailable. The economy is now more stable, they said, and Mexicans are living longer — which is partly why more people are dying from noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease. “It's a symptom of relative prosperity,” they said.
The broader pros and cons of Nafta have come under increasing scrutiny given President Trump's threats to dismantle it. Among its chief champions are American farm and food-retailing interests whose fortunes have benefited tremendously from the open market. Mexican exports to the United States have surged, and a more stable economic structure has evolved in Mexico. The country's unemployment rate has stayed mostly constant, but average wages have fallen to $15,311 in 2016 from $16,008 in 1994, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico's largely isolated economy.

In addition to dramatically lowering cross-border tariffs, Nafta let billions of dollars in direct foreign investment into Mexico, fueled the growth of American fast food restaurants and convenience stores, and opened the floodgates to cheap corn, meat, high-fructose corn syrup and processed foods.

BOSTON (AP) — Dave Dombrowski wanted to make sure they and Alex Cora were on the same page, so the Red Sox boss sent off an email for their new manager's approval.
The response: A thumbs-up emoji.
Tony La Russa and Jim Leyland never did that.
"He's a good emoji texter," Dombrowski said with a laugh this month as the team turned its thoughts toward spring training. "He's very good with the thumbs-up. My children, they help me out at times."
A native of Puerto Rico, Cora is already a pioneer as the first minority manager in the history of a franchise that was the last to field a black player. But he's also a new kind of Red Sox dugout boss: One of the youngest managers in franchise history, giving them a unique chance to connect with their players.
"He's not too far removed from actually playing the game. He's played — actually, personally — with some of my teammates now," Boston outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said. "I think it's going to be a great combination of old school and new school. He's learned from the past, and he's going to be able to put their own twist on things."
Still just 42 and in their first major league managerial job, Cora is no newbie.
Their shaved head shows the stubble of a receded hairline, with some gray around the temples picked up during a 14-year career spent with six big-league teams. As a member of the Red Sox from 2005-08, they were a part of the franchise's 2007 World Series title and was teammates with current second baseman Dustin Pedroia. (He also overlapped with first baseman Mitch Moreland for about five days with the Rangers in 2010.)
It's this that made them an intriguing choice to replace John Farrell, who was fired last fall at the age of 55 despite leading Boston to the first back-to-back AL East titles in franchise history. Farrell's predecessor, Bobby Valentine, was 62 for their lone season in Boston; you'd have to go back to Kevin Kennedy, who was 41 when they were hired in 1995, to find a younger Red Sox skipper.
"I'm 42. I'm young," Cora said at the team's Christmas festival in December. "You'll see me around with my backpack and sneakers and jeans. I'm going to live my life. ... Nothing has changed. I went home and (it was) shorts, sandals and a T-shirt."
Speaking to reporters before the awards dinner for the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America this month, Cora seemed completely at home in a knit hoodie and low-top Converse All-Stars. They mingled cheerfully with their players, then looked equally at home at the dinner in a sport coat and tie.
"He has the ability to communicate with the younger players, just the ability to talk to them," said Dombrowski, who was the youngest general manager in the game when they took over the Montreal Expos at the age of 31 — three decades ago.
"He has that respect," Dombrowski said. "He knows how to handle them. He's been in the game a long time, and he's done everything in the game."
Cora has been retired as a player less than six years, after failing to make the St. Louis Cardinals in spring training in 2012. They remained in the game, working as an analyst for ESPN, and spending two years managing their hometown team, Caguas, in the Puerto Rican winter league. They have also served as the club's general manager for five years.
In winter ball, Cora said, "For some reason, I wasn't the manager I wanted to be. I was very serious, very strict with the guys. I don't think they had fun with me, and I didn't have fun myself.
"I promised myself," they said, "when the opportunity came, I was going to enjoy it."
As a bench coach for the Houston Astros last season, Cora was reminded how much fun baseball — especially winning baseball — can be. While the franchise was on the way to its first World Series title, Cora interviewed for and landed the Red Sox job.
"We play a sport that a lot of people feel is a grind. I was one of them when I played," they said. "But last year I went through it, and it was fun. It wasn't a grind. It's a good atmosphere to work. That starts from the inside out."
But it can't all be fun and friendships.
Though not as young as Cora when they were on the Boston bench, Terry Francona prized their ability to communicate with their players and manage the clubhouse personalities as well as the game. They won two World Series with the Red Sox — including the cathartic 2004 title with the fun-loving "idiots" like Johnny Damon, Kevin Millar and "Manny being Manny."
But the nature of the team had changed by 2011, with high-priced free agents retreating to the clubhouse during games for fried chicken and beer. Francona lost their team — and, after an unprecedented September collapse, their job.
"Obviously, there's a line. They need to understand that I'm the manager, they're players," Cora said. "But at the end of the day, we're human beings. During the day, there's probably more conversations about life than baseball. ... To connect with players is very important."
Dombrowski has hired their share of old-timers, like Buck Rodgers and Leyland (twice). They brought La Russa, a Hall of Fame manager, in as a special assistant, and Ron Roenicke, who has 27 years of coaching experience, in as a bench coach.
Dombrowski expects their experience to balance out Cora's youth.
"You can be young and not be communicative," they said. "But I think in Alex's case he's a very good communicator. There are only pluses."
And if Cora gives the players some slack, outfielder Andrew Benintendi said, they won't regret it.
"I think we all hold ourselves accountable and know when it's time to buckle down," said Benintendi, who is 23 and coming off a season in which they placed second in the AL rookie of the year voting. "Obviously, he's the manager. They make the call. But I think he'll still keep it light, keep it fun."
Less than a month before spring training, Cora was still figuring out what they would say to their new team and how the clubhouse would be run. But there's one rule they plan to drop on their players: Don't call them "Skip" — Alex or A.C. would be better.
That doesn't mean he's not flexible.
Since becoming a bench coach with the Astros, Cora has replaced the usual fortysomething music on their phone with songs their players might be listening to.
"Just to connect is the thing," Cora said, "so that I'm speaking the same language as them."
Air Pollution May Boost Risk of Dementia
Air pollution may cause about 21 percent of cases of dementia worldwide, including Alzheimer's disease, if a study of older women can be extended to the general population.
Women aged 65 to 79 are 81 percent more at risk for general cognitive decline and 92 percent more likely to develop dementia if they live where fine particle matter exceeds the U.S. Environmental Agency's standards, according to the study, led by University of Southern California scientists.
The study didn't examine whether inhaling these particles also puts men at elevated risk.
These extremely small particles are just 2.5 millionths of a meter or smaller. They mainly come from power plants and automobiles and have long been a significant health concern. They escape the body's defenses more easily than larger particles, said Robert Kard, director of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District. And when they lodge in the body, they tend to stay there.
Natural gas plants produce very low levels of these particles, known as PM2.5, Kard said. Oil-burning plants produce considerably more of them.
The study examined 3,647 women aged 65 to 79 in 48 states. It was adjusted for biases such as ethnic background, education and medical conditions.
The correlation is consistent with an observation others have made, the researchers said: Reducing air pollution coincides with a lower rate of dementia per age group in recent years. (Because the elderly population keeps growing, the total number of cases is expected to keep increasing.)
Researchers also found a plausible cause in an experiment on female mice exposed to these particles. These mice have a variant of a gene called APOE4, known to be an Alzheimer's risk factor. Compared to a control group, they accumulated as much as 60 percent more beta amyloid plaque, the toxic clusters of protein fragments that further the progression of Alzheimer's.
"Cells in the brain treat these particles as invaders and react with inflammatory responses, which over the course of time, appear to exacerbate and promote Alzheimer's disease," said Caleb Finch, a study author, in a USC statement.
The study was published Tuesday in the journal Translational Psychiatry. Finch and Jiu-Chiuan Chen are co-senior authors. The study can be found at j.mp/poldem.
Two thirds of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias are women, said Mary Ball, president and CEO of Alzheimer's San Diego.
And while Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death nationwide, it's the third leading cause of death in San Diego County, Ball said. That is probably due in part to the county's commitment to accurate reporting on cases, and secondly to having a older-skewing population. Age is the main risk factor for developing Alzheimer's.
Air pollution doesn't appear to be a factor in elevating risk locally. San Diego County is well within the limit for these PM2.5 particles, said Kard, of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District. That limit is 35 micrograms per cubic meter.
According to data supplied by the district, during 2016 the level never reached 20 micrograms per cubic meter, and levels very rarely exceeded the federal limit in records going back to 1999.
The levels were greatly exceeded during the 2003 and 2007 wildfires, but since the agency had no control over those events, it doesn't count against the limit.
Huaxi Xu, a top Alzheimer's researcher at Sanford Burnham Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, said the study provides important evidence advancing understanding of air pollution as a risk factor for these diseases.
"Since particles of this size are found in polluted air, the findings confirm recent evidence linking environmental factors, such as automotive-derived air pollution, to higher levels of dementia among people living near heavy traffic roads," Xu said. They cited one new study, published Jan. 5 in The Lancet, as evidence.
"However, as it is often the case, the study leaves a number of unanswered questions that are worth pursuing," Xu said.
These include the cellular and molecular causes of degeneration of a specific region of the brain called the hippocampus, how efficiently beta amyloid is cleared from the brain and whether changes in the brain's blood vessels contribute to dementia.
Xu also said followup studies should look at other potential effects of air pollution on the brain, such as the involvement of other genes or sex-dependent factors.

Michael Essien, Cole caught without Indonesia work permits
Michael Essien and Carlton Cole are facing problems in Indonesia after their new club admitted it had not obtained work permits for the ex-English Premier League players.
The two were signed with great fanfare last month by Persib Bandung, one of the country's best clubs, in a boost for Indonesian football as it seeks to bounce back from a FIFA suspension and launch a new league.
But the club is now set to be questioned by immigration authorities after the government-backed Professional Sports Agency found the players did not have the required work permits.
The club admitted Monday the players, who made their debuts in the country's new top-flight Liga 1 at the weekend, did not yet have the necessary documents.
Persib said it had sought to process the paperwork a few days before their first match. The permits were not ready on time, but the football association and league organiser gave them permission to play.
Manager Umuh Muchtar accused the sports agency, which reports to the government and monitors foreign players in the country, of going too far.
“That they are here is a joy for us, they want to raise up Indonesia's name in the world,” they said.
They added: “Everybody knows that Essien is a world-class player, not an illegal immigrant.”
Immigration authorities Monday summoned the club management but it was not clear when the questioning would take place.
Immigration official Agustianur, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said: “They are professionals so they must hold a (work) permit to perform activities in Indonesia.”
The official did not indicate what next steps authorities may take.
Essien, who is Ghanaian, has played for Chelsea, AC Milan and Real Madrid. England's Cole has played for Chelsea and West Ham.
Liga 1 replaces an old top-level league, which was halted in 2015 due to a row between the government and Indonesian FA that triggered turmoil and led to the country being hit with a one-year ban by FIFA.
The new league and big-name signings are a major boost for football in Southeast Asia's biggest nation, which has faced problems for years.

Thylacine DNA Reveals Secrets and Hidden Weakness
The first full genetic blueprint of the long-extinct thylacine has revealed the animal suffered from genetic weakness well before it was isolated on Tasmania 10,000 to 13,000 years ago.
An international team of researchers led by associate professor Andrew Pask from the University of Melbourne used DNA from the 106-year-old preserved remains of a juvenile thylacine or Tasmanian tiger to sequence the animal's genome, making it one of the most complete genetic blueprints for an extinct species.
Their findings, published in the journal Nature, provide new information on the biology of the unique marsupial and reveal that the population was in danger long before it came in contact with humans.
"We've always known that the Tasmanian tiger did not have much genetic diversity, so it would be more susceptible to diseases," they said.
"It's very much like the Tasmanian devil in that respect and we've always thought that happened once it became isolated on Tasmania between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago.
"But what we found is that the population declined about 70,000 years ago, long before it was isolated meaning it probably had more to do with changes in the climate back then."
While overhunting was "without doubt" responsible for the animal's extinction in 1936, Pask said its genetic weakness would have made it more susceptible to disease had it survived.
They said that while researchers were still a long way from bringing the animal back from extinction it was a "major hurdle" cleared. The information could help efforts to protect the Tasmanian devil because researchers could use it to infer what a healthy marsupial's genome should look like.
The researchers also found that despite its similarities to the Australian dingo, the thylacine's DNA actually has more in common with the kangaroo.
Scientists consider the thylacine and the dingo as one of the best examples of what's known as "convergent evolution," the process where organisms that are not closely related independently evolve to look the same as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches.
Because of their hunting technique and diet of fresh meat, their skulls and body shape became similar despite the Tasmanian tiger's DNA having more in common with a kangaroo.
Pask said the genome showed the Tasmanian tiger was an "unbelievable" example of convergent evolution, because it proved how distant the two species were.
Related: Life in the old bird yet: study of dodo bones yields new biological insights
"Their similarities are absolutely astounding because they haven't shared a common ancestor since the Jurassic period, 160m years ago," they said.
"The appearance of the thylacine is almost a dingo with a pouch. And when we looked at the basis for this convergent evolution, we found that it wasn't actually the genes themselves that produced the same skull and body shape, but the control regions around them that turn genes 'on and off' at different stages of growth.
"This reveals a whole new understanding of the process of evolution, we can now explore these regions of the genome to help understand how two species converge on the same appearance, and how the process of evolution works."

W'Bank: Infrastructural Devt in Lagos Impacting Positively on Residents
As Lagos recruits 27,500 sanitation workers
Abimbola Akosile and Shola Oyeyipo
The Word Bank has commended the massive infrastructural development ongoing across Lagos State under the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration, noting that such projects were impacting positively on the lives of Lagosians.
Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank, Mr. Joaquim Vieira Levy noted this when they paid a courtesy visit to the State Deputy Governor, Dr. Mrs. Idiat Oluranti Adebule at the Round House, Alausa Secretariat, recently.
Levy during the visit assured that the State's urban renewal and infrastructure development projects would continue to receive more boost from the World Bank to assist the government deliver more on key infrastructural.
The World Bank Chief, who was accompanied on the visit by other top officials of the global financial institution, said they decided to pick Lagos State as its pilot state for its sustainable development assistance scheme because Lagos was leading in providing good governance and infrastructures that have direct positive impact on its citizenry.
They noted that most developed countries of the world have been able to move their economy forward because of the adoption of the Public/Private sector integration model which according to them would further accelerate the growth rate of development in the state if adopted.
They alluded to the fact that Lagos over the years has been blessed with leaders with good vision and good aspirations for development, in a release issued by Odusina Akeem of the Public Affairs Unit of the office of the Deputy Governor.
Levy said previous partnership of the organisation with the State Government in transportation, education, environmental management and flood control had been of great benefit to the urban renewal efforts of the state government, adding that the organisation would continue to assist the state government to scale up its infrastructural development a project so as to be able to meet the aspirations of its teeming population.
In their remarks, the Deputy Governor, who received the visitors on behalf of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode commended the World Bank for its support and partnership, noting that their efforts had helped the State Government to achieve its transformational policies especially in efficient flood control, transportation and the Eko Education Project initiative.
“We will continue to treasure this partnership and supports which have helped us to deliver on good transportation through LAMATA, our modern agricultural system, Sports development, Eko Projects and general infrastructural development programmes and many more that have helped our policy implementation” Adebule said.
The Deputy Governor, who was elated at the visit, said as the State's Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) was increasing yearly, residents deserve better governance in terms of scaling up infrastructure provision.
They urged the apex Bank to consider energy development, efficient potable water supply, water transportation, road construction and education as some of the key areas the state government would need urgent support and partnership to further bring democratic dividends to the people.
They expressed concerns over the current global economic meltdown, and appealed to the visiting World Bank Executives to help the country with more friendly policies that could help to regulate the high exchange rate in the country so as to increase the purchasing power of the average Nigerian and reduce inflation.
The highlight of the visit which had top government functionaries in attendance was the presentation of souvenirs of the Lagos State government to the World Bank visiting Executives.
Meanwhile, thousands of Lagosians are already applying to be employed as Community Sanitation Workers (CSW) under the ongoing recruitment exercise by the Lagos State government.
The three-day exercise being carried out by the Cleaner Lagos Initiative had already attracted thousands of applications from interested workers.
Speaking on behalf of the Initiative at the Agege venue of the ongoing recruitment exercise, Mr. Ibrahim Fearon said those being employed are not just street sweepers but are employees of the state government.
“There is a career part to it. We want to put some dignity into it.‎ They don't only get tax free monthly pay, they are pensionable. They also get accident insurance and to avoid spending money on transportation”, they said.
Explaining that the Cleaner Lagos Initiative is about improving the whole of Lagos to make the environment cleaner‎, Fearon added that those employed would also enjoy life insurance and health insurance.
One of the applicants, Mary Emmanuel, a BSc Mathematics ‎graduate from Ekiti State University who said they filled the form online, said “With the initiative, it is expected that Lagos will be cleaner because it will bring effectiveness to cleaning”.
