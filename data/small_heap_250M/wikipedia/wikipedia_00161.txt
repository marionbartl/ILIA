Dudley B. Perkins (May 19, 1893 - February 26, 1978
) was an American champion motorcycle hillclimb competitor and Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealer. The American Motorcyclist Association's highest award, the AMA Dud Perkins Lifetime Achievement Award, was named after him in 1970, and he was its first recipient.
Early years
Perkins was born in Kern, California, now a part of Bakersfield, California. He began riding motorcycles in 1907 when attending school in Los Angeles. A neighbor offered to let him ride his Reading-Standard motorcycle, and Perkins was "quite thrilled."
Beginning of motorcycle career
After his family moved to Stockton, California, Perkins began working part-time for an Indian motorcycle dealer while still a student. He first competed on May 10, 1911, winning a one-mile race. After his step-mother died, Perkins went to live with his grandmother in Rocklin, California, where he rode an Excelsior motorcycle. Later, he moved to live with his father in San Francisco, and began hanging around at the local Indian dealership, later working there. He continued racing his Excelsior with success.
Harley-Davidson dealer
In 1913, Perkins entered into a partnership with Al Maggini, then a San Francisco dealer for DeLuxe motorcycles. In January, 1914, Perkins acquired sole control of the business, which was renamed the Dudley Perkins Company, and began selling Harley-Davidsons. He said that he sold 125 motorcycles in his first year in business.
During World War I, all of Harley-Davidson's production was furnished to the U.S. military, so the Dudley Perkins Company survived by buying, refurbishing and reselling used motorcycles. At the beginning of the Depression, Perkins reported that the company was able to sell only 15 motorcycles in 1930, but business improved as the years went along. When the California Highway Patrol formed its motorcycle unit in the 1930s, the Dudley Perkins Company sold them the equipment, and Perkins helped train its officers. At the end of World War II, the company thrived by buying military surplus Harley-Davidsons, repainting them, and selling them to the civilian market. His company purchased those bikes for $125.00 each and sold them for $325.00 each.
Perkins continued to support motorcycle racers including Mert Lawwill and Mark Brelsford who both went on to win the AMA Grand National Championship. He managed his dealership until 1968, when he turned control of the business over to his son, Dudley Perkins, Jr., who had been involved with the business since the end of his military service in World War II.
Motorcycle hillclimbing
Perkins began competing in motorcycle hillclimb events in 1915, and always rode Harley-Davidsons. He won the Gilroy Hillclimb in 1917.
He won the Capistrano Hillclimb in 1920 and 1921, which was a very popular event of that era, attracting as many as 20,000 fans.
Perkins won 12 California Hillclimb championships starting in 1915. He competed until 1943, when he was 50. Perkins was considered one of the top hillclimbers of the era and was described as one of the "classiest performers."
American Motorcycle Association leader
By the early 1930s, Perkins was already considered "one of the veterans of the sport of motorcycle racing". He was invited to serve on the Competition Committee of the American Motorcycle Association, now known as the American Motorcyclist Association. He was the longest-serving member of that committee. He represented the AMA in negotiations with various city officials regarding motorcycle rallies in the late 1930s, emphasizing the economic benefits to communities that agreed to sponsor such events.
In 1948, he spoke out on behalf of the American Motorcycle Association against outlaw motorcyclists who had created disturbances such as the Hollister riot and a similar event in Riverside, California.
Legacy
At the time of his death, Perkins "was considered the grandest of the grand old men of motorcycling." He was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998.
The Harley-Davidson dealership he founded, the Dudley Perkins Company, is still in business under the name San Francisco Harley-Davidson, with its main facilities located in South San Francisco, California, and a branch on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. The company celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014.

Jason Guerriero is an American ice hockey coach and former defenseman who was an All-American for Northeastern.
Career
Guerriero was a star player in juniors, leading the NAHL in scoring in 2001 and leading the Texas Tornado to a league championship. He began attending Northeastern University the following autumn and immediately became a major piece of the team's offense. Unfortunately, during his four-year tenure, the Huskies were never a top team. For his senior season Guerriero was named team captain and was named an All-American. Once the team's season was over, Guerriero signed with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers and finished the year in the AHL.
For his first full season as a professional, Guerriero played in Finland but returned to the AHL the following year. He spent most of the next two years playing for the Milwaukee Admirals, producing modest numbers. He returned to Europe in 2008 and split time between two teams. With the second, Alba Volán Székesfehérvár, he helped the team win the Hungarian championship. The next season he tied for the scoring lead for the Schwenninger Wild Wings and led the team to a regular season championship. Guerriero played one further season in Denmark before hanging up his skates.
In 2011, Guerriero began his coaching career as an assistant for Holy Cross. After two years, he took a similar position with Yale and then joined Brown two years afterwards. He stuck with the Bears and was promoted to Associate head coach in 2019.

The Florence Plantation was a former cotton plantation and is a historic site, located in the community of Harwood in Chicot County, Arkansas.
History
On December 8, 1870, John C. Calhoun II and Lennie (Linnie) Adams married. He was the grandson of U.S. Vice President John C. Calhoun and brother of Patrick Calhoun. Lennie Adams, was the daughter of Betsy Johnson of the Lakeport Plantation. With this marriage, Lennie Adams inherited the Florence Plantation, a 3,600-acre plantation (with 200 acres in cultivation). Lennie Adams maintained legal ownership of the property for approximately the next 8 years.
Prior to 1870, John C. Calhoun II had been an American Civil War veteran serving in the Confederate States Army and he had been in an active partnership in 1866 with James R. Powell (of Montgomery, Alabama) in order to, "colonize Negros in the Yazoo Valley, Mississippi to work on plantation lands on a cooperative basis." This labor model proved profitable for Calhoun, and by the time he moved to Arkansas he was ready to scale this labor model to a larger size.
The Florence Plantation came with 20 Black laborers, and Calhoun brought 150 Black laborers, many of which were once enslaved on his family plantations in Alabama and had acquired past debts. By 1883, there were 260 Black laborers and 1600 acres in cultivation. According to journalist Frank Wilkeson in 1883, Calhoun made sure the workers were not in current debt, and earning enough to live in relative comfort.
By 1881, the family was acquiring large tracts of land to add to the site. Calhoun purchased many nearby plantations to add to their collection. To help in the purchase of these properties, Calhoun created a few businesses including one named the Florence Planting Company.
In 1915, the plantation was listed for sale by the heirs of Joseph P. Alexander and advertised as "a baronial estate at the price of a farm", with "5,000 acres, 34 good mules, residence and 40 tenant houses."
In 1953, Jack Vaughan sued Carneal Warfield over the ownership of the plantation.

John Birchard Rice (June 23, 1832 – January 14, 1893) was an American medical doctor and politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Ohio for one term from 1881 to 1883.
Biography
Born in Fremont, Ohio, Rice attended the common schools of Lower Sandusky (now Fremont) and Oberlin College, Ohio. He graduated from the medical department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1857. He took a post-graduate course at Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and at Bellevue Hospital, New York City in 1859. He was a lecturer on military surgery and obstetrics in the Charity Hospital Medical College and the medical department of the University of Wooster in Cleveland, Ohio.
Rice served on the medical staff during the Civil War as assistant surgeon of the Tenth and then as surgeon of the Seventy-second regiments of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He was also surgeon in chief of a division in the Fifteenth Army Corps and of the District of Memphis.
After the war, he was appointed a trustee of the state hospital in Toledo, Ohio. He served as member of the Board of Health of Fremont, Ohio.
Congress
Rice was elected as a Republican to the Forty-seventh Congress (March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1883). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1882. He engaged in the practice of medicine in Fremont. He died in Fremont, and was interred in Oakwood Cemetery. He died from Bright's disease.
Family
Rice was the second son of Dr. Robert Stuart Rice and Eliza Ann (Caldwell) Rice. He was married to Sarah Wilson on December 12, 1861. They had two children named Lizzie, born 1865, and Wilson, born 1875.

Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a species in the fungal genus Trichophyton. It is one of three common fungi which cause ringworm in companion animals. It is also the second-most commonly isolated fungus causing tinea infections in humans, and the most common or one of the most common fungi that cause zoonotic skin disease (i.e., transmission of mycotic skin disease from species to species). Trichophyton mentagrophytes is being frequently isolated from dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs and other rodents, though at least some genetic variants possess the potential of human-to-human transmission, e.g. Type VII and Type VIII. Particular genetic variants of the fungus have distinct geographic ranges.
Drug resistance
In T. mentagrophytes, antifungal drug resistance is mainly associated with Type VIII isolates. Drug-resistant T. mentagrophytes strains have been found in many places across Asia and Europe. India is the most affected country, with the rate of microbiological resistance to terbinafine estimated at 11.4%. There are also reports on terbinafine-resistant Type II isolates from Japan and Denmark.
Molecular strain typing
For studies on the epidemiology of T. mentagrophytes, two molecular strain typing techniques are available. The first one is based upon amplification of nontranscribed spacer of ribosomal DNA, and the second one involves a comparison of internal transcribed spacer sequences within defined boundaries.
Nomenclature
Along with closely related T. interdigitale, the species has been traditionally treated as a part of polyphyletic assemblage, named "T. mentagrophytes sensu lato". From 1999 to 2017 the two species have been collectively referred to as T. interdigitale, while the name "T. mentagrophytes" has been used for current T. quinckeanum. Trichophyton interdigitale seems to be strictly anthropophilic, and is associated with foot and nail infections.
Mating and meiosis
Trichophyton mentagrophytes is capable of mating. This species is also able to undergo meiosis. The haploid chromosome complement of T. mentagrophytes is four. The fusion of haploid nuclei (karyogamy) preceding meiosis occurs in the penultimate cell of a typical crozier, an anatomical feature of the sexual phase of many fungi in the Division Ascomycota.

Laurier Brantford is Wilfrid Laurier University's second campus located in Brantford, Ontario. The first and original campus of Wilfrid Laurier University is located in Waterloo, Ontario. Laurier follows a 'multicampus' structure, as it is one university with multiple campuses.
Laurier Brantford opened its doors in 1999 with a total of only 39 students in its inaugural year. By January 2015, there were 2,625 full-time students, and an unstated number of part-time students. At that time, some reduction was expected for the 2015/2016 year because Nipissing University would not be accepting new students to the joint concurrent (BA/BEd) education program with Laurier in September 2015. By the time of the 2017/2018 year, Laurier estimated a total of over 3,000 students at the Brantford campus.
In June 2017, the university graduated its 5,000th student from the Brantford campus.
Locations
Laurier's main building is the Carnegie building on George Street. The campus has since expanded and has several academic and residence buildings. Research and Academic Centre, Wilfrid Laurier Student's Union, Grand River Hall, Lucy Marco Place, Post House, Wilkes House, the Laurier Brantford YMCA, One Market, the Odeon building and the Carnegie Building are all properties of Laurier Brantford and are used as academic theaters, residences, book store and a gym facility.
Residences
As of the 2016-2017 academic year, Laurier Brantford had six residence communities: Lawyer's Hall, Expositor Building, Grand River Hall, Post House, Wilkes House and Lucy Marco Place. All residences are apartment-style; 80% of bedrooms are singles.
Curriculum
Laurier Brantford's curriculum is offered by two faculties. The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences includes courses in Criminology, Game Design and Development, Health Studies, Leadership, Policing and Psychology. The Faculty of Liberal Arts houses Society, Culture and Environment (formerly Contemporary Studies), Digital Media and Journalism, History, English, Youth and Children's Studies, Foundations, Human Rights and Human Diversity, Indigenous Studies, Languages at Brantford and Law and Society programs.
Another program, Foundations, administered jointly by the two faculties, provides a curriculum that introduces students to common themes in social sciences and humanities research and lays the foundation for building necessary critical thinking and communication skills for university success. To graduate from this program, students must complete Modernity and the Contemporary World, Modernity: Critique and Resistance, Academic Literacy: Social Sciences and Academic Literacy: Humanities.
According to Maclean's, Laurier's "Standout Programs" in 2017-2018 included Game Design and Development at the Brantford campus. "The program develops skills not only in game design, project management and entrepreneurship, but also considers how transformative games are used in areas such as education, corporate training, health care and more."
Laurier Brantford offers Honours Bachelors programs (2015/2016) in Community Health, Criminology, English, Health Administration, History, Human Rights & Human Diversity, Law & Society, Society, Culture & Environment, Youth & Children's Studies, Digital Media & Journalism, Game Design & Development, Public Health, Psychology, Business Technology Management, Policing and Social Work. Students can pursue a number of combination Honours degrees.
A September 2017 report indicated that the Brantford campus offered several recently added programs, including:
LLB (University of Sussex) and BA (Laurier) in either Criminology, Law & Society, or Human Rights & Human Diversity; six-year program
Bachelor of Fine and Applied Arts in Game Design & Development
Bachelor of Arts in Indigenous Studies (must be combined with another major)
Bachelor of Arts in Policing (must be combined with another major)
Bachelor of Design in User Experience Design
Bachelor of Arts in Labour Studies & Career Development
Other programs available at the time included Bachelor of Business Technology Management; Bachelor of Arts in community health; criminology; digital media & journalism; English; health administration; history; human rights & human diversity; law & society; psychology; social & environmental justice; youth & children's studies; Bachelor of Arts and Science in public health and Bachelor of Social Work.
Laurier/Nipissing programme
For some years, Laurier students could take a concurrent BA/BEd (five year) program with Nipissing University Brantford. On November 16, 2014, Nipissing announced that it would wind down its operations in the city in the wake of changes to funding for education programs. As of November 10, 2015, there were 622 such Laurier/Nipissing students. No new students were admitted for the 2015–16 academic year and the partnership will officially end once the last cohort of current students completes the program in 2019.
Students who had started in the programme in 2014/2015 or earlier were able to complete the program, but no new students were accepted since the programme was winding down.
Because of that change, Laurier Brantford was expecting about 125 fewer students to be on campus in September 2015.
In spite of that reduction, the university was anticipating long-term growth in that city. "... Laurier's plans for growth are supported by its partnership with Conestoga College and significant investments in infrastructure that will continue to make Brantford an important destination for post-secondary education students," according to Brian Rosborough, senior executive officer, Brantford Campus. That optimism was warranted since by the June 1, 2015 deadline for confirmations the number of applicants who had accepted an offer of admission for first-year study in 2015–2016 at Laurier Brantford rose by 24.1 per cent (or by 611 students) over the previous year.
Library
A significant challenge faced by any university starting a new campus location is to create a new library that is as useful as the one on their main campus. That can take many years, especially when the enrolment at the new campus is still quite low. Laurier Brantford has yet to meet that goal but it has established a partnership with the public library, which houses about 10,000 volumes in the Laurier collection and is open seven days a week (except on statutory holidays).
The library also provides access to a system that contains the combined catalogues of the universities of Laurier, Guelph and Waterloo that are accessible to both students and the public. The materials are sent electronically or by deliveries made regularly to the library.
The university also opened a "digital learning commons" in Grand River Hall in early 2014. The university's two librarians moved there from their previous office in the neighbouring Brantford Public Library. However, no current plan has been announced for the creation of a dedicated library, exclusively for Laurier students in Brantford.

Edward Burtenshaw Sugden, 1st Baron Saint Leonards, (12 February 178129 January 1875) was a British lawyer, judge and Conservative politician.
Background
Sugden was the son of a high-class hairdresser and wig-maker in Westminster, London. Details of his education are said to be "obscure". It appears that he was mostly self-taught, although he also attended a private school.
His humble origins and rapid rise were frequently remarked upon by his contemporaries: when he first attempted to enter Parliament, he was heckled at hustings for being the son of a barber. Later, Thomas Fowell Buxton would write that "there are few instances in modern times of a rise equal to that of Sir Edward Sugden".
Legal and political career
After practising for some years as a conveyancer, Sugden was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1807, having already published his well-known Concise and Practical Treatise on the Law of Vendors and Purchasers of Estates. In 1822 he was made King's Counsel. He was returned at different times for various boroughs to the House of Commons, where he made himself prominent by his opposition to the Reform Bill of 1832. He was appointed Solicitor General in 1829, receiving the customary knighthood. As Solicitor-General he took a narrow view of Jewish emancipation, arguing that "They had possessed nothing; they held nothing. They had no civil rights; they never had any."
In 1834–5 Sugden was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in Peel's first ministry, and was sworn of the Privy Council on 15 December 1834. Sugden was again the Irish Lord Chancellor in Peel's second ministry, serving from 1841 to 1846. In 1849, Sugden published A Treatise on the Law of Property as administered in the House of Lords, in which he criticised the decisions given in the House of Lords when acting as a Court of Appeal. In Lord Derby's first government in 1852 he became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and was raised to the peerage as Baron Saint Leonards, of Slaugham in the County of Sussex. In this position he devoted himself with energy and vigour to the reform of the law (note his important dissenting opinion in Jorden v Money (1854) 5 HL Cas 185); Lord Derby on his return to power in 1858 again offered him the same office, which from considerations of health he declined. He continued, however, to take an active interest especially in the legal matters that came before the House of Lords, and bestowed his particular attention on the reform of the law of property. He championed the fulfilment of the will of J. M. W. Turner with regard to his art bequests in 1857–70.
Publications
Lord Saint Leonards was the author of various important legal publications, many of which have passed through several editions. Besides the treatise on purchasers already mentioned, they include Powers, Cases decided by the House of Lords, Gilbert on Uses, New Real Property Laws and Handybook of Property Law, Misrepresentations in Campbells Lives of Lyndhurst and Brougham, corrected by St Leonards.
Family
Lord Saint Leonards married Winifred, daughter of John Knapp, in 1808. She died in May 1861, Lord Saint Leonards died at Boyle Farm, Thames Ditton, in January 1875, aged 93, and was succeeded in the barony by his grandson, Edward.
Inheritance dispute
After his death his will was missing but his daughter, Charlotte Sugden, was able to recollect the contents of a most intricate document, and in the action of Sugden v. Lord Saint Leonards (L.R. 1 P.D. 154) the Court of Chancery accepted her evidence and granted probate, admitting into the probate a paper propounded as containing the provisions of the lost will. This decision established the proposition that the contents of a lost will, that can be proven to have existed, may be proved by secondary evidence, even of a single witness. Charlotte Sugden submitted sworn testimony that Lord Saint Leonards was in the habit of reading his will every night, such that his daughter had to listen to it and over some years memorised it. This decision became a well known fact and narrow precedent in legal circles, departing from provisions of the Wills Act 1837 which remained the principal legislation governing an area shaped by equity and later by common law.

In Parts Assembled Solely is the fourth EP by Spahn Ranch, released on May 21, 1996 by Cleopatra Records. It comprises six remixes and four live versions of tracks from the band's 1995 album The Coiled One.
Reception
In his review of In Parts Assembled Solely, Jon Worley of Aiding & Abetting noted that "the only remix that outdoes the original is the first track" and "the live tracks prove that Spahn Ranch can play live, I guess, but they are completely redundant." CMJ New Music Monthly listed the EP as the top "Family Album", which offers a list of releases to listen to with one's relatives. Sonic Boom pointed to the live tracks as being the highlight of the album, saying "the sound quality isn't all that great, yet the live tracks have a raw emotional context to them which they lack in the studio versions."

Advania is a Nordic information technology service corporation headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company is the largest in its field in Iceland and the 9th largest in the Nordic countries. Advania has corporate clients in the public and private sector. It provides a range of IT-services, platforms, cloud services, and support to multinational enterprises, governments, and businesses.
History
Advania has roots in three Nordic countries, Iceland, Norway and Sweden . Over a long period of time each country generated a component of what eventually was braided into one company, Advania AB, in 2012.
EJS branch
In 1939 the Icelandic entrepreneur Einar J. Skúlason founded EJS, an office equipment repair workshop in Reykjavik. He soon expanded his business, opened a store and started importing products like office machinery and cash registers. During World War II the company also repaired guns and lighters. EJS eventually became a dominant IT business in Iceland. In 1952 the Icelandic government and the city of Reykjavik founded Skýrr, an IT company whose purpose was to take a leading role in computing and recordkeeping in Iceland. The company was privatized in 1995 and later became an important element in a group of companies – including EJS – that merged under the Skýrr brand.
Swedish branch
In 1971 the IT company Nokia Elektronic AB – later renamed Datapoint Svenska AB – was founded in Sweden. The company sold Datapoint computer terminals but later became a network company and a system integrator in Sweden. In 2003 Datapoint merged with Virtus AB, an IT-company which was founded in 1994. The new company was named Kerfi AB.
Norwegian branch
In 1991 Merkantildata Applikasjon was founded in Norway, originally as a business unit within Merkantildata (later ATEA). The company focused on implementing ERP solutions in the Nordic market, industry solutions for retail, property management, logistics, legal and transport & waste management. In 2000 the company changed its name to Hands and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In 2005 Hands was unlisted, as it was acquired by the Icelandic company Kögun which later merged with Skýrr. Despite changes in ownership, Hands managed to acquire Nett.2.3 and Completo in 2005.
In 2012 Advania AB was born, when Skýrr, Kerfi and Hands merged. Since then four companies have been acquired and merged with Advania, the listed Swedish IT company Caperio included.
Advania Finland
In 2018 the Finnish IT & Digital Service provider Vintor became Advania Finland.
Goldman Sachs majority acquisition
In February 2021, it was announced a Goldman Sachs merchant banking division had acquired a majority share of Advania.
They are now the owner by at least 51%.
The new owners aim to further accelerate Advania's growth both organically and through acquisitions.

Reload! Frankie: The Whole 12 Inches is a remix album by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It was released by ZTT Records in 1994 as a complementary album to Bang!... The Greatest Hits of Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
Reload! contains classic and new mixes of 5 Frankie Goes To Hollywood singles. Many of these mixes were also released on the Twelve Inches collection.
Track listing
"Relax" (New York Mix) – 7:24
"Relax" (Ollie J Mix) – 6:27
"Relax" (Trip O Matic Fairy Tale Mix) – 7:49
"Two Tribes" (Carnage Mix) – 7:56
"Two Tribes" (Intermission Legend Mix) – 5:15
"Welcome to the Pleasuredome" (Pleasurefix Mix) – 9:40
"Welcome to the Pleasuredome" (Brothers in Rhythm Rollercoaster Mix) – 14:37
"Rage Hard" (Young Person's Guide Into the 12 Inch Mix) – 10:04
"Warriors of the Wasteland" (Twelve Wild Disciples Mix) – 9:43
The New York mix of "Relax" is the third 12" mix, which was originally released as the Sex Mix (as, confusingly, were the first two). It features four minutes of instrumental loops and textures before cutting to the standard vocal mix.
The Ollie J and Trip O Matic Fairy Tale mixes were first released on the 1993 reissue of "Relax". The latter mix features vocal samples from "Relax", and an interpretation of the "Two Tribes" riff.
The Carnage mix is an instrumental run through "Two Tribes", with "my name's Nash, mine is the last voice you will ever hear" over a stripped-down version of the last chorus, then looping round for a vocal run through the track, with an extended middle eight. The Annihilation mix is the one that people remember.
The Legend mix appeared on a German 12" single in 1993, featuring four Intermission remixes, using vocal samples from the original track.
The Pleasurefix mix is actually the original 12" mix of "Welcome to the Pleasuredome" (released as the Real Altered or Alternative to Reality mix) and is an instrumental run through followed by a vocal run through. It is not the same as the Pleasure Fix mix that appeared on the B-side of "The Power of Love" 12" single.
The Brothers in Rhythm Rollercoaster mix of "Welcome to the Pleasuredome", one of the 1993 remixes, follows a similar pattern to the album version, but with completely retooled backing.
Young Persons Guide is 10:04 on this compilation, compared with over 12 minutes on the 12" releases. It fades out in the 2nd verse of the main song.
Twelve Wild Disciples is a sampled and reconstructed version of the song according to the info on the sleeve of the 12" mix. The format is an instrumental run through, break to 4 loops of the middle 8 with extra keyboards, then a vocal run through.

Hillsboro Stadium is a multi-sport stadium in the northwest United States, located in Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb west of Portland. Opened in 1999 and owned by the city of Hillsboro, the award-winning stadium is part of the Gordon Faber Recreation Complex located in the northeast part of the city, adjacent to the Sunset Highway.
The facility hosts home football games for Portland State University, plus state playoff games for the Oregon School Activities Association's smaller school divisions. Hillsboro Stadium is also used for baseball, softball, soccer, and lacrosse and has hosted college and professional teams. Hillsboro Stadium is used for the NWAPA's annual Century Showcase. The adjacent Hillsboro Ballpark (now Ron Tonkin Field) opened in 2013.
The primary playing field runs northwest to southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level. The covered main grandstand and press box are along the southwest sideline.
History
The stadium cost $7.5 million to build, and opened in August 1999; the entire sports complex cost $10 million to build, with funding from the city and the Ronler Acres urban renewal district. The first high school football game at Hillsboro Stadium was on September 17, 1999, when Century played Oregon City. Previously, Century had used Hare Field after the school opened in 1997, sharing that stadium with Hillsboro and Glencoe high schools.
In 2000, the facility was expanded to increase the seating capacity from 4,000 to the current 7,000 plus. An additional 3,000 temporary seats were added at that time as well to accommodate the Portland State football team. The team used Hillsboro Stadium in 2000 when Civic Stadium (now Providence Park) was being renovated. Portland's Central Catholic High School also played their home games at the stadium that season as well. In May 2001, the University of Oregon Ducks held their annual spring football game at the stadium, which included future NFL quarterbacks Joey Harrington and Jason Fife.
In October 2005, Hillsboro Stadium hosted a college football game between Southern Oregon University (SOU) and Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) in a neutral site contest between the NCAA Division III PLU and NAIA SOU. During the 2007 season, Pacific University's baseball and softball teams used the stadium while their new facility was being built in Forest Grove. In June 2008, the opening ceremonies of the Special Olympics Oregon Summer Games were held at the facility.
In 2008, the stadium hosted a regular season game between the Philadelphia Barrage and the New Jersey Pride of Major League Lacrosse (MLL) on August 9. New Jersey won the game with attendance totaling 3,687 people. Hillsboro Stadium is mentioned as the likely home of any MLL team that may be awarded to or relocate to Portland. The annual Les Schwab Bowl for high school football all stars was played at the stadium since 2009.
In February 2010, the original AstroTurf of 1999 was replaced with FieldTurf. The renovation cost $988,000, of which the school district covered $250,000 of those costs.
Portland State again used Hillsboro Stadium in May 2010 for its spring football game, and held its four home games there during the 2010 season, while PGE Park (now Providence Park) underwent a remodel to prepare for Major League Soccer. Also due to those renovations, Central Catholic High School played its home football games at Hillsboro Stadium. In March 2012, the city announced it was exploring the addition of a baseball stadium at the complex in hopes of adding a minor league baseball team.
Portland State played one game at Hillsboro in 2015, when Providence Park was unavailable due to its use as a Portland Timbers venue. The Vikings returned for four games in 2018, with only one at Providence Park. In that season, the Vikings not only faced conflicts with the Timbers, but also with the Timbers' NWSL sister team, the Portland Thorns; the NWSL championship game; and stadium expansion. All six PSU home games in 2019 were scheduled for Hillsboro.
Facility
Designed by GBD Architects and built by Hoffman Construction Company, the stadium was named one of 1999's Best Public Project Award recipients by AIA Western International. The facility also won the 2000 Design Award of Merit from International Illumination Design Award. Hillsboro Stadium has a FieldTurf field. This field is large enough to accommodate two games at the same time. The main grandstand is on the southwest side of the field and contains locker rooms, concession stands, and team training facilities. Seating capacity is approximately 7,600, and the main covered grandstand seats 4,000.
The FieldTurf field is used for a variety of sports. These include lacrosse, football, soccer, baseball, and softball. The main use is for high school athletics for Hillsboro's four high schools, primarily Century. The stadium also hosts other events such as foot races, OSAA state football playoffs, Cyclocross (Cross Crusade), expositions for rally cars, and high school band competitions.

The Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) is a 9-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure individuals differences in the tendency to have casual, uncommitted sexual relationships. This tendency, termed sociosexuality or sociosexual orientation, is divided into three facets measured by the inventory: behavior (in terms of number of casual and changing sex partners), attitude (towards uncommitted sex) and desire (for people not in a romantic relationship). The most recent revision is from 2008.
History
Sociosexuality as a concept was introduced by Alfred Kinsey to describe differences in individuals tendency to engage in uncommitted sexual relationships.
Minimal research was done until interest in the topic markedly increased when Gangestad and Simpson released their 5-item Sociosexual Orientation Inventory in 1991. However, serious problems were found with the original scale with respect to sociosexuality as a single dimension, its sometimes low internal consistency, skewed score distribution, and one question inapplicable to singles. It was these concerns that led Penke and Asendorpf to create the SOI-R to deal with these issues.
There currently exist two variations on the SOI-R currently available in 25 languages, a 9-point response scale for integration with the original Gangestad and Simpson SOI and a 5-point response scale for the majority of subjects. The language versions include Czech, English, Hungarian, or Polish.
Findings
Significant sex differences have been found between men and women on the scale, with a significantly larger correlation between the attitude and behavior facets of the SOI-R in women compared to men (proposed to be due to lower opportunity for behavior). There were pronounced sex differences in desire, mediocre differences for attitude (with men scoring higher than women) no differences in behavior in heterosexual test-takers.
Improving on the previous Gangestad and Simpson Sociosexuality scale, the three factors appeared to make unique contributions and have discriminant validity. Desire made unique contributions to the prediction of past sexual and relationship behaviors, observer-rated attractiveness, self-perceived mate value, and male and female flirting behavior, as well as having links with sex drive and relationship quality. Attitude appears responsible for the effect of sociosexuality on mate preferences, assortative mating, and romantic partner's flirtatiousness outside the relationship. Evening-oriented females (but not males) were more unrestricted in behavior, attitude, and desire.

Christian Action Network or CAN is a Christian activist organization founded by Martin Mawyer in 1990. The organization states that its "primary goals are to protect America's religious and moral heritage through educational efforts."
The group has advocated on a number of issues, including actions against the National Endowment for the Arts, battles regarding First Amendment to the United States Constitution issues, and the Islamic community center to be built near the World Trade Center site in New York. The group has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group.
History
According to the group's website, CAN was founded in 1990 as a "pro-family, pro-religious freedom and pro-traditional values organization."
According to the site, founder Martin Mawyer began a journalism career in 1979 in Washington D.C. covering religious issues for the daily news service Religion Today and as a correspondent for Moody Monthly, an American religious magazine published by the Moody Bible Institute.
Mawyer went on to become the editor of Dr. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority Report, a news publication of the Moral Majority, where he served from 1980 to 1988. Christian Action Network was formed soon after.
Over the next three decades the organization has produced books, videos and full-length feature films opposing the promotion of homosexuality and same-sex marriage, denigration of Christian beliefs in popular media and culture and infiltration of Islam into Western society, and promoting Christianity as a foundational American value.
Action against the National Endowment for the Arts
In 1993 CAN conduct several protests of the funding of what it called obscenity by the National Endowment for the Arts. In July Mawyer's group hand-delivered letters to 114 freshman members of Congress and Republican congressional leaders urging them to abolish the NEA on the basis of a concurrent art exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. The show "Abject Art: Repulsion and Desire" featured images of excrement and homoerotic acts.
On July 29 the group set up a photography show at the U.S. Capitol that featured sexually explicit photographs by Joel-Peter Witkin, an artist funded by the NEA. The exhibit was abruptly banned from the Capitol before it could publicly open and was then closed down by House Speaker Tom Foley after 15 minutes at a second location.
The following September, CAN distribute 15-minute video tapes to President Bill Clinton and members of Congress that contained clips of pornographic films that the group said had the "stamp of approval" of the NEA. The 15-minute tapes contained excerpts from three films shown at the Pittsburgh International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in July 1991, which Mawyer said had been funded by NEA grants. An NEA spokeswoman disputed that the funding had supported those specific films.
Prevails in lawsuit by Federal Election Commission
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) accused CAN in 1995 of violating the Federal Election Campaign Act by running television commercials prior to the 1992 presidential election that asserted Democratic candidate Bill Clinton supported job quotas for homosexuals as a kind of Affirmative Action. The commercials aired in 25 cities. In 1995 the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia granted CAN's motion to dismiss the complaint. In 1996 the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, finding that because the commercials did not expressly advocate for the election or defeat of the candidate, they were not a violation of the Act.
Action against Gay Days at Walt Disney World
In June 1999 Mawyer and an accomplice went into nightclub at Downtown Disney during Gay Days at Walt Disney World, obtaining night-vision, hidden-camera video of men simulating sex acts as they danced onstage. CAN make the footage into a video which it showed at a news conference at the National Press Club, and threatened to boycott Disney unless the company agreed to warn families entering its parks and booking hotel rooms during the annual Gay Days event. CAN also post the video on its website and distributed it to churches.
Although Disney did not change any of its policies after the expose, a spokesman did acknowledge that the dancing men in the video were Disney employees and that whoever was responsible for the dance routine would be disciplined.
Campaign against the “Ground Zero Mosque”
The organization had a nationwide screening tour that included stops near speaking engagements by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the former spokesman for Park51. The group's campaign received wide press coverage.
CAN and American Center for Law and Justice threatened the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation with legal action after it was unable to get permits to show its film in several public parks around the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Department said the parks were unavailable. The organization then announced that they were granted permits to show its film in several parks.
On September 7, 2011, congressman Allen West (R-FL) hosted a screening of the film in the Rayburn House Office Building in Congress, where he reiterated his opposition to Park51 alongside several people who lost family members in the September 11th attacks.
Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN) responded by sponsoring an event on September 13, 2011, to publicize a report about the "Islamophobia network" in the U.S. The report criticized Rep. Allen West for spreading anti-Muslim sentiment and for his involvement in the event at which the work was screened. It also criticized the Christian Action Network and other participants.
Action on Muslims of America group
(Note: This section seems self-contradictory and needs editing. The last paragraph says the Federal court ruled that the claims in the book and film were based upon “Muslims of the Americas Inc.”, whereas “Muslims of America” is the organization name claimed in the Title and in 2nd and 4th paragraphs of the article below to be referenced in the book and film. The Title itself claims “Action ON…” this group, not Action Against CAN by this group which is the sense of the article. This should be clarified.)
In 2001, immediately after the September 11 attacks by terrorists on New York City and Washington, D.C., CAN add Muslim extremism and jihad within the borders of the United States to its list of actionable causes. Mawyer has stated that he was in fact in New York City on the morning of the attacks for a scheduled meeting with United Nations (UN) officials about the delivery of citizen petitions on various UN activities opposed by CAN. CAN's video Homegrown Jihad: The terrorist camps around U.S. was released in 2009, and was followed in 2012 by the book Twilight in America: The Untold Story of Islamic Terrorist Training Camps Inside America.
Both the book and film described the activities of the group Muslims of America, which set up a religious hamlet called Islamberg in New York state, another called Holy Islamville in South Carolina, and several other settlements including one in Red House, Va., near CAN's headquarters in Forest, Va. Muslims of America was portrayed as the creation of Sufi Cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani, a Pakistani cleric. Gilani was in fact the religious leader whom Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was on his way to interview before Pearl was abducted, later to be found decapitated.
It has been alleged by the U.S. Government that Gilani is associated with the terrorist organization Jamaat ul-Fuqra.
The claim of both book and film were congruent with that allegation: that the settlements were cover for jihadist training activities, carried out in isolated rural settings to escape scrutiny. Muslims of America claimed, on the other hand, that its members were primarily black Muslims seeking to escape the troubles of big city life.
In 2013 The Muslims of America, based in Hancock, N.Y., sued Mawyer, a co-author and the Christian Action Network for $3 million in federal court in Syracuse, N.Y., seeking also to halt the continued publication of Twilight in America: The Untold Story of Islamic Training Camps in America. In 2014 the suit was dismissed by a federal judge on the grounds that the Muslims of America lacked standing to sue, since the allegations in the book on which its claims were based pertained to a different organization, Muslims of the Americas Inc., which had dissolved in March 2013.
"In God We STILL Trust" billboard campaign
In early 2020 CAN launch an "In God We STILL Trust" mobile billboard ad campaign, which saw box trucks emblazoned with the statement deployed in the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Los Angeles. The trucks were active from Nov. 2 to Nov. 6. A fourth route was planned in Washington D.C. for the same week, that of the 2020 presidential election, but the trucking company backed out due to concerns about street violence.

The Steart Peninsula () is a peninsula in Somerset, England. At its outermost tip is Fenning Island (now joined to the mainland), at the tip of which is Stert Point (sometimes spelt Steart Point) which is the eastern end of the West Somerset Coast Path. North of Stert Point lies Stert Island, which was joined to the peninsula until about 1798. The peninsula consists largely of low-lying flat farmland, and projects northwards on the west side of Stockland Reach, the lower stretches of the estuary of the River Parrett.
The main settlement on the peninsula is the village of Steart, but two other villages, Stockland Bristol and Otterhampton sit at the peninsula's base. A single minor road links the village of Steart to these other villages. The River Parrett Trail runs along the peninsula.
West of the peninsula are the villages of Stolford and Hinkley Point, and to the south is the village of Combwich.
From 1927 to the 1950s, Stert Flats, the mudflats north-west of the peninsula, were used as a RAF range, the Stert Flats Air Gunnery and Bombing Range. A few structures from this time remain.
Nature reserves
There are two nature reserves on the peninsula. A third reserve is being developed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve
Bridgwater Bay, a national nature reserve, lies on the northern side of the peninsula. The reserve includes the largest area of salt marsh in Somerset, and large expanses of mudflats exposed at low tide, important feeding
and roosting sites for waterfowl and wading birds. There are four bird hides in the north of the reserve, near the tip of the peninsula. Adjoining the reserve are three coastal commons — from west to east these are Catsford Common, Wall Common and Steart Common.
Steart Marshes
The Steart Marshes are a major wetland reserve on the south side of the peninsula, completed in 2014 and managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. The reserve is the result of a flood management project, which involved a breach in the sea wall to permit seawater to enter the salt marsh from the tidal River Parrett.
The Steart peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, current sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future.
In July 2010, the Environment Agency presented a plan to convert the peninsula into wetland habitat,
costing £17–20 million,
which included land purchase costs of £5–7 million. It was the largest wetland habitat creation scheme in England. Work began on the programme in May 2012 and was completed in September 2014. An Environment Agency spokesman said "The Steart project will directly protect homes, businesses and the surrounding infrastructure. Salt marsh is a natural flood risk management scheme. Like coral reefs or mangroves in the tropics, salt marsh takes energy out of the tide and reduces wave height."

Clive Burlingame Meredith (February 7, 1892 – April 11, 1932) was an American radio engineer and radio station owner. Meredith served as the founding owner and operator of WSYR in Syracuse, New York. He also assisted the Federal Radio Commission with the developing a means to reduce heterodyne interference between radio stations operating on the same transmitting frequency.
Early life and education
Meredith was born to Eugene Meredith and Gertrude Burlingame Meredith in Syracuse. He was a grandson of diplomat Anson Burlingame and a cousin of author Roger Burlingame. Meredith graduated from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1910. He then attended Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1910 to 1913. Meredith later participated in the Harvard Club of New York.
Radio operations
On September 15, 1922, Meredith launched radio station WMAC from his home in Cazenovia, New York, with the first broadcast featuring music from nationally known harpist Melville Clark. In late 1926 he founded a second station, WSYR, operating from the Hotel Syracuse in nearby Syracuse. In 1930 these two stations were consolidated in Syracuse as WSYR-WMAC.
In 1927, Meredith devised a plan for precise unified control of radio station transmitting frequencies; this plan informed work by the Federal Radio Commission to reduce electromagnetic interference. The following year, Meredith organized WSYR's participation in a national frequency synchronization experiment for the commission. WSYR partnered with four stations also broadcasting on 1020 kHz (294 meters): WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, KPRC in Houston, Texas, WODA in Paterson, New Jersey, and WGL in New York City.
Meredith also operated amateur radio station 8AQO with J. Edward Page. In December 1922, this station participated in a transatlantic test of the American Radio Relay League, and was one of 13 radio stations heard by listeners in both England and France.
Military service during World War I
In 1917, Meredith attended the officers' training camp for the U.S. Army in Plattsburgh, New York. After he received a commission of second lieutenant in the infantry, he served at Fort Dix, a military facility near Trenton, New Jersey. In 1918, Meredith transferred to the 307th Machine Gun Battalion of the 78th Infantry Division. He later joined the Aviation Section of the Army Signal Corps as a second lieutenant and sailed for France to serve in World War I on February 26, 1918. Meredith served at the headquarters of the U.S. Army Air Service and then as an officer in charge of supply train.
During the summer, Meredith returned to infantry. The U.S. Army detailed him to the headquarters of the 41st Division and then to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion of the 1st Infantry Division. Following the conclusion of World War I, Meredith served with the Army of Occupation during the Occupation of the Rhineland.
Personal life
On October 4, 1913, Meredith married Alice Louise Abbott of Pelham Manor, New York, who was related to the Roosevelt family. They divorced in 1914 and they both remarried. His second wife was Jean Jeffrey Smedberg.
Meredith died in an Albany, New York hospital on April 11, 1932, after a car accident. According to reports, he was a passenger in a car struck by another car near Selkirk, New York, in the evening of April 10. Meredith was thrown from the vehicle and run over by a third car, suffering punctured lungs. He died the next morning in the hospital.

Nelbia Romero Cabrera (8 December 1938 – 3 April 2015) was a Uruguayan visual artist. She began her career in drawing and engraving and later incorporated other artistic languages, such as photography, installation, and performance. Her work was marked by themes of politics and protest. She was an active participant in the . She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1994 and was granted the Figari Award in 2006 for her artistic career.
Biography
Childhood
Nelbia Romero was born on 8 December 1938 in the town of Durazno, Uruguay. She was the eldest daughter of a family of rural landowners. Her parents, Apolinaria Cabrera and Conrado Romero, settled in the city for her birth, where later the youngest daughter of the marriage and her only sister, María Teresa, was born.
Romero's upbringing alternated between the city and the countryside, where she spent her vacations. Her father, a landowner and local political figure, socially active and atheist, shared with his eldest daughter an interest in music and history, passing along his concern for social justice.
Training
Romero completed elementary school and secondary studies at the school of the Immaculate Conception of Durazno. She left without finishing her preparatory architecture studies in 1959 to enter the Durazno Workshop of Plastic Arts. Claudio Silveira Silva, her teacher for two years, strongly influenced her vocation and encouraged her to move to Montevideo to continue her studies at the (ENBA). Supported by her father, she moved to the country's capital in 1962, abandoning marriage plans. At the ENBA she received multiple artistic and political influences. The painter Mario Pareja guided her to the graphic arts, suggesting that she enter the printing workshop. In 1967 her father died and she stopped attending the Institute.
In 1968 Romero entered the school of the Engraving Club, where she was a student of and met her former ENBA classmate, Rimer Cardillo. She also participated in the graphic activity of the Club: monthly newsletters, almanacs, and illustrations. In this time she experimented with different materials and studied the history of art at the Faculty of Humanities.
She also received training as an educator of plastic expression, which allowed her to later work as a teacher in primary schools and workshops for adults.
Political activity
Romero was a politically engaged artist who supported causes and social movements through her artistic activity. In 1969 she joined the Communist Party, where she would continue to work until the 1990s.
Artistic production
Early works
During the first phase of Romero's career she was mainly engaged in drawing and engraving. Between 1975 and 1980 she participated in "El Dibujazo", a movement in which draughtsmen and graphic artists took part in expressing themselves against the social conflict of the period of the dictatorship. At this stage she began to show her work in collective exhibitions, and in 1976 she held her first individual exhibition, received some prizes, and sent works abroad. During that year, she collaborated with draftswomen Beatriz Battoine, Irene Ferrando, and Marta Restuccia, and experimented by complementing her samples with audiovisual recordings with Nelson Advalov, which would lead her to new multimedia aesthetic searches in the 1980s. In fact, at the end of the decade, in 1988, she retired from the Engraving Club after promoting an unsuccessful attempt at renewal with Ana Tiscornia.
Second stage
Romero's work took a new direction in the 1980s with the incorporation of audiovisual language and the use of her body as a plastic element. In turn, her work was increasingly committed to the personal and social consequences of the recent past. In an interview with , she said:
During those years of transition Romero made engravings in which photographs of her inked face appear, which she also printed on the works. With these works she participated in collective exhibitions that expressed the new paths taken by the nation's plastic arts towards the end of the dictatorship and during the first years of the return of democracy. In 1981 she participated in the show paying tribute to Carlos Fossatti exhibited in the Montevideo Gallery of Notaries, with the participation of artists of the Engraving Club, and in 1983 she was part of the Muestra por las libertades organized by the Culture Commission of the (AEBU) together with more than 300 national and international artists. In 1986 the engravings of this cycle were sent to the Second Havana Biennial as part of the installation A propósito de aquellos años oscuros.
In 1983 she presented Sal-si-puedes ("Get out if you can"), considered the first artistic installation made in Uruguay, which included texts, music, body language, plastic art, and atmosphere. After the fall of the Uruguayan Dictatorship in 1985, she returned to the country and continued work expressing the pre-Hispanic, indigenous heritage of Uruguay through performance, installations, and multimedia work.
The work evokes the Charrúa ethnic group and recalls the , constituting a reflection on national identity and pluriculturalism in a country that was considered practically without indigenous heritage. Sal-si-puedes is part of the crisis period of the post-dictatorship era in which the perception of a country with European roots, socially homogeneous and of tolerant tradition, was questioned. Romero was nourished by the artistic and academic production (history, sociology, anthropology) that in this period questioned the historical construction of national identity.
She continued working in the same direction by producing a performance, Uru-gua-y, in 1990, followed by two installations in 1992; Más allá de las palabras ("Beyond words") and Garra Charrúa, which uses, among a heterogeneity of elements, large amounts of text written in Spanish and Guarani, rescuing the linguistic heritage of that nation, present in everyday speech today. This work was presented in Montevideo, in Havana, and at the Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst (Germany).
In Bye Bye Yaugurú, a 1995 installation presented at the in Montevideo, Romero continued to work on the issue of national identity from a critical perspective. The central element of the work is a map of Uruguay represented in various ways in combination with other elements. It questions the "scientific" reading of the reality that cartography tries to show, highlighting the arbitrariness of the historical tracing of the borders that underpin nationalism.
In the following years she continued to develop her work in installations and performances, at the same time that she intensified her teaching and curatorial activity. In the 2000s she exhibited several times at the national and international level, sending her work to the Havana Biennial and to the .
Romero was also the author of texts, presentations, and talks on printmaking and on topics related to Uruguayan identity.
Awards and recognitions
In 1994 Romero received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 2009 the Parliament granted her a gracious pension for being considered a prominent figure in Uruguayan art. In 2005 she received the Figari Award granted by the Central Bank of Uruguay.

Katie Skelly is an American comics artist and illustrator. She is best known for her graphic novels My Pretty Vampire, Maids, and Nurse Nurse.
Biography
Katie Skelly was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Her father's side of the family operated a newsstand in downtown Bethlehem and he brought her comics from the stand to read. She began drawing her own comics in high school, and after graduating from college, Skelly began her science fiction-themed, Barbarella-inspired series Nurse, Nurse. She received a B. A. in Art History from Syracuse University and followed it with graduate coursework at City College of New York.
Works
In 2017 Fantagraphics Books published Skelly's first hardcover graphic novel My Pretty Vampire, notable for its "dramatic colors" and "sense of mercurial motion". Inspired by the Italian horror films of Dario Argento and the early work of comics illustrator Jean-Claude Forest, the story follows a young vampire who escapes captivity by her brother to discover herself through surreal, sensual and often violent adventures in the modern world.
Skelly's other works include Operation Margarine (2014, Adhouse Books), for which she was awarded the inaugural Emerging Artist Prize at the Cartoon Crossroads Columbus Festival in 2015; The Agency (2018, Fantagraphics Underground); and illustrations for the Alex de Campi penned Twisted Romance: Heartbreak Incorporated (2018, Image Comics), which received a 2019 Eisner Awards nomination for best anthology.
Among her early works, Skelly self-published Nurse Nurse in chapter-sized installments until Sparkplug Comics founder Dylan Williams offered to publish the collected issues. Nurse Nurse was one of the last pieces Williams finished publishing before he died in 2011.
Skelly has written and lectured about comics for The Comics Journal, the Center for Cartoon Studies, Fordham University, and The New School, among others. In 2017 she told NPR: "When I started drawing comics, it was to make my own reality. But now as an adult, I draw them to better understand why everyday life is extraordinary."
Currently living and working in Brooklyn, New York, Skelly's biographical graphic novel Maids, based on the lives of convicted murderers Christine and Léa Papin, was published by Fantagraphics Books in October 2020. Library Journal's advance review of the book discusses the "horror of the Papin sisters' crimes," noting that Skelly's "perceptive examination of the complex bond between Catherine and Lea evokes incredible sympathy for the two nonetheless."
Exhibitions
Skelly's first solo exhibition Skellyworld ran at The Naughton Gallery at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland August 8 through October 6, 2019. The show gave insights into Skelly's work and artistic process, exhibiting original drawings from all of her major published works, as well as paintings, sketchbooks, video projects, self-produced merchandise, and a 78-card tarot deck that she designed and illustrated. Exhibition curatorial notes listed Japanese comics, bandes dessinée, science fiction and B movies from the 1960s and 1970s as Skelly's inspirations, and noted that she "examines exploitation genres for transgressive elements" in her work.
Her art has also appeared in group exhibitions, including 18+ at Recspec Gallery in Austin, TX (2018); Speculative Skins at The Naughton Gallery (2018); From Panel to Panel X: C/Overt Movement in Comicana, at the Medialia Gallery in New York City (2014), and Karma-Con at the Rubin Museum of Art (2012).

Zonadhesin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ZAN gene.
Function
This gene encodes a protein that functions in the species specificity of sperm adhesion to the egg zona pellucida. The encoded protein is located in the acrosome and may be involved in signaling or gamete recognition.
An allelic polymorphism in this gene results in both functional and frameshifted alleles; the reference genome represents the functional allele. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015].

Ang Chan II (; 1791 – 7 January 1835) was King of Cambodia from 1806 to his death in 1835. He reigned under the name of Outey Reachea III ().
Ang Chan II was the eldest son of Ang Eng. Ang Eng died in 1796 when Ang Chan II was only five years old. Prince Talaha Pok (, ) was appointed the regent of Cambodia. Ang Chan II was not allowed to go to Cambodia until Pok died in 1806.
In 1806, Ang Chan II was crowned king by the Siamese. His two brothers, Ang Em and Ang Snguon, were pro-Siamese. In order to gain power from the two brothers, Ang Chan got closer to the Vietnamese. In the next year, he started to pay tribute to Vietnam. Two Vietnamese officials, Ngô Nhân Tịnh and Trần Công Đàn, came to Longvek and granted him the title Cao Miên quốc vương ("king of Cambodia").
The Siamese demanded Ang Chan appoint Ang Snguon and Ang Em as the uprayorach and ouparach, respectively, but Ang Chan refused. In 1811, with the help of the Siamese, Ang Snguon overthrew him. Ang Chan fled to Saigon. His two brothers were appointed regents by the Siamese. In 1813, a Vietnamese army under Lê Văn Duyệt invaded Cambodia and captured Oudong. Ang Chan returned with the Vietnamese army. Ang Em and Ang Snguon fled to Bangkok. After a rebellion, Cambodia was put under the protection of Vietnam. The Vietnamese built two castles, Nam Vang (Phnom Penh) and La Yêm (Lvea Aem), to station their forces. One thousand men under Nguyễn Văn Thoại were sent to Phnom Penh to "protect" him.
He was ordered to collect Cambodian Royal Chronicles in 1818.
In 1819, Ang Chan sent 5,000 Khmer labourers to reconstruct the Vietnamese Vĩnh Tế Canal. An anti-Vietnamese rebellion broke out the next year, but was put down by the Vietnamese army.
Ang Chan died in 1834, and his second daughter, Ang Mey, was installed as queen.

A lihapiirakka (literally "meat pie") is everyday Finnish food sold in supermarkets and often available ready-to-eat as street food. It is a form of savoury pie or turnover made from doughnut dough and filled with a mixture of minced meat and cooked rice and cooked by deep frying. It does not resemble a traditional English or American meat pie or turnover because it is made of doughnut mix and is deep fried. They are usually bought ready cooked and are simply reheated in a microwave oven.
A larger and thicker form is also known as a möttönen. Two variants from Lappeenranta are atomi and vety ("atom" and "hydrogen"), where atomi contains either ham or egg, and vety includes both.
Traditionally the pastry is eaten whole. A contemporary way to have them is to split it in half and fill it with a frankfurter or some other type of sausage, or with kebab meat or some form of meat burger. They are generally served with ketchup, mustard and a relish similar to Bostongurka.
The term lihapiirakka may also be used for a large rectangular turnover.

Vodou drumming and associated ceremonies are folk ritual faith system of henotheistic religion of Haitian Vodou originated and inextricable part of Haitian culture.
Vodou drumming is widely practiced in urban centres in Haiti and some cities in North America (especially New Orleans). The ritualistic faith system that involves ceremonies that consist of singing, drumming and dancing.
The Vodou drumming rituals call upon abstract ancestral spirits, called Loas (or Lwas), for their aid, instruction, special powers and strengths as embodiment of certain principles or characteristics. While certain aspects of this religion may share the same roots, it is completely contrary to the stereotype of black magic, witch doctors, pins in dolls, and zombies portrayed by New Orleans style Voodoo (a variation of the name).
Religious and cultural history and context
Through the involuntary mass dispersion of slavery, the traditional West African Vodun religions went through the process of Religious syncretism between Roman Catholicism. Due to mass dispersion of the West African population from its indigenous territories, the colonial plantation system created and influenced the Haitian Vodou's ecotheological perspective. The relationship of Vodou's belief system lies heavily on ecological systems. The interest in ecotheological ethics are the base of beliefs in Vodou religion, these ethics are ancestor worship, nature spirits, and natural processes such as birth, death, weather, and fertility. With the globalization of Yoruba religions through African diaspora, many Eurocentric religions denounce Yoruba religions and practices. This is because of the negative misconception where it is believed that religions like Haitian Vodou, have a devotion to witchcraft, sorcery, and demon worship. The demonization of Yoruba religions can be contributed to the blatant racism caused by colonization. In April 2003 Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide officially recognized Vodou as a religion in Haiti. Due to the negative stigma that surrounds the Haitian Vodou, The Haitian government has had a history of previously persecuting those who practiced the religion. Vodou in Haiti was often used as a scapegoat for the countries issues. This misunderstanding and negative stigma can be noted back to the nation's founding. The dispute over the validity of the religion, was both beyond and within Haiti.
Drumming in Ritual
In Vodou ritual, drummers are called tambouriers, and becoming one requires a lengthy apprenticeship. The drumming style, choice of rhythm, and composition of the orchestra differs depending on which nation of lwa are being invoked. The drum rhythms typically generate a kase ("break"), which the master drummer will initiate to oppose the main rhythm being played by the rest of the drummers. This is seen as having a destabilizing effect on the dancers and helping to facilitate their possession.
The drumming is typically accompanied by singing, usually in Haitian Creole. These songs are often structured around a call and response, with a soloist singing a line and the chorus responding with either the same line or an abbreviated version. The soloist is the hungenikon, who maintains the rhythm with a rattle. Lyrically simple and repetitive, these songs are invocations to summon a lwa. As well as drumming, dancing plays a major role in ritual, with the drumming providing the rhythm for the dance. The dances are simple, lacking complex choreography, and usually involve the dancers moving counterclockwise around the poto mitan. Specific dance movements can indicate the lwa or their nation being summoned; dances for Agwé for instance imitate swimming motions. Vodouists believe that the lwa renew themselves through the vitality of the dancers.

was a Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) catcher and manager. During his over 26-season playing career mostly spent with the Nankai Hawks (now the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks), he became one of NPB's greatest offensive catchers. He was awarded the Pacific League MVP Award five times, became the first NPB batter to win the Triple Crown in 1965, and holds the record for second-most home runs and RBIs in NPB history.
Nomura was a player-manager for the last eight years he was with the Hawks, leading them to the Pacific League title in 1973. After playing, he became a full-time manager and served led the Yakult Swallows to four league titles and three Japan Series championships from 1990 to 1998. Later, he managed the Hanshin Tigers for three seasons and the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles for four seasons until his retirement in 2009. As a manager, Nomura recorded 1,565 wins, the fifth-most wins of any manager in NPB history. He was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.
Biography
Early life
Nomura was born in the coastal fishing village of Amino (now Kyōtango) in Kyoto Prefecture. When he was three years old, his father died of disease while serving in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Nomura grew up in poverty with his mother and older brother. With the help of his brother, he was able to attend high school.
Playing career
After graduating from Mineyama High School, Nomura joined the Nankai Hawks after a tryout in 1954. The team's manager at the time believed he'd at least be useful as a catcher for pitching practice. That year, Nomura played in nine games and went hitless for the season. The Hawks discussed cutting him from the team, however, he was given another chance reportedly after Nomura offered to play for free and even threatened to throw himself in front of a train if he was let go.
During a career that spanned four decades from 1954 to 1980, Nomura hit 657 home runs and led the Pacific League in homers eight straight seasons. (However, it should be taken into consideration that his home park, Osaka Stadium, measured only 276 feet down the lines until 1972, and 300 feet from 1972 onward, and 380 feet to straightaway center—tiny dimensions by Major League Baseball standards.) He finished his career with 2901 hits.
In 1965, Nomura won the league's first Triple Crown. He was a player-manager between 1970 and 1977. He played for 26 years, the longest NPB playing career until Kimiyasu Kudo pitched in his 27th season in 2008; Kudo retired in 2010 having played 29 seasons.
Managerial career
Nomura began his 24-year managerial career as player-manager of the Hawks in 1970. During his eight year stint as Hawks manager, he led the team to the Pacific League title in 1973. After his playing career, Nomura went on to become a full-time manager. From 1990 to 1998, he managed the Yakult Swallows, leading them to four league titles and three Japan Series championships. While managing the Swallows, Nomura mentored the team's catcher, Atsuya Furuta. Under Nomura, Furuta flourished and became a hall of fame catcher in his own right.
Following his role as Yakult manager, Nomura joined the Hanshin Tigers and managed the team from 1999 to 2001. The team finished last in the Central League all three seasons. On December 5, 2001, his wife, television personality Sachiyo Nomura, was arrested for tax evasion. Nomura resigned from his managerial position the next day. His wife was accused of hiding ¥45 million of his income, however Nomura was not accused of any criminal responsibility.
After the scandal, Nomura managed the amateur corporate league team Shidax from 2003 to 2005. He left after three seasons to return to NPB. The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles had a poor showing during their inaugural 2005 season. It was the first PL club in 40 years to lose at least 90 games in one season. They finished with a 38-97-1 record. Hoping to improve for their second season, the team hired Nomura to manage the club because of his experience. Over the next four seasons, he helped turn Rakuten around. By his final season with the team, the Eagles finished the regular season in with their best-ever showing up to that point in time, second place, securing them a position in the Climax Series. After losing in the final stage of the 2009 Pacific League Climax Series, Nomura retired from managing at the age of 74. As a manager, Nomura recorded 1,565 wins, the fifth-most wins of any manager in NPB history.
Legacy
During his playing time, Pacific League games were rarely televised. Because of this, Nomura was often overshadowed by his Central League contemporaries such as superstars Sadaharu Oh and Shigeo Nagashima of the Yomiuri Giants. He openly resented this and felt he never received the attention that he deserved as a player. Over 26-season playing career, however, Nomura amassed a number of awards, titles and records. During his time with the Hawks, he won five Pacific League MVP Awards – the most of any PL player and second-most all-time. Nomura also led the PL in home runs for nine seasons, eight of which were consecutive and won 19 Best Nine Awards for best catcher in the league. He accumulated 657 home runs, 1,988 RBIs and 2,901 hits in 3,017 games, all of which are 2nd in the all-time rankings. He was elected into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame by the Selection Committee for Players in 1989.; his copper plaque depicts him wearing his cap backwards with no team logo visible.
Personal life
While married to his first wife Masako, Nomura began a relationship with Sachiyo in 1972. Shortly after, Sachiyo became pregnant and gave birth to future NPB player Katsunori Nomura in 1973. After this, Masako had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide, and later died of cancer.
Sachiyo and Katsuya married in 1978. The two remained married until her death in 2017 at age 85. Sports agents Kenny and Don Nomura, Sachiyo's children from her previous marriage, are Katsuya's step-children. His granddaughter, Saya Nomura is an employee with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Katsuya died of heart failure on February 11, 2020, at age 84.

Ruth Winifred Cracknell AM (6 July 1925 – 13 May 2002) was an Australian character and comic actress, comedienne and author, her career encompassing all genres including radio, theatre, television and film. She appeared in many dramatics as well as comedy roles throughout a career spanning some 56 years. In theatre she was well known for her Shakespeare roles.

Cracknell played an elderly woman, Maggie Beare, who was slowly becoming senile. She was cared for by her long-suffering younger son Arthur (Garry McDonald), to whom she was often indifferent but on whom she was also dependent and whom she often cynically played off against her self-centred older son Robert (Henri Szeps) and daughter-in-law Liz (played by Judy Morris).
Cracknell appeared in film productions including opposite Chips Rafferty in the 1958 classic Smiley Gets a Gun, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), the 1983 The Night the Prowler in 1978 and The Dismissal as Margaret Whitlam in 1983.

Robert May's School is a coeducational secondary school with academy status, located in the village of Odiham, Hampshire, England. All children in year 6 whose families live in the catchment area, and who attend named feeder schools in the area are eligible for a place at the school in year 7. The school was founded in 1694 with donations from the will of Robert May, a local man, and other benefactors who contributed to what is now the Odiham Consolidated Charities.
History
The original school was founded in 1694 from donations made in the will of Robert May, a local mercer, and the first school premises were purchased ten years later. This donation was supplemented by a gift from James Zouch, a trustee appointed in the will of Robert May, enabling twenty-five boys to be taught at the school. In addition to the main school, the headmaster was allowed to take boarding pupils of wealthy parents and give them a classical education. This resulted in the headmaster giving little attention to the needs of the main school and the school Trustees passed a resolution in 1858 requiring the headmaster to spend more time with the main school.
The school was reorganised in the 1870s, following the Endowed Schools Act 1869.
The group of Trustees that had run the school since its foundation was replaced by a board of governors. Pupils were now required to pay fees to attend the school and a new building was constructed, opening in 1876. This building is still in use as part of a local junior school.
In 1920, the local education authority decreed that teachers' salaries should be increased and the director of education wrote to the governors saying that he could not afford the ever-increasing financial support to the school. Following a report by an inspector later in the year that the school could soon face difficulties, the decision was taken to transfer complete control of the school to the county.
The start of the Second World War in September 1939 resulted in air raid shelters being dug, delaying the start of term. During the war, the school day had to end earlier, due to the blackout, and a total of 151 air raid warnings were sounded in the first year alone. An enemy bomb landed close to the school in 1940 but no-one was hurt.
The grammar school was closed down in 1950, despite vigorous local protests and a petition to the government carrying 1,000 signatures. Funding for building work on the school site was approved in 1952 and was completed in 1957, when the school was reopened as a secondary modern school with 265 pupils. A formal opening ceremony took place in 1958.
The school was reorganised again in the 1970s into a comprehensive school, with new school buildings constructed by 1975. The new site was designed for 690 pupils and had a central courtyard, concert hall, office, dining area and kitchen, with separate blocks for craft workshops and music. In the first year the new school took in five hundred and three pupils. More buildings were constructed in 1978, linked to the rest of the building by walkways. More business studies and computer facilities, as well as a new library, were added in 1987. The music block was rebuilt in 1993/94. A new English block followed soon after, as did a new maths block in 2002, in order to allow the school to cope with its high intake. Following a successful application, the school then became a Specialist School in Science with mathematics and computing. In 2019, the school finished construction on the new "Invictus" block.
The school converted to academy status on 1 May 2012.
Demographics
Pupils come from the surrounding area, including the villages of Upton Grey, Greywell, Hook, Hartley Wintney and Odiham. The vast majority of pupils are of white ethnicity and British backgrounds and there are a few pupils who speak English as a second language. The number of pupils eligible for free school meals or who have disabilities is below average.
Extra-curricular activities
A wide range of free extracurricular activities are run after school hours on five days of the week, with special buses for pupils involved to return home afterwards. The choice available has been described as "exceptional" by a school inspection.
From year 7 onwards, students can take part in exchange trips with partner schools in France and Germany, as well as other trips to ski resorts and residential trips such as recent trips to Iceland and Tanzania.
Robert May's School have competed in the F1 in Schools competition annually for over a decade - Colossus F1 were crowned World Champions in 2014, with Britannia Red being crowned World Champions for the 2020(21) competition. Other successful teams include Rush, Evolution, Enigma, and Origin who have all represented the United Kingdom at the World Finals.
The school has run stage productions since 1921 and almost annually since 1977. The most recent productions were "Beauty and the Beast" (2018), "School of Rock" (2019), and "Annie" (2021).

Cheryl Rainfield (born August 19, 1972) is a Canadian author. She is an incest and ritual abuse survivor. She battled with abuse by reading numerous books, and by writing and creating art during her early life which opened doors for her as an escape. She is an active feminist and a lesbian. Her favourite pastime is reading. She is a passionate reader, and enjoys writing and creating art. She lives with her dog, Petal, and her cat, Amazon. She currently resides in Toronto, Ontario.
Volunteer work and education
Rainfield was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She has been involved with the Regular Children's/YA Critique Group for more than 11 years. She volunteers at CANSCAIP (Canadian Society of Children's Authors, Illustrators, and Performers). She completed an editing course at George Brown College in 1999 that covered proofreading, copy editing, and substantive editing.
Notable works
Rainfield is most famous for her book called Scars. She wrote the first draft in a few short months, and then for over ten years she edited and revised the book more than forty times before it was accepted for publication by WestSide Books. She based the book Scars on some of her personal life experiences. Cheryl Rainfield has many similarities with the protagonist of the story Kendra. Rainfield wrote the book in order to speak out about self-harm, sexual abuse, and being a queer teen, and to help others who've been through those experiences to know that they are not alone, and to encourage greater compassion and understanding in people who don't have those experiences. For the launching of the book, she partnered with the Toronto Rape Crisis Centre because she used this centre as a help line when she was a teen. Cheryl donates a portion of all her earnings from Scars to RAINN (Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network) and the TRCC (Toronto Rape Crisis Centre). The actual cover of the book is a picture of Rainfield's forearms which shows that she has been through much of Kendra's pain.
Novels and short stories
The Healer
It is a compilation of 14 different horror stories. Like most anthologies it contains a variety of stories. The Horrors: Terrifying Tales: Book Two is no different. The stories range from the proverbial babysitter gone mad to the necrophilia fairy tale with a twist. The one thread that weaves itself through this collection of stories is teenage angst. Each story deals with an aspect of teen life, and the worst nightmares contained in that demographic come true. The Horrors are a teenager's worst nightmares given breath.
Comfort Food
It is a collection of twenty three writers and seven artists. The vibrant vivid cover represents the contents inside the pages. The common denominator is anything fast food related, and the ensemble runs the gamut from zombie delicacies to child hungry playgrounds. No food was safe, burgers, seafood, even the healthy conscious vegetarian cuisine has a darker ickier side.
The Last Dragon (Dragon Speaker, 1)
Manning, the evil Lord rules through fear and magic over the fallen kingdom in the year 1144. The only hope seems to lie in the prophecy that a dragon speaker will appear to save the people. Jacob, a small young man is an unlikely hero. He walks with a limp and is the only one that can speak to the dragons. When the last dragon returns he is the only one that can communicate with her. Jacob and his friends Orson and Lia must rescue the egg of the world's last dragon. This is a hi-lo (high interest, low vocabulary) book for reluctant teen readers.
Scars
Scars is a fiction book about Kendra, a lesbian teen who was sexually abused but doesn't remember who abused her. As her abuser starts leaving her threatening messages, Kendra uses self-harm, as well as art and therapy, to cope. Kendra is aware that she copes with her emotional pain through self-harm and tries to seek help through a therapist. Scars is a compelling story of the teen survivor, Kendra and her journey to becoming a person she wants to be.
SkinWalkers (Walking Both Sides)
Claire and her cousin Kelsey are hunting and Kelsey ends up shooting a deer Skinwalker. They soon find themselves captured by Skinwalkers seeking revenge. When angry villagers attack the Skinwalker camp, Claire finds herself in a difficult situation. Who will she choose and whose side is she really on? This is a hi-lo (high interest, low vocabulary) book for reluctant teen readers.
Hunted
Hunted is a paranormal fantasy/dystopian book about Caitlyn, a teen telepath in a world where Paranormal powers are illegal. Caitlyn is on the run from government troopers. Whet Caitlyn falls for Alex, a Normal, and discovers dangerous renegade Paranormals, Caitlyn must decide between staying in hiding to protect herself, or taking a stand to save the world. It is a journey in which Caitlin must make decisions in order to do what is right. Cheryl drew on her abuse experiences (and specifically ritual abuse and torture) to write Hunted, just as she did with Scars.
Influences
Cheryl Rainfield is one of the many authors of this day and age that has influenced darker subject matter in novels for the life of teens. With correlation to her writing; she has inspired many to speak out against abuse and feelings of teen angst. Rainfield has also been reviewed in many blogs, newspapers, and magazines such as the Torontoist. In many articles she is portrayed as a notable writer in the subjects of inner strength and about self acceptance. The nature of her books are about love and being a strong individual in the most extreme emotional conditions. Throughout her career, she has also made many public appearances like Daytime Toronto (TV) and as well as numerous radio interviews. On her website Cheryl Rainfield states, "I write about some of the harsh things teens go through ... things that shouldn't be hidden…". The ideas from her books come from experiences she has faced as a teenager and ones that many young adults may have confronted in their lives.
Awards
She was a finalist for the 2010 Governor General's Literary Awards for Scars, which was also a nominee for the 2011 American Library Association (ALA) Stonewall Book Award, and was #1 on YALSA's 2011 Top 10 Quick Picks for Reluctant Readers, and was on ALA's 2011 Rainbow Project List.

Leonora Cannon Taylor (October 6, 1796 – December 9, 1868) was a member of the Relief Society organization at the time of its origin and the first wife of John Taylor, the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
Personal life
On October 6, 1796 in Peel, Isle of Man, Leonora Cannon was born to George Cannon and Leonora Callister. As the oldest daughter in the family, when Leonora's father died when she was thirteen she went away to London to work and help support her family.
While in London, she explored religion and joined the Methodists. Given the opportunity, she eventually moved to Canada where she met John Taylor, a Methodist preacher at the time. They married in Toronto, Canada in 1833. After having two children, they were introduced to the Latter Day Saint movement by Parley P. Pratt. The Taylors were baptized into the Church of Christ, the original name of the church founded by Joseph Smith, in 1836 and moved to America to join the other members of the church.
The couple traveled with and served in the church all their lives. They had eight children together, many of whom did not survive into adulthood. Leonora preceded her husband in death, dying of pneumonia in 1868 in Salt Lake City.
LDS Church involvement
Taylor was an original member of the Relief Society when it was formed in March 1842. She and her family traveled around the country with the members of the LDS Church throughout her life, living in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa Territory, and Illinois and eventually settling in Salt Lake City, Utah. Leonora Taylor was said to be the first pioneer to plant fruit trees after arriving in the Utah territory, and had a large fruit tree orchard. Throughout this time she cared for her family, especially her husband, John, who served in the church in many capacities. She was left alone with the children during her husband's missionary service in Great Britain and nursed him back to health when he was shot in the incident at Carthage Jail where Joseph and Hyrum Smith were killed.
On December 5, 1847, her husband re-baptized, common during the Mormon Reformation.

Georg Humann (8 December 1847, in Rellinghausen (now a suburb of Essen) – 18 January 1932, in Aachen) was a German art historian.
Life
Humann belong to a long-established Essen family, his father was steward of the estates of Schloss Schellenberg. Humann studied architecture, like his better known cousin Carl Humann, the discoverer of the Pergamon altar. He attended the Polytechnische Schule Hannover from 1873 to 1876. After completing his studies, he returned to Essen, where he dwelt in his maternal family home. For health reasons he was unable to work as an architect.
Humann dedicated himself to the Essen Cathedral Treasury and Minster, stimulated by the gothicization of the Minster from 1880. Humann represented an alternative perspective to that of the architect in charge, Peter Zindel, whose plans foresaw the gothicization of the westwerk. Humann prevailed over him when he called in the Prussian conservator Heinrich von Dehn-Rotfelser. Humann's books derive from his work on the Minster and its treasury and were highly valued by his contemporaries, such that Georg Dehio used Humann's line drawings for his section on Essen Minster in his Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmäler (Handbook of German Artistic Monuments).
Humann received an honorary doctorate from the Royal Theological and Philosophical Academy of Münster for his research in 1908, as well as Honorary membership of the Essen Historical Society. After his house in Essen had to be sold in 1897 because of an inheritance dispute, Humann settled in Aachen, where he lived in the Vinzenzstift from 1900 and died in 1932.
His private library, with around 300 individual volumes on art history as well as his own work was donated by Humann to the Stadtbibliothek Aachen after his death.
Legacy
Many of Georg Humann's art historical conclusions have been superseded by newer research, but his works are still used today, because Humann's observations, descriptions and drawings are very precise. Therefore, his work enables in many cases a comparison of present conditions with those before the First World War. In 1890 Humann proposed an early date for the Essen Westwerk on stylistic grounds, which was not accepted but has lately been taken up once more.
Humann's intervention to protect the Ottonian style of Essen's Westwerk saved it from being converted into a neo-Gothic building. Furthermore, during the preparation of his book about the Cathedral Treasury, he discovered that the wooden interior of the Golden Madonna was full of woodworm, prompting restoration work without which the figure would probably not have survived.

Ion Țurcanu (born January 15, 1946 in Găureni, Nisporeni) is an author, educator, historian, memoirist, professor, former member of the Parliament (1990–1994), politician and Romanian writer from Moldova.
He is one of the 277 MPs of the first parliament of the former RSS Republic (later the Republic of Moldova), who voted for the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova on 27 August 1991.
Biography
Țurcanu was born on January 15, 1946 in Găurenii de Sus, former Lăpușna County. He graduated from the State University of Moldova in 1969 and obtained his doctorate in history in 1975. He started work as a teacher in the village Bărboieni, Nisporeni District. After getting his PhD, he became a senior lecturer, then lecturer at the Pedagogical Institute "Ion Creangă". In the years 1993-1997, he worked at the History Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova. Since 2001, he returned to his professorial career in higher education, this time at the State University of Moldova.
He participated in the creation, in 1988, of the Democratic Movement in Support of the Perestroika, (the future Moldovan Popular Front). In the years 1987–1990 he published a series of articles in the Chișinău press to inform the population on the thorny subjects of the history of Bessarabia, and that of all Romanians. In the same context he initiated a critique of the historiographical Soviet propaganda that falsified the historical themes mentioned above. In the years 1990-1994 he was a Member and Secretary of the Parliament. In 1998, he established the New Moldavian National Party, which participated in the local elections in 1999 and parliamentary ones in 2001, but without obtaining significant results.
Țurcanu was the editor of the publishing house "Moldovan Book" (1989–1990), and director of the publishing house "Universitas" (1993-1996). In the 1990–1993 he published, as editor, the historical journals "Patrimoniu" "Magazine of History of Moldova."
He published a number of studies and books on various historical subjects: the political events in Bessarabia in 1917-1918, Bessarabian agrarian relations during the interwar period, the Bessarabian famine of 1946-1947, the resistance movement against Soviet occupation of Bessarabia during 1944-1953, political and ethnic relations east of the Carpathians in the period preceding the founding of the Romanian state of Moldova, the Greco-Roman antiquity on the Lower Dniester and the neighboring territories, the philosophy of history from the perspective of some Romanian thinkers, historical bibliography of Bessarabia and Transnistria, social and political realities in modern Moldova etc. He wrote several syntheses of Romanian history. He also had some literary preoccupations, which occurred occasionally and with great interruptions.

Black and White is a Big Finish Productions audio play based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.
Plot
The search for the Doctor continues. The Black TARDIS brings Ace and Aristedes to the setting of the classic, epic, Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf. The White TARDIS brings Hex and Sally to the same location, but sixteen years later.
Cast
Seventh Doctor – Sylvester McCoy
Ace – Sophie Aldred
Hex – Philip Olivier
Captain Aristedes – Maggie O'Neill
Private Sally Morgan- Amy Pemberton
Garundel – Stuart Milligan
Young Beowulf – Michael Rouse
Old Beowulf – Richard Bremmer
Weohstan – John Banks
Wiglaf – James Hayward
Continuity
Aristedes was first heard in the 2010 story, Project Destiny, where she was working for The Forge, just before its destruction.
Sally met the Doctor in the 2011 story House of Blue Fire. She also features in Project: Nirvana, alongside Captain Aristedes.
The exterior of the TARDIS was rendered white during the events of the 2009 story, The Angel of Scutari. It remained as such in the stories, Project: Destiny, A Death in the Family, Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge and Protect and Survive.
Ace and Hex discovered that the Doctor was missing at the start of the previous story, Protect and Survive.
The TARDIS with the black exterior was inexplicably seen in a trilogy of solo Seventh Doctor stories, Robophobia, The Doomsday Quatrain and House of Blue Fire, which, for the Doctor, take place between Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge and Protect and Survive. It is also in Project: Nirvana, which takes place just before Black and White.
Aristedes recalls unheard adventures with the Doctor and Sally, fighting Elder Gods such as The Animus (encountered by the First Doctor in the television story The Web Planet) and The Great Intelligence (encountered by the Second Doctor in the television stories The Abominable Snowmen and The Web of Fear). She also mentions The Mi'en Kalarash, which Sally fought in House of Blue Fire. Ace recalls her encounter with The Celestial Toymaker in the audio The Magic Mousetrap.
The Fast Return Switch was used in the 1964 First Doctor television story, The Edge of Destruction. It has also featured in Big Finish audios such as Seasons of Fear and Neverland.
The Doctor is heard in several scenes that take place at other points in time. He is heard obtaining the Black TARDIS, just after the events in Alaska in Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge. He is then heard taking it on its first three trips, (Robophobia, The Doomsday Quatrain and House of Blue Fire). He is also heard recruiting Sally, in a scene taken from the end of House of Blue Fire. And he is heard recruiting Captain Aristedes, just after House of Blue Fire.
Notes
Stuart Milligan previously played U.S. President Richard Nixon in the 2011 Eleventh Doctor television episodes, The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon, as well as Emerson Whytecrag in Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge.
An alternative cover was first released, to conceal the inclusion of the characters Sally and Aristedes. The actual cover was not revealed until just before the audio's release.

British–Portuguese relations are foreign relations between Portugal and the United Kingdom. The relationship, largely driven by the nations' common interests as maritime countries on the edge of Europe and close to larger continental neighbours, dates back to the Middle Ages in 1373 with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. The two countries now enjoy a friendly and close relationship.
History
The history of the relationship between Portugal and Britain dates back to the Middle Ages. English Crusaders aided Portugal in the Reconquista, and after taking Lisbon in 1147, the first King of Portugal Afonso Henriques made the Englishman Gilbert of Hastings the Bishop of Lisbon. In 1373 the Kingdom of England signed the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, the oldest alliance in the world still in force. The alliance was formalised by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, and in 1387 Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, was married to John I of Portugal.
During the late 16th century England found itself fighting against Spain which at this time was in personal union with Portugal. The English Armada was launched as part of this conflict in an attempt to restore Portuguese independence and counter both Spanish and Portuguese military ships which formed the Spanish Armada.
A further marriage between the Portuguese and English royal families occurred with the Marriage Treaty in 1662 when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. Her dowry gave Britain Tangiers and Bombay, plus free trade to Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Asia. In return Charles raised a brigade of troops to serve in Portugal's Restoration War against Spain. Catherine is credited with popularising tea, which is now seen as a key part of British culture. In 1703, Portugal joined an alliance of England and the Netherlands in the War of the Spanish Succession against France and Spain. That same year, Portugal and England signed the Methuen Treaty. In the 18th century, the two nations were allies in the Seven Years' War.
The 19th century saw the alliance between Portugal and the United Kingdom come into effect once more when Napoleon Bonaparte built the Continental System, which Portugal refused to join, leading Napoleon to invade. In 1807 Napoleon's army attacked Lisbon, forcing the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil under the protection of the British Royal Navy. In the later half of the century, as Portugal's imperial power declined following Brazil's independence, there were disputes between itself and the United Kingdom in southern Africa (1890 British Ultimatum) which was a great embarrassment for the Portuguese monarchy and colonial prestige. Portugal was one of the Allies of World War I along with Britain. While officially neutral in World War II, Portugal remained friendly to the British, a counterpart to Spain's cooperation with the Axis.
World Wars
Portugal was an official Allied Power in World War I; Portuguese troops were the first to be gassed by German soldiers, yet they received nothing after the Treaty of Versailles. In World War II, Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar was committed to the six-century-old treaty (which had been renewed in 1899). Portugal provided assistance not by declaring war but by helping Spain stay neutral and by assuming a co-belligerent status against Germany by leasing air bases in the Azores to the Allies in 1943. It cut off vital shipments of tungsten to Germany in 1944, after heavy Allied pressure. Lisbon was the base for International Red Cross operations aiding Allied POWs, and a main air transit point between Britain and the U.S.
Post 1945
The states are members of NATO and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. There have been several state visits between the nations.
The President of Portugal Francisco Craveiro Lopes paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in October 1955.
The President of Portugal António Ramalho Eanes paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in November 1978.
The President of Portugal Mário Soares paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in April 1993.
The President of Portugal Jorge Sampaio paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in February 2002.
The President of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in November 2016.
Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom paid state visits to Portugal in February 1957, and in March 1985.

Colonisation of Britain and Portugal in China
In 1557 and 1842, and in 1898, Britain and Portugal established Hong Kong and Macau on both sides of the Pearl River Estuary along the coast of Guangdong Province. Today, Hong Kong and Macau have been established a Chinese Special Administrative Regions on 1 July 1997 and 20 December 1999, and ended the rule of 156 and 442 years, respectively, for British and Portuguese.

Ethel Creek Station is a pastoral lease that operates as a cattle station.
It is located about north east of Newman and south of Nullagine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It had about double frontage to the Fortescue River and adjoins Roy Hill, Balfour Downs, Three Rivers, Muura Munda and Sylvania Stations. The country is mostly alluvial flats that support a variety of grasses.
The station was established in about 1880 by Charles Smith. A new stock route passed through the area in 1895.
Jack Bates, the drover husband of Daisy Bates, acquired Ethel Creek at some time before 1902. The Bates family, including the 15-year-old Arnold Bates, bought cattle at Roebuck Plains, near Broome and overlanded the 770 head of Hereford cattle for over back to Ethel Creek. The journey took about six months and although they lost 200 head along the way they still made a profit of over !,000. The Bates' were legally separated in 1912.
Messrs J and L Smith acquired the property in about 1902 and placed it on the market in 1928. At this time Ethel Creek comprised of land with a carrying capacity of either 17,000 cattle or 120,000 sheep. In addition to the many pools along the Fortescue River stock were watered by 38 wells that were fully equipped with engines, mills and troughing. The property had over of fencing dividing it into nine paddocks. A six-room homestead, with additional workers cottages, a post office, store and two outcamps were included along the buildings on Ethel Creek. During the 1970s until the late 1980s the property was run by Rex Ericson and his wife Olga and their children Michael, Brett, Craig and Tania. Tania died during transit, as a result of a motor vehicle accident at age 14, on the property and is buried in the station cemetery. Olga was also buried at the Ethel creek cemetery in 2010, at her request to be beside her beloved daughter. Rex Ericson found himself named in the Stockman's Hall of Fame, for the era in which had run, not only the large station of Ethel Creek but Roy Hill, Balfour Downs and Marillana. The largest land title under one management recorded in Western Australia. The family moved to neighbouring Mount Divide station in the late 1980s.
Since 1989 the property has been managed by Barry and Bella Gratte, who were running 5,000 head of droughtmaster and shorthorn cross-bred cattle.
BHP currently owns the property which is run in conjunction with Marillana Station, together the two properties have a combined area of .

Guidelines
To be included, entries must be notable (have a stand-alone article) and described by a consensus of reliable sources as "terrorism".
List entries must comply with the guidelines outlined in the manual of style under MOS:TERRORIST.
Casualty figures in this list are the total casualties of the incident including immediate casualties and later casualties (such as people who succumbed to their wounds long after the attacks occurred).
Casualties listed are the victims. Perpetrator casualties are listed separately (e.g. x (+y) indicate that x victims and y perpetrators were killed/injured).
Casualty totals may be underestimated or unavailable due to a lack of information. A figure with a plus (+) sign indicates that at least that many people have died (e.g. 10+ indicates that at least 10 people have died) – the actual toll could be considerably higher. A figure with a plus (+) sign may also indicate that over that number of people are victims.
If casualty figures are 20 or more, they will be shown in bold. In addition, figures for casualties more than 50 will also be underlined.
Incidents are limited to one per location per day. If multiple attacks occur in the same place on the same day, they will be merged into a single incident.

The Mexican animation industry is a part of Mexico's domestic film industry. It utilizes primarily the flash, CG, and traditional animation formats, typically produced on a small budget. It began in 1915 with the first animated film of the country, Mi Sueño, and continues decades later.
History
Early years
The first documented Mexican animation is Mi Sueño. The film was made in 1915 and the author remains unknown. First known Mexican animator is Miguel Angel Acosta, who made more than two-hundred animated films of about thirty seconds each. Other early pioneer of Mexican animation was the painter Juan Arthenack. Salvador Pruneda, Bismarck Mier, and Salvador Patiño, founded an animation studio in Mexico City after taking inspiration from Fleischers and Disney during the 1920s. Pruneda adapted the comic strip Don Catarino y su apreciable familia, which was screened in 1934 despite remaining unfinished. Pruneda tried to make an animated sequence for the film Revista Musical, but the project failed due to financial problems.
In 1934, the otolaryngologist Alfonso Vergara Andrade founded AVA Studios in Mexico City with Antonio Chavira and Francisco Gómez. After three years, the studio produced eight shorts. The first short was Paco Perico en première (Paco Perico's Premiere, 1935), a gag film according to the American model. In 1936, Los cinco cabritos (The Five Little Goats, 1936), directed by Bismarck Mier, was released. This film was a Mexican version of Disney's Three Little Pigs (1933), and was the first Mexican colour animated film, using a bichromic Cinecolor or bicolor. The next film was Noche Mexicana (Mexican Night, 1937). In 1939, AVA went out of business.
In 1942 and 1943, Walt Disney and his wife visited Mexico. The Mexican Ernesto ´Ernie´ Terrazas and Edmundo Santos crossed the border with him. After the visit, Disney produced The Three Caballeros, which world premiere was screened at Cine Alameda in Mexico City in 1944. However for unexplained reasons, the Mexican animators didn't receive screen credit. The main Mexican character Pancho Pistolas was invented by Terrazas.
The Mexican advertising agent Santiago Reachi Fayad (aka Santiago Reachi) hired four Californian animators and founded Caricolor studio, a project that was interrupted by the Second World War. The studio only completed the short-film Me Voy de Cacería (I Go Hunting), an homage to Tequila. In 1947, Caricaturas Animadas de México was founded, a study that most prominent work was an animated fly in the first Mexican film that combined live-action and animation, El diablo no es tan diablo (The Devil Is Not So Devil, 1949).
1950s - 1980s
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, animation in Mexico was restricted to short formats. Also around this time, the country was responsible for the Animation services provided in Rocky & Bullwinkle set up by the sponsor to produce the series on a low budget. In 1972, La familia Telemiau ("The Telemiau Family") was the first animated television series to be created in Mexico. It received poor ratings due to competition with more popular American animated shows, such as those of Hanna-Barbera. The country's first feature film, Los tres Reyes Magos ("The Three Wise Men"), was released in 1974, directed by Fernando Ruiz. It was a Mexican adaptation of the Biblical Magi story.
In 1984, the country released its first successful animated film, Katy La Oruga ("Katy the Caterpillar"). It was followed by a made-for-television sequel, Katy, Kiki y Koko. In 1987, Mexico released Las Aventuras de Oliver Twist ("The adventures of Oliver Twist"), a Mexican film adaptation of Charles Dickens Oliver Twist book. It was the second animated film directed by Fernando Ruiz.
2000s - 2010s
After 1987, the creation of animation significantly slowed down, as not much was done in the 1990's, with the exception of advertising. It did not fully restart until 2003, when Mexico City-based animation studio, Ánima Estudios, released Magos y Gigantes (Wizards and Giants). The company later released Imaginum, in 2005. Since then, Ánima Estudios has produced more films and animated content for television.
In 2006, Huevocartoon, a popular multimedia brand focused on eggs, released its first feature film, Una pelicula de huevos. It proved to be a box-office success, grossing $142.3 million pesos. It held the record as the highest-grossing Mexican animated film of all time for nine years. It was followed by two sequels. Founded in 2001, Huevocartoon has produced a lot of animated internet content, funded by its advertising campaign.
In the same year, El Chavo Animado (an animated version of the popular comedy El Chavo del Ocho series), premiered in Televisa networks with high ratings. It ran until 2014.
In 2007, Animex Producciones released La leyenda de la Nahuala, directed by Ricardo Arnaiz. It grossed $42.2 million pesos and was one of Mexico's highest-grossing animated films at the time. It was followed by even more successful sequels and a television series.
In 2011, Don gato y su pandilla, an animated film based on Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat series was released successfully, earning $112.25 million pesos in its theatrical run. It was followed by a computer animated prequel. Both films were produced by Ánima Estudios.
Un gallo con muchos huevos ("A rooster with many eggs"), a computer animated film, was released in 2015. It grossed $167.8 million pesos, breaking box-office records in Mexico, overtaking the original Huevos film as Mexico's highest-grossing animated film.
In 2012, Villainous, a comedy web series created by Alan Ituriel, premiered on internet platforms. The series gained unexpected popularity and was picked up for television by the Latin American branch of Cartoon Network. It was shown on the network's Anything application on digital devices in 2016.
In 2017, Ánima Estudios, Latin America's largest animation studio, was recognized by Forbes Mexico. as the region's most important and successful animation studio.
2020s - present
In 2020, Ánima Estudios has released the superhero film, La liga de los 5, which is a first for the Mexican cinema industry. Marvick Núñez, first time director and an experienced animator since 1996, explained the entire process of the country's animation industry which he calls it "very small". "Let's say I had to see the birth of modern industry, the way we perceive animation now[.] [Y]ou didn't even think about dreams that a studio would make an animated movie in Mexico," said Núñez. He also stated that despite the frequent successes of the films, the industry has not gained global attention, adding that it "is emerging and is gradually gaining ground." He later added that a reasoning for the industry's lack of sufficient quality is due to a limited amount of universities in the country dedicated to animation and gaming, as well as the singular focus on an animation element over multiples. "Here in Mexico it seems to me that there are hardly two or three universities focused entirely on it," he said. “More people need to know how to make animation with all the departments they need: character design, art design, backgrounds… not only to animate the character, that's just one of the departments."

Movimiento de Agrupaciones Obreras ('Workers Groups Movement', abbreviated MAO) was a political labour organization in Argentina. MAO was founded in mid-1957 by a Nahuel Moreno's Trotskyist tendency (which had been organized in the Revolutionary Workers Party, POR, until that party had merged into the Socialist Party of the National Revolution in 1954). MAO formed part of the trade unionist resistance to the Revolución Libertadora.
On July 23, 1957, MAO began publishing the weekly newspaper Palabra Obrera ('Workers Word'). The organization became commonly known by the name of its publication.
Through MAO, Moreno's group sought to practice entryism in the Peronist movement.
MAO was disbanded in the early 1960s.

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific "All-America" and typically referred to as "All-American athletes", or simply "All-Americans". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2020 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2019–20 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.
A consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and Sporting News to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.
Before the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. Sporting News does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.

Die Deutsche Frauen-Zeitung (also known as Frauen-Zeitung, English: The German Woman's Journal) was a German language newspaper founded in 1852 by Mathilde Franziska Anneke in Milwaukee. The paper focused on women's rights issues and ran for around two and half years. It was one of the first feminist journals produced by a woman in the United States.
History
Die Deutsche Frauen-Zeitung (also Frauen-Zeitung, English: German Woman's Journal) was first published in Milwaukee in March of 1852. It was founded and edited by Mathilde Franziska Anneke and was one of the first feminist journals created by a woman in the United States. The publisher of another newspaper, the Volksfreund, gave Anneke space to publish the first issues of Frauen-Zeitung. The paper focused on women's rights issues. In May of 1852, men in the publishing union asked that publishers remove women in the trade. This caused Anneke to tour several cities, including Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Detroit, New York City, and more, to promote the paper. She began to publish the paper in New York and other cities by October of 1852.
Frauen-Zeitung ran for around two and a half years. Anneke stopped publishing the paper when her health began to fail.

The Michelsberg, at , is the highest point in the borough of Bad Münstereifel in the county of Euskirchen in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The hill, which rises near the village of Mahlberg belongs to that part of the Eifel mountains known as the Ahr Hills (Ahreifel), and is the second highest point in the range.
Geography
Location
The Michelsberg rises on the northwestern edge of the Ahr Hills in the High Fens-Eifel Nature Park. Its summit lies 1.2 km east-northeast of the centre of Mahlberg, which extends to the southwestern flank of the hill, and 1.5 km west-northwest of Reckerscheid. Some distance away to the south is the village of Esch with its hamlet of Wasserscheide. All these villages belong to the borough of Bad Münstereifel.
Natural regional classification
The Michelsberg lies within the natural regional major unit group of East Eifel (Osteifel, no. 27) on the boundary of its southern subdivision, the Northern Ahr Hill Country (Nördliches Ahrbergland, 272.1) which belongs to the Ahr Eifel (Ahreifel, 272), with its northern subdivision, the Münstereifel Forest (Münstereifeler Wald, 274.1), which belongs to the major unit of Münstereifel Forest and Northeastern Foot of the Eifel (Münstereifeler Wald und Nordöstlicher Eifelfuß, 274). The western slopes of the hill drop into the subunit of the Münstereifel Valley (Münstereifeler Tal, 274.0).
Height and upland location
According to a trig point marked on the German base map, the Michelsberg is 586.1 m. Its summit, whose height is also given as 588 m, is located on the middle of three tops or kuppen. From the main top, the countryside runs via a saddle at 564.6 m to the Michelsberg North Top, also called the Hohberg (574.5 m). To the southwest is another top, 573.5 m. In topographic maps of the Bundesamt für Naturschutz the summit region is also given a height of 566.1 m.
Rivers and watershed
The watershed between the rivers Ahr and Erft runs over the Michelsberg. Among the rivers and streams that rise on or near the hill are: in the west the Schußbach, whose waters reach the Erft via the Waldbach which rises northwest of the hill. Flowing directly into the Erft in the same direction is the Krumesbach whose source lies to the south. Near its origin rises the Buchholzbach (Trinkpützsiefen, Escher Bach, Lamersbach) which sends its waters down the Armuthsbach south-southeastwards into the Ahr. The Liersbach (Rosensiefen) rises north of the hill and also flows southeastwards.
History
Hunters and gatherers settled on and around the Michelsberg in early times, as evinced by numerous artefact finds (microliths etc.). Archaeologists date them to the Middle Stone Age (9,600 to 5,500/4,500 B. C.). Most of these artefacts are displayed in the Hürten Museum in Bad Münstereifel. In Celtic, Roman and Germanic times the hill was a pagan cultic and juridical site as its former name Mahlberg testifies. Until about 800 A.D. there were sacrificial fires (Opferfeuer) here. After the people adopted Christianity the pagan name was transferred to the nearby village of Mahlberg, while the hill was now consecrated to the Archangel Michael, the guardian of Christianity.
On the southwest flank of the hill is a transmission mast/-tower and, nearby, a water tank.
Pilgrimage
The Michelsberg has been a destination for pilgrims for centuries as the make their traditional pilgrimage annually on 29 September. They make their way along a Way of Sorrows to the Roman Catholic Chapel of St. Michael at the summit.
Reserves
Parts of the protected landscape (LSG) of the Mutscheid Upland (Mutscheider Hochfläche, CDDA no. 555558861; established 2008; 48.9083 km² in area) lie on the Michelsberg. Another one, the LSG Fließgewässer, Auen und Hangbereiche im Bad Münstereifeler Tal (CDDA no. 555558740; 2008; 3.5523 km²) reaches up to its hillsides.
Hiking, transport, leisure
The Michelsberg is often a destination for hikers and, is popular even when it snows because the grass-covered slopes are ideal for tobogganing and the paths in the vicinity of the hill are suitable for langlauf skiing. Running past the hill to the west is the Landesstraße 113 from Mahlberg to Scheuerheck) and, to the southeast, is the Kreisstraße 50 from Mahlberg to Reckerscheid.
From the viewing platform of the chapel tower there is an all-round view that reaches to the Siebengebirge hills, the basalt kuppen of the Hohe Acht, the Hochthürmerberg and Aremberg hills as well as the Schneifel and Rur Eifel regions. In good visibility even the towers on Cologne Cathedral, about 50 kilometres away, may be visible.

History
As ABS-CBNnow! (2003-2010)
Launched in 2003 as ABS-CBNnow!, a service primarily focusing to the overseas Filipino workers where they can watch ABS-CBN programs such as MTB, The Buzz and Magandang Gabi Bayan anywhere in the world using a PC with high-speed Internet or broadband connection. Users can stream directly or download files and are required to install Windows Media Player in order to view contents which are DRM protected. It is one of the first Filipino owned OTT platform.

iWant TV (2010-2018)
From its launch until 2015, iWant TV had foreign contents from many pan-regional television channels such as NatGeo, the Food Network, E!, CNN, and Cartoon Network. These particular contents are now diverted into a new service called Sky On Demand which is exclusive to Sky subscribers.
In August 2015, iWant TV, together with StarFlix (a division of Star Cinema) and Wattpad, released Must Date the Playboy, starring Kim Chiu, Xian Lim and directed by Mae Cruz Alviar, the first movie to be released exclusively through iWant TV and ABS-CBN Mobile service.
On September 26, 2016, a partnership with PLDT and its subsidiary Smart Communications was announced during a signing ceremony attended by Eugenio Lopez III (Chairman of ABS-CBN), Carlo Katigbak (President and CEO of ABS-CBN), Manny Pangilinan (Chairman of PLDT) and other ABS-CBN, PLDT and Smart executives. The partnership will enable PLDT and Smart customers to access the iWant TV website and mobile apps.
In 2018, iWant TV began streaming Filipino-dubbed Japanese anime series and movies that aired on ABS-CBN's original channel, starting with the hit anime film Your Name.

In May 2019, the service adds the 2005 version of the Japanese animé series Doraemon (which airs on Yey!, an exclusive channel of ABS-CBN TV Plus), becoming the second animé title to be streamed on iWant.
A television special called iWant Originals premiered on ABS-CBN's Yes Weekend! Sunday evening block on August 11, 2019, replacing the 14-year-old comedy gag show Goin' Bulilit. Some scenes were edited for the TV version due to strict guidelines of the MTRCB. On August 18, Call Me Tita was the first original series to premiere simultaneously on both iWant and ABS-CBN. iWant Originals was cancelled on September 22, 2019, to give way for the Kapamilya Super Blockbusters movie block.
On March 16, 2020, iWant Originals returned on ABS-CBN's Primetime Bida as part of the special TV programming due to the Enhanced community quarantine in Luzon caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. iWant Originals showcased some of their fresh, most-watched programs.

The German tariff of 1887 was a protectionist law passed by the Reichstag (under the guidance of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck) that raised tariffs on agricultural imports into Imperial Germany. It became law on 21 December 1887.
The tariff of 1885 had raised the duties on wheat and rye to 3 marks per 100kg, with those on oats and barley raised to 1.50 marks. The price of wheat in Prussia in 1886 was 33s.7d. per imperial quarter, in 1887 it was 35s.2d. per imperial quarter. In 1886 the price of rye in Prussia was 6s.9d. per cwt.; in 1887 it was 6s.3d.
Bismarck had requested a wheat and rye duty of 6 marks, but the Reichstag voted for 5 marks. Many of the duties in the tariff were lowered by commercial treaties with Austria-Hungary and Italy negotiated by Bismarck's successor Leo von Caprivi.
Rates
The duties on wheat and rye were raised to 5 marks per 100kg; on oats 4 marks; on barley 2.25 marks; on maize 2 marks; on flour 10.50 marks. The duties on butter, cheese, egg, meat, bullocks, cows, pigs and wine remained unchanged.

Bombette Martin (born 1 June 2006) is a British-American skateboarder. She won the women's park event at the 2021 GB Skateboard Championships. Martin and Sky Brown were selected to represent Great Britain in skateboarding at the 2020 Summer Olympics. She became the first skateboarder to ever compete in a park event in the Olympic Games.
Martin was born and lives in New York City, though she spent much of her childhood in her father's home city of Birmingham, England, and holds dual citizenship in the United Kingdom and the United States. About joining Team GB rather than Team USA for the 2020 Olympics, Martin said, "I like to make the joke that I'm half a New Yorker, and 3/4ths a Brummie! I spent so much of my childhood in Birmingham because my dad is British, so I guess it didn't really cross my mind, or my family's mind, to even try and compete for America. We just decided to try and go for Great Britain and it's worked out."
She was named after her father, Jon "Bomber" Martin, an amateur boxer.
In 2021, Bombette and her brother and fellow skateboarder, Kayo Martin, were featured in a promotional campaign for Gap Inc.

Walter Keil Granger (October 11, 1888 – April 21, 1978) was a U.S. Representative from Utah.
Born in St. George in the Utah Territory, Granger moved with his parents to Cedar City, in 1894. He attended the public schools and graduated from Branch Agricultural College at Cedar City, Utah in 1909. From 1909 to 1911 Granger served as an LDS missionary in the Southern States Mission.
Granger served as postmaster of Cedar City from 1914 to 1922. During this time he served overseas as a sergeant in the Eleventh Regiment of the United States Marine Corps from 1918 to 1919, which saw no combat in the waning days of World War I. He later twice served as mayor of Cedar City from 1923 to 1926 and 1930 to 1932. From 1926 until at least 1930 Granger was also the LDS Bishop of the Cedar 3rd Ward in Ceder City.
Advancing his political career, Granger served as member of the Utah House of Representatives from 1932 to 1937, and serving as speaker in 1935. He then served as member of the Public Service Commission of Utah from 1937 to 1940. In 1941 Granger was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-seventh and to the five succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1941 to January 3, 1953). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1952 but was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate. In 1954 he was again an unsuccessful candidate, in the election to the 84th United States Congress.
Granger was engaged in agricultural pursuits and livestock raising and served as member of the board of trustees of Utah State Agricultural College. After his political life he resumed his farming interests and from 1967 to 1970 served as member of the Board of Appeals of the United States Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture.
After retiring, he resided again in Cedar City, where he died April 21, 1978, at the age of 89. He was interred in Cedar City Cemetery.

Support Your Local Gunfighter is a 1971 American comic Western film directed by Burt Kennedy and starring James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette. The screenplay was written by James Edward Grant. The picture shares many cast and crew members and plot elements with the earlier Support Your Local Sheriff! but is not a sequel. It actually parodies Yojimbo and its remake A Fistful of Dollars, using the basic storyline of a stranger who wanders into a feuding town and pretends to work as an enforcer for both sides. The supporting cast features Jack Elam, Harry Morgan, John Dehner, Marie Windsor, Dub Taylor, Joan Blondell and Ellen Corby.
Garner later wrote that the film was, "not as good as Support Your Local Sheriff".
Plot
Latigo Smith, a gambler and confidence man, is traveling by train in frontier-era Colorado with the rich and powerful Goldie. Goldie wants desperately to marry him, a fate he wants to avoid. He hands the train's headwaiter a generous tip to assist him off the train without letting Goldie not realize that he's fleeing. He sneaks off the train at Purgatory, a small mining town.
He discovers that two mining companies, run by bitter rivals Taylor Barton and Colonel Ames, are vying to find a "mother lode" of gold buried somewhere nearby. Dynamite blasts periodically rock the town to its foundations.
Latigo consults the town doctor about an embarrassing problem that is not immediately revealed, but turns out to be a Goldie-related tattoo. Latigo's great weakness is a periodic uncontrollable urge to bet on roulette; he soon loses all of his money playing his "lucky" number, 23. Penniless, he starts romancing local saloon keeper Miss Jenny. Being mistaken for infamous gunslinger "Swifty" Morgan gives Latigo an idea. He talks amiable ne'er-do-well Jug May into impersonating Swifty. Latigo attracts the attention of Patience Barton, the hot-tempered daughter of Taylor (the townsfolk call her "The Sidewinder"), who desperately wants to escape her frontier existence, attend "Miss Hunter's College on the Hudson River, New York, for Young Ladies of Good Families", and live a life of refinement in New York City. When Latigo and Jug side with the Bartons in a dispute, Ames sends a telegram to the real Swifty Morgan, informing him of their deception.
Swifty arrives in town and immediately challenges the hapless Jug to a gunfight, but at the appointed time and place, Latigo is there in his place, sitting atop a donkey loaded with crates of dynamite. Swifty calls Latigo's bluff, but he is startled by the next mine explosion and accidentally shoots himself. The blast also panics the donkey, which charges into the Bartons' saloon. The dynamite explodes, blowing up the building, uncovering the mother lode, and removing Latigo's troublesome tattoo but leaving him otherwise uninjured.
Latigo finally wins big at roulette after betting $10,000 of the Bartons' money on number 23. From the back of a train taking Latigo and Patience to Denver to get married, Jug narrates the outcomes: Patience never does go to Miss Hunter's College, but her seven daughters do; and Jug goes on to become a big star in Italian Westerns.

Sierra Nevada, also known as Sierra Nevada de Lagunas Bravas, is a major ignimbrite-lava dome complex which lies in both Chile and Argentina in one of the most remote parts of the Central Andes.
Activity in the complex started in Argentina and formed two stratovolcanoes. Later, 12 or more vents formed, some with craters up to wide. Lava flows up to long with flow ridges are also found. It covers a total area of 225 km2. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 1.7 ± 0.4 to 0.431 ± 0.012 million years ago, a lava flow from the neighbouring Azufrera Los Cuyanos volcano that is sometimes considered part of Sierra Nevada is 140,000 years old. Together with Cerro el Condor and Peinado it forms the Culampaja line, a line of volcanoes that reaches Cerro Blanco. Strong seismic attenuation is observed beneath Sierra Nevada. Hydrothermally altered rocks in Sierra Nevada may be the source of sulfate and arsenic in the Juncalito and Negro rivers, and heat sources for regional hot springs. The snowline in the area lies at altitude at Cumbre del Laudo.
First Ascent
Sierra Nevada's main summit was one of the last 6000 metre peaks climbed in the Andes. It was thought that its secondary summit, , which sits on the border, was the highest. New measurements however show that the main summit is entirely in Argentina, 2.6 kilometres east. The complex has 9 main summits.

Shabdavedhi is about Sandeep (Rajkumar), a strict police officer crusading against narcotics. The man is so straight that when his wife Vathsala (Jayaprada) refuses to reveal the identity of a key link in the drug ring that he is investigating, he beats her in lockup. Eventually he overcomes all the usual attempts to throw him off the chase like tarnishing his reputation and implicating him in lock-up death cases and tracks the ring down to its last man.

The Gawis cranium is a portion of a fossil hominin skull discovered on February 16, 2006 near the drainage of Gawis, a tributary of the Awash River in the Afar Depression, Ethiopia. Despite the presence of volcanic ash layers that are key to dating, the cranium is only generally dated between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago due to taphonomic issues.
The 2006 discovery was reported by Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Project, which is based at the Stone Age Institute and Indiana University Bloomington's CRAFT research center.
Discovery and significance
The hominin skull was discovered by Asahmed Humet, a member of the Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project; he found the recently resurfaced fossil in a small erosion gully that empties into the Gawis river drainage basin in the Afar Region, some 300 miles northeast of Addis Ababa. The skull is a nearly complete cranium of what is believed to be a Middle Pleistocene human ancestor. While different from a modern human, the braincase, upper face and jaw of the cranium have unmistakable anatomical evidence that belong to human ancestry. The discovery was reported by Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Project at the Stone Age Institute. Semaw noted the skull fossil could be a transitional form that fills a gap in human evolutionary origins. He described its appearance as intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.
Significant archaeological collections of stone tools and numerous fossil animal specimens were also found at the site.
Gawis is in the Gona Research Project study area situated in the Awash River Valley. Immediately to the east of Gona, also located along the Awash and one of its tributaries is the site of Hadar, where in 1974 U.S. scientist Donald Johanson found the 3.2-million-year-old remains of an Australopithecus afarensis, known as Lucy. The Middle Awash project, site of many other hominin discoveries, is to the south.
In addition to the Gawis cranium, the Gona project area has yielded some of the world's oldest stone tools (2.6 million years old), as well as fossils of Ardipithecus ramidus—hominid, and debated as whether or not hominin—dated to approximately 4.5 million years ago.

Cyprus has a subtropical climate - Mediterranean and semi-arid type (in the north-eastern part of island) - according to Köppen climate classification signes Csa and BSh, with very mild winters (on the coast) and warm to hot summers. Snow is possible only in the Troodos mountains in the central part of the island. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry.
Temperatures
Cyprus has one of the warmest climates and warmest winters in the Mediterranean part of the European Union. The average annual temperature on the coast is around during the day and at night. Generally, the warm season lasts about eight months. It begins in April, with average temperatures of during the day and at night, and ends in November, with average temperatures of during the day and at night. In the remaining four months of the year, the temperatures tend to remain mild, while sometimes exceeding during the day.
In Limassol, in the period January–February, the average maximum temperature is during the day and at night.
In other coastal locations in Cyprus, the temperature is generally during the day and at night.
In March and December in Limassol the average is during the day and at night; other coastal locations in Cyprus are generally during the day and at night.
The middle of summer (July and August) is usually hot, with an average maximum coastal temperature of around during the day and around at night.
In the centre of the island (the highlands) the average temperature exceeds ).
In June and September on the coast the average maximum temperature is usually around during the day and around at night.
While large temperature fluctuations are rare on the coast, the centre of Cyprus has more variations – typically colder winters and hotter summers.
Temperature of sea
The average annual temperature of the sea around Cyprus is , from in February to in August (depending on the location). In the seven months from May to November the average sea temperature exceeds .
Sunshine
In winter, Cyprus receives an average of 5–6 hours of sunlight per day, half of the 12–13 hours experienced at the height of summer. This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe; for comparison, London has 1,461 hours. However, in winter there can be more than four times more sunshine; for comparison, London has 37 hours while coastal locations in Cyprus have around 180 hours of sunshine in December (that is, as much as in May in London).

Precipitation
The higher mountain areas are cooler and moister than the rest of the island. They receive the heaviest annual rainfall, which may be as much as . Sharp frost also occurs in the higher districts, which are usually blanketed with snow during the first months of the year. Precipitation increases from up the south-western windward slopes to nearly at the top of the Troodos massif. The narrow ridge of the Kyrenia range, stretching from west to east along the extreme north of the island produces a relatively small increase in rainfall of around along its ridge at an elevation of . Plains along the northern coast and in the Karpass Peninsula area average of annual rainfall. The least rainfall occurs in the Mesaoria, with a year. Variability in annual rainfall is characteristic for the island, however, and droughts are frequent and sometimes severe. Statistical analysis of rainfall in Cyprus reveals a decreasing trend of rainfall amounts in the last 30 years.
Rainfall in the warmer months contributes little or nothing to water resources and agriculture. Autumn and winter rainfall, on which agriculture and water supply generally depend, is somewhat variable from year to year.
Other information
The Mediterranean climate, warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.
In summer the island is mainly under the influence of a shallow trough of low pressure extending from the great continental depression centred over Western Asia. It is a season of high temperatures with almost cloudless skies.
In winter Cyprus is near the track of fairly frequent small depressions which cross the Mediterranean Sea from west to east between the continental anticyclone of Eurasia and the generally low pressure belt of North Africa. These depressions give periods of disturbed weather usually lasting for a day or so and produce most of the annual precipitation, the average rainfall from December to February being about 60% of the average annual total precipitation for the island as a whole, which is .
Humidity
Relative humidity of the air is on average between 60% and 80% in winter and between 40% and 60% in summer with even lower values over inland areas around midday. Fog is infrequent and visibility is generally very good. Sunshine is abundant during the whole year and particularly from April to September when the average duration of bright sunshine exceeds 11 hours per day.
Winds
Winds are generally light to moderate and variable in direction. Strong winds may occur sometimes, but gales are infrequent over Cyprus and are mainly confined to exposed coastal areas as well as areas at high elevation.

Augsburg Hochzoll is a district in the east of the city of Augsburg. Hochzoll is bordered on its west by the Lech river, whose waters also feed the Kuhsee (Cow lake) to the south of Hochzoll. To the east, Hochzoll shares its city border with Friedberg West, a district of the town of Friedberg.
History
The history of Hochzoll began with a bridging over the Lech river in 980. As the Lech is the historical border between Oberbayern (Upper Bavaria) and Schwaben (Swabia), and as the construction of bridges was very expensive at the time, a bridge toll was raised (HochZoll - High Tariff). Since the town charter for the Friedberg municipality in 1264, the Lech has also served as the border between Augsburg and Friedberg. Today's Hochzoll district then belonged to Friedberg and was referred to as Friedberger Au.
Timeline
The history of the district has always been strongly shaped by the construction of bridges.
1639 the Lech bridge goes up in flames as a result of war and can only be rebuilt through subsidies from the realm of the city of Augsburg.
1646 during the siege of Augsburg by French and Swedish armies, the bridge again goes up in flames.
1796 the destroyed bridge, by order of the French general Moreau, is rebuilt by carpenters from Augsburg.
1797 French troops burn the bridge down again, but in the two subsequent years reconstruction of the bridge takes place successfully.
1800 Bavarian military heavily damages the bridge – but with subsequent immediate repair - complete renewal of the bridge is accomplished a few years later. From 1803 onwards the Auen is increasingly settled east of the Lech.
1818 the scattered settlements comprise 24 estates. Hochzoll, Kolonie, Kolonie an der Lechbrücke and Einöden now comprehensively form the 172 inhabitant parish community of Friedbergerau.
1839/1840 building of a wooden course bridge as a part of the building of the railway line Augsburg - Munich.
1840 at the estate "Stierhof" the first Hochzoll railway station is built on the newly constructed railway line Augsburg - Munich.
1851 a flood destroys the road bridge.
1855 the city of Augsburg builds a new heavy timber bridge for road traffic.
1862 the wooden railway bridge is replaced by a latticed bridge made of steel.
1874 through construction of the Paartalbahn arises the station Hochzoll, the number of inhabitants increase, through immigration of industrial workers, to 350.
1877 establishment of a voluntary fire-brigade.
1878 the road bridge collapses, as floodwater wash away the columns from under the bridge and deposit them 50 meters up the Lech. An emergency bridge is constructed in its place.
1891 a road bridge made of iron replaces the emergency bridge which was established in 1878.
1905 the parish of Friedbergerau takes the name Hochzoll.
1910 a flood damages large parts of the village. The old weir on the Lech – called Hochablass (high drain) – was destroyed by the flood and reconstructed later.
1911 first electrical road lighting.
1913 incorporation: Together with Lechhausen the village of Hochzoll, whose population has increased in the meantime to 1708 inhabitants, becomes a district of Augsburg.
1915/1916 a new school building "Holzerau" is established.
1926 a new steel arch construction replaces the lattice bridge of the railway. This "new" bridge was still in use up to the year 2002.
1928 new building of a 120 meters long steel-reinforced concrete bridge, which was renovated in 1990.
1929 Hochzoll is attached to the town gas supply network.
1934 the Straßenbahn line 6 is built on the Friedberger road, over the Lech bridge, and up to Zugspitz street. (opened on 9 May 1934)
1944 several houses fall victim to allied bombs.
1945, 28 April, the US army rolls unhindered through Hochzoll towards Friedberg.
1946 war refugees find a new homeland in Hochzoll.
1954 there are now over 5.000 inhabitants.
1957 laying of the foundation stone of the European village.
1969 Hochzoll is divided into north and south.
Starting from 1970 the settlement of Hochzoll begins, with the establishment of housing estates south of Oberländer street, to push against its boundaries.
1972 the Eiskanal (a canoe racing channel running parallel to the Lech) is built as part of the 1972 Summer Olympic games held in Munich. As part of the construction measures of the Eiskanal, the Kuhsee is built in the popular local recreation area in the south of Hochzoll. Also in this year the fifth to eighth level auxiliary classes, which were previously provided at the Holbein-Gymnasium (specialising in the natural sciences and languages), were shifted to the now finished Rudolf Diesel Gymnasium. At present over 1.150 pupils visit this Gymnasium (High School).
1976 16 September, the Rudolf Diesel Gymnasium at Friedberger street takes up its training enterprise.
1990 reconstruction of the road bridge
2000–2003 the 1926 built railway bridge, in the course of the four track development of the Augsburg - Munich line, is replaced by two new steel arch bridges.
Road and rail links
The main road through Augsburg Hochzoll is the Bundesstrasse 300, also designated as the Bundesstrasse 2 for the section which goes through Hochzoll. The latter turns to the south in the east of Hochzoll, and forms part of the border between Hochzoll and Friedberg West.
Approximately 200 meters south of the road bridge, a bridge on the Augsburg-Munich railway line also crosses the Lech. East of the railway bridge is the Hochzoll station, at which the Paartalbahn railway line branches off the main route to Ingolstadt. This light-rail route runs roughly parallel to the B 300, while the main route of the Augsburg–Munich line turns south towards Munich.

Brave New Films (BNF) is a nonprofit film company based in Culver City, California. Founded by filmmaker Robert Greenwald, BNF produces feature-length documentaries and investigative videos that seek "to educate, influence and empower viewers to take action around issues that matter."
History
In 2001, Robert Greenwald was a respected film producer and director with nearly three decades of socially conscious television and theatrical credits. After 11 September, he decided to turn his efforts to documentary filmmaking. He teamed up with Richard Ray Perez and Joan Sekler to create his first nonfiction film, Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election (2002), about the controversial poll results from Florida.
Unprecedented was shown in theaters around the country, on cable TV, and made the round of film festivals, bringing home 11 awards. But Greenwald saw opportunities for higher viewership with experimental marketing models. He teamed with former dot-com exec Jim Gilliam to create a distribution model for his next short documentary – Uncovered: The War on Iraq (2004). Uncovered, about the government and media push for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, was distributed through the websites of influential partner organizations such as MoveOn.org, the Nation and the Center for American Progress. The multi-organizational partnership model would become a keystone of Greenwald's filmmaking approach.
The new strategy was successful beyond Greenwald's expectations. The first two days Unprecedented was available, more than 23,000 people requested copies. MoveOn sponsored thousands of "house parties" across the country where people could gather and watch the film. Greenwald made sure that every US Senator and Congressperson was invited to a screening.
Going forward, he and Gilliam tried new approaches to traditional production models as well. Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism (2004) took on Fox News, claiming that they have a pervasive Republican bias. Outfoxed used extensive clips from Fox News under the doctrine of fair use, which allows limited use of copyrighted material for parody or criticism. Turning standard documentary wisdom on its head, Greenwald also used his future audience as active members of his production team by inviting them to work as production researchers.
After Outfoxed "put Greenwald on the mainstream documentary map," he officially registered Brave New Films as a 501(c)4 charity. The new nonprofit went on to produce Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price (2005), using BNF's freshly minted distribution model. In keeping with a developing philosophy of including the audience as active participants in the process, BNF invited 1500 volunteers across the country to shoot footage of their local Walmarts for the film. They also tried a new model for funding their documentary films. An email request for donations to make the movie drew $267,892 in 2 days, in 2004 – 2 years before the word crowdfunding was coined and 5 years before Kickstarter launched.
BNF continued to explore new options for distribution with Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers (2006). In order to facilitate arranging the house party screenings that had become a hallmark of BNF, Gilliam invented Brave New Theatres, described as a mashup between "My-Space, and Evite and Moviefone."
BNF was growing and changing in parallel with the social media explosion on the Internet. New sites like YouTube, Facebook and Hulu had profound impact on their evolving production and distribution models. BNF started a YouTube channel which they populated with hundreds of short viral videos about a variety of progressive issues, including criticism of Fox News; military policy on LGBT servicemen and women; Power Without Petroleum; and much more. At the same time, BNF was developing their multimedia approach to include blogs, websites, petitions, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts with millions of followers.
In 2008, BNF took on presidential candidate John McCain with The Real McCain series of short videos. McCain found himself forced to respond to embarrassing questions about how many homes he owned – a serious issue amidst a historic housing crisis – as well as his spiritual leaders and his health,
among other topics. The New York Times wrote, "Mr. Greenwald shows how technology has dispersed the power to shape campaign narratives, potentially upending the way American presidential campaigns are fought."
Greenwald and BNF returned to long-form documentary with Rethink Afghanistan (2009). However, there was a twist: in order to address a fast-changing topic in a timely way, the film was released in six on-line segments, in "real time" over 2008 and 2009.
In 2010, BNF launched one of its most successful multimedia campaigns, Cuentame, which addresses Latino issues, worker rights and immigration reform. Beyond Bars is another touchstone campaign, that works on the issue of mass incarceration in the US. The Koch Brothers Exposed (2012) film and campaign built awareness of the right-wing billionaires' influence on US government and industry. Under the umbrella of another campaign, War Costs, BNF produced two full-length films, War on Whistleblowers (2013) and Unmanned: America's Drone Wars (2013). For Unmanned, BNF brought drone strike survivors to Washington, and for the first time, congresspeople heard eyewitness testimony from civilians on the ground in Pakistan.
Impact
Brave New Films is notable for both its innovations in documentary production and distribution models; and for the practical impact of its films and campaigns. Its first films "demonstrated to the rest of us [documentary filmmakers] that there was a new way of marketing a documentary." "By employing distribution strategies based on the Internet and the Internet's ability to support ‘user generated content,' to bring his films to mass audiences, Greenwald became arguably, the most influential political documentary maker working in the U.S. and a political entrepreneur with national reach."
The full-length documentaries, short subjects and viral videos produced by Brave New Films have been seen tens of millions of times, across the globe, "which in many cases, amped up debate, raised consciousness, and produced some of the change we have been waiting for." Its work has been covered by mainstream media including New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Time magazine, and The Huffington Post, among others, with a worldwide media reach of billions.
Brave New Films' work "challenge(s) the political discourses of some of the most powerful figures and institutions in U.S. society, including a sitting president and his administration." Examples of such impact include:
The Walmart film forced the largest company in the world to curtail its expansionism. Iraq for Sale and Unmanned both triggered congressional hearings, and have been influential in changing public discourse about the U.S. war efforts.
Brave New Films has earned the ire of political conservatives, who have called the films "agitation and propaganda." But even critics admit "The way [Greenwald] edits and posts his videos online and urges his viewers to take action is innovative and creative."

Mount Williwaw is a prominent mountain summit located in the Chugach Mountains, in Anchorage Municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska. Mount Williwaw, the highest peak of the Chugach Front Range, is situated in Chugach State Park, southeast of downtown Anchorage, and northeast of The Ramp. The Williwaw Lakes lie below the north and west slopes of the mountain and provide pleasant campsites for climbers not wanting to climb the mountain in one arduous day. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1964 by the United States Geological Survey based on a recommendation by the Mountaineering Club of Alaska because an infantry company from nearby Fort Richardson was caught in a williwaw near this mountain in May 1962. Three men died of exhaustion before the group was rescued. The first ascent of this peak was made June 11, 1965, by David Judd, M. Judd, Myers, and Parker via the South Ridge.
Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Williwaw is located in a subarctic climate with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Ship Creek and Campbell Creek.

The Colonial Defence Committee (CDC) was a standing committee of the British Colonial Office between 1885 and 1908. During the second half of the 19th century British Army troops were being progressively withdrawn from colonial garrisons, with the intention being that colonial governments would replace them with locally raised troops. Russian victory in the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War led to increased concerns for the security of the British colonies and a short-term Royal Commission looked into colonial defence. It was replaced by the CDC, which first met on 22 April 1885.
One of the CDC's first actions was to ask the colonial governments to report on the condition of defences, the number of troops and quantity of stores held. Concerned about a surprise attack they also offered advice to the colonial governors as to how to prepare and respond. The CDC asked each colony to prepare a local defence plan for review by the committee. The CDC made recommendations to the governors about improvements to the plans, such a recommendation resulted in the establishment of the Hong Kong Regiment. In some cases, as in Saint Helena, where local means were not sufficient the committee drew up plans for defences which were funded by the British government. The CDC continued the policy that land-based defence was the responsibility of the colonial governments, assisted by the maritime supremacy of the Royal Navy. It also recommended the standardisation of colonial troops' equipment and training to better allow them to deploy alongside the British Army. This was not welcomed by all colonial governments, who were concerned about involvement in foreign wars. The poor performance of the army in the 1899–1902 Second Boer War led to wide-ranging defence reform, including the establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID). The CID had more senior members than the CDC and more political clout. The CDC became sidelined and was absorbed into the CID, being renamed the Overseas Defence Committee in 1908.
Background and establishment
In 1870–71 the government withdrew standing army garrisons from self-governing colonies of the British Empire. This was a key stage in the development of the Empire and removed a significant cost burden from central government. Colonial governments were expected to make their own arrangements to raise forces to carry out internal policing and border defence duties. The move also allowed the British Army to centralise its forces and become more efficient.
The colonial governments were slow and reluctant to raise troops, the costs of which would fall upon colonial taxpayers. The colonies were hampered by the withdrawal of regular troops, which could have acted as models for colonial forces and provided advisers and trainers. Apart from ad hoc advice from Royal Navy officers stationed in adjacent seas or from a small number of officers seconded from the War Office the colonial governments had been left to their own devices.
The British government was concerned that colonial defence was being neglected. This was particularly worrisome during the Russian war scare of 1878–79, which followed Russian victory in the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War. During the war the Secretary of State for the Colonies Sir Michael Hicks Beach had appointed a special committee to inspect the defences of some key ports in the colonies. They found them deficient, requiring £265,000 () of improvements, and only 35–40 suitable cannon were found in Britain that could be sent to augment them. After the war ended the committee was disbanded.
After the war Hicks-Beach remained concerned about the defence of the colonies and established the Royal Commission Appointed to Enquire into the Defence of British Possessions and Commerce Abroad under former Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Carnarvon. The commission found many colonial governments were unable to answer their queries, requiring investigation by Royal Navy officers.
The commission recommended that imperial garrisons in Barbados be withdrawn but colonial under-secretary Robert Henry Meade halted this, concerned that the colonial government lacked the necessary expertise to secure the ports. Meade consulted with the permanent under secretary Sir Robert Herbert and military officers who agreed that a small Colonial Office standing committee was necessary to coordinate defence arrangements. The Colonial Defence Committee (CDC) was approved and met for the first time on 22 April 1885, to discuss the defence of Barbados. It was composed of a mix of army and naval officers. The first chairman was Sir Andrew Clarke, Inspector-General of Fortifications and one of its early secretaries was Captain George Clarke of the Royal Engineers.
Early actions
The Russia crisis had caused panic in some colonies. The Governor of British Ceylon, James Robert Longden, had ordered the movement of of coal and transported the colony's treasury inland. The CDC was determined to stop such overreactions in the future. A Local Defence Committee was established in all dependencies, to devise local defence plans which would be reviewed and approved by the CDC. The focus was on the defence of the colonies in case of a widescale European war.
One of the CDC's first decisions was to ascertain the current condition of colonial defences, for which there had been no regular reports made. In August 1885 the CDC requested that colonial governments report on naval and land defences, the number of arms, ammunition and marine mines stored, the quantities of electrical and telegraph cable held and the number of troops, both colonial and imperial, in the colony.
The CDC was concerned about a surprise assault on a colony and provided advice to colonial governors on actions to take in case of war. The CDC warned governors that they should not permit more than two foreign warships into a harbour at once and no more than one foreign troopship. They warned that any break in telegraph communications might indicate state of war. Governors were advised to guard cable routes, set-up mines and implement black-out conditions. Food, coal and currency was also to be guarded.
Defence plans
The first 19 local defence plans had been prepared by October 1891. Canada was among the slowest to prepare its plan, to the worry of the CDC particularly after the Venezuelan crisis of 1895, and began work only after the intervention of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. By October 1891 the CDC had reviewed some local plans and made the first 150 of its recommendations to governors.
An early recommendation was made on 6 August 1888; that a battalion be added to the garrison at Hong Kong, doubling the infantry available there. This led to the raising of the Hong Kong Regiment of the British Indian Army for service. Between 1895 and 1905 the CDC itself drew up plans for the defence of Jamestown, Saint Helena, which they considered vulnerable to attack from an organised expedition and whose loss would threaten trade in the South Atlantic. These measures were funded by the British government, due to the poor performance of the local economy.
The Secretary of State for War of 1887–1892, Edward Stanhope, wanted to dissolve the CDC and replace it with a high-level Admiralty and War Office committee with more senior staff and a wider remit. This was successfully opposed by the Colonial Secretary, Lord Knutsford, who stated that if the War Office withdrew from the CDC he would find replacement members from retired officers.
Colonial troops
In 1892 the CDC set out, at the request of the Colonial Office, Memorandum 57M that set out the principles of colonial defence. This stated that the defence of the colonies depended upon British supremacy at sea but also noted that it anticipated that the colonial forces could move from a defensive to an offensive role.
CDC and War Office policy was that imperial troops should have no responsibility for the garrisoning of the colonies, which should be protected by colonial troops (who came under the aegis of the Colonial Office), but could be posted to imperial property such as Royal Navy coaling stations. This led to some peculiar effects, for example the officer commanding the garrison at the coaling station in Sierra Leone could not enter the colony proper without War Office permission and had no official communication with the colonial forces of the West African Frontier Force.
The CDC urged that colonial troops standardise their equipment and training, to allow better compatibility on the battlefield. This would provide a pool of colonial troops, perhaps up to 10,000 each from Canada, Australia and South Africa, who could be called upon to serve alongside the British Army at short notice. These plans were resisted by some colonial governments, including Canada and Australia where there were significant factions opposed to involvement in foreign wars. The War Office chose a compromise solution, a cautious programme of standardisation and professionalisation of the colonial forces was to be carried out but the colonies were not expected to make advance commitments that their troops could be deployed overseas.
Decline
The good performance of colonial troops in the 1899-1902 Second Boer War spurred British politicians such as Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery to look for the increased use of colonial forces in British wars. However, with the government focussed on reform of the imperial troops under Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher's War Office Reconstitution Committee, the Royal Commission on the South African War and the Royal Commission on Militia and Volunteers; together with the 1904 establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) left the CDC sidelined. It was ill equipped to engage in political negotiation with the colonies over the deployment of colonial troops. The CDC found it could play little part in an argument between British and Canadian politicians over the command of the Canadian militia, which eventually saw London agree for the British general in command to be replaced by a Canadian military council. In a similar case the CDC and the CID could not persuade the British government that Australia, which contributed a subsidy towards Royal Navy vessels, should not be allowed any control over the deployment of the naval force.
The CDC was essentially a committee of military experts, while the CID had more senior personnel and included political figures. The Secretary of War 1903-1905 H. O. Arnold-Forster, had recommended the disbandment of the CDC when a CID proposal to reduce the imperial West Indies garrison had stalled awaiting CDC approval. This was opposed by the Colonial Office and General James Grierson, the Director of Military Operations. Arnold-Fisher was partly successful and the CDC became an arm of the CID; in 1908 was renamed the Overseas Defence Committee.
Legacy
The CDC is considered the father of the more influential CID (upon its founding the CID had chosen Clarke as its first secretary). It was the first British government body to provide a continual assessment of the defence of the colonies and one of the few to consider both land and sea defence at a time when army and naval policies were sometimes at odds. In common with British cabinet practice of the 19th century no minutes or agendas of meetings of the CDC were kept, though its memoranda survive. In 1909 one of the recommendations of the CDC came to fruition when a meeting with Dominion governments saw an agreement reached for their armed forces to receive standardised War Office training with a view towards becoming an "homogenous Imperial Army".

Tawawa House is an opera written by Zenobia Powell Perry in 1985. It premiered at Central State University in 1987. A fully staged revival took place in 2014 in Modesto, California.
Background
Tawawa House is based on a real-life place in Ohio and set in 1852. In the town of Wilberforce, Ohio, there was a watering hole called Tawawa by the Native Americans in the area. A large, 300 room house, that served as a hotel in Wilberforce eventually became known as "Tawawa House." Tawawa House was "notorious for its popularity among slaveholders and their enslaved mistresses" during the 1850s. Travelers and vacationers were drawn to the natural springs in the area and stayed at the resort owned by lawyer and state legislator, Elias Drake. Slaves that worked at the hotel were able to earn their freedom and get an education. The house was also part of the underground railroad. Later, the site became Wilberforce College. Wilberforce was the first black-owned college in the United States.
Perry found the story of Tawawa House especially interesting due to her own multiracial heritage. When she first moved to Wilberforce, Ohio, she began to research the history of the town and found the story of Tawawa House. Powell dedicated the opera to her parents.
About
Powell started writing the libretto in 1974. The first performance of Tawawa House took place at Central State University in the Paul Robeson Cultural and Performing Arts Center in 1987. It was staged by Lois McGuire and Cheryl Welch and the orchestra was directed by Donald Carroll. Perry's daughter, Janis, performed as a singer in the first performance of the opera. The first fully staged production with sets and complete score was not performed until 2014 at the Townsend Opera in Modesto, California.
The opera starts with an overture using "pentatonic melodic lines and harmonies based on seventh, ninth and eleventh chords. The first chorus is made up of the entire cast. Tawawa House's score, reflects the influence of her teachers, Dett, Dawson and Milhaud. Tawawa House features a "unique fusion of traditional Negro Spirituals and western classical music." Songs written for Tawawa House include "Jumping Over the Broom" and "Follow the Drinkin' Gourd." With intermission, the piece is 2 hours long. The story told in the opera involves the lives of escaped slaves.

The Golden Age of Finnish Art coincided with the national awakening of Finland, during the era of the Grand Duchy of Finland under the Russian Empire. It is believed to span an era from the late 19th Century to the early 20th Century, approximately 1880 to 1910. The epic poetry form known as Kalevala, developed during the 19th Century, provided the artistic inspiration for numerous themes at the time, including in visual arts, literature, music and architecture; however, the "Golden Age of Finnish Art" is generally regarded as referring to the realist and romantic nationalist painters of the time. Notable figures of the time include Akseli Gallen-Kallela, Pekka Halonen, Albert Edelfelt, Jean Sibelius, Eino Leino, Helene Schjerfbeck, Emil Wikström, Eero Järnefelt, Emil Wikström and Eliel Saarinen.
Finnish art became more widely known in Europe at the Paris Exposition of 1900, where the Finnish pavilion was one of the most popular among the attendees.
Artists
There were a number of notable visual artists who are considered to have been part of the Golden Age of Finnish Art.
Painters
The following list of painters does not include artists who are sometimes considered to be part of the Golden Age but generally largely predate it; several notable painters, such as Werner Holmberg, exist in this category. Ferdinand von Wright, the notable Finnish artist whose 1886 The Fighting Capercaillies is considered a seminal Finnish painting, is also regarded as predating the Golden Age. The numerous painters of the Düsseldorf school of painting, such as Berndt Lindholm, Hjalmar Munsterhjelm and Fanny Churberg, may be regarded as Golden Age painters; however, their work is generally associated with an earlier era of artistic development.
Adolf von Becker, however, is regarded as a significant figure to the Golden Age, resulting from his education and tutelage of numerous artists of the era; in addition, Robert Wilhelm Ekman, as an early and notable painter of Kalevala, laid the foundation for similar following works.

Contrary Condor is a 1944 Donald Duck short film by Walt Disney Productions and RKO Radio Pictures.
Plot
Donald Duck tries to collect some eggs from a condor, but things go wrong.
Cast
Clarence Nash as Donald Duck
Florence Gill as Condors
Frank Graham as Narrator
Reception
Rick DeMott on Animation World Network writes: "Produced in the same year as Disney's second Latin American feature The Three Caballeros, this Andres-set comedy is actually more humorous than any section of Donald's work in the full-length film. While the narrator often drains character development from Caballeros sequences, in Condor, the contrast between the narrator's matter-of-fact information and the reality of Donald's shenanigans works in a humorous way reminiscent of the Goofy "How To" shorts. While some of the gags are repetitive and the pacing lags at times, the overall short has enough laughs to be successful. In our more PC age, the idea of Donald stealing eggs for fun is less than sympathetic, but the trouble that ensues gives the baby-snatching duck what he has coming to him I suppose."
Home media
The short was released on December 6, 2005, on Walt Disney Treasures: The Chronological Donald, Volume Two: 1942-1946.
It was also featured as a bonus cartoon on the 2008 DVD, The Caballeros Collection.

Charlie "Choo Choo" Brackins (January 12, 1932 – June 1, 1991) was an American former quarterback in the National Football League for the Green Bay Packers during the 1955 NFL season. Brackins is considered to be one of the first black quarterbacks to play in the NFL.
Biography
Brackins was born on January 12, 1932 in Dallas, Texas. He attended Lincoln High in Dallas.
Professional career
He played college football at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas, from 1951 to 1955. He was a three-year starter for head football coach Billy Nicks and led the Prairie View Panthers to 33 victories in 37 games in the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). He was a big tall passer at and 205 pounds. Brackins was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixteenth round of the 1955 NFL Draft, making him the first HBCU alumnus to play quarterback in the NFL. He played in only one game in during the 1955 season, in the closing minutes of a game against the Cleveland Browns on October 23, 1955. Green Bay lost the game, 41–10, and Brackins threw two incomplete passes. The Packers placed Brackins on waivers after that game. Brackins had tried out as a defensive back with other teams but he never got another chance to play in the league. Brackins died from cancer in 1991.
In 2013, Brackins was elected to the Black College Football Hall of Fame.

Ward No. 137, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is an administrative division of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in Borough No. 15, covering parts of Metiabruz (Lichu Bagan) in Garden Reach neighbourhood in the Indian state of West Bengal.
History
The establishment and evolution of Kolkata Municipal Corporation followed a long process starting from around the middle of the 19th century. The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach, as well as the New Dock Extension area, were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out.
Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144.

Charles Esmond Kearney (March 8, 1820 - January 3, 1898) was the first president of the Kansas City and Cameron Railroad which as a subsidiary of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad and built the Hannibal Bridge establishing Kansas City, Missouri as the dominant city in the region.
He was born in Ireland before emigrating to Texas in 1837. He moved to Kansas City in 1852 where he outfitted travelers on the Oregon Trail and Santa Fe Trail from Westport, Missouri.
During this time he saw the need for direct link from Chicago to Texas. He along with Kersey Coates and Robert T. Van Horn persuaded the railroad to build a cutoff of their line from Cameron, Missouri to Kansas City for the first bridge across the Missouri River which opened in 1869. He was the first president of the subsidiary. The result was the Hannibal Bridge which was the first bridge across the Missouri River. It established Kansas City rather than Leavenworth, Kansas or St. Joseph, Missouri as the dominant city in the region.
The town of Kearney, Missouri (which is on the route) is named for him.

Cape Howard () is a high, flat-topped, snow-covered cape at the extremity of the peninsula separating Lamplugh Inlet and Odom Inlet, on the east coast of Palmer Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by members of the United States Antarctic Service who explored along this coast by land and from the air in 1940, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for August Howard, founder of the American Polar Society and editor of The Polar Times.

A superorganism or supraorganism is a group of synergetically interacting organisms of the same species. A community of synergetically interacting organisms of different species is called a holobiont.
Concept
The term superorganism is used most often to describe a social unit of eusocial animals, where division of labour is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods. Ants are the best-known example of such a superorganism. A superorganism can be defined as "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective", phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food and avoiding predators, or bees choosing a new nest site. In challenging environments, micro organisms collaborate and evolve together to process unlikely sources of nutrients such as methane. This process called syntrophy ("eating together") might be linked to the evolution of eukaryote cells and involved in the emergence or maintenance of life forms in challenging environments on Earth and possibly other planets. Superorganisms tend to exhibit homeostasis, power law scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours.
The term was coined in 1789 by James Hutton, the "father of geology", to refer to Earth in the context of geophysiology. The Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock, and Lynn Margulis as well as the work of Hutton, Vladimir Vernadsky and Guy Murchie, have suggested that the biosphere itself can be considered a superorganism, although this has been disputed. This view relates to systems theory and the dynamics of a complex system.
The concept of a superorganism raises the question of what is to be considered an individual. Toby Tyrrell's critique of the Gaia hypothesis argues that Earth's climate system does not resemble an animal's physiological system. Planetary biospheres are not tightly regulated in the same way that animal bodies are: "planets, unlike animals, are not products of evolution. Therefore we are entitled to be highly skeptical (or even outright dismissive) about whether to expect something akin to a 'superorganism'". He concludes that "the superorganism analogy is unwarranted".
Some scientists have suggested that individual human beings can be thought of as "superorganisms"; as a typical human digestive system contains 1013 to 1014 microorganisms whose collective genome, the microbiome studied by the Human Microbiome Project, contains at least 100 times as many genes as the human genome itself. Salvucci wrote that superorganism is another level of integration that is observed in nature. These levels include the genomic, the organismal and the ecological levels. The genomic structure of organisms reveals the fundamental role of integration and gene shuffling along evolution.
In social theory
The nineteenth century thinker Herbert Spencer coined the term super-organic to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his Principles of Sociology is entitled "Super-organic Evolution"), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, not an identity: Spencer explored the holistic nature of society as a social organism while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism. For Spencer, the super-organic was an emergent property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a "difference between emergence and reductionism".
The economist Carl Menger expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth, but without ever abandoning methodological individualism. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as "the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing 'individual' interests".
Spencer and Menger both argued that because it is individuals who choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, though Menger emphasized this more emphatically. Spencer used the idea to engage in extended analysis of social structure, conceding that it was primarily an analogy. So, for Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of social reality above that of biology and psychology, and not a one-to-one identity with an organism. Nevertheless, Spencer maintained that "every organism of appreciable size is a society", which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.
The term superorganic was adopted by the anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber in 1917. Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed by Alan Marshall in his 2002 book "The Unity of Nature". Finally, recent work in social psychology has offered the superorganism metaphor as a unifying framework to understand diverse aspects of human sociality, such as religion, conformity, and social identity processes.
In cybernetics
Superorganisms are important in cybernetics, particularly biocybernetics. They are capable of the so-called "distributed intelligence", which is a system composed of individual agents that have limited intelligence and information. These are able to pool resources so that they are able to complete goals that are beyond reach of the individuals on their own. Existence of such behavior in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.
Superorganisms are also considered dependent upon cybernetic governance and processes. This is based on the idea that a biological system – in order to be effective – needs a sub-system of cybernetic communications and control. This is demonstrated in the way a mole rat colony uses functional synergy and cybernetic processes together.
Joel de Rosnay also introduced a concept called "cybionte" to describe cybernetic superorganism. This notion associate superorganism with chaos theory, multimedia technology, and other new developments.

Samuel Shenton (8 July 1829 – 3 July 1893) was a building contractor, architect and politician in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. He was mayor of Ipswich. A number of the buildings he designed are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.
Early life
Samuel Shenton was born at Leicester, England on 8 July 1829, the son of a building contractor of that town. At thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner, and subsequently
acquired good practical experience in his trade at Liverpool. On the advice of his sister Elizabeth who had already immigrated to Australia, on 26 October 1850 he sailed on the Tartar from Plymouth arriving in Sydney on 8 February 1851. After a fortnight's stay in Sydney, he arrived in South Brisbane on 1 March 1851 and in Ipswich on the following day. He was accompanied by his mother and sister, and also by the Rev. Thomas Deacon and his niece, Eliza Thorpe. Shenton at once commenced business as a carpenter and contractor. In the early 1850s he also acted as an undertaker in Ipswich, organising burials. However, as he did not have a hearse, the coffins were carried to the cemetery in a firewood cart.
His early works included:
Dr. Challinor's house and shop in Brisbane Street (subsequently destroyed by fire)
Mr. P. Cardew's residence at Rhossilli
the Ellenborough Street Wesleyan Church and parsonage
the Congregational Church in Brisbane-street
the Ipswich School of Arts
Mr. G. H. Wilson's residence
the Lands Office.
He also fitted up the first church in which the Rev. Edward Griffith (father of the Queensland Premier Samuel Griffith) preached on his arrival in the Queensland colony and also the first Presbyterian Church for the late Rev. Dr. Nelson (father of the Queensland Colonial Treasurer).
About 1879 ago he retired from the active work of contracting, and devoted his attention to the architectural part of the business, carrying on business as an architect for many years in the premises, in Brisbane Street, later occupied by his successor, George Brockwell Gill. Buildings designed by Samuel Shenton include:
the Queensland Times
Messrs. Hughes and Cameron's buildings
the Ipswich Hospital premises, including the doctor's residence and the Jubilee ward
the North Star Hotel
residences of J. C. Cribb, E. W. Hargreaves, C. C. Cameron, G. R. Wilson. J. W. Daisey, and R. Gill
Politics
Shenton always took an active part in public matters, having been twice Mayor of Ipswich. He was first elected as an alderman in February, 1863, and served in the Council for three years; was again elected in 1869 for one year; and at the end of that time was again returned, this time at the head of the poll. He occupied the Mayoral chair in the years 1872 and 1873, and during that time had the honour of receiving the Marquis of Normanby and his lady on their first visit to Ipswich, when a public banquet and ball were given to commemorate their visit. In 1888, he was again requested to offer himself as an alderman for the East Ward, and was elected without opposition.
He was also connected with most of the societies that tended to promote the welfare of the town and district. In 1854, he was one of the founders of the subscription library and reading rooms, which formed the nucleus of the School of Arts; took an active interest in the Ipswich and West Moreton Horticultural and Agricultural Society, and the Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society, being once or twice president of the latter. For many years in succession he was chairman of the trustees of the Ipswich General Cemetery, and was as a director, and in other ways, connected with several building societies.
He was also a director of the Ipswich Gas Company for many years, and was one of the trustees for the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. He was among the promoters of tihe Queensland Woollen Company, and held the office of director for several years from its foundation, and also took an active part in the establishment of the present Cotton Company.
Personal life
On 12 January 1953, Samuel Shenton married Eliza Thorpe, a niece of the Rev. Thomas Deacon at the United Evangelical Church in Brisbane. After residing in West Street for several years, he purchased a beautiful site known as Rose Hill, Newtown, where he lived the rest of his life.
Later life
In March 1891, Shenton had a buggy accident, which crushed his side, and brought on lung disease, eventually developing into pulmonary phthisis. Although he was not able to take that active part in public matters which characterised his life up to the time of the accident, he was able to drive about in his buggy until a week before his death, when he had to take to his bed. Despite every care on the part of his wife and friends he died at his villa residence, Rose Hill, Newtown, at 4:20am on 3 July 1893.
The funeral took place at 3 o'clock on 4 July 1893. It was attended by the members of the Ipswich Municipal Council.

The West Somerville Branch Library is a historic library at 40 College Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts, just outside Davis Square. It is a fine local example of Classical Revival architecture, built in 1909 with funding support from Andrew Carnegie, and was the city's first branch library. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
Architecture and history
The West Somerville Branch Library is located on the west side of College Avenue, opposite Morrison Avenue, on the north side of Davis Square. It is a 1-1/2 story granite structure, with elaborate Classical Revival styling. The main facade, facing roughly southeast, is three bays wide, with a center projection housing the entrance, which is set in a round-arch opening flanked by fluted Ionic columns and broad square pilasters. The entry columns support a gabled pediment with a modillioned cornice. The building's corners are quoined, and it is capped by a shallow-pitch hip roof with a modillioned cornice. On each side of the building is a projecting round bay.
The building was designed by McLean & Wright of Boston, and was built in 1906-09 with funding from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie and the city. It is the city's best example of Classical Revival architecture, also exhibiting Beaux Arts details that were then in fashion. It was the first branch library in Somerville. The library has served the city since opening in 1909; it is part of the Minuteman Library Network system.

Wang Shouting (; born on September 3, 1985) is a Chinese professional football player. He plays midfielder for Chinese club Dalian Duxing.
Club career
Wang Shouting was a promising youngster when he played for the Liaoning's youth teams and was good enough to be called up to the Chinese Under-20 football team. He attracted the interests of Shanghai United and would start his professional football career when he joined during the 2005 Chinese Super League season. He made his league debut on July 3, 2005 in a 1-1 draw against Liaoning Zhongyu and then continue to establish himself within the squad. This caught the attention of Dalian Shide and he transferred to them at the beginning of the 2006 Chinese Super League season, however his time with them was short when he was unable to break into the first team squad.
Still a relatively young player with top tier experience saw newly promoted Henan Construction willing to take Wang Shouting and revive his career with them. He would immediately become a regular when he started in their second game of the season against Beijing Guoan on March 11, 2007 in a 0-0 draw.
On 28 February 2018, Wang was loaned to China League One side Shanghai Shenxin for one season. In July 2018, his loan spell was cut short and was loaned to first-tier club Changchun Yatai instead for the rest of the season. Shanghai Shenhua announced Wang's departure on 14 February 2019 when his contract expired.
On 28 February 2019, Wang signed a contract with newly-relegated China League One side Guizhou Hengfeng.

The Chaytor family is an English gentry family on which has been conferred two baronetcies, one in the Baronetage of England and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom and several knighthoods. As of 2008 one baronetcy is extinct.
The Chaytor Baronetcy, of Croft Hall in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of England on 26 June 1671 for William Chaytor, colonel of the Richmondshire Regiment of the militia in 1689. He was the son of Royalist Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Chaytor (1608 – 1665), of Butterby and Haughton Field. In 1675, Sir William married Peregrina, daughter of Sir Joseph Cradock of Richmond. Though Sir William had eight sons and five daughters, none of them survived him, and when he died in Fleet Prison, where he had been held for debt 17 years, in 1720/1 the baronetcy became extinct. His seat of Croft passed to his nephew Henry, who was father of William Chaytor (MP) of Croft and Spenningthorne (1732 – 1819).
The Chaytor Baronetcy, of Croft in the County of York and of Witton Castle in the County of Durham, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 30 September 1831 for William Chaytor, an industrialist and Whig politician who served as MP for Richmond in the first Reform Parliament. He built Clervaux Castle on the manor of Croft. He was son of William Chaytor of Croft and Spenningthorne, Member of Parliament for Hedon (UK Parliament constituency), Recorder of Richmond and Vice-Lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire; his great-grandfather, Henry Chaytor (c. 1638 – 1719) was brother to Sir William Chaytor, 1st Baronet of the first creation.
He was succeeded by his eldest son William Richard Carter Chaytor, the second baronet, who represented Durham in the House of Commons. His grandson, William Henry Edward Chaytor, the fourth baronet, was High Sheriff of County Durham in 1902 and a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Walter Clervaux Chaytor, the fifth baronet, who served as a Justice of the Peace. The fifth baronet also died at a young age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Edmund Hugh Chaytor, the sixth baronet. On the death of his only son, William Henry Clervaux Chaytor, the seventh Baronet, in 1976, the line of the third baronet failed. The presumed eighth baronet, his successor, was his second cousin George Reginald Chaytor, son of William Richard Carter Chaytor, the eldest son of Reginald Clervaux Chaytor, son of the second marriage of the second baronet. He never proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. As of 2019, the presumed ninth baronet was his first cousin once removed, Bruce Gordon Chaytor.
Major-General Sir Edward Chaytor, commander of New Zealand troops in the Boer War and First World War, was the grandson of John Clervaux Chaytor, second son of the first baronet.

Richard Wagener (born 1944) is an American wood engraver known for his prints and fine press books. His work has been collected by over one hundred and thirty public institutions. His first livre d'artiste, Zebra Noise with a Flatted Seventh, was included in Artists' Books in the Modern Era, 1870–2000 at the Legion of Honor, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Victoria Dailey has called Wagener the first California artist since Paul Landacre to achieve prominence in the art of wood engraving.
Works
Wagener's early engravings juxtaposed realistic elements against a field of abstract imagery, frequently incorporating letterforms. In 1990, while teaching at Kala Institute, he met Peter Koch, fine press printer, Berkeley. California. Their collaboration resulted in the publication of Zebra Noise with a Flatted Seventh (Peter Koch, Printers, 1998). Zebra Noise included 26 wood engravings of a zoological alphabet as well as a text by Wagener that is evocative of the American West. Simon Brett, noted British engraver and writer, wrote that “No one else I know of is making such avant-garde grand opera in wood-engraved prints.” Mark Dimunation, Head of Special Collections at the Library of Congress, referred to the book as a “work of maturity and grace.”
In 1999 Wagener was elected as a member of the Society of Wood Engravers in England. This organization was started in 1920 by a group of artists including Lucien Pissarro and Eric Gill.
In 2003, Wagener contributed abstract color wood engravings to accompany The Fragments of Parmenides, Editions Koch, Berkeley. This book, some ten years in the making, features a new translation of the Parmenides fragments by Robert Bringhurst, Canadian poet, typographer and author, and uses two new Greek typefaces commissioned for this project by Peter Koch. The first typeface was designed by Christopher Stinehour in a digital format. The second typeface was cut in steel and cast in metal by Dan Carr at the Golgonooza Typefoundry in Ashuelot, New Hampshire.
In 2006, Wagener established the imprint Mixolydian Editions for his own fine press projects. The first publication was Cracked Sidewalks, vignettes and prose poems about growing up in Los Angeles. The second book was Mountains & Religion, twenty engravings based on imagery from a journey to Nepal and Tibet in 1995, published in 2011. His print Kathmandu Alley, from Mountains and Religion, is a prime example of realistic imagery informed by an abstract sensibility.
The Book Club of California published California in Relief, (2009, thirty wood engravings by Wagener with a foreword by Victoria Dailey). Peter Koch collaborated in the design and printing of this book. Jan Elsted noted: “Wagener's essential engravings of an outer landscape remind us of the echo within ourselves of an interior one, and we respond with grateful recognition.”
In 2009 Wagener was invited to Magnolia Editions, Oakland, California, to develop large-scale woodcut interpretations of his wood engravings. Four images, two from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and two from Nepal, were published in limited editions.
Wagener has produced a number of engraved bookplates that have been collected internationally. He designed the logo for the XXVII FISAE Congress held in Boston, 2000. His bookplates have been featured in Print Magazine; Contemporary Ex-Libris Artists, article by James Keenan, published in Portugal, 2003;[13] California Bookplates by Robert Dickover, published by the Book Club of California, 2006;[14] and Three Centuries of the American Bookplate by James Goode, the catalog accompanying a show of bookplates at the University of Virginia in 2010.[15]
In 2013 Wagener again collaborated with Peter Koch to create a companion book, The Sierra Nevada Suite: Thirty-One Wood Engravings, published by the Book Club of California. This book continued Wagener's observations of the sometimes stark and austere details of California's landscape and featured two fold-out panoramic engravings of Yosemite. It received a Juror's Choice award at the Fine Press show in Oxford, England.
At the 2013 Codex Book Fair and Symposium held at the Craneway Pavilion, Richmond, California, Wagener met the New Zealand poet Alan Loney. After seeing Wagener's new suite of prints based on the idea of weaving, Loney agreed to write a poetic response. The resultant book, Loom, was collaboratively designed and published by David Pascoe, Nawakum Press, Santa Rosa, California and Richard Wagener, Mixolydian Editions, Petaluma, California. The text was printed by Patrick Reagh, Sebastopol, California while the engravings were printed by Wagener at Mixolydian Editions, Petaluma, California. Craig Jensen at Booklab II in San Marcos, Texas did the binding. Loom had its debut at Codex Australia Book Fair held in Melbourne, Australia during March 2014. David Pascoe made a short film about the making of this book that focuses on Wagener, the engraver, Patrick Reagh, the printer, and Craig Jensen, the bookbinder.
The development of a special print for the deluxe edition of Loom led to a small series of prints that looked at weaving from a different point of view. The series of engravings for Loom explored the idea of threads coming together into a weaving. In contrast, the Vestige engravings emerged out of thinking about the ultimate fate of this activity and the beauty in weathered and distressed textiles. Alan Loney subsequently wrote a poetic response to these engravings. Mixolydian Editions published the poem and the prints in a book titled Vestige. This book was entirely printed and bound using handmade paper from Twinrocker Paper, Brookston, Indiana and Papeterie St. Armand, Montreal, Canada. Lisa Van Pelt, Philo, California, bound the limited edition of the book. Vestige had its debut at the 2015 Codex Book Fair.
Edwin Dobb, independent writer and lecturer at the UC Berkeley School of Journalism, interviewed Wagener about his development as a book artist engaged in wood engraving. A highlight of this interview is an examination of the relationship between abstract and realistic imagery in his engravings. This interview was published in the Book Club of California Quarterly, Winter 2015.
Wagener created an engraving of Festival Hall from the Panama Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco during 1915. Wagener printed the engraving for a broadside published by the Book Club of California in commemoration of the centennial of this event. The broadside was designed and printed by Fred and Barbara Voltmer and Li Jiang at Havilah Press, Emeryville, California.
Richard Wagener and David Pascoe again collaborated to create Trading Eights, The Faces of Jazz, a book of jazz portraits engraved by Jim Todd of Missoula, Montana. Also included in the book is an essay by jazz critic and musical historian Ted Gioia and a poem by his brother Dana Gioia, Poet Laureate of California. Patrick Reagh did the monotype composition of the text. Lisa Van Pelt, Philo, California created the paste papers for the covers and did the binding for the edition. Mixolydian Editions and Nawakum Press published Trading Eights in 2106.
In 2016 Richard Wagener and David Pascoe were awarded the 15th Carl Hertzog Award for Excellence in Book Design for their book Loom, published by Nawakum Press/Mixolydian Editions 2014. This national award honors the lifework of one of this country's most accomplished book designers and printers, Carl Hertzog, 1902 -1984. The award is sponsored by the Friends of the University Library of the University of Texas at El Paso.
The Book Club of California awarded Wagener the 2016 Oscar Lewis Award for his contributions to the field of Book Arts. Past recipients of this award include Ward Ritchie, Jack Stauffacher, Peter Rutledge Koch, Patrick Reagh, Carolee Campbell, and Sandra and Harry Reese.
During a meeting in late 2015 to discuss a future book, the writer Edwin Dobb suggested that they resurrect a previously stalled project about exotic desert plants. Within two months Dobb had completed a four-thousand word essay about the origins of botanical gardens. The resultant book was Exoticum, Twenty-five Desert Plants from the Huntington Gardens published by Mixolydian Editions. John DeMerritt of Emeryville. California bound the edition using an abstract marbled paper designed by Pamela Smith of Abiquiu, New Mexico. The book was officially launched at a talk Wagener gave at the Huntington Gardens, San Marino, California in January 2107.
The 2107 Reva and David Logan Symposium on the Artist's Book was held at The Legion of Honor in San Francisco. Wagener gave a presentation on The Fabric of Collaboration. Other presenters at the symposium were Mary Ann Caws, Lisa Pearson, Kyle Schesinger, and Ward Schumaker.
John Hawk, Head Librarian of Special Collections & University Archives at the University of San Francisco, contacted Wagener in December 2016 and asked him to consider writing a Foreword for a book he was writing on the California wood engraver Mallette Dean. After several meetings going over the prints in the university's collection, Wagener agreed to write a short appreciation for Mallette Dean. In 2018 the Book Club of California published Mallette Dean, A Printmaker and His Art with Wagener's Foreword.
In response to a request from Peter Koch, founder of the Codex Foundation, Wagener engraved an image of Spitsbergen Island to be used with promotional material for Codex Nordica, the 2019 Codex Book Fair and Symposium. In addition, Wagener's essay After the Studio Floor is Swept was included in the Codex Papers, Volume One. Wagener also collaborated with Edwin Dobb to produce a broadside, Corrosion, that was included in Words on the Edge: an EXTRACTION Art broadside project of the Codex Foundation that included the poems and lyrical texts of twenty-six writers paired with an equivalent number of notable letterpress printers.
In the late 1970's Wagener picked up a copy of Maxine Chernoff's A Vegetable Emergency from the Beyond Baroque Foundation in Venice, California. Over time this publication began disintegrating due to its acidic paper. In 2017 he conceived the idea of letterpress printing a number of these poems accompanied by abstract color engravings from his Umbraculo Series. Working with Patrick Reagh for casting the metal type and bookbinder Craig Jensen, the book, Teapots & Tympani, was designed and printed at Mixolydian Editions and officially launched at the Codex Book Fair in 2019.
In 2019, Jan and Crispin Elsted at Barbarian Press, Mission B.C., Canada, published a major retrospective volume on Richard Wagener's engraving in their ongoing series of monographs on wood engravers: Endgrain Editions 5: Richard Wagener – a Dialogue with Wood Engraving. The book included 95 of Wagener's engravings from every period of his work, including several in colour, all printed from the blocks. The images are interspersed with prose comments by the artist and others. The book includes, by way of an Introduction, a major autobiographical essay by Richard Wagener, ‘A Dialogue with Wood Engraving', in which he traces his early exploration of art, his discovery of wood engraving, and his journey within the form.
In honor of the eightieth anniversary of the 1940 historic voyage of the Western Flyer by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts, Arion Press published a fine press edition of their book Sea of Cortez. It was originally published in December 1941, two days before Pearl Harbor. Ten years later the book was republished under the title The Log from the Sea of Cortez with a new preface by Steinbeck, “About Ed Ricketts.” This subsequent edition omitted Ricketts' name from the cover giving Steinbeck sole authorship. The Arion Press edition restores Ricketts name as coauthor. Wagener contributed six wood engravings, five of marine specimens and a three-color engraving of the Western Flyer.
Education
He studied Biology at the University of San Diego and earned an MFA in painting from Art Center School, Los Angeles (now Pasadena), California.
Notable writings
His interview of artist Robert Motherwell, conducted in 1974, was first published in a catalog for an exhibition Robert Motherwell in California Collections at the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, and later included in The Collected Writings of Robert Motherwell.
Wagener wrote an essay for Carving the Elements, a companion to The Fragments of Parmenides, discussing the development of his engravings to illuminate the text.

Alexander County is the southernmost and southwesternmost county in the U.S. state of Illinois. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,240. Its county seat is Cairo and its western boundary is formed by the Mississippi River.
Alexander County is part of the Cape Girardeau, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area which is made up of jurisdictions on both sides of the Mississippi River.
History
Alexander County was organized from part of Union County in 1819. It was named for William M. Alexander, a physician who practiced in the town of America (the first county seat). Alexander was elected as a representative to the state House, where he became Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives in 1822.
The county was initially developed for agriculture and settled by numerous migrants from the Upper South. The county seat was moved to Unity in 1833, then to Thebes in 1843, and finally to Cairo in 1860. America, the first county seat, is now within Pulaski County, which was formed from Alexander and Johnson counties in 1843.
Settled largely by white migrants from the Upland South, southern Illinois had many racial attitudes of the South. As African Americans settled in Cairo to seek jobs on steamboats, ferries, in shipping and railroads, there were tensions between the racial groups. White residents sometimes used violence and terrorism, as well as discrimination, to keep black residents in second-class positions. They excluded them from the city government and the police and fire departments, and relatively few African Americans were hired to work in the local stores.
There were three lynchings of blacks in Alexander County in the years between Reconstruction and the early 20th century. The county had the second-highest number of lynchings of African Americans in all of Illinois. The most notorious of these was the lynching of Will James before a crowd of white spectators estimated at 10,000, in the county seat of Cairo, Illinois on November 11, 1909. James was accused of murdering a young white woman. Later that same evening, the mob lynched a white man named Henry Salzner, hanging him in the courthouse square for allegedly killing his wife. Neither man had had a trial, nor was anyone ever prosecuted for the lynchings, even though Illinois had passed an anti-lynching law four years earlier.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.8%) is water. Its borders are partly defined by the Mississippi River and the Ohio River. The lowest point in the state of Illinois is located on the Mississippi River in Cairo in Alexander County, where it flows out of Illinois and into Kentucky.

Law enforcement
The Tamms Correctional Center, a now shuttered super-maximum correctional facility operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections, was located in Tamms, as was the State of Illinois execution chamber. Prior to the January 11, 2003 commutation of death row sentences, male death row inmates were housed in Tamms, Menard, and Pontiac correctional centers. After that date, only Pontiac continued to host the male death row. On January 4, 2013, after years of controversy over inmate conditions, the prison officially closed, negatively impacting the county's economy.
In late September 2009, press reports indicated that the Alexander County Sheriff's office had five of its seven squad cars repossessed as payments had not been made. The sheriff once had 29 deputies, but was reduced to just five at the time of the reports. The Illinois State Police have provided assistance to the county with additional patrols.
Demographics
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 8,238 people, 3,329 households, and 2,093 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 4,006 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 60.9% white, 35.4% black or African American, 0.3% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific islander, 1.4% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 1.9% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 13.9% were German, 6.8% were Irish, 5.3% were English, and 4.7% were American.
Of the 3,329 households, 29.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.6% were married couples living together, 18.5% had a female householder with no husband present, 37.1% were non-families, and 33.6% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.94. The median age was 41.1 years.
The median income for a household in the county was $28,833 and the median income for a family was $44,699. Males had a median income of $35,880 versus $25,743 for females. The per capita income for the county was $15,858. About 11.8% of families and 20.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.1% of those under age 18 and 14.7% of those age 65 or over.
2020 census
Between 2010 and 2020, the population of Alexander County decreased to 5,240. The 36.4 percent decline was the largest of any of the 3,138 U.S. counties. Although the population of the county had been decreasing for decades, the closure of the Tamms Correctional Center in 2013 probably caused an acceleration of the decline in the 2010s.
Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 5,240 people, 2,154 households, and 1,357 families residing in the county.

Politics
Alexander County is unique among antebellum free state rural counties in having a postbellum political history largely determined by a previously disfranchised black electorate. It is most similar in this respect to – though still substantially different from – some counties of the south and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The county was thus solidly Republican until the New Deal, and gradually turned solidly Democratic up through the presidency of Bill Clinton.
In the twenty-first century, the county has shown a trend towards the GOP due to large-scale black emigration and a rapid swing of its Caucasian population toward Republican candidates. This became clear in 2016, when Donald Trump carried the county by 8.3 points—a hard swing from favorite son Obama's 13.6-point victory four years earlier, and the first time the county voted Republican since 1972. An even harder swing was taken in 2020, when he carried Alexander again by 14.2 points, even as the nation as a whole trended slightly leftward. Furthermore, Dick Durbin lost the county in the simultaneous U.S. Senate election, making it his first Senate election in which he failed to win the county and the first Senate election since 1972 in which a Republican won the county.
Despite the rightward swing taken by the county, the city and county seat of Cairo remains overwhelmingly Democratic.

The Sisters are a 1938 American drama film produced and directed by Anatole Litvak and starring Errol Flynn and Bette Davis. The screenplay by Milton Krims is based on the 1937 novel of the same title by Myron Brinig.
Plot
At a ball held on the night of the 1904 presidential election, serious Louise, frivolous Helen, and stolid Grace, daughters of Silver Bow, Montana pharmacist Ned Elliott and his wife Rose, find themselves dealing with romantic prospects. Tom Knivel is about to propose to Louise when Frank Medlin, a San Francisco sports reporter, asks her to dance. Infatuated with the young woman, Frank extends his stay, and at Sunday dinner in the Elliott home he announces he and Louise plan to wed. Although her parents disapprove of the union, Louise leaves for San Francisco with Frank that night. Grace eventually marries the jilted Tom and Helen weds wealthy Sam Johnson, who promises her freedom and asks for nothing in return.
Although facing financial difficulty, Louise urges Frank to complete his novel. When she becomes pregnant, she decides to keep her condition a secret, but finally reveals the truth when she accompanies Frank to a boxing match and the smoke and smells make her ill. Returning home, Louise suffers a miscarriage while climbing the stairs to their apartment, and her distraught husband begins to drink heavily.
Overwhelmed by increasing medical bills and a sense of worthlessness, Frank demands a raise but is rebuffed by his editor who, telling him his writing is suffering as a result of his drinking, fires him. Louise tries to console him by announcing she has found employment at a local department store, but Frank's hurt pride prompts him to forbid her to work. Louise ignores his demand, and while her husband struggles to find a job, she thrives as secretary to store owner William Benson.
Fellow sportswriter Tim Hazelton suggests Frank leave San Francisco in order to get a fresh start, and he decides to accept work on a ship bound for Singapore. When Louise arrives home, she finds a note from Frank and rushes to the docks, where a policeman mistaking her for a prostitute arrests her. By the time she is released, Frank's ship has sailed.
A few hours later, much of the city, including Louise's apartment building, is destroyed by the 1906 earthquake. When Ned is unable to contact his daughter, he travels to San Francisco to search for her, but she has sought refuge with her friend Flora Gibbon in Flora's mother's bordello in Oakland. With William's help, Ned locates Louise and brings her back to San Francisco.
Two years pass, the city has been rebuilt, and Louise is an executive in the department store. When she learns Tom has been unfaithful to Grace, she returns to Silver Bow and is reunited with both her sisters. Meanwhile, Frank returns to San Francisco, and although he is ill, he travels to Silver Bow with Tim when he learns Louise is there. At the ball on the night of the 1908 presidential election, Frank and Louise are reunited and decide to give their marriage another chance.

Original novel
The film was based on a popular novel which was published in 1937. The New York Times said it "is a story that takes hold of you and keeps you engrossed until you have finished it." It instantly became the best seller. It was on the Chicago Tribune best seller list for 19 weeks.
Film rights were bought by Warner Bros.
Production
Casting
In May 1937, Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis were originally announced as female stars.
In December 1937 Warners announced the film would be made the following year from a script by Milton Krims.
In April 1938 Irene Dunne was announced for the lead. By this stage Anatole Litvak was attached to direct and Jane Bryan was to play one of the sisters.
Then in May, Warners said that Dunne had been replaced by Bette Davis. Following Jezebel, Bette Davis was dismayed to be assigned to Comet Over Broadway, a melodrama in which she would portray a Broadway actress who sacrifices her career to care for her ne'er-do-well husband when he is released from prison. "This was the first nothing script I was given since my court battle in England," Davis later recalled, referring to the lawsuit in which she tried to win her freedom from Warner Bros. after being forced to appear in a series of mediocre films. "It was heartbreaking to me. After winning a second Academy Award . . . I was asked to appear again in junk."
Davis opted to go on suspension and remained on suspension when the studio offered her Garden of the Moon, a Busby Berkeley musical, instead. "I was on suspension for a good part of the year following Jezebel. So much wasted time at a time when I felt my career could from then on become a truly successful one... It took a lot of courage to go on suspension. One received no salary... I couldn't afford it, nor could I afford, career-wise, to make films such as Comet Over Broadway and Garden of the Moon!"
After Irene Dunne declined the role of Louise in The Sisters, Davis was offered it and accepted. The script had originally been purchased for Kay Francis, but was shelved when the studio decided to relegate her to B movies for the remainder of her contract. Davis said, "I was delighted with this part because it was a change of pace... I was always challenged by a new type of person to play."
Davis had been put on suspension 1 April 1938. She and Wallis of Warners agreed to a truce, with The Sisters as part of the settlement on 29 April. John Garfield was originally meant to play the part of the reporter; then Fredric March was sought. By May 11 Anita Louise and Bryan had firmed as Davis' sisters and George Brent or Humphrey Bogart were contenders for the male lead.
Eventually Errol Flynn got the role. Although Davis welcomed the opportunity to co-star with Errol Flynn ("he was a big box office star at the time and it could only be beneficial to me to work with him"), she was unhappy to learn he alone was being given billing above the title. "At that time I had no billing clause in my contract," she recalled. "I felt after Jezebel that my name should always appear above the title. That is star billing." It was Flynn' least sympathetic role to date.
After taking a determined stand with the studio, Davis was billed above the title, although second to Flynn. Producer Hal B. Wallis later admitted the billing dispute was the studio's way of keeping Davis in check and "giving her a dose of her own medicine."
Shooting
Filming started June 7, 1938.
For the earthquake sequence, which took three weeks to film but lasted only 2½ minutes on screen, the studio spent $200,000 on special sets that were razed and burned, in addition to using footage from the 1927 Warner Brothers film Old San Francisco. It was felt that the film had to match the earthquake in San Francisco (1936).
Re-shoots
When preview audiences responded unfavorably to the film's original ending, in which Louise married William Benson as she did in the novel, studio executives decided to film a new one in which she reunites with her seafaring husband instead.
On July 18 Flynn reportedly told Warners executives that he would not film a new ending.
"Oh dear, how many films I have been in that have suffered by the change by the studio of the ending," Davis later lamented. "Certainly the original ending of The Sisters was the right one."
In his score, Max Steiner interpolated the folk ballad "Oh My Darling, Clementine" in the scenes set in Silver Bow.
Critical reception
Life observed, "Bette Davis acts with such extraordinary grace, sensitivity, and distinction that hers is already being acclaimed the movie performance of the year."
Variety called the film "a virtual cavalcade of early 20th-century American history" and added, "Davis turns in one of her most scintillating performances. Flynn's happy-go-lucky reporter is a vivid portrayal although his slight English accent seems incongruous."

Tzafria (, ) is a religious moshav in central Israel. Located near Ben Gurion International Airport, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Dan Regional Council. In it had a population of .
History
During the Ottoman period, the area of Tzafria belonged to the Nahiyeh (sub-district) of Lod that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut in the south to the present-day city of El'ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land.
The village was founded in 1949 by immigrants from Czechoslovakia and Hungary on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of al-Safiriyya. Its name is derived from that village and was initially called Safria Alef and then Kfar Tzafria before adopting its current name.

Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, management, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, disorder, and injury in animals. Along with this, it deals with animal rearing, husbandry, breeding, research on nutrition, and product development. The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild, with a wide range of conditions that can affect different species.
Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon, or "vet"), but also by paraveterinary workers, such as veterinary nurses or technicians. This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialties, such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species-relevant roles such as farriers.
Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from nonhuman animals to humans), food safety, and through human applications via medical research. They also help to maintain food supply through livestock health monitoring and treatment, and mental health by keeping pets healthy and long-living. Veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists and other health or natural scientists, depending on type of work. Ethically, veterinarians are usually obliged to look after animal welfare. Veterinarians diagnose, treat, and help keep animals safe and healthy.
History
Premodern era
Archeological evidence, in the form of a cow skull upon which trepanation had been performed, shows that people were performing veterinary procedures in the Neolithic (3400–3000 BCE).
The Egyptian Papyrus of Kahun (Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt) is the first extant record of veterinary medicine.
The Shalihotra Samhita, dating from the time of Ashoka, is an early Indian veterinary treatise. The edicts of Asoka read: "Everywhere King Piyadasi (Asoka) made two kinds of medicine (चिकित्सा) available, medicine for people, and medicine for animals. Where no healing herbs for people and animals were available, he ordered that they be bought and planted."
Hippiatrica is a Byzantine compilation of hippiatrics, dated to the fifth or sixthth century AD.
The first attempts to organize and regulate the practice of treating animals tended to focus on horses because of their economic significance. In the Middle Ages, farriers combined their work in horseshoeing with the more general task of "horse doctoring".
The Arabic tradition of Bayṭara, or Shiyāt al-Khayl, originates with the treatise of Ibn Akhī Hizām (fl. late ninth century).
In 1356, the Lord Mayor of London, concerned at the poor standard of care given to horses in the city, requested that all farriers operating within a 7-mile (11-km) radius of the City of London form a "fellowship" to regulate and improve their practices. This ultimately led to the establishment of the Worshipful Company of Farriers in 1674.
Meanwhile, Carlo Ruini's book Anatomia del Cavallo, (Anatomy of the Horse) was published in 1598. It was the first comprehensive treatise on the anatomy of a nonhuman species.
Establishment of profession
The first veterinary school was founded in Lyon, France, in 1762 by Claude Bourgelat. According to Lupton, after observing the devastation being caused by cattle plague to the French herds, Bourgelat devoted his time to seeking out a remedy. This resulted in finding a veterinary school in Lyon in 1761, from which establishment he dispatched students to combat the disease; in a short time, the plague was stayed and the health of stock restored, through the assistance rendered to agriculture by veterinary science and art. The school received immediate international recognition in the 18th century and its pedagogical model drew on the existing fields of human medicine, natural history, and comparative anatomy.
The Odiham Agricultural Society was founded in 1783 in England to promote agriculture and industry, and played an important role in the foundation of the veterinary profession in Britain. A founding member, Thomas Burgess, began to take up the cause of animal welfare and campaign for the more humane treatment of sick animals. A 1785 society meeting resolved to "promote the study of Farriery upon rational scientific principles."
Physician James Clark wrote a treatise entitled Prevention of Disease in which he argued for the professionalization of the veterinary trade, and the establishment of veterinary colleges. This was finally achieved in 1790, through the campaigning of Granville Penn, who persuaded Frenchman Benoit Vial de St. Bel to accept the professorship of the newly established veterinary college in London. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was established by royal charter in 1844. Veterinary science came of age in the late 19th century, with notable contributions from Sir John McFadyean, credited by many as having been the founder of modern veterinary research.
In the United States, the first schools were established in the early 19th century in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. In 1879, Iowa Agricultural College became the first land-grant college to establish a school of veterinary medicine.
Veterinary workers
Veterinary physicians
Veterinary care and management are usually led by a veterinary physician (usually called a veterinarian, veterinary surgeon or "vet" - doctor of veterinary medicine or veterinary medical doctor). This role is the equivalent of a physician or surgeon (medical doctor) in human medicine, and involves postgraduate study and qualification.
In many countries, the local nomenclature for a vet is a protected term, meaning that people without the prerequisite qualifications and/or registration are not able to use the title, and in many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a vet (such as animal treatment or surgery) are restricted only to those people who are registered as vet. For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may be performed only by registered vets (with a few designated exceptions, such as paraveterinary workers), calling oneself a vet without being registered or performing any treatment is illegal.
Most vets work in clinical settings, treating animals directly. They may be involved in a general practice, treating animals of all types; may be specialized in a specific group of animals such as companion animals, livestock, laboratory animals, zoo animals, or horses; or may specialize in a narrow medical discipline such as veterinary surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology, laboratory animal medicine, internal medicine, and more.
As with healthcare professionals, vets face ethical decisions about the care of their patients. Current debates within the profession include the veterinary ethics of purely cosmetic procedures on animals, such as declawing of cats, docking of tails, cropping of ears, and debarking on dogs.
A wide range of surgeries and operations is performed on various types of animals, but not all of them are carried out by vets. In a case in Iran, for instance, an eye surgeon managed to perform a successful cataract surgery on a rooster for the first time in the world.
Paraveterinary workers
Paraveterinary workers, including veterinary nurses, technicians, and assistants, either assist vets in their work, or may work within their own scope of practice, depending on skills and qualifications, including in some cases, performing minor surgery.
The role of paraveterinary workers is less homogeneous globally than that of a vet, and qualification levels, and the associated skill mix, vary widely.
Allied professions
A number of professions exist within the scope of veterinary medicine, but may not necessarily be performed by vets or veterinary nurses. This includes those performing roles which are also found in human medicine, such as practitioners dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, including osteopaths, chiropractors, and physiotherapists.
Some roles are specific to animals, but which have parallels in human society, such as animal grooming and animal massage. Some roles are specific to a species or group of animals, such as farriers, who are involved in the shoeing of horses, and in many cases have a major role to play in ensuring the medical fitness of horses.
Veterinary research
Veterinary research includes prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases of animals, and basic biology, welfare, and care of animals. Veterinary research transcends species boundaries and includes the study of spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced models of both human and animal diseases and research at human-animal interfaces, such as food safety, wildlife and ecosystem health, zoonotic diseases, and public policy.
Clinical veterinary research
As in medicine, randomized controlled trials also are fundamental in veterinary medicine to establish the effectiveness of a treatment. Clinical veterinary research is far behind human medical research, though, with fewer randomized controlled trials, that have a lower quality and are mostly focused on research animals. Possible improvement consists in creation of networks for inclusion of private veterinary practices in randomized controlled trials.
No studies exist on the effect of community animal health services on improving household wealth and the health status of low-income farmers.
The first recorded use of regenerative stem-cell therapy to treat lesions in a wild animal occurred in 2011 in Brazil. On that occasion, the used stem cells to treat a maned wolf who had been run over by a car, which was later returned, fully recovered, to nature.

John Caldwell Calhoun II (1843–1918) was an American planter and businessman. He was a large landowner in Chicot County, Arkansas and a Director of railroad companies. He was a prominent financier and developer of the "New South".
Early life
He was born on July 9, 1843 in Demopolis, Alabama. His father, Andrew Pickens Calhoun, was a planter. He had a brother, Patrick Calhoun. His paternal grandfather, John C. Calhoun, served as the Vice President of the United States from 1825 to 1832.
He was educated in Demopolis, Alabama. He graduated from South Carolina College in 1863.
During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, he served in the Confederate States Army (CSA).
Career
In 1866, Calhoun entered in a partnership with James R. Powell, a businessman from Montgomery, Alabama, whereby he moved freedmen from the Southeast to Yazoo County, Mississippi, where they worked on new plantations. A year later, he decided to do this on his own, and on a larger scale. Over the years, he moved over 5,000 freedmen from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama to the Yazoo Valley of Mississippi.
By 1869, Calhoun moved to the Florence Plantation in Chicot County, Arkansas, which was inherited by his wife through her mother. By 1881–1882, he acquired a few more plantations in Chicot County: Harwood, Hebron, Luna, Fawnwood, Patria, Hyner's, and Latrobe. He also acquired the Sunnyside Plantation from the Starling family for US$90,000. He also acquired the Lakeport Plantation from his mother-in-law. He established the Calhoun Land Company, the Florence Planting Company, and the Chicot Planting Company. He teamed up with investors J. Baxter Upham of Boston and Austin Corbin of New York City. However, due to heavy debt, by 1885, he let his brother divest of their Arkansas landholdings.
Meanwhile, Calhoun moved to New York City, where he invested in the construction of Southern railways. He served as on the Board of Directors of railroad companies. He became the majority proprietor of the Baltimore Coal Mining and Railway Company. He sued the United States Shipbuilding Company.
Personal life
He married Linnie Adams on December 8, 1870 in Marengo County, Alabama. She was the daughter of Betsy Johnson and grandniece of Richard Johnson, who served as the Vice President of the United States from 1837 to 1841. They had three sons and one daughter.
Death
He died on December 18, 1918 at his home 200 West Fifty-eighth Street, in Manhattan. He was buried at the Saint Philips Episcopal Church Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina.

Steve Dilworth was born in Yorkshire in 1949 and studied sculpture at Maidstone College of Art. Since 1983, he has lived and worked on the Isle of Harris, Scotland.
Dilworth is known for his use of 'once living and found material, often held inside outer forms of wood, bone, stone and bronze. He also incorporates elements drawn directly from land and seascape, such as calm water, storm water, mountain air, the North wind and darkness. These are elements gathered at a particular time and place, in an exacting way that sit right on an edge between concept and material, the physical and metaphysical. He also uses the concept of sound and its absence in objects such as Air Rattle (1992)'
Dilworth's sculpture has been described as a ‘resurrectionist act' transforming raw material with great skill into objects that have a connection with deep-time. The starting point for his work is the energy or charge of raw material with the artist as a channel.
Notable public sculpture includes Walrus (1996) Ferens Art Gallery, Kingston Upon Hull, Ark (2000-2003) King's Place, London, Venus Stone (2007) and Claw (2006) commissioned by the Cass Sculpture Foundation, Case (2007) at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and Fish Box (1990), Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, formerly part of the Scottish Arts Council Collection. One of Dilworth's most important works, the Hanging Figure (1978-79) was purchased by the Richard Harris Collection, Chicago, USA in 2011.

Frank A. Gough (June 28, 1872 – August 15, 1938) was an American orthodontist who graduated from Angle School of Orthodontia. He was the first person to open an orthodontic practice in the borough of Brooklyn.
Life
He was born in 1872 in North East, Pennsylvania. He initially was interested in working in civil service but later became interested in dentistry. He attended New York University College of Dentistry and obtained his dental degree in 1896. He was the fourth dentist ever to get a license to practice dentistry in the State of New York. Around 1900 he became interested in orthodontics and applied to Angle School of Orthodontia in St. Louis. He eventually attended the school with his classmates Lloyd Steel Lourie, Herbert A. Pullen and Richard Summa. After his orthodontic course, Gough stayed in Hornellsville, Pennsylvania, to assist a dentist for some time. He then moved to Brooklyn, where he started his orthodontic practice in an office of his home. He was the first person to open a practice of orthodontics in Brooklyn. He practiced here for next 30 years.
He was also a Fellow of American College of Dentists and Edward H. Angle Society of Orthodontists. In 1927, Gough joined Brooklyn Rotary Club and he became the treasurer, vice-president, and president in 1926. He was also a member of New York State Crippled Children's Society and New York Mausoleum Association.
Gough was married to Allie B. Ellsworth, who died in 1937. After that incident, Gough suffered a coronary thrombosis and gave up his practice and his organization activities. He then returned to his home in North East, Pennsylvania, and eventually died in 1938. They had two daughters: Helen Gough, who practiced in Brooklyn as an orthodontist and Mrs. Charles Gough, who lived in New York.

Ars subtilior (Latin for 'subtler art') is a musical style characterized by rhythmic and notational complexity, centered on Paris, Avignon in southern France, and also in northern Spain at the end of the fourteenth century. The style also is found in the French Cypriot repertory. Often the term is used in contrast with ars nova, which applies to the musical style of the preceding period from about 1310 to about 1370; though some scholars prefer to consider ars subtilior a subcategory of the earlier style. Primary sources for ars subtilior are the Chantilly Codex, the Modena Codex (Mod A M 5.24), and the Turin Manuscript (Torino J.II.9).
Overview and history
Musically, the productions of the ars subtilior are highly refined, complex, and difficult to sing, and probably were produced, sung, and enjoyed by a small audience of specialists and connoisseurs. Musicologist Richard Hoppin suggests the superlative ars subtilissima, saying, "not until the twentieth century did music again reach the most subtle refinements and rhythmic complexities of the manneristic style." They are almost exclusively secular songs, and have as their subject matter love, war, chivalry, and stories from classical antiquity. There are even some songs written in praise of public figures (for example Antipope Clement VII). Daniel Albright compares avant-garde and modernist music of the 20th century's "emphasis on generating music through technical experiment" to the precedent set by the ars subtilior movement's "autonomous delight in extending the kingdom of sound." He cites Baude Cordier's perpetual canon Tout par compas (All by compass am I composed), notated on a circular staff.
Albright contrasts this motivation with "expressive urgency" and "obedience to rules of craft" and, indeed, "ars subtilior" was coined by musicologist Ursula Günther in 1960 to avoid the negative connotations of the terms manneristic style and mannered notation. (Günther's coinage was based on references in Tractatus de diversis figuris, attributed to Philippus de Caserta, to composers moving to a style "post modum subtiliorem comparantes" and developing an "artem magis subtiliter".)
One of the centers of activity of the style was Avignon at the end of the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy and during the Great Schism (1378–1417), the time during which the Western Church had a pope both in Rome and in Avignon. The town on the Rhône had developed into an active cultural center, and produced the most significant surviving body of secular song of the late fourteenth century.
The style spread into northern Spain and as far as Cyprus (which was a French cultural outpost at the time). French, Flemish, Spanish and Italian composers used the style.
Notational characteristics
Manuscripts of works in the ars subtilior occasionally were themselves in unusual and expressive shapes, as a form of eye music. As well as Baude Cordier's circular canon and the heart-shaped score shown above, Jacob Senleches's La Harpe de melodie is written in the shape of a harp.
List of composers
The main composers of the ars subtilior (those from whom at least three compositions in this style are known) are Anthonello de Caserta, Johannes Cuvelier, Egidius, Galiot, Matteo da Perugia, Philipoctus de Caserta, Jacob Senleches, and Trebor. Other composers associated with the style include:
Johannes Ciconia, Sus un fontayne
Baude Cordier, Tout par compas (Rondeau-canon) and Belle bonne sage
Martinus Fabri
Paolo da Firenze
Guido de Lange, Dieux gart (Rondeau)
Johannes Symonis Hasprois
Matheus de Sancto Johanne
Solage, Fumeux fume par fumée (Rondeau)

MDMB-CHMICA is an indole-based synthetic cannabinoid that is a potent agonist of the CB1 receptor and has been sold online as a designer drug. While MDMB-CHMICA was initially sold under the name "MMB-CHMINACA", the compound corresponding to this code name (i.e. the isopropyl instead of t-butyl analogue of MDMB-CHMINACA) has been identified on the designer drug market in 2015 as AMB-CHMINACA.
Chemistry
Several commercial samples of MDMB-CHMICA were found to exclusively contain the (S)-enantiomer based on vibrational and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. An (S)-configuration for the tert-leucinate group is unsurprising since MDMB-CHMICA is likely synthesized from the abundant and inexpensive "L" form of the appropriate tert-leucinate reactant.
Pharmacology
MDMB-CHMICA acts as a highly potent full agonist of the CB1 receptor with an efficacy of 94% and an EC50 value of 0.14 nM, which is approximately 8 times lower than the EC50 of JWH-018 (1.13 nM) and twofold lower than AB-CHMINACA (0.27 nM).
Metabolism
MDMB-CHMICA's main metabolic reactions comprise mono-hydroxylations and hydrolysis of the carboxylic ester function. In total, 31 metabolites could be identified in vivo.
Side effects
Seventy-one serious adverse events, including 42 acute intoxications and 29 deaths (Germany (5), Hungary (3), Poland (1), Sweden (9), United Kingdom (10), Norway (1)) that occurred in nine European countries between 2014 and 2016 have been associated with MDMB-CHMICA.
Side effects such as unconsciousness or coma, hyperemesis, nausea, seizures, convulsions, tachycardia, bradycardia, mydriasis, syncope, spontaneous urinating and defecating, shortness of breath, somnolence, respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, collapse, lower limbs paralysis, chest pain, aggression and severe disturbance of behaviour were reported.
Legal status
In the United States, MDMB-CHMICA is a Schedule I controlled substance.
MDMB-CHMICA is illegal in Austria, Canada, China, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Louisiana, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the UK, Sweden and Switzerland.
In August 2016 the European Commission proposed a ban on MDMB-CHMICA across the European Union.
In 27 February 2017 the Commission adopted an implementing act in banning MDMB-CHMICA, and Member States shall take the necessary measures to subject it to control measures and criminal penalties no later than by 4 March 2018.
Seizures
Over 3600 MDMB-CHMICA seizures between 2014 and 2016 in 19 member states of the European Union have been reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), including a 40 kg seizure [sic] in Luxembourg in December 2014.

The Human Zoo was a radio programme on talkSPORT, presented by Tommy Boyd, with his engineer Asher Gould effectively acting as co-presenter. It was broadcast from May 2000 until Boyd's dismissal in March 200 and took its name from a 1969 book of the same name by Desmond Morris.
Format
The programme had a straightforward 'phone in' format, except that callers were unscreened, went straight to air, and could say whatever they wanted, broadcasting regulations permitting. This unique radio experiment attained cult status and quickly became the most popular programme on AM radio in Britain. At the peak of its popularity in the summer of 2001, up to a million calls were received throughout the four-hour programme.
While not the most original format for radio, the Human Zoo was wildly successful. This has been attributed to the particular style of its presenter, who encouraged a very wide variety of callers to contribute, including some who called in to give short performances, play pieces of prepared audio or just shout out catchphrases. "Can I pleasure your wife?" was an oft-repeated slogan. Therefore, the mainstay of the programme for its listeners was the unpredictable nature of where the discussion would lead next. Very weighty issues not often discussed by mainstream phone on the radio (which Boyd derided as all about "points missed in the debate so far") could be juxtaposed with frivolous, light-hearted or comedic items. Boyd divided opinion between devoted fans, many of whom considered him to be an extremely wise man and critics who viewed him as arrogant or mad, often taking the opportunity to phone up to launch personal attacks or deride his ideas to start heated and vitriolic arguments.
Boyd attributed the popularity of the show to the ability of its anarchic nature to strike a chord with people on a Sunday night, and elaborated on this theory many times, proposing that Sunday evenings induced a widespread and overwhelming mood of either resignation or defiance and that the programme provided an outlet to those who felt trapped by the prospect of school, college or work the following morning.
Demise
In its latter stages, the Human Zoo became increasingly repetitive and at times descended into farce. Despite Boyd's efforts to reinvigorate the format, it became dominated by a small coterie of callers.
An important part of the production of the programme was the need to prevent the broadcast of offensive or illegal material by callers who knew that they were being granted an open platform for whatever they had to say before a national audience. This was achieved by a facility known as the dump button, often employed in phones in radio for this purpose. The station's output was broadcast several seconds after it was produced in the studio, allowing a small amount of time for the station to be silenced after unwanted comments had been made.
Revival
The Human Zoo would be revived to a lesser extent when Boyd began presenting a late Saturday night show on BBC Southern Counties Radio in September 2004. Regular callers included a Johnny Vegas soundalike, someone reading the results of the day's games in the Premier League or the FA Cup, someone doing an impression of Darth Vader breathing, "The Duck", and "Quarter-to-One Mick", a Northern accented gentleman who each week would recite the lyrics of well-known songs towards the end of each show.
In 2007, Tommy Boyd joined Play Radio UK to co-host a Sunday night phone-in show with Duncan Barkes. Calls went unscreened, and as the station is internet-only and not regulated by Ofcom, there was no need for a dump button and callers were allowed to say things not usually permitted on most UK radio stations that broadcast on regulated media. Having left the station towards the end of 2007 for a brief spell, Boyd returned to the station in mid-2008 with a similar format.
Similar formats
Similar straight-to-air formats have been used in British radio. Nick Abbot took calls straight to air in a segment calls the "Lightning Round". Iain Lee began a segment on his afternoon show known as "Triple M" which was given its 3-hour slot in the LBC Sunday night schedule until the format fell out of favour with new station management. "Triple M" was part of Iain Lee's show on Absolute Radio which is also on a Sunday Night. The format has continued occasionally on Lee's Talkradio show. LBC's late-night host Clive Bull also had a straight-to-air section at the end of his show, which was also ended under LBC's new management, to move the station to more serious news topics. James Whale used similar tactics which he called "Fast & Furious" toward the end of his 10pm till 2shows on Radio Aire in the mid-1980s.

William Schickel (1919July 14, 2009) was an American spiritual artist and liturgical architect. His stained glass, painting, sculpture, furniture, and building design is characterized by neo-Thomism and modernism and is influenced by the writings of Jacques Maritain.
Biography
Schickel was born in 1919 in Stamford, Connecticut, the grandson of German-American architect J. William Schickel, and grew up in Ithaca, New York. As a student at the University of Notre Dame, he studied under the philosopher Yves Simon and the stained-glass artist Emil Frei, Jr., whose daughter Mary he would soon marry. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1944.
The Schickels moved to Loveland, Ohio, so that Mary could be close to Grailville, the national headquarters of the Grail movement of which she was a member. William Schickel established a design studio there in 1948. The Schickels had five sons and six daughters, including Iowa politician and broadcast executive Bill Schickel. In 1952, William Schickel was diagnosed with lymphoma, which went into remission after a pilgrimage to St. Charles, Missouri.
On July 14, 2009, Schickel died in Loveland of complications from pneumonia. The William Schickel Gallery in Loveland has continued to display his works.
Notable works
Over his more than 60-year career, Schickel was involved in the design or renovation of many liturgical structures. One of his earliest works was the conversion of a 1813 barn in Loveland into the Grailville Oratory. He won an Architects Society of Ohio award for the 1960s renovation of the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani, the oldest Trappist abbey in the United States, in which the Gothic Revival vaulting was replaced by a minimalist design in keeping with Second Vatican Council reforms. His other liturgical commissions include Bellarmine Chapel at Xavier University in Cincinnati and the Shrine of St. Rose Philippine Duchesne in St. Charles, Missouri, an early example of a church in the round.
Schickel's secular works include the Rotunda of Creation at the Mercy Centers for Health and Wellness in Anderson Township and Fairfield, Ohio, and the Kane County Correctional Complex in Aurora, Illinois.

Compass Box is a producer, bottler and marketer of a creative range of blended Scotch whiskies. The company is headquartered in Chiswick. Compass Box Whisky was founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur John Glaser, a former marketing director at Johnnie Walker. Blenders for Compass Box are Jill Boyd and James Saxon.
The company's whiskymakers select distillates from a number of existing Scotch whisky distilleries, with the selected whiskies then being blended together and the resulting blend matured further.
Products
Compass Box's main product line, called the Signature Range, consists of whiskies named 'The Spice Tree', 'The Peat Monster', 'Oak Cross', and 'Hedonism'. Outside the Signature Range, they produce a range of Blended Scotch whiskies called 'Great King Street', within which there are two products: 'Artist's Blend' (a rich, round, fruity blend) and 'Glasgow Blend' (a bold, smoky, sherried whisky made in the style historically favoured by Glaswegians).
This whiskeymaker is known for discovering unique whiskies which they used to create Limited Editions, such as 'Optimism', 'The General', 'The Lost Blend', 'Morpheus', the 'Canto Cask' series, the three-bottle 'Myths and Legends', and many more. Notable Limited Editions and Signature Ranges whiskies have been serially reincarnated due to their popularity; these include 'Hedonism Maximus', the 'Flaming Heart' series, and 'Peat Monster Reserve'.
Compass Box creates Limited Editions in collaboration with notable restaurants, bars, and celebrated Bartenders. 'Juveniles' was blended with restaurateur, Tim Johnston to favour the tastes of the classic French cuisine of Juveniles Bistrot à Vins in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. 'Delilah's' was created in partnership with Chicago punk bar owner Mike Miller. London bartender Rosey Mitchell created 'The Circle' with Compass Box whiskymakers.
Apart from whiskies, Compass Box also produces 'Orangerie', made from whisky infused with orange zest and spices.
Contravention of Scotch Whisky Association regulations
In 2005 Compass Box released a new Blended Malt Scotch Whisky called The Spice Tree in which the blend of single malt distillates had undergone a secondary partial maturation stage in casks containing additional, flat French oak inserts (also known as ‘inner staves'). The Scotch Whisky Association, a trade organisation that represents the Scotch whisky industry, felt that the use of such inner staves in the whisky maturation process was in contravention of the Scotch Whisky Regulations prevailing at the time and threatened legal action against Compass Box to halt the production of The Spice Tree. In response, Compass Box altered the production process for subsequent releases of The Spice Tree wherein the secondary maturation stage takes place in casks containing toasted French oak heads instead of the flat oak inner staves.
More recently, in 2015 Compass Box again disagreed with the Scotch Whisky Association when attempting to release complete information about every component whisky used in its blends, a step which the Scotch Whisky Association claimed was prohibited by both EU and UK laws. In response, Compass Box launched a 'Scotch Whisky Transparency' campaign to encourage greater transparency within the world of Scotch with other Scotch whisky producers – notably Bruichladdich – subsequently joined them in sharing full age component information about one or more of their blends.

Splatter is a 2009 interactive short horror web series directed by Joe Dante produced by Roger Corman and starring Corey Feldman. It was created for Netflix.
The film aired over 3 parts on October 29, November 6 and 13, and was subsequently combined into a single 29 minute segment. In October 2019, the film website Trailers from Hell released all ten variations of the series, giving the viewer the option of whom to kill next. This is the first time every filmed episode of the series has ever been released to the public.
Plot
After committing suicide, a washed-up rocker returns from the grave to torment the five people who betrayed him in life.
Audiences would get to vote which character lived and died.

Production
Netflix approached Roger Corman with the project.
Corman tried to hire Richard Matheson to write the script but he was busy and recommended his son, Richard Christian Matheson. The director was Joe Dante, with whom Corman had worked in the 1970s.
The series was shot over eight days at a mansion in the Hollywood Hills.
The original intention was to shoot the first installment and then wait a day for the audience votes to be tabulated before write, shoot, edited and post produce the next one over six days. “I wanted to see if I could do this stuff again,” said Corman, who had made feature films in such short time spans before. However he soon realized it would be too logistically difficult. His wife proposed a solution. "We would shoot the deaths of all five and then, as the votes come in, we may do a little pick-up shooting to tie things together,” Corman says. “Then we would edit the deaths in.”
“We have to have everything ready for when the first vote happens,” says Joe Dante. “When the first vote happens, we have to have a rough version of all of these different possibilities and the same thing for the third week. You have to shoot everything three times. There are all of these logistical issues you have to carry around in your head.”
Dante later recalled:
Dante says that making the film was challenging:
There were ten episodes in all. "The first episode is always the same, and then the others vary depending on the audience vote," says Dante. "There are more versions again of the last episode than the middle. The exact details escape me, because I probably never quite understood them anyway!"

Summary
The story revolves around a godman, Baba Nirala (Bobby Deol), whose followers (mostly from the disadvantaged sections of the society) have blind faith in him and will do anything that he asks of them, when in reality, he is a conman who ensures that his devotees devote their wealth to him and stay attached to the ashram for life. Politicians Hukum Singh (Sachin Shroff) and incumbent CM Sundar Lal (Anil Rastogi) vie for Baba Nirala's support in the upcoming State Legislative Assembly Elections owing to his large number of followers for their vote bank politics, which only increase after a pop singer, Tinka Singh (Adhyayan Suman) decides to conduct tours with Baba Nirala to promote his new song.
Meanwhile, SI Ujagar Singh (Darshan Kumar) is a police officer who has little interest in his job and simply follows his seniors' orders, until he meets Dr. Natasha (Anupriya Goenka) in a case related to a skeleton found on the property of an industrial group which has good ties with Sundar Lal. Her constant pestering, along with the stubbornness of a small-time journalist Akhivendra Rathi alias Akki (Rajeev Siddhartha) encourages him to take up this case, along with his assistant senior constable Sadhu Sharma (Vikram Kocchar).

Marketing and release
Promotion
The official trailer of two seasons of this web series was launched on 16 August 2020 and 29 October 2020 respectively by MX Player on YouTube.
Release
Season 1 and Season 2 was made available for streaming from 28 August 2020 and 11 November 2020 respectively on OTT Platform MX Player.
The series made its TV debut through The Q on 11 October 2021.
Critical reception
Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee rated the series 3 out of 5 adding that “Prakash Jha's digital debut is ambitious, provocative and action-packed.” He praised the performances of actors and concept handling from the director Prakash Jha. Rohan Nahaar of Hindustan Times wrote that Aashram is “a show that doesn't have the courage of its convictions. The self-censorship of sex scenes is emblematic of the trepidation with which Jha approaches the story. As it turns out, that ridiculous disclaimer was utterly unnecessary.”
Controversies
In December 2020, Jodhpur Court had served a legal notice to Bobby Deol And Director Prakash Jha after Karni Sena filed a case on the actor and the director for hurting their sentiments and stated that the show "is an attempt to discredit Hinduism and ashrams". In October 2021, the Bajrang Dal group targeted Aashram web series sets and Prakash Jha for defaming Hindus and the entire aashram system, through his web series, whereas the sets were vandalised by the group. Director Prakash Jha stated that "They will voice their concerns, but I think about the thousands who see my project in the correct manner. It is no joke that 1.5 billion people watched it. If we say there will be no objection, it is not right. " Later, Bobby Deol supported Jha and stated that the show is not about defaming anyone and as an actor nothing else matters.

Blue Star Contemporary is a non-profit contemporary art institution located in San Antonio, Texas. It was established by a group of artists in 1986 after the success of the Blue Star Exhibition, a show featuring the work of local contemporary artists in the former Blue Star Ice and Cold Storage warehouse. Blue Star Contemporary is the longest-running non-profit contemporary art space in the city. Blue Star Contemporary, also known as BSC, is run by Executive Director Mary Heathcott. Open calls for artists from Texas, the United States, and abroad are held on an annual basis.
Background
Blue Star Contemporary is housed in a renovated warehouse in the Blue Star Arts Complex, a mixed-use development containing lofts, apartments, galleries, artist studios, retail stores, and restaurants. The Blue Star Arts Complex is a stop on the VIA Metropolitan Transit VIVA Culture bus route. BSC is a part of the King Williams Cultural Arts District in the Southtown neighborhood and is located along the San Antonio River Walk.
Blue Star Contemporary is at the center of San Antonio's First Friday Art Walk, an event that takes place on the first Friday of each month and is intended to provide "a free showcase of the art community in San Antonio." Blue Star Contemporary is credited as being a revitalizing force for the arts district and surrounding neighborhoods. Contemporary Art Month (CAM), San Antonio's month-long celebration of local contemporary art in July, started at the museum.
Current programs
Current BSC programs include Creative Classrooms, a free six-week program that brings artists to school classrooms for weekly lessons, the MOSAIC Student Artist Program, a free after-school program for students interested in learning about the arts, and the Berlin Residency Program, a three-month residency at the Künstlerhaus Bethanien granted to four artists from Bexar County annually. Blue Star Contemporary partnered with BiblioTech, Bexar County's digital library, to open a reading room in the museum's Arts Education Lab in 2016.
Off-site art exhibitions
Art in the Garden is an ongoing partnership between Blue Star Contemporary and the San Antonio Botanical Garden. Each year, an artist is selected and commissioned to create a site-specific work in the garden.
Blue Star Contemporary has also partnered with the City of San Antonio's Department of Arts and Culture's Public Art San Antonio division (PASA) to commission Plexus c18 at the San Antonio International Airport. The work is described on the BSC website as "a site-specific public art installation by Dallas-based artist Gabriel Dawe. The installation, a weaving of approximately 90 miles of colored thread hooked from wall to ceiling that emulates the dynamic shape of an airplane, will suspend from the vaulted ceiling of the Terminal A ticketing Area. Plexus c18 is composed of more than 19 colors--creating a prism-like effect that represents the full spectrum of visible light. The art installation will be on view for three years beginning October 2016."
In addition to these off-site exhibitions and partnerships, BSC's MOSAIC student artists, under the direction of Artist-in-Residence Alex Rubio, have completed nine public works projects throughout the city, including murals and mosaics of handmade and hand-painted ceramic tiles.

Luke "Long Gone" Miles (May 8, 1925 – November 22, 1987) was an American Texas blues and electric blues singer and songwriter. He was a protégé of Lightnin' Hopkins and variously recorded or performed with Hopkins, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee and Willie Chambers. Miles is best known for his 1964 album Country Born, issued by World Pacific Records.
Life and career
Miles was born in Lachute, Louisiana. Except for a period of service in the United States Navy in 1943 and 1944, he worked on a cotton plantation until the early 1950s and listened to blues music on the radio. Suitably inspired, Miles moved to Houston, Texas, in 1952, with the single aim of meeting Lightnin' Hopkins. Miles stated, "I went to Houston for one reason. I went to see Lightnin' Hopkins. That's what I went for and that's what I did. Lightnin' Hopkins taught me just about everything about blues singing. The first time I ever sang in front of an audience was in 1952 with Lightnin'. The first day I met Lightnin' he named me "Long Gone" … and I've been Long Gone Miles ever since".
According to Ed Pearl, "Miles appeared on Lightnin's doorstep in Houston a long while back, and Lightnin' wanted to close the door. And Luke proceeded to just go to sleep on his doorstep.... he was a real country guy. So Lightnin' took a fancy to him and let him hang around and he was a good singer, and Lightnin' sometimes let him perform with him on stage".
Nervous at his first concert, Miles dropped the microphone. However, he persevered and played at local clubs, and he subsequently appeared on several of Hopkins's recordings, including the "live album", Country Blues (1960). In 1961, Miles relocated to Los Angeles, but, with Hopkins being "rediscovered" and his career booming, the two parted ways.
In 1962, Miles recorded two singles for Smash Records, accompanied by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. The B-side to both singles was the antiwar song "War Time Blues", in which Miles sang, "Well, when I get my examination card, I want the doctor tell me I too doggone old". Also in 1962, he teamed up with the guitarist Willie Chambers, and they performed together regularly for two years. In 1964, Miles recorded the album Country Born, released by World Pacific. In addition, he recorded singles for Two Kings Records in 1965 and, four years later, another one, "Hello Josephine", for Kent. A live recording of Miles was made in 1966 at the Ash Grove nightclub, in Los Angeles, where he was accompanied on acoustic guitar by Bernie Pearl, the brother of the Ash Grove proprietor, Ed Pearl.
However, in 1970, Miles lived up to his stage name and disappeared for a long time from performing and recording. He never spoke to or heard from Hopkins again. The later album releases were Country Boy (1984), which included mainly previously unreleased tracks recorded in 1962, and Riding Around in My V8 Ford (2008), composed of tracks recorded live in Venice, California, in 1985.
Miles died on November 22, 1987, in Los Angeles, aged 62.

The Reid and Sigrist R.S.3 Desford was a British twin-engined, three-seat advanced trainer developed in the Second World War for postwar use. Although the R.S.3 was evaluated as a trainer, the type never entered production and was eventually rebuilt as the R.S.4 Bobsleigh as an experimental aircraft with the pilot in a prone position, seen as advantageous in minimising g-force effects in fighters.
Design and development
Reid and Sigrist in Desford, Leicestershire, England, were an important instrument manufacturer in the interwar era, specialising in aircraft applications leading to the forming of an aviation division in 1937 at the New Malden, Surrey factory site. The first product was a twin-engined advanced trainer, the R.S.1 Snargasher (1939) which was eventually relegated to company hack used primarily at the factory and Desford aerodrome.
The follow-up design, the R.S.3 Desford (taking its name from the company site) was similar in size and concept to its predecessor although it was only configured for a pilot and trainee and featured a low-set wing. The R.S.3 was powered by two 130 hp de Havilland Gipsy Major Series I engines, rather than the higher powered de Havilland Gipsy Six engines of the earlier R.S.1. The overall shape was more pleasing than the dumpy R.S.1 and the pleasant flying characteristics of the earlier machine were retained.
Operational history
The prototype, registered as G-AGOS first flew on 9 July 1945, shortly before VJ Day. Evaluated as a private venture project by test pilots including famed postwar flyer, Janusz Żurakowski at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down, the R.S.3 was generally found to be well suited as a multi-engine primary and intermediate trainer. However, RAF interest was lukewarm due to the glut of surplus wartime training aircraft available. The prototype appeared at the Farnborough Airshow in 1946, and was allocated to the Institute of Aviation Medicine but by May 1949, it was deregistered as a civilian aircraft, flying subsequently with RAF serial number VZ728.
Further development of the type continued as the company wanted to establish itself as an aviation engineering and production concern although its postwar work primarily centred on instrument and camera production, especially in creating a copy of the German Leica.
When Royal Air Force high-speed research explored high g-forces encountered in manoeuvres, a number of prone-pilot experimental aircraft including the Gloster Meteor F8 "Prone Pilot" were produced. To investigate low-speed applications, the R.S.4 Bobsleigh was a radical conversion of the R.S.3 reconfigured into a single pilot operation with a prone pilot station in the new rounded nose. This section was equipped with a transparent cone which covered a large section of the nose and two separate transparent ports to give minimal sideways and rearwards views. The R.S.4 was first flown in this form on 13 June 1951. Although useful data was obtained, the R.S.4's prone pilot did have difficulty with the initial control setup. Today's hang glider pilots have found the prone position an ideal means of controlling flight as well as providing a streamlined profile.
Experimental testing was conducted by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough and continued until January 1956 when the R.S.4 returned to the UK civil registry, again as G-AGOS. It was used at one time as an air photo aircraft by Film Aviation Services and remained in flyable condition until 1973. After a period at the Snibston Discovery Park, the R.S.4 was moved to Spanhoe, Northamptonshire for restoration by Windmill Aviation. The restored Desford flew again on 22 April 2018, but the aircraft's owners, Leicestershire County Council, did not publicly display the Desford. The Desford was delivered to the Newark Air Museum on 19 August 2022.

Olfactory language refers to language associated with the sense of smell. It involves the naming and categorisation of odours by humans according to each odour's perceived source or attributes. The study of olfactory language is part of the field of linguistics and is distinct from the study of semiochemical communication, which involves communication between organisms using chemical substances detected through olfaction.
Cross-linguistic variation
Olfactory perception and identification
Different speech communities tend to display differences in both the perception and linguistic categorisation of odours. In general, Europeans find it harder to identify odours than hunter-gatherer communities. The ease with which odours are identified by speakers is related to the primary type of olfactory vocabulary used in their speech community. Some speech communities, including Jahai- and Thai-speaking hunter-gatherers, mostly use dedicated abstract vocabulary for referring to odour qualities, while others, such as Dutch and English speakers, mostly use concrete terms that identify the source itself. When presented with common odours and asked to name them, Jahai speakers are likely to use the same abstract descriptor and answer more quickly, while English and Dutch speakers tend to take longer to answer and use a more diverse range of mostly concrete descriptors, suggesting that abstract and concrete odour names are encoded differently. The nature of odour-colour associations also differs between speech communities based on their vocabulary. Dutch speakers who use concrete terms associate a particular odour with the colour of its source (e.g., banana odour associated with the colour yellow), while Maniq and Thai speakers who use abstract terminology do not show consistent odour-colour associations.
Olfactory metaphor
Cross-linguistically, olfactory metaphor is traditionally thought to be the least important of all the senses, especially when compared to visual or auditory metaphors, although emerging research suggests the phenomenon is more common than previously thought. In English, olfactory metaphors with negative connotations are often used to describe bad character ("he's a stinker") or the detection of bad qualities ("I smell something fishy about this deal"). In the Seri language, olfactory metaphor and metonymy are salient features. One example is the expression hiisax cheemt iha ("I am angry"), literally 'my.spirit stinks (Declarative)'.
Variation within languages
Different populations speaking the same language and sharing cultural traditions may still display varied perceptions of an odour, based on its prevalence and most common source in each location. For example, one study showed that French speakers in Quebec find the scent of wintergreen more pleasant and edible than speakers in France. This is because the odour is commonly used in candies and sodas in North America, while in Europe it is used mainly in medicinal products. However, providing concrete names of the source of the odours caused cultural differences in responses to decrease or disappear, suggesting that providing more linguistic information about an odour tends to make its perception more salient in the mind of the smeller.
Clinical applications
In a clinical setting, patients may undergo olfactory tests to aid in the diagnosis of mental disorders. A common test involves the use of "Sniffin' Sticks", a set of marker pens imbued with different scents at varying dilutions. Sniffin' Sticks are used both for diagnosis and for research into olfaction, including olfactory language. Due to linguistic variation across speech communities, the Sniffin' Sticks test must be validated for each country in which medical professionals wish to use it for diagnosis. Rather than using a literal translation of scent descriptors, researchers validating the test in a new country may need to change the translated descriptors to more culturally-appropriate terms for the speech community in question. For example, researchers validating the Sniffin' Sticks test for the Portuguese population changed the original translation of the grapefruit scent descriptor, toranja, to the Portuguese word for orange, laranja. This is because grapefruit are not commonly eaten in Portugal, which resulted in participant familiarity falling below the benchmark of 75%. Altering lesser known descriptors such as "grapefruit" to less literal but more culturally-relevant translations increased familiarity to within the range expected for healthy populations. This validated the Sniffin' Sticks test for the Portuguese population without requiring the scents themselves to be altered.

In Fijian mythology, Degei (pronounced Ndengei), enshrined as a serpent, is the supreme god of Fiji. He is the creator of the (Fijian) world, fruits, and of men and is specially connected to Rakiraki District, Fiji. He judges newly dead souls after they pass through one of two caves: Cibaciba or Drakulu. A few he sends to paradise Burotu. Most others are thrown into a lake, where they will eventually sink to the bottom (Murimuria) to be appropriately rewarded or punished.
He is said to have at first moved about freely, but then in the form of a snake to have grown into the earth with his ringed tail. Since then he has become the god of earthquakes, storms and seasons. Whenever Degei shakes himself fertilising rain will fall, delicious fruits hang on the trees, and the yam fields yield an excellent crop.
Degei is also a god of wrath who declares himself in terrible fashion. He punishes and chastens his people by destroying the crops or by floods; he could indeed easily wipe out mankind from the earth, for since he has lived in the bowels of the earth he has been tormented with so insatiable hunger that he would like to take in and swallow the whole world.
Rokola is a name of the son of Degei.
First human couple
Degei hatched an egg from which the first humans came to Earth.
In popular culture
Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind reported in 1896 a religious practice enjoined by Degei that involved tattooing women on the lower part of the body and the thigh, the corner of the mouth, and the finger.
R.A. Derrick (1957:11) says:
"In these traditions Degei figures not only as the origin of the people, but also as a huge snake, living in a cave near the summit of the mountain Uluda – the northernmost peak of the Nakauvandra Range. Earth tremors and thunder were ascribed as his uneasy turnings within the cave. He took no interest in his people's affairs; his existence was no more than a round of eating and sleeping. By association with him, snakes were honoured as ‘the Offspring of the origin'. The snake cult was generally throughout the group."

Neville Blyth (March 1825 – 15 February 1890) was a South Australian colonial politician.
Blyth was some two years younger than his brother Arthur Blyth, was also born in a suburb of Manchester, educated at King Edward's Grammar School under the Rev. Dr. Lee (later the first Bishop of Manchester), and with his family sailed to South Australia in 1839.
Early in the forties Neville joined his brother Arthur at their father's ironmonger business, and the two were actively engaged in the trade up to 1865. At his father's death Neville Blyth was sole executor of his estate and, characteristically, first repaid debts his father had incurred in England but legally wiped out by his insolvency.
Blyth was elected a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for East Torrens at the general election in March 1860, as colleague of Henry Mildred, represented that district during three Parliaments (in 1865 with Charles Henry Goode as colleague) until July 1867, when he resigned rather than be forced to break a promise, and was succeeded by Daniel Fisher. In April, 1868, he was elected to the fifth Parliament as member of the Assembly for the Encounter Bay, with William Everard as his colleague. He was Treasurer of South Australia from 21 September to 13 October 1868 in the Hart cabinet and the crisis that preceded the formation of Strangways' Government. Having represented Encounter Bay until the end of the fifth Parliament he was chosen by the District of Victoria in August 1871 to succeed William Paltridge as the colleague of James Park Dawson Laurie. In 1871 he stood for the District of Encounter Bay, but was defeated and decided to quit politics, but in March, 1877, he was elected member for North Adelaide to fill the vacancy left by his brother, by then Sir Arthur Blyth, when he was appointed Agent General.
In the last Boucaut Ministry, which lasted from 26 October 1877 until 27 September 1878, Neville Blyth was Minister of Education, and had as his colleagues J. P. Boucaut, Sir William Morgan, Charles Mann, G. C. Hawker and T. Playford. Forced by ill-health to return to England, he resigned from politics in November 1878 and settled in Sutton in Surrey, living off the rents from his substantial South Australian properties. He died eleven years later.
Blyth was a communicant of the Church of England, but of liberal persuasion. He strongly opposed State aid to churches and fought for the rights of the working classes.
Blyth supported C. Emily Clark (sister of John Howard Clark) and Catherine Helen Spence in the formation of the "Boarding-out Society" for orphans.
Family
On 14 April 1852 he married Julia Barns (or Barnes) of Everton or Manchester during a trip to England. She survived him; they had no children. He was survived also by three brothers — Sir Arthur, W. W. Blyth, of Gover Street, North Adelaide, who was more than five years his senior, and Howard Blyth of Edinburgh, Scotland.

The Zlataust Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 5 Zlataust Road in Iași, Romania. It is dedicated to Saints John Chrysostom and Theodore of Amasea.
The first church on the site was a small wooden one with stone foundations, erected between 1563 and 1564. This was built by Prince Ștefan IX Tomșa, who in the early 17th century was preoccupied by the development of that part of the city, then on its periphery. Eventually, the old church deteriorated.
The present church dates to 1683, according to the inscription, and was built in thirty days by George Ducas, near the end of his third reign in Moldavia. In order to fulfill a promise, he put it under the control of church authorities from Argyrokastro in exchange for Hlincea Monastery, which he placed under Cetățuia Monastery, recently founded by him. An alternate date is late 1682: on April 20 the following year, he was obliged to accompany the Ottomans to the Battle of Vienna, and was taken prisoner by the Poles in December, while returning from the campaign. Oddly, the inscription mentions George's son Constantine, who was only 6 or 7 years old in 1682, as well as his wife Maria. His marriage took place only when he ascended the throne in 1693, implying that the plaque was placed at that point, when the church was already a decade old. The north wall of the old foyer features a painting of George holding the church, his wife Anastasia, their three daughters and their son. Inside the church, there is a list of names to be mentioned during the liturgy, beginning with Prince Eustratie Dabija and his wife.
The churchyard used to be Iași's main cemetery, and some of the gravestones remain in the yard and inside the church. In the foyer, added later, there is a stone for a vornic who died in 1858 and his family. Another family has a stone from 1877. The grave of musician Barbu Lăutaru was discovered during an excavation in 1968. The road on which the church is located is named after the latter. Writer Ionel Teodoreanu grew up in a house adjoining the church, and several of his writings deal with the vicinity. Notable architectural features include the church's stone walls and its tall bell tower, which has a hiding place for religious objects, to be used in cases of danger.
The church, which was enlarged in 1855, is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, together with Lăutaru's grave.

Rahel Hirsch (September 15, 1870 – October 6, 1953) was a German physician and professor at the Charité medical school in Berlin. In 1913 she became the first woman in the Kingdom of Prussia to be appointed a professor in medicine.
Biography
Rahel Hirsch was born on 15 September 1870 in Frankfurt am Main, one of eleven children of Mendel Hirsch (1833–1900). Mendel Hirsch was the director of the girls' school of the Jewish religious community in Frankfurt am Main. Mendel's father, Rahel's paternal grandfather, was the eminent rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch
From 1885 to 1889, Rahel Hirsch studied for her degree in education in Wiesbaden; she then worked until 1898 as a teacher. The German Reich did not permit women to study medicine so she studied in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1899 she continued to study in Leipzig, Germany and Strasbourg, France to earn her medical doctor title in 1903.
In 1906, Rahel Hirsch was the first scientist to find the presence of starch granules in the blood and urine. She found that tiny cells, no more than 0.2mm, could penetrate the kidneys and be removed by the urine. She was mocked at a meeting of the Society of the Charité's Directors and her research was ignored since the doctors believed they knew more than her. She was unable to convince them otherwise. However, in 1957, G. Volkheimer, an assistant at Charité, came across her work and publicized it, naming it the "Hirsch Effekt."
She was then hired to work at the Medical Clinic of the University of Berlin at the Charité as an intern. The Charité was militarily strong and she was the second female to ever be hired here. Hirsch worked as an assistant to the physiologist Professor Friedrich Krause. Rahel Hirsch worked alongside surgeon Ernst von Bergmann and anatomist Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz.
In 1908, Hirsch was appointed head of the polyclinic at the Charité's Medical Clinic, however, she was never a paid employee there. After being replaced, she left the Charité and started her own internal medicine practice in Berlin. At her private practice, she had modern x-ray equipment and wealthy clientele that allowed her to live comfortably.
Rahel Hirsch was the first female to be awarded the title of Professor in Prussia in 1913.
In 1914, Hirsch published a study titled “Accidents and Internal Medicine.”
As a Jewish woman Hirsch was prohibited from teaching. She went on to write a treatise titled the "Physical Culture of Women." She wrote to counter the medical prejudice against physical activity for women and favored naturally-fitting clothing. Hirsch tried to bring attention to women's public health by raising awareness about hygiene, nutrition, and physical strengthening. In an article published in the Munich Medical Weekly, she writes to her male colleagues to not look at women from just the point of view of a gynecologist. She also argued that women's inferiority to men due to their biologically determined lighter brains was not true. She stated that women's physical and psychological weakness compared to men came from a faulty upbringing.
As Jewish persecution by the Nazis gathered momentum, Hirsch lost her professional opportunities, culminating in the cancellation of her license to practice medicine in 1938. When she learnt that she was about to be arrested, she escaped to England at 68 years old. In England, Hirsch could not practise as a doctor. Instead she worked as a librarian and a laboratory assistant. During wartime she lived in Yorkshire and returned to London after the war. Her treatment by the Nazis manifested itself in the form of depression, hallucinations and a persecution-complex. As a result, she was committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she died on October 6, 1953. Hirsch was buried in one of London's Jewish cemeteries.
Legacy
Her reputation was upheld by G. Volkheimer. Many internal medicine textbooks refer to the “Hirsch Effekt” and the State of Israel honored her by including her in the gallery of Famous Jewish Scientists in Jerusalem. In 1995, a bronze statue of Rahel Hirsch stands in the old lecture hall at the Charité.
Germany issued a postage stamp in 2013 to commemorate the centenary of Rahel Hirsch being appointed as the first female professor of medicine in the Kingdom of Prussia.
A stretch of road in front of the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof now bears her name in recognition of her impact on society.

RPM was a Canadian magazine that published the best-performing singles of Canada from 1964 to 2000. During 1989, twenty-six songs became number-one singles in Canada. Chicago began the year with "Look Away" at the summit while Phil Collins' "Another Day in Paradise" was 1989's final chart-topper. Twelve artists attained the number-one spot for the first time this year: Will to Power, Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, Debbie Gibson, Mike + the Mechanics, Fine Young Cannibals, Paula Abdul, Michael Damian, Love and Rockets, Richard Marx, Milli Vanilli, Roxette, and Bad English. Madonna obtained three number-one singles this year—"Like a Prayer", "Express Yourself", and "Cherish"—while Phil Collins, Fine Young Cannibals, and Richard Marx all picked up two number-one hits.
No Canadian acts reached number one in 1989. Two songs peaked at the top for five weeks: "Like a Prayer" by Madonna and "Right Here Waiting" by Richard Marx; the former song became the most successful single of the year in Canada. Altogether, Madonna spent nine weeks at number one with her three chart-topping hits. Phil Collins totalled seven weeks at number one: a four-week stay with "Two Hearts" and a three-week stay with "Another Day in Paradise", while Richard Marx topped the chart for six combined weeks with "Right Here Waiting" and "Angelia". Fine Young Cannibals spent four weeks at number one, and those who spent at least three weeks atop the chart were Debbie Gibson with "Lost in Your Eyes" and Tears for Fears with "Sowing the Seeds of Love".

The metallic-green tanager (Tangara labradorides) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Taxonomy and systematics
The blue-and-black tanager was first described as Tanagra (Aglaia) labradorides by Auguste Boissonneau in 1840 on the basis of a specimen from Santa Fe, Colombia. The generic name Tangara comes from the Tupí word tangara, meaning dancer. The specific name labradorides is from the French pierre de Labrador (feldspar), and the Ancient Greek -ides, meaning resembling, referring to the species' metallic blue-green color, which resembles that of feldspar. Metallic-green tanager is the official common name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).
The metallic-green tanager is one of 27 species in the genus Tangara. It was previously thought to form a species group with the blue-browed and golden-naped tanagers. However, phylogenetic studies have shown that the golden-naped tanager is only distantly related to the other two species in the group. Its relation with the blue-browed tanager is also unclear, as some studies have shown the metallic-green tanager to be sister to the blue-browed tanager, but others have found this grouping to be paraphyletic.
Subspecies
There are two recognized subspecies of the metallic-green tanager. DNA studies have shown that the rate of divergence between in nucleotide sequences between the two subspecies is higher than that of several other tanagers currently recognized as distinct species.
T. l. labradorides (Boissonneau, 1840): The nominate subspecies, it is found in western and central Colombia and western Ecuador.
T. l. chaupensis Chapman, 1925: Found from southeastern Ecuador and northern Peru. It is similar to the nominate, but is greener in color, with a paler abdomen, no gold on the forehead, and golden-green margins on the primary flight feathers.

The William B. Coley Award for Distinguished Research in Basic and Tumor Immunology is presented annually by the Cancer Research Institute, to scientists who have made outstanding achievements in the fields of basic and tumor immunology and whose work has deepened our understanding of the immune system's response to disease, including cancer.
The first awards were made in 1975 to a group of 16 scientists called the "Founders of Cancer Immunology." In 1993, the award was renamed after William B. Coley, a late-nineteenth century surgeon who made the first attempts at the non-surgical treatment of cancer through stimulation of the immune system. For this reason, Coley has become known as the "Father of Cancer Immunotherapy."

Gavin Love (born 2 June 1978 in Plymouth, England) is a former British professional basketball player and former head coach of Plymouth Raiders.
The tall former Point Guard was educated at local college Marjon's and played for his hometown team Plymouth Raiders for 15 years, and the first team since 2000, where he became a permanent feature in the starting five for the Raiders. Love soon rose to prominence as a fans' favourite with the people of Plymouth and a local hero, and was awarded the team captaincy.
At the end of the 2006–2007 season, Love earned a call-up to the Great Britain team coached by Chris Finch, only to pull out after badly damaging his Achilles tendon in the final game of the BBL campaign, and had to undergo an operation and lengthy rehabilitation period. Love made a recovery and returned to the team in 2008 but was constantly hampered by further injuries, which eventually prompted him to an early retirement announced on 6 February 2009, at the age of 29. His number 6 jersey has been retired in honour of his dedication to the club.
Love was appointed head coach of the Plymouth Raiders during the summer of 2010, replacing his former mentor Gary Stronach who had left the club after 24 years of service.
Love was relieved of his job as Head Coach of the Plymouth Raiders two weeks before the start of the 2013/2014 BBL season and replaced by current Head Coach Jay Marriott.
On 29 May 2018 he announced that he would be leaving Plymouth Raiders after receiving an offer "too good to refuse". He went back to Contern to coach the AB Contern.

The Fresh Fruit Festival was founded as a summer arts festival presented by All Out Arts, and featuring the work of LGBTQ artists as the primary expression of the All Out Arts mission of "Fighting prejudice and homophobia through the arts." It has since expanded to year-round programming at partner organizations in support of the same goals. As of 2017, it was held at the Wild Project theatre.
History
The Festival was founded by Carol Polcovar in 2002 as a merger of New Village Playwrights and New Village Productions reacted to a current reluctance on the part of major venues to present a truly representative array of LGBT arts. Originally sponsored by All Out Arts, it became a fully owned d/b/a of All Out Arts. The Festival included a wide range of plays, visual arts, dance, and film presentations. Along with the Hot! Festival, it is among the most prominent LGBT-themed festivals in the New York artistic community. Carol Polcovar served as Founding Artistic Director of the festival for its first decade, and upon retirement in 2013 accepted an "Outstanding Achievement" Award for the Fresh Fruit Festival's mission from the Manhattan Borough President's Office.
Ancillary programs
The Festival presented the first of several "OUTmusic" programs in New York City, consisting entirely of vocalists, musicians, and composers who were Lesbian, Gay, Bi, or Transgender. When Michael Biello & Dan Martin created Outmusic Inc. in 1990, All Out Arts served as their fiscal conduit and aided their becoming a unique organization. Outmusic is now a national foundation, sponsoring National Outmusic Awards since 2001.
In 2006 the Festival presented the first event solely dedicated to and entirely by LGBT Native Americans. Native American elder Kent Lebsock presided over the opening convocation, and the event included members of the Cherokee, Mohawk, Chikasaw, Navajo, Creek, Lakota, Kumeyaay and Cree tribes.

Taming the Star Runner (1988) is a young adult coming-of-age novel written by S. E. Hinton, author of The Outsiders. Unlike her previous young adult novels, this novel has not been made into a film.
Context
The novel is the last of her series of novels that take place in and around her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma and the only one of that series written in the third-person perspective. This is also S.E. Hinton's only novel that was not made into a movie. Like her first book, The Outsiders, it is implied at the end of the book that the protagonist is the actual author. In reality, many of Travis' experiences trying to publish his book parallel those of S.E. Hinton's while trying to publish her first book (having to clean up the language, starting a second book before the first is published, being only 16) It could also be that Travis' book is deliberately similar to Hinton's first book, as it is stated that a major plot point of his book is a title character (the Star Runner) dying in a car accident, similar to Johnny in The Outsiders dying due to injuries sustained in a fire.
Plot summary
Travis is a tough kid living in a big city. When he comes home to find his stepfather cramming the fireplace with his writing, Travis assaults him with a fireplace poker. As a result, he is sent to live with his paternal uncle, Ken, on his ranch outside of Tulsa. Travis, used to living in the city, soon finds country life to be boring\ the coolest, toughest kid in school, he is now an out-of-place loner, torn between his desire to fit in and his contempt for country living. Even Ken seems too busy for him, between work at his law-firm and his divorce; he is often too busy to even keep food in the house. Travis continues work on his book while maintaining a correspondence with Joe, the only one of his friends to even occasionally write back.
He also meets Casey Kencaide, who runs a riding school on Ken's ranch and is the only one brave enough to ride the Star Runner, a creature who, like Travis, was never meant to be tamed. Soon Travis is working for Casey as a stable boy, and he receives an offer to publish his book. In response he takes a trip into town to celebrate. While in town he gets drunk and is beat up by the bouncer when his true age is discovered. In bad shape, he contacts his uncle to bring him home and reveals his book deal to Ken, a surprise for Ken, as he was unaware that Travis was even fully literate.
For a while life, to Travis, at least seems bearable. Things soon get worse though, as Travis' stepfather refuses to allow the book to be published without his prior approval. Hearing this, Travis has another fit of rage and throws the phone, nearly hitting Ken's wife, Teresa, and their son, Christopher. Teresa, in response to this, and discovering Travis' criminal record, threatens to use his presence in Ken's house to win full custody of Christopher and Ken almost kicks Travis out in his real to be with his son. Eventually they make peace after they realize that they both hoped that the other would be the father and son they were looking for. It turns out Travis' father died in the Vietnam War two months before Travis was born. Ken then agrees to help Travis get his book published, going with him to meet the publisher Ms. Carmichael when she comes to town, and even arranges some publicity with a TV interview at a station owned by a friend of his.
Travis then gets a surprise visit from his friend Joe, who had hitchhiked his way there. Instead of this being a joyous event, Joe reveals that after Travis left, his friends, Joe and the twins, Billy and Mike, had turned to burglary, fencing the goods through a man named Orson. After Joe quit, the twins continued their burglaries, but found a new fence. For this, Orson killed the twins and tried to make Joe help him. Travis and Ken convince Joe that he must return to face trial as an accomplice, and take him to the local police for extradition.
As they return to Ken's ranch, a huge lightning storm strikes and Ken and Travis must go help Casey round up the horses into the barn. As they do this, the Star Runner breaks free of his paddock. Casey and Travis give chase only to have Casey's jeep struck by lightning. Although it is not directly stated, the Star Runner is killed (This is implied from Travis smelling burned flesh).
The book ends as Casey and Travis have recovered from the accident and the temporary hearing loss. Though Casey had previously spurned Travis' romantic overtures, they are now close friends who share a common bond. Travis also realizes that he, like the Star Runner, should never allow himself to be tamed or broken, even when life is at its worst.

United Nations Security Council resolution 680, adopted 14 December 1990, noted a report of the Secretary-General that, due to the existing circumstances, the presence of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) would continue to be essential for a peaceful settlement. The Council asked the Secretary-General to report back again before 31 May 1991, to follow the implementation of the resolution.
The Council reaffirmed its previous resolutions, including Resolution 365 (1974), expressed its concern over the situation, urged the involved parties to work together toward peace and once more extended the stationing of the Force in Cyprus, established in Resolution 186 (1964), until 15 June 1991.
The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none, with Canada abstaining from the vote.

The tram network of Budapest is part of the mass transit system of Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. The tram lines serve as the second most important backbone of the transit system (after the bus network), carrying almost 100 million more passengers annually than the Budapest Metro.
In operation since 1866, the Budapest tram network is one of world's largest tram networks, operating on of total route. , it was composed of 38 lines (26 main lines, and 11 supplemental lines denoted by an 'A' , 'B' or 'G' after the route number), and the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway. The system is operated by Budapesti Közlekedési Zrt. ('Budapest Transit LLC.') under the supervision of the municipal Budapesti Közlekedési Központ ('Budapest Transit Center').
Since 2016 Budapest tram system use the world's longest 9-sectioned articulated tram vehicle CAF Urbos 3/9.
History
The early days
The first horse-tram line in Budapest was inaugurated on 30 July 1866 between Újpest-Városkapu and Kálvin tér, through Váci út. Over a year before, on 22 May 1865, the Count Sándor Károlyi founded the PKVT (Pesti Közúti Vaspálya Társaság ()). Horse tramlines in Buda proper soon followed, built by the competing Buda Public Road Rail Tracks Company (BKVT).
By 1885, Budapest had as many as 15 horsecar lines but since it was obvious that the technology was obsolete. A steam-driven suburban railway line from Közvágóhíd (Slaughterhouse) to Soroksár, run by HÉV, was separately introduced in 1887; two more lines soon followed.
Around this same time, Mór Balázs suggested that a new, electric tram system should be introduced to Budapest. It was Gábor Baross, then secretary of state at the Ministry of Community Service and Transportation who authorised the construction of the first test tram line between Nyugati railway station and Király utca. Balázs teamed up with Siemens & Halske and Lindheim és Társa and formed a new corporation: BVV (Budapesti Városi Vasút ()). The construction works (carried out by Siemens & Halske) started on October 1, 1887 and the line was opened on November 28, 1887. The track gauge of this first line was and electricity was supplied to the cars from below to avoid cables hanging across the street.
The second step in the expansion of the system were two lines: on July 20, 1889 the second line, which spanned from Egyetem tér to Fiumei út via Kálvin tér, was opened. It was designed so that in case of a power failure steam engines could tow the carriages. The third line, also standard gauge, was opened on September 10, 1889 and ran from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to Andrássy út.
Even though not a tram line per se, the first underground line in Continental Europe, the Millennium Underground Railway must also be noted. It was built using a cut-and-cover method between 1894 and 1896 and was first named FJFVV (Ferenc József Földalatti Villamos Vasút ()) after emperor Franz Joseph. It used electric cars from the very beginning.
In the first years, tram had no numbers but coloured circular signals instead, for example, a simple red, green, blue or black disk; a red disk with a vertical white stripe or a cross; a white disk with a green 8-pointed green star, etc. This, of course, quickly became very cumbersome so around 1900, when there were already 30 lines, each line got a number – BVV, which was renamed to BVVV (Budapesti Villamos Városi Vasút ()) got the even numbers; odd numbers were assigned to a rival transport company, BKVT (Budapesti Közúti Vaspálya Társaság ()).
The dynamically growing network brought new companies: two of them served Újpest, the northern part of Pest, one Pestszentlőrinc, which then was a separate town, and one the southern part of Buda and the then-separate village Budafok. These companies were joined together in 1923 by the name BSZKRT (Budapest Székesfővárosi Közlekedési Rt. ()). It was during 1939-1944 that the most tram lines (66) existed in the city.
After World War II
The siege of Budapest left the city with a crippled infrastructure: many houses were destroyed, as well as the bridges bombed, electric cables torn. It was of course of utmost importance to restore the transport network, however, many trams were destroyed either in the siege or in a depot fire that occurred in 1947. This might have been the cause that decisionmakers suggested that trolleybus lines should replace trams in the city centre. Along with cost considerations it is important to note that trolleybuses might be better suited for the downtown area than trams: they turn more easily and produce significantly less noise.
While some tram lines were abolished in favour of trolleybuses, the expansion of the system did not stop. Near Nyugati railway station a new junction of tram lines were built to transport people back and forth to the factories in Angyalföld and Újpest and line 33 through the newly built Árpád Bridge. Line 4 on the Buda side and the tracks on Nagy Lajos király útja were also extended around 1960. The reconstruction of Erzsébet Bridge in 1964 played a significant role in the revival of the tram network: five lines started using it after its opening.
In 1968 there were 83 tram lines in Budapest (10 of which night services) thus reaching the largest extent of the network since World War II, decline was imminent. This happened partly because of the replacement of tram lines with single track and old vehicles with autobuses but also due to the construction of underground lines M2 and M3 which – were then thought to – replace tram lines that used to run above them. In 1972 tram lines on Erzsébet Bridge and Rákóczi út were abolished, then until 1982 tram lines were removed along M3 as well thereby effectively erasing 40 km of rail tracks, around 20% of the Budapest tram network. Along with lines in the city centre, most of the lines in Újpest and some in the southern parts of Pest were demolished.
While many lines were closed down, a significant one was rising: tram 33 was shut down for the renovation of Árpád Bridge in 1981 but when the bridge was reopened, a new line was born on the eastern end of the outer ring road, Hungária körgyűrű, line 1. It has been under construction ever since with segments opened in 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2015 and 2019. In 2015 the line crossed to the Buda side of Rákóczi Bridge which was inaugurated in 1995 and was designed for the tram to cross it.
Present and future
As of 2012, it seems that the local governments have shifted towards a more tram-friendly view: line 1 and 3 were renovated and line 1 extended (mostly from EU funding); line 47 and 49 are planned to reach Nyugati tér once again as it used to be their final stop before M3 was opened. A major project was carried out to connect, extend, and develop the tram lines on the Buda side (providing longer lines and fewer transfers).
Lines and developments
, it was composed of 38 lines (26 main lines, and 11 supplemental lines denoted by an 'A' or 'G' after the route number), and the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway. Among these lines, only Line 6 offers non-stop service, most of the trams run between 5 am and 11 pm.
Discontinued lines
It is not always straightforward to decide whether a tram line still exists in Budapest since throughout the decades some numbers may have been carried by several lines (not at the same time though), so some numbers might have appeared and disappeared throughout time. Some lines were assigned new numbers so even though there is no line with that specific number, there is a line on exactly the same route. Of course, existing lines might have been lengthened or shortened, so this also makes hard to exactly define a tram line. Still, the following table tries to summarize these data – termini and dates refer to the last time the number was used.

The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco, Inc., is a predominantly gay 501(c)(3) nonprofit fund raising organization. Formed in 1973 as a more camp-oriented response to San Francisco's Imperial Court System by H.L. Perry, who reigned as the Court's Grand Duchess I, the Grand Ducal Council raises money for a wide array of charity organizations through large annual costume balls and various other, smaller fund raisers throughout the year. Both the Imperial Court System and the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco are built using roughly the same power structure. "Monarchs" are elected and the nonprofit, 501(c)(3) portion is run by a Board of Directors or Trustees.
The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco, in turn, inspired similar such organizations to be founded around the country. In 1998, the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco was joined by a sister Court located in Alameda County, on the opposite side of the San Francisco Bay. A third such sovereign Ducal Court exists in London, Ontario, Canada.
Called "one of the city's unsung gay heroes," in 2006 Perry's work establishing the San Francisco Ducal Council and more were commemorated with a month-long exhibit at the San Francisco Public Library.
Structure
Each individual court chapter (or "realm") is a separate, legally incorporated charitable non-profit organization that raises funds and awareness for various charities and people in need within its realm. Each chapter has its own board of directors and is financially responsible for its own management. In addition to local non-profit status, many courts in the United States have Federal 501(c) status.
Titles
Each court holds an annual "coronation," which is usually the chapter's largest fundraiser and is attended by both local members and members of other Ducal chapters as well Imperial Courts from across North America. The evening culminates in the ceremony in which the new monarch or monarchs—the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess—are crowned. In San Francisco, the new monarchs are determined by popular elections held in the community.
Within a set number of weeks, the newly elected monarchs must hold an "investiture," at which time they name the members of their Court. The titles given to members vary from one chapter to another and are primarily left to the discretion of the reigning monarchs.
Each Court consists of a Royal Crown Prince and Royal Crown Princess, Prince/Princess Royale, Baron/Baroness, etc. Additionally, each year the Court holds fund raising competitions to crown such titles as Royal Baby Girl & Baby Boy, King & Queen of Hearts, Mr. & Miss Royal Bunny, Royal Daddy & Royal Daddy's Boy and White Knight and Debutante. In 2009, the Court added an annual fund raising pageant to crown Miss San Francisco Gold Rush.
Fundraising
Each court conducts numerous fundraisers throughout the year. Drag shows, ranging in size from performances at local bars to events in hotel ballrooms and other large venues, are the main way in which revenue is raised for charity. Especially in recent years, court chapters have diversified their fundraising strategies so as to include yard sales, gift raffles, etc. Court members also solicit donations at LGBT events, gay pride parades and other public events at which they appear.
The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco donates the funds raised to a variety of causes including those related to AIDS, breast cancer, domestic abuse, and homelessness.
Membership
While composed primarily of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, each court is open to all. Gay, bisexual, transgender and straight people have all served as monarchs and court members in the system's history. Drag queens collectively comprise about half of the membership.

Prizzi's Honor is a satirical crime novel by Richard Condon published in 1982. It is the first of four novels featuring the Prizzis, a powerful family of Mafiosi in New York City. In all four novels the protagonist is a top member of the family named Charlie Partanna. It was adapted into a successful film of the same name.
Plot summary
The opening lines of the New York Times review summarize the complexities of the novel:
CHARLEY PARTANNA, underboss of the Prizzi crime family, has a problem. He's just bumped off a traitor in Vegas who'd fleeced the organization to the tune of $720,000 - and now he's discovered that his new girlfriend, Irene, was the dead man's wife. As if that weren't enough of a headache, Charley's also learned that she's been augmenting her income as a tax consultant by working as a freelance hitter, and that she's now been offered a contract by a family rival to do the number on him. What a business for a woman! Charley grouses. This is a serious thing. We were going to get married. You think she decided what business? asks his father, Angelo, consigliere to the Prizzis. She's an American! She had a chance to win even more money so she grabbed it!
Complexity builds upon complexity, irony builds upon irony, murder follows murder, and tension mounts as the improbable story of the two married killers races to its climax.
Condon's style
Condon attacked his targets, usually gangsters, financiers, and politicians, wholeheartedly but with a uniquely original style and wit that made almost any paragraph from one of his books instantly recognizable. Reviewing one of his works in the International Herald Tribune, the well-known playwright George Axelrod (The Seven-Year Itch, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter), who had collaborated with Condon on the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, wrote:
"The arrival of a new novel by Richard Condon is like an invitation to a party.... the sheer gusto of the prose, the madness of his similies, the lunacy of his metaphors, his infectious, almost child-like joy in composing complex sentences that go bang at the end in the manner of exploding cigars is both exhilarating and as exhausting as any good party ought to be."
In Prizzi's Honor Condon's normal exuberance is somewhat muted because the entire book is narrated through the viewpoints of the semi-literate underworld characters who populate it. Nevertheless, on the first page of the book, we have Don Corrado Prizzi, the 84-year-old leader of the family, attending a wedding:
He was asleep, but even in repose his face was as subtly distorted and burnished as that of a giant crown of thorns starfish predator. Every few moments both small, sharp eyes, as merry as ice cubes, would open, make a reading, then close again.

All of Condon's books have, to an unknown degree, the names of real people in them as characters, generally very minor or peripheral. The most common, which appears in most of his books, is some variation of Franklin M. Heller. The real-life Heller was a television director in New York City in the 1950s, '60s, and 70s, who initially lived on Long Island and then moved to a house on Rockrimmon Road in Stamford, Connecticut. In this book Marxie Heller plays a somewhat more important role than usual, being the husband of Charley's future wife, Irene, before being shot to death by Charley in the garage of Irene's Los Angeles home.
Reception
The New York Times gave it a very favorable long review, comparing it to Condon's previously best-known book, The Manchurian Candidate:
Of course, Mr. Condon is an old pro at mixing satire and suspense. Twenty years ago, he began a novel with an outlandish comic premise: Since Joe McCarthy couldn't have done more for the Communists if he had been one himself, suppose he had been? His answer to that question, The Manchurian Candidate, the first of what has been a long string of best sellers for Mr. Condon, was one of the finest thrillers of recent times and perhaps the most darkly amusing look ever at the McCarthy era. Prizzi's Honor also involves a humorous variation on a real-life theme... Twenty years after The Manchurian Candidate, it's nice to know that Mr. Condon is still up to his sly tricks. In his case, at least, it's a pleasure that - as he tells us an old Sicilian proverb has it - The fewer things change, the more they remain the same.
Kirkus Review, however, was far less charitable. After a long synopsis of the plot, it concluded:
Believable? Not really. Hilarious? Now and then in the opening chapter--with the portrait of likable/dumb/lethal Charley and his reactions to Irene's secret life (""What a business for a woman!""). But all too soon the lovers' matter-of-fact murdering becomes sick instead of offbeat, while Condon's cheerful non-stop vulgarity shifts from gritty to gross. And, though intermittently inspired in its low-life linguistics, this rather slow-paced, loose-plotted farce/melodrama succeeds neither as dog-eat-dog black comedy nor as Mafioso thriller/romance.

John Howe (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book illustrator and conceptual designer, best-known for his artwork of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in Strasbourg, France, then at the École des arts décoratifs in the same town.
Howe and Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. Howe illustrated the Lord of the Rings board game created by Reiner Knizia, and re-illustrated the maps of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion in 1996–2003. His work includes images of mythological material such as the Old English epic poem Beowulf (including Knizia's board game Beowulf: The Legend). Howe illustrated many books in the fantasy genre, such as those by Robin Hobb. He also contributed to the film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R. Martin's novel A Clash of Kings was released by Meisha Merlin, with numerous illustrations by Howe.
Howe has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game.
For The Hobbit films, original director Guillermo del Toro and replacement director Peter Jackson consulted with both Howe and fellow conceptual artist Alan Lee to ensure continuity of design.
Howe is a member of the living history group the Company of Saynt George, and has expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.
Howe is also serving as a conceptual designer for Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which is scheduled to premiere on Prime Video on September 2, 2022.
Biography
John Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got "a real spark" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.
A year after his high school graduation, Howe moved to Strasbourg, France to attend college. The following year, he enrolled into the École des arts décoratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:
Throughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was "simultaneously ancient and novel." He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his "The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-dûr", a piece inspired by Tolkien's, The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of "his" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.
Projects in which Howe worked include The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.

General Eliott (or General Elliott) was launched in 1782 as the East Indiaman Fletcher, but was renamed before completion to honour General Elliott's defence of Gibraltar. Under the ownership of Robert Preston (later 6th Baronet), she made six voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) and one voyage as transport for a naval expedition. She then became a West Indiaman until she was sold for breaking up in 1802.
Career
EIC voyage #1 (1783–1784)
Captain Robert Drummond sailed from Portsmouth on 17 March 1783, bound for Bombay. General Eliott reached Johanna on 28 June and arrived at Bombay on 19 July. She visited Tellicherry on 24 September, Anjengo on 4 October, and Tellicherry again on 26 October, and returned to Bombay on 10 November. She then visited Goa on 29 November, and returned to Bombay on 16 December. Homeward bound, she was at Goa on 21 January 1784, Tellicherry on 6 February, and St Helena on 5 May, and she arrived back at The Downs on 18 July.
EIC voyage #2 (1785–1786)
Captain Drummond sailed from Portsmouth on 28 March 1785. General Eliott arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 29 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 27 December, reached St Helena on 25 March 1786, and arrived at The Downs on 27 May.
EIC voyage #3 (1787–1788)
Captain Robert Preston sailed from The Downs on 1 April 1787, bound for Bombay. General Eliott reached Madeira on 19 April and arrived at Bombay on 28 July. Homeward bound, she was at St Helena on 2 March 1788, and arrived at The Downs on 10 May.
EIC voyage #4 (1788–1790)
Captain Robert Drummond sailed from The Downs on 19 December 1788, bound for Bombay and China. General Eliott was at Simon's Bay on 13 March 1789, reached Bombay on 16 May, and arrived at Whampoa on 27 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 8 January 1790, reached St Helena on 13 April, and arrived at The Downs on 19 June.
EIC voyage #5 (1792–1793)
Captain Drummond sailed from The Downs on 6 April 1792, bound for Bombay. General Eliott arrived at Bombay on 28 July. She visited Surat on 14 November, returned to Bombay on 30 November, returned to Surat on 5 February 1793, and returned to Bombay on 15 February. Homeward bound, she was at Tellicherry on 9 March and Calicut on 27 March. She reached St Helena on 14 June, and arrived at The Downs on 21 August.
EIC voyage #6 (1794–1795)
War with France had commenced on 1 February 1793 and Captain Robert Drummond acquired a letter of marque on 17 August 1793. However, Captain Adam Drummond acquired one on 23 December 1793.
The British government held General Elliot at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on Île de France (Mauritius). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid £1,346 12s 8d for having delayed her departure by 71 days.
General Eliott sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May 1794, bound for Bengal. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 11 September. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 28 November, reached St Helena on 18 May 1795, and arrived at The Downs on 22 July.
West Indies expedition (1795–1796)
General Eliott had no sooner returned to England when she joined Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's expedition to the West Indies. The Government chartered General Eliott and a number of other EIC vessels, as transports. Captain Joshua Langhorne acquired a letter of marque on 30 October 1795.
The expedition sailed on 6 October, 16 November, and 9 December, but weather forced the vessels to put back. At some point General Eliott and sustained so much damage in gales that they had to come into harbour to refit.
The fleet finally successfully sailed on 20 March to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada.
West Indiaman
General Eliott was sold into the West Indies trade in 1796. On 25 February 1798 her officers and crew (some 70 persons in all), abandoned her on the Goodwin Sands as she was returning from Jamaica. A Danish vessel took them aboard. Although she was taking on water, and had lost her rudder, cables, and anchors, she continued to float. Boats came from shore and salvaged her. Estimates were that the salvors would earn £10,000 pounds for their efforts. The Royal Navy frigate and ship of the line towed General Elliot in to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.
Fate
General Eliott was sold in 1802 for breaking up.

Raul V. Fabella (born 12 April 1949, Bacolod, Negros Occidental, Philippines) is a Filipino academic, economist and National Scientist of the Philippines. He was born to Estelito Fabella and Magdalena Villaseñor in Bacolod, Negros Occidental. Raul is the grandnephew of Gabriel Fabella, father of June 12th. Raul's grandfather Adriano was Gabriel's brother.
Fabella was educated at the Seminario Mayor-Recoletos (now the Casiciaco Recoletos Seminary, Ph.B. 1970); the University of the Philippines School of Economics at UP Diliman (M.A. 1975). He obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Economics of Yale University in 1982 with the dissertation "Economies of Scale in the Household Production Model and Intra-Family Allocation of Resources". His entire academic career has been spent with the faculty of the University of the Philippines School of Economics (UPSE), which he served as dean from 1998 to 2007.
Fabella has written articles in both theoretical and applied fields: political economy and rent-seeking; the theory of teams; regulation; international economics; and mathematical economics. Notable concepts associated with him are the "Olson ratio" in rent-seeking, egalitarian Nash bargaining solutions, and the debt-adjusted real effective exchange rate.
In public-policy debates he has been a prominent advocate of a policy of currency undervaluation as a tool of development.
Fabella was elected to the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) in 1995. Upon endorsement by NAST, he was awarded the title of National Scientist by President Benigno Aquino III on 27 July 2011. The National Scientist title is the highest recognition given by the Philippine Government to a Filipino for his or her outstanding contributions to science and technology.

Jo Jones Trio is an album recorded by drummer Jo Jones in 1959 and released by the Everest label.
Reception
AllMusic reviewer Scott Yanow stated "Jo Jones is probably best known for his work with Count Basie, but his small-group dates as a leader, though overlooked, are also very rewarding. ... The trio is effortlessly swinging ... this 1959 LP treats the musicians with the respect they deserve". On All About Jazz, David Rickert wrote "The Jo Jones Trio, features his working unit of Ray Bryant and Tommy Bryant on a straightforward piano trio recording. Bryant utilizes a minimalist approach similar to Basie's, but the trio explores a wider terrain than the big band ever did".

The Taurian Games (Latin Ludi Taurii or Ludi Taurei, rarely Taurilia) were games (ludi) held in ancient Rome in honor of the di inferi, the gods of the underworld. They were not part of a regularly scheduled religious festival on the calendar, but were held as expiatory rites religionis causa, occasioned by religious concerns.
Ludi Taurii are recorded in 186 BC as a two-day event. Varro mentions them as occurring in the late Republic. During the reign of Antoninus Pius, they were held every five years from 140 to 160 AD, within a period beginning on the day after the Ides of May and continuing through the Kalends of June. Some scholars extrapolate that like the lustrum (purification ritual), the Ludi Taurii were regularly quinquennial. Others caution that the five-year schedule under Antoninus Pius, attested by the Fasti Ostienses, is never mentioned in other sources. The limited evidence suggests the Ludi Taurii were important mainly in the context of religious revivalism during the Augustan and Antonine eras.
The Taurian Games were horse races, or less likely chariot races, on a course around turning posts (metae). In the 19th century, they were sometimes confused with the archaic Tarentine Games (ludi tarentini), which were replaced by the Saecular Games. Horse racing along with the propitiation of underworld gods was characteristic of "old and obscure" Roman festivals such as the Consualia, the October Horse, and sites in the Campus Martius such as the Tarentum (where the ludi tarentini originated) and the Trigarium. The Ludi Taurii were the only games held in the Circus Flaminius.
If the games are Etruscan in origin, as Festus and Servius claim, taurii probably comes from the Etruscan word tauru, "tomb." The design of the turning posts (metae) on a Roman race course was derived from Etruscan funerary monuments. Festus, however, offers an etiology based on Latin taurus, "bull."
Origin and significance
In the tradition recorded by Festus, the games were instituted in the Regal period when Tarquinius Superbus was king. Servius also places their origin during his reign.
Festus explains that the games were performed in honor of the gods below (di inferi). They were established in response to an epidemic (magna … pestilentia) afflicting pregnant women, caused by the distribution of the flesh of sacrificial bulls (tauri) among the people. Servius implies that the pestilentia was infant mortality: "each delivery of the women came out badly." The remedy of the games was obtained ex libris fatalibus, "from the books of the fates" (either the Sibylline books or Etruscan texts). According to Servius, the ludi took their name from the word taurea, meaning a sterile sacrificial victim (hostia).
Servius gives an alternative version that credits the Sabines with instituting the games in response to the pestilentia, and characterizes the transferral of the lues publica (the plague upon the people) onto sacrificial victims (hostiae) as if it were a scapegoat ritual.
Festus also provided an additional explanation of the name as taurus ("bull") from Varro, preserved only in fragmentary form by the Codex Farnesianus. A reconstruction dating back to J.J. Scaliger has been taken to mean that youths, under the direction of a coach, engaged in ritual gymnastics on a raw bull's hide, perhaps to be compared to exercises on a trampoline. This view has not attracted wide acceptance, but would suggest that the ritual action countervails infant mortality by affirming the fitness of the youth. Ritually, landing on the bull's skin may mimic the "catching" of a safely delivered newborn.
The Augustan historian Livy has a brief reference to the games as occurring in 186 BC per biduum, for a period of two days, religionis causa, "for the sake of religious scruple." On this occasion, the two-day Ludi Taurii preceded ten days of ludi presented by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior as the result of a vow in the Aetolian War. Nobilior's games are notable as the first time a beast hunt (venatio) was staged at Rome. At a corrupt transition between the two events in Livy's text, the word decem ("ten") appears, which Georg Wissowa construed as referring to the ten-member priestly college of decemviri sacris faciundis; he thought these priests were likely charged with organizing the Taurian Games.
Earlier scholars have sometimes taken the adjective taurii to mean that bulls were part of the games, either in a Mediterranean tradition of bull-leaping, or as an early form of bullfighting. Because Livy's chronology places the Ludi Taurii (or in some editions Taurilia) immediately after the news of a victory in Roman Spain, the games have figured in a few efforts to trace the early history of Spanish-style bullfighting.

DrinkWise Australia (DrinkWise) is an Australian social change organisation created to bring about healthier and safer drinking culture in Australia – where drinking alcohol excessively or drinking too young is considered undesirable. Utilising targeted, integrated and sustained social marketing approaches and developing practical education initiatives and resources allows DrinkWise to inform and support the community about responsible alcohol use.
DrinkWise's philosophy is founded on industry leadership and community partnerships. It is currently funded by voluntary contributions from alcohol industry participants and has in the past received both Coalition and Labour Government funding to support its work.
The organisation is governed by a board of eminent Australians with backgrounds including policing, public health, education, community service, academia, research and marketing. DrinkWise's alcohol industry contributors are also represented on its board.
History
DrinkWise Australia was established in 2005 and then received $5 million in funding from the Federal Government as announced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing in the then Australian Government, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP.
Board Members
Under the DrinkWise constitution, the board must comprise eight (8) community members and six (6) industry representatives with the Chair being a community member. Current board members as of July 2022 are:

Activities
Campaigns
To date, DrinkWise Australia has launched a range of social marketing campaigns and initiatives including Kids Absorb Your Drinking, Kids and Alcohol Don't Mix, Drinking – Do it Properly and "You won't Miss a Moment...if you DrinkWise".
Kids Absorb Your Drinking
Launched in June 2008, the Kids Absorb Your Drinking campaign marked DrinkWise Australia's initial step towards engaging generational change in attitudes to alcohol. The campaign was created to raise awareness of the importance of role-modelling behaviour of parents about their consumption of alcohol. In a 2008 media release, DrinkWise cites research that supports the view that there is a strong positive correlation between the way parents drink and how their children grow up to drink. According to DrinkWise, children form their attitudes towards alcohol a long time before they've had their first drink by observing how their parents and other adults around them drink.
Kids and Alcohol Don't Mix
In 2010 the Kids and Alcohol Don't Mix campaign alerted parents to emerging clinical research undertaken by Professor Ian Hickie at the Sydney University mind and brain institute that indicated that alcohol can cause damage to the developing adolescent brain. The campaign challenged parents to put aside any existing beliefs about introducing alcohol to their underage adolescents and to encourage them to delay their children's introduction to alcohol for as long as possible. The campaign empowers parents with facts and tactics via the DrinkWise website.
Drinking – Do it Properly (18–24 year-old Campaign)
In 2014, DrinkWise Australia launched an Australian first campaign designed to influence young adults (18–24 years) to drink responsibly – by moderating the intensity and frequency of binge drinking occasions. The Drinking – Do it Properly campaign aims to make the ongoing trend of drinking to get drunk less socially acceptable among young drinkers, and to encourage those already drinking in safe and moderate ways. The campaign was developed in response to the prevalence of poor drinking choices by young Australians aged 18–24 years. DrinkWise commissioned extensive quantitative and qualitative formative research as well as multiple rounds of concept testing research to ensure the campaign cut through with young adults. To date, the campaign has been in receipt of numerous international and Australian awards.
Commissioned research
Where a knowledge gap has existed DrinkWise Australia has commissioned independent academic research to ensure that its activities are underpinned by a sound evidence base:
From Ideal to Reality: Cultural contradictions and young people's drinking: The first stage of this project resulted in a literature review that collected a range of data that addressed the topic and was published in 2008. This report is the result of qualitative research undertaken by NCETA that examined the socio-cultural influences on 14 to 24-year-old Australians' drinking and the analysis provides useful insights to better understand these influences.
Drinking patterns in Australia, 2001-2007: The Report is based on an analysis of data from 2001, 2004 and 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Surveys, and looks at trends in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harm, alcohol beverage of choice, under-age drinking and factors associated with risky drinking populations.
The influence of parents and siblings on children's and adolescents' alcohol use: a critical review of the literature: A consortium consisting of Monash, Newcastle and La Trobe Universities undertook this review to document and critique the existing evidence (available up to 2009) concerning the role of parents and older sibling's behaviours, attitudes and use of alcohol in influencing their children's/siblings' attitudes, behaviour and use of alcohol, within the broader social environment.
Alcohol and the Teenage Brain: Safest to keep them apart: Professor Ian Hickie, Executive Director of the Brain and Mind Research Institute at the University of Sydney reviewed the evidence regarding alcohol and the teenage brain and identified that alcohol can disrupt the brain development during the critical phase of growth that occurs from around 12–13 years of age until our early twenties.
What a Great Night'; The Cultural Drivers and Drinking Practices among 14-24-year-old Australians: A consortium consisting of Monash and Deakin Universities undertook this research project to identify the most salient cultural drivers of low risk and risky alcohol consumption by Victorian youth, located in inner and outer suburban settings plus provincial and rural locations in Victoria.
Expressions of Drunkenness (400 Rabbits): This book is the 10th in a scholarly series on alcohol in society published by the International Center for Alcohol Policies (ICAP) and provides an understanding of the historical origins of drunkenness; the biological explanations of intoxication; the language used to define this phenomenon; and modern-day drinking patterns.
Sustaining a Reduction of Alcohol-Related Harms in the Licensed Environment: A Practical Experiment to Generate New Evidence: This project was undertaken to develop a comprehensive prevention model that was capable of reducing alcohol-related violence and aggression, and a scientifically defensible research design to test the model in a variety of licensed environments in Australia and New Zealand.
Criticism
Some health and academic commentators have noted that DrinkWise is the Australian version of the global alcohol industry-supported public relations organisations, following the example of the tobacco industry. In 2009 fifty-eight scientists and health professionals expressed their opposition to DrinkWise by signing a letter stating that they will not seek or accept funding from them, and called on other researchers and community agencies to consider their own positions. These researchers strongly oppose the perceived conflict of interest between a body that is linked to an industry that profits from the consumption of alcohol, and that also purports to fund research aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm.
In 2018 thousand posters warning pregnant women about the dangers of alcohol have had to be removed from the walls of hospitals and GP clinics around Australia because they contained misleading and inaccurate information about the risks of drinking alcohol while pregnant.
The posters were distributed by Tonic Health Media and were later replaced with updated posters.

Nicolas Bergasse (born 24 January 1750 in Lyon – died 28 May 1832 in Paris) was a French lawyer, philosopher, and politician, whose activity was mainly carried out during the beginning of the French Revolution during its early Monarchiens phase.
Life
After studying philosophy and law, Bergasse became a lawyer at the Parlement of Paris. He was very interested in the Enlightenment and in particular meeting Sieyès and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1781, he became a disciple of Franz Mesmer, and published in 1784 a systemization of Mesmerism titled Considérations sur le magnetisme animal. In the Kornmann case, his quarrel with Beaumarchais made him a famous personality.
In 1789, he was elected Deputy of the Estates-General and become an important face of the Monarchiens Party. During the French Revolution, he created a particular political and constitutional thought inspired by the British and American models and develops a theory of the sovereignty of universal reason. He delivered an important report to the National Assembly on the organization of justice. He survived the Reign of Terror, but stopped active policy.
During the Bourbon Restoration, he published Essay on the law and Essay on the Property, as a result of which he ran into problems with the authorities. He died in Paris in 1832, aged 82.

Elena Nikandrovna Klokacheva (, also known as Klakachova (Клакачова) and Klakacheva (Клакачева); Saint Petersburg, Russia, 25 November 1871 – not before 1943), was a painter mainly known by one of the few existing portraits of Rasputín, now at the Hermitage. In 1942 and 1943, during the Siege of Leningrad, she draws some portraits of Spanish military physicians belonging to the Wehrmacht Blue Division.
Biography
Elena Nikandrovna Klokacheva was born in a distinguished navy officers family. Fedot Alekséevich Klokachev (Федот Алексеевич Клокачёв,1739-1783), Vice admiral of the Black Sea fleet, was Klokacheva's great-great-grandfather. Her father, Nikandr Nikolaevich Klokachev (Никандр Николаевич Клокачёв), was Rear admiral.
She studied at the Gymnasium "Maria Nikolaevna Stoiunina" and, since 1891, at the Imperial Academy of Arts.
Since 1902 she appeared in the directory All Petersburg (Весь Петербург), sometimes as Klokacheva and others as Klakacheva, with different addresses. Since 1906 she lived in Serguiévskaya street that changed its name to Tchaikovsky street in 1923. From 1917 on, her name disappears from the directory. Since 1922 she lived in Pavlovsk.
In 1910, the writer Evdokiia Nagródskaia (Евдокия Аполлоновна Нагродская) dedicated to Klokachova her novel The Wrath of Dionysus (Гнев Диониса,Saint Petersburg,Тип. Н.Я. Стойковой, 1910).
In 1942 and 1943, the Spanish Blue Division, participating in the Siege of Leningrad, had a field dressing station in Pavlovsk. Klokacheva made charcoal portraits of some of the Spanish military physicians on assignment there. Their families hold two of these portraits in Spain.
The date and place of her death are unknown.
Artistic career
She studied painting at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (Императорская Академия Xудожеств); during 1891 and 1892 with Pavel Chistiakov and then with Pavel Kovalevsky (). In 1899 she went to Munich to study with the Slovene painter Anton Ažbe and with Franz von Lenbach.
Klokacheva took part in some of the exhibitions of the Peredvizhniki (The Wanderers or The Itinerants) group whose best known member was Ilya Repin.
In 1901 she was entitled "artist” (Russian: художника) for her picture “Behind the scenes” (За кулисами). The Academy had accepted full membership of women just in 1873.
In 1907, the Academy acquired her work At the circus; her picture Hard days and a portrait of her friend, the art historian Olga Bazankur (Ольга Георгиевна Базанкур-Штейнфельд) were exhibited in Saint Petersburg and Moscow.
In 1909 she took part in the spring exhibition at the Imperial Academy of Arts with her work “Satyr and nymph”.
Klokacheva participated in the artistic circles of her time in Saint Petersburg; she was friend with the writers Nadezhda Aleksandrovna Lukhmanova (Надежда Александровна Лухманова) and Evdokiia Nagródskaia. At the Imperial Academy some of her colleagues were Maria Alekseevna Fedorova (Мария Алексеевна Фёдорова), Elizabeta Mikhailovna Martynova (Елизавета Михайловна Мартынова), and Anna Petrovna Ostroumova-Lebedeva. She posed for the photographer Elena Lukinichna Mrozovskaya -Helène de Mrosovsky- (Елена Лукинична Мрозовская).

Birthana loxopis is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1909. It is found in Assam, India.
The wingspan is about 30 mm. The forewings are dark purplish fuscous with a narrow irregular orange basal fascia enclosing two small dark fuscous spots. From this fascia rise seven longitudinal yellow-whitish lines on the veins and the dorsum, reaching mostly to about the middle. There is an oblique transverse rather narrow ochreous-white blotch in the disc beyond the middle. The hindwings are dark fuscous with a slight orange median dash near the base and an orange subdorsal streak from near the base to beyond the middle.

Spectrophobia (derived from Latin: spectrum, n. specio, an appearance, form, image of a thing; an apparition, spectre) or catoptrophobia (from Greek κάτοπτρον kátoptron, "mirror") is a kind of specific phobia involving an abnormal and persistent fear of mirrors, and an anxiety about seeing one's own face reflected in them. It is sometimes related to the fear of ghosts or the undead.
This phobia is distinct from eisoptrophobia, which is the fear of one's own reflection. Sufferers of spectrophobia can fear the breaking of a mirror bringing extreme bad luck. They can fear the thought of something frightening jumping out of the mirror, or seeing something disturbing inside of it next to their own reflection when looking directly at it. Others fear that it is a link to the preternatural world or a gateway into another world, and may fear being pulled into the mirror by some preternatural force. Some also fear their own reflection in the darkness, as it can appear distorted in strange ways or their reflection may frighten them.

Bora Yoon is a Korean-American experimental electroacoustic composer and musician known for her use of unconventional instruments and musical technology in her music. An interdisciplinary sound artist, vocalist and TED2014 Fellow, she gathers and uses instruments and timbres from various centuries and cultures, to create immersive audiovisual experiences, with architecture, and acoustics.
Early life
Bora Yoon was born in Chicago, Illinois. She completed her undergraduate studies at Ithaca College's Conservatory of Music and Writing School, and is currently a doctoral candidate in Music Composition at Princeton University.
Body of work
Yoon uses unconventional sound sources (everyday found objects, chamber instruments and digital devices) to generate music, and illuminate the invisibility of environment, sound, space, and architectural acoustics and psychoacoustics—to create a storytelling through sound.
In her work, she has used the human voice, violin/viola, water, ancient Tibetan singing bowls, cell phones, music boxes, glockenspiel, guitar, walkie talkies, metronomes, shortwave radios, kitchenware, found sounds, and electronics.
As a performer, Yoon has toured her experimental soundwork internationally at venues including the Lincoln Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Singapore Arts Festival, Edinburgh International Festival, the KBS/Nam June Paik Museum in Seoul, the Festival of World Cultures (Poland), and various galleries, universities, and performing arts centers around the globe. She composes music/sound for film, theater, and dance, including an adaptation of Haruki Murakami's Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.
Collaborations
Yoon's wide-ranging musical skills have yielded a diverse collection of collaborators across many genres and disciplines which include:
Visual artists Ann Hamilton, and Seoul-based kinetic sculptor U-Ram Choe.
Electronic artists: Iceland-based producer Ben Frost, DJ Spooky, King Britt
Poet Sekou Sundiata
indie guitarist Kaki King
composers Michael Gordon, Christopher Bono, and composer/live visualist/ data artist R. Luke DuBois,
Chamber ensembles SYMPHO, and early music group New York Polyphony
Choral ensembles SAYAKA Ladies Consort of Tokyo, Voices of Ascension, and Musica Viva
Dance collaborations include choreographers Noemie Lafrance, Yin Mei Dance.
Korean traditional dance and drumming artist Vong Pak
Multimedia London-based wax cylinder artist Aleks Kolkowski
Spatial acoustic works
As a composer, notable spatial-acoustic works with unusual architecture include stereophonic sound mural "Doppler Dreams" for seven sopranos on bicycles in Brooklyn's , empty McCarren Pool for the site-specific dance piece Agora II, and created and performed the multi-speaker live sound score for the aerial dance piece Rapture, reverberated off the dynamic curves of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center (Bard College) as part of a collaboration with award-winning choreographer Noémie Lafrance.
Choral commission "Semaphore Conductus" created for the Young People's Chorus of New York City is inspired by the conduction of energy, signals, and the evolution of communication devices (conch, gramophone, megaphone, cell phones) over the centuries. This is sung in surround-sound, creating an activated sound field for the audience, and lives between the space of a choral performance work, and sound installation.
Multi-format releases
In 2014, Yoon published a multi-media release for master work 'Sunken Cathedral', which was first released as
a limited-edition Double LP and digital release, co-produced with R. Luke DuBois
an interactive graphic album for iPad with the GRALBUM Collective in Brooklyn NY
a multimedia staged show, directed by Glynis Rigsby.
Inspired by turning the lens of architecture inward, to the architecture of the subconscious, and the mind. The album was a culmination of major works created from 2006 ~ 2013, and featured guest artists New York Polyphony and poet Sekou Sundiata.
The staged multimedia work, directed by Glynis Rigsby, reflects Buddhist philosophies of cycles and orbits as well as issues of identity Yoon's Korean heritage. Featururing immersive video design by Adam Larsen, 'Sunken Cathedral' premiered the world stage to critical acclaim, and was presented by the Prototype Festival and LaMama Experimental Theater Club, and co-produced by HERE Art Center and Beth Morrison Projects.

Karel Komzák I (4 November 182319 March 1893) was a Bohemian composer, organist, bandmaster and conductor. He was the father of Karel Komzák II and the grandfather of Karel Komzák III.
Biography
Karel Komzák was born in 1823 in Netěchovice, near Týn nad Vltavou, now in the České Budějovice District of the Czech Republic. A memorial plaque now commemorates his birthplace. He learned the violin from his father, a blacksmith but also a popular folk singer and acclaimed violinist, and studied with Moritz Mildner and Antonín Bennewitz at the Prague Conservatory. He studied at the School for Organists and became a village teacher. Later he was an organist at a lunatic asylum, the National Institute for the Mentally Ill, where he worked for 19 years. He was also a bandmaster of the Rifle Corps in Prague and a theatre conductor in Linz. He moved around frequently, staying longest at Vienna and Baden.
He formed a well-respected orchestra for opera performances at the Czech Provisional Theatre. In 1862 it was permanently attached to the Theatre. Among its players were Antonín Dvořák (viola) and the composer's own son Karel Komzák II (violin). He was succeeded in this post by Bedřich Smetana.
In 1865 Komzák was appointed bandmaster in the 11th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army in Innsbruck. He served in this post for the next 15 years in a variety of locations.
In 1876 he declined an offer to conduct at the World Exhibition in Chicago, followed by a concert tour of Boston, Washington and New York.
In 1880 he moved to the 74th Infantry Regiment. Up until this time, he had warmed the hearts of his listeners by regularly including Czech folk songs in his concert programs, but from 1880 this music was forbidden. He retired in 1881, but only a year later was persuaded to join the newly formed 88th Infantry Regiment in Prague as a bandmaster. He retired in April 1888 to his birthplace, where he died in 1893, aged 69.
He wrote more than 200 popular marches, waltzes, mazurkas, polkas, galops, quadrilles and other dances.

Sterlington, was a tiny community located in the Town of Ramapo, Rockland County, New York, United States located between Suffern and Sloatsburg.
The name was adopted when the post office opened in 1882. The Sterling Mountain Railway transported ore to the furnaces at sterling which was known as Sterling Junction or Pierson's Depot. Sterlington ceased when the railway ceased operation.
Quote from Catskill Archive Gazetteer:
"Sterlington, junction of the Sterling Mountain Railroad, running to Sterling Lake and mines; Sloatsburg, a small hamlet, formerly of some industrial importance. From New York, 35 and 36 miles respectively."
Possibly this location was named after the Sterling Lake mentioned in the quotation.

Cyril Francis Caunter (22 March 1899 in Ilford, Essex – 10 April 1988), was a British aviation historian and author.
Life
He was the son of Lionel George Caunter from Dittisham, Devon and Elizabeth Gertrude Einhauser from St Pancras, Middlesex. When he was at school, his headmaster was Fr. Ignatius Rice M.A., O.S.B. He was a pilot in World War I.
In 1932, Caunter published a design for a 60 hp two-stroke light aero engine. Frederick George Miles of the Phillips & Powis Aircraft company (later Miles Aircraft Ltd) built a test prototype of the Caunter engine and successful tests were carried out at Reading Aerodrome in Woodley, Berkshire, during the late 1930s. The Caunter engine performed well at Woodley with Miles, who proposed a company to produce it, to install in an aeroplane that would be sold in large numbers like Ford cars.
Caunter worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment starting in the summer of 1937 in the aero engine department, writing some of the operational text books of the RAF aero engines, including the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine which powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters.
Phillips & Powis increasingly concentrated on military training aircraft production at Woodley from the late thirties and the Caunter engine was put aside. Caunter eventually became Chief Technical Librarian for the R.A.E. after a 1943 transfer and sold his prototype engine to Alvis Ltd., Coventry, for £2,000 after the war.
In 1950, he joined the Science Museum as keeper of the Road Transport Collections, beginning ten years of work documenting one of the finest collections in existence at the time. He began the process of restoring the collection. An 1888 1½ h.p. Benz three-wheeled car which had been purchased by the Science Museum in 1913 for 5 pounds and was one of the oldest cars in the world, was driven in the 1957 London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, as the No. 1 car, but its poor braking meant it did not finish. He fitted a second brake to it in 1958 and successfully completed the Run.
The National Film Board of Canada produced Full Circle, a vignette about Caunter returning to flight and college at the age of eighty. He was writer-in-residence at Glendon College in 1979, and he received his M.A. there in June 1982.
Caunter lies buried in Saint Mary's Catholic Cemetery in the city of Barrie in Ontario, Canada.
Works
Caunter's first publication was a small handbook, Model Petrol Engines, published in 1920 by Percival Marshall Ltd., followed by Small Electric Lighting Sets, which he described as "bad, although it was published". Madness Opens The Door (1932) was written in 1931 in six weeks for £100. Pitman published Small Two-Stroke Aero Engines and Small Four-Stroke Aero Engines as well as Light Aero Engines and The Two-Cycle Engine (1932). He published the novel Madness Opens The Door, a space novel, and Ex-Gangster and Killers Must Die.
Caunter wrote six HMSO books about Science Museum subjects during the 1950s. His official handbooks include The History and Development of Cycles.
In 1936 Caunter wrote Death of the War God, which was about a world war, which he scheduled in the novel to start in 1939. His publishers at that time were afraid of publishing it because of widespread anxiety of another conflict. Caunter mentions in his 1969 unpublished autobiography that his space novels were inspired by those of H.G. Wells but were written too soon to be popular in the 1970s.
Family
Caunter married Kathleen Eve Murray on 12 April 1928.

The National Commission on Excellence in Education produced the 1983 report titled A Nation at Risk. It was chaired by David P. Gardner and included prominent members such as Nobel prize-winning chemist Glenn T. Seaborg.
It produced a short summary of its findings called The United States System of Education in which it gives a short history of education since colonial days and, after a Preface, gives an overall view on control and financing of education, organization and structure, statistical data and conclusions.
Background
In their 1983 report, A nation at risk: The imperative for educational reform, the National Commission on Excellence in Education said "Our Nation is at risk. Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world."
In 1983, The New York Times published an article that cited a passage from the "Pursuit of Excellence: Education and the Future of America" by the Rockefeller Brothers' Fund's panel, "America at Mid-Century."
The "excellence" movement of the mid-1980s, was inspired by the landmark report, "A Nation at Risk''.
The article emphasized among several points the observation that teachers are frequently regarded as identical units of a factory assembly line in the education sector. Mentors regardless of competence teach the same subjects in the same grade, use one kind of textbook, deal with the same number of pupils, and receive equal salaries. This trend has not changed since 1958. The late John W. Gardner who used to be Education Secretary of former President Lyndon Johnson and afterwards Chairman of the Commission insisted that students with academic proficiency should take an additional three years each of mathematics, science, and one foreign language which did not happen.
The 36-page Nation at Risk Report criticized the state of schools in the United States and clamored for numerous reforms to rectify supposed flaws in the country's public education system at that time. The commentary described education in America as mediocre. There were few indications of assurance because of test scores that were declining at a rapid pace, low salaries of teachers, and substandard training programs for educators. The turnover rate of teachers became alarmingly high. Statistics showed that some 23 million American grownups did not have sufficient reading and writing skills. This report gained plenty of attention from media.

Kick IIII (stylized as kick iiii) is the seventh studio album by Venezuelan record producer and singer Arca. The album was scheduled to be released on 3 December 2021, but released early on 2 December 2021, through XL Recordings as a continuation to her 2021 record Kick III, and is the fourth entry in the Kick quintet. Kick IIII was supported by the accompanying lead single "Queer" featuring Planningtorock, and features cellist Oliver Coates, Garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson, Planningtorock, as well as production from Cardopusher.
Background
Upon the release of Kick I, news surfaced that Arca would be releasing three more Kick albums to make a tetralogy. The artist took to Pitchfork to say: "There will be four volumes. The third one is a little bit more introverted than Kick I, a little bit more like my self-titled album, I guess. The fourth one is piano only, no vocals. Right now, the least defined one, strangely, is the third one. It's all gestating right now [...] Each Kick exists in a kind of quantum state until the day that I send it to mastering. I try to not commit until I have to. But I have a vision for it. The second one is heavy on backbeats, vocal manipulation, mania, and craziness."
In the following year, Arca released her extended play Madre and took part in Dawn of Chromatica, a remix album by Lady Gaga, where she remixed the Ariana Grande collaboration "Rain on Me". While talking about the song on social media, Arca stated: "It's also the last time I playfully deconstruct my songs 'Time' and 'Mequetrefe', as we say goodbye to the Kick I era and move into the Kick II era and beyond". Kick IIII was announced on November 18, alongside the release of the lead single "Queer" featuring vocals from English musician planningtorock. Arca described the album as "entry of sensual charge in the cycle; my own faith made into song, a posthuman celestial sparkle, psychosexual pulsewidth modulation, queering the void, abyss alchemically transmuted into a deconstruction of what is beautiful, it is a healing spell, recognition of the alien inside, a bursting apart of old skin, fresh new sinew rippling outward from a beating core, the first prenatal kick—proof that there is a sentience with a will beyond its creators' control expressing itself from within the womb."
Critical reception
On review aggregate site Metacritic, Kick IIII received a score of 77 out of 100, based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

Philip Favel (1922–2021) was a Canadian veteran and Indigenous activist.
Favel was born on 30 April 1922 in Sweetgrass First Nation. He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps in 1942 and participated in Operation Overlord. For his military service he was awarded the Defence Medal, the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal, the Diamond Jubilee Medal, and the French National Order of the Legion of Honor.
After the war Favel advocated fair compensation for Indigenous veterans, who received discriminatory treatment compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. He was named Grand Chief of the Saskatchewan First Nations Veterans Association. In 2020 a portrait of Favel by Elaine Goble, titled Normandy Warrior, was unveiled at the Canadian War Museum.

Oil City Roller Derby (formerly called Oil City Derby Girls) is a flat track roller derby league based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Founded in 2005, the league currently consists of six teams, comprising men's, women's and co-ed squads.
Teams
6 House teams:
Damage Inc - Coed, low-contact
Dirty Harriets - Female, full-contact
G.I. Janes - Female, full-contact
Near Death Stars - Coed, full-contact
River City Riot - Male, full contact
Space Oddities - Coed, full-contact
2 Travel teams:
Oil City Derby Girls - Female, full contact
Dreadnaughts/Riot - Male, full contact
House teams are composed of travel team skaters as well as those who are not part of the travel team. These teams play B-level teams and other house teams and are perfect for developing skater skills. Travel teams are more competitive and play higher level teams. These teams tend to travel more frequently and farther. The Dreadnaughts are a registered MRDA team.
History
The league was founded in 2005, and claims to have been the first flat-track roller derby league in Canada. By the following February, it had 14 skaters, and was known as the "Oil City Rollers." Although it briefly planned to expand across Canada, other leagues emerged in other cities, and E-Ville Roller Derby split from Oil City to produce two leagues in the city.
In January 2009, Lesley McDonald, a skater with Oil City, founded the Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association, By September 2010, the league was hosting bouts in a 3,000-capacity venue. It won the Wild Rose Cup from the Calgary Roller Derby Association, which had held it for three years.
Teeknee, a member of Oil City at the time, was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2011 Roller Derby World Cup.
In 2015, the league turned 10 years old. It was at this time that they chose to re-brand the league as "Oil City Roller Derby", to better embody the inclusive and non-gendered nature of the league. The league reserved the Oil City Derby Girls name for their travel team to honour the history of the league.
In 2015, Oil City Roller Derby moved to the Edmonton Sportsdome due to the demolition of Metro Sportsplex.

The Claremont Graduate University (CGU) is a private, all-graduate research university in Claremont, California. Founded in 1925, CGU is a member of the Claremont Colleges which includes five undergraduate (Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College, Pitzer College) and two graduate (CGU and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences) institutions of higher education.
The university is organized into seven separate units: the School of Arts & Humanities; School of Community & Global Health; Drucker School of Management; School of Educational Studies; the School of Social Science, Policy, & Evaluation; the Center for Information Systems & Technology; and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity."
History
Founded in 1925, CGU was the second of the Claremont Colleges to form, following Pomona College and preceding Scripps College. The school has undergone several name changes since its inception. After being called Claremont University College for thirty-seven years, in 1962 the school officially became known as Claremont Graduate School and University Center. Five years later, in 1967, the name was again changed to Claremont University Center, and in 1998 it acquired the name Claremont Graduate University.
The Claremont Colleges were designed to incorporate the Oxford Model of higher education. Instead of one large university composed of several separate schools, the Claremont Colleges are made up of different institutions designed around differing theories of pedagogy. CGU was founded upon the principle that graduate education is separate and distinct from undergraduate education. Students discover and cultivate their disciplines during undergraduate course work; at CGU students continue cultivation of their own disciplines, but are also expected to augment this with research that incorporates other disciplines as well. This is called "Transdisciplinarity" and is an essential component of Claremont Graduate University's functioning theory of pedagogy.
The school is home to more than 2,000 master's and PhD students, as well as approximately 200 full and part-time faculty members. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has classified Claremont Graduate University as a CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) with high research activity. Its seven academic units and other related programs and institutes award master's and/or doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines. Enrollment is limited and classes are small. In 2018, the university also introduced its first online master's degree programs.

Aganonerion is a plant genus in the family Apocynaceae, first described in 1905. It contains only one known species, Aganonerion polymorphum, native to Indochina (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam).
Aganonerion polymorphum is used medicinally and as a food, appearing for example in a traditional Vietnamese soup called canh chua. In Vietnamese, the plant is called lá giang, literally "river leaf." In Cambodia, it is called /vɔə tʰnɜŋ/ (វល្លិថ្នឹង) or /kaɔt prɷm/ (កោតព្រំ).
This plant is a perennial herb with glabrous climbing stems of 1.6–4.0 m long. Its leaves are ovate glabrous with short petioles, and are 2.5–10 cm long and 2–5 cm wide. The tips of the leaves are sharpened while the base is cordate. Its flowers are umbel, with follicles that are 8–15 cm long and 5–8 mm wide.

George Ingersoll Wood (May 20, 1814 – January 9, 1899) was an American Congregationalist clergyman and a founding member of Yale's Skull and Bones Society.
Rev. George Ingersoll Wood was born in Stamford, CT. He was the son of Hon. Joseph Wood and Frances Ellsworth, daughter of Supreme Court Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth.
He graduated from Yale College in 1833 and the Union Theological Seminary in New York City in 1838. While at Yale he was a founding member of The Skull and Bones Society. He and his wife Susan, married in 1840, had four children.
Wood was ordained in Washington, DC on May 18, 1840 and pastored the Second Presbyterian Church there for a year. He was then pastor in several of the Congregational churches of Connecticut: West Hartford (1842–1844), North Branford (1844–1850, 1855–1858), Ellington (1850–1854, 1869–1870), and Guilford (1858–1867).

Erpingham Rural District was a rural district in Norfolk, England from 1894 to 1974.
It was formed under the Local Government Act 1894 based on the Erpingham rural sanitary district, taking its name from the ancient North and South Erpingham hundreds - but did not, initially, include some parishes from these hundreds including Erpingham parish itself. It lay on the north coast of Norfolk around the Urban Districts of Cromer and, later, Sheringham (created 1901, extended 1914).
In 1935 Erpingham RD took in several parishes from Aylsham Rural District, and ceded smaller areas to Walsingham and Smallburgh RDs.
In 1974, the district was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and became part of the North Norfolk district.

is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known as the creator of the manga series Golden Kamuy, for which he won the 2016 Manga Taishō and the 2018 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.
Biography
Noda was born in Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido, Japan. His great-grandfather was a military settler in Hokkaido and veteran of the Russo-Japanese War; Noda named the protagonist of his manga series Golden Kamuy after him. After moving to Tokyo at the age of 23, he entered the manga industry as an artist assistant. Noda was an assistant to Mitsurou Kubo for two years, and later worked under . He made his debut as a manga artist in 2003, with the one-shot published in . His second one-shot story, 2006's , won a in the Young Artist division.
After working as an artist assistant for nearly a decade, Noda made his serialized manga debut in 2011 with Supinamarada!, serialized in Weekly Young Jump. After Supinamarada! was a commercial failure, Noda took a year before developing his next series, 2014's Golden Kamuy. The series would become a widespread critical and commercial success, and won the Manga Taishō in 2016 and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2018. Following the conclusion of Golden Kamuy in 2022, Noda announced that he would relaunch Supinamarada!.
Little is known about Noda's personal life. Though he maintains an online presence and is interviewed by the press about his work, he does not make public appearances; upon winning the Manga Taishō in 2016, the award was accepted by his editor, with Noda delivering an audio-only acceptance speech.
Style
Noda draws using digital illustration exclusively. While Noda is noted for conducting in-depth research on subject material that appears in his manga, he has stated that he is not interested in maintaining strict historical accuracy in his work, citing historically inaccurate elements in Golden Kamuy such as skiing and certain firearms that were added for dramatic effect.
Noda cites JoJo's Bizarre Adventure creator Hirohiko Araki and the manga Keiji, Kinnikuman, and as among his influences. Hallmarks of his work include visual references to pop culture, and narratives that juxtapose gag comedy against violent or dramatic moments. Handsome and muscular men are a recurring element of Noda's work; he has voiced his distaste for -styled manga, and has stated that he "draw[s] without compromise the beautiful bodies of men."

L'Androuno is one of the world's narrowest streets found in the city of Gassin, France.
It measures 29 centimeters (11.41 inches) at its narrowest point.
The name derives from a Greek term for a passage between two houses, with a subtext for a place for men only, such as a hiding place or a latrine. The Provencal term is defined as an "alley", a "cul-de-sac", or a "void that separates two houses", with the same subtext.

Shaun Anthony Woodward (born 26 October 1958) is a British politician who was the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for St Helens South from 2001 to 2015. He served in the cabinet from 28 June 2007 to 11 May 2010 as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Following the 2010 general election, Woodward was the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland until 7 October 2011, when he was replaced by Vernon Coaker.
A former television researcher and producer, Woodward began his political career in the Conservative Party. He was elected in 1997 as a Conservative MP for Witney, but joined Labour in 1999.
Early life and education
Woodward was educated at Bristol Grammar School, at the time a Direct Grant Grammar School, and now an independent day school, followed by Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied English literature. He also studied at Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar. From 1981 to 1982, he was a parliamentary lobbyist for the National Consumer Council. From 1982 to 1990, he worked as a researcher and producer for BBC TV News and Current Affairs on the programmes That's Life!, Panorama and Newsnight. He subsequently wrote a book about Ben Hardwick. From 1991 to 1992, he was director of communications for the Conservative Party.
Member of Parliament
Woodward was selected as Douglas Hurd's successor as Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Witney at the 1997 election, having previously been a senior official of the party. The majority Douglas Hurd had won at the previous election was over 22,000. Elected with a 7,000 majority, he was a front-bench spokesman on London for the Conservative opposition under William Hague until 1999, when he was sacked for supporting the repeal of Section 28, a regulation which aimed at preventing the promotion of homosexuality in schools.
Defection to the Labour Party
After being sacked from the Tory front bench, on 20 December 1999, Woodward left the Conservative Party to move to the ruling Labour Party, without resigning as an MP. This meant that no by-election took place. He was given a job co-ordinating the Labour party's 2001 general election campaign. Woodward's local Conservative constituency association requested that he resign and run again in a by-election, under the Labour banner, as he had originally won the safe Conservative seat by campaigning as a Conservative. Woodward refused to hold a by-election, and continued to represent Witney for a further eighteen months.
Woodward was criticised by his former colleagues in the Conservative Party, including leader William Hague, Conservative former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and party chairman Michael Ancram. Other critics included backbench Labour MPs Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn, and ten years later, former Labour government minister Chris Mullin, in his political diaries.
Michael Heseltine said Woodward would "soon become a dot on the horizon", whilst Conservative leader William Hague wrote a public letter to Woodward on his resignation, in which he stated: "You have left a party whose members have given you their loyal support. You have done so for reasons not of integrity or of principle, but for your own careerist reasons. That is an attitude of which I am determined to rid our party..." Conservative chairman Michael Ancram said: "Shaun has decided for his own reasons to leave the party and no amount of sincerity or fake sincerity is going to hide that fact..."
Woodward's defection was welcomed by senior Labour figures.
In the June 2001 general election, Woodward decided not to contest his Witney seat as a Labour candidate and instead found a safe Labour seat in St Helens South. Chris Mullin wrote with shock of "the awful Shaun Woodward" defecting to Mullin's own side, calling "the New Labour elite parachuting [Woodward] into a safe seat ... one of New Labour's vilest stitch-ups ... made my flesh creep". His successor in Witney was David Cameron, who subsequently became Prime Minister in 2010.
When news of Woodward's intention to stand reached St. Helens, a strong left-wing challenge was put forward in an attempt to deny the former Conservative the safe Labour seat. Neil Thompson of the Socialist Alliance and Michael Perry of the Socialist Labour Party both contested the St Helens South seat and received a total of 12% of the vote between them. Woodward won the seat with a much reduced 49% of the vote.
As a Labour MP, Woodward served on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and was a prominent supporter of the Gender Recognition Act 2004.
In May 2005, Woodward was re-elected in St Helens South receiving 54% of the vote and his majority increased. However, the Liberal Democrats' candidate, Brian Spencer, saw his party's vote increase from 23% in 2001 to 28%. Michael Perry of the Socialist Labour Party contested the seat again and received just under 2% of the vote.
In government
Following the 2005 election, Woodward was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office.
In the May 2006 reshuffle, Tony Blair named Woodward Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with responsibilities for the digital switchover for TV. On 28 June 2007, in his first cabinet, newly appointed Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Woodward as the Northern Ireland Secretary, replacing Peter Hain. Woodward chose not to receive a ministerial salary because of his personal wealth. As Northern Ireland Secretary, Woodward reportedly became a close confidant of the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. This was largely due to Woodward's previous first-hand experiences of the beleaguered Conservative government of John Major.
In Opposition
Woodward stood for election to Labour's shadow cabinet, but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, he was retained as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by Labour leader Ed Miliband for just under a year.
In November 2013 he announced that he would stand down from Parliament at the next general election,
to work on human rights issues. He was praised for his role by then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who wrote to him: "In 1999, you made an incredibly hard decision to cross the floor of the House and join the Labour party. It took personal courage and political commitment, and our party will forever be grateful to you."
Personal life
He married Camilla Davan Sainsbury, daughter of former Conservative MP Tim Sainsbury of the wealthy supermarket Sainsbury family, on 2 May 1987; they announced their separation after 28 years on 20 December 2015. They have one son and three daughters, including the food blogger Ella Woodward.
His current partner is Hollywood camera operator Luke Redgrave.
In March 2001, he was said to be the only Labour MP with a butler.
Woodward currently serves as chair of the board of trustees at the Human Dignity Trust and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He also serves as a member of the board of directors at the Hamptons International Film Festival.

Professional life
After the Iowa Writers Workshop, Richter joined Oregon Public Broadcasting initially as a producer-reporter, then Director of Public Affairs programs. In addition he reported from the Pacific Northwest for The New York Times. A CBS News Fellowship brought him back to New York where he earned an M.A. in Public Law and Government at Columbia University in 1964. He is the last member of the Edward R.

Few documentary filmmakers have received as many honors: the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences nominated two Richter films for best documentary short; he received a 2008 National Emmy for "exceptional merit in nonfiction filmmaking;" the duPont Columbia Broadcast Journalism award (TV's Pulitzer Prize); the Distinguished Science Reporting Award from AAAS (American Academy for Advancement of Science); Peabody Awards; many US and international film festival awards; critical acclaim in The New York Times and other major papers. Richter's many documentaries on environmental subjects earned him a Global 500 Award from the United Nations Environment Programme—the only independent producer in the world to receive this honor.

Toutoungi was the club's first president.
The team first played in the 1943–44 Lebanese Second Division; initially formed of former students, the club later also accepted other players. They won the Second Division in their first season, and were due to be promoted to the Lebanese Premier League after beating Shabiba Mazraa 4–0 in the promotion play-offs. However, due to a technicality, Sagesse were allocated in the Second Division for the 1944–45 season. From the 1945–46 season, the club were known as Club de la Sagesse.
Recent history
In 2006 Sagesse reached the final of the Lebanese FA Cup, but lost against the cup holder Ansar 3–1. Sagesse finished second in the 2020–21 Lebanese Second Division, and were promoted back to the Lebanese Premier League after five years.

The Théâtre des Folies-Wagram was a theatre in Paris which operated from 1928 until 1964. From late 1935 it was known as the Théâtre de l'Étoile. Located at 35 Avenue de Wagram in the 17th arrondissement, the theatre saw the premieres of numerous French operettas as well as Antonin Artaud's play Les Cenci. It had no connection to another theatre also known as the Théâtre de l'Étoile which was located on the Champs-Élysées and operated from 1923 to 1926.
History
The theatre was built on the initiative of Paul Fournier and the Lutetia-Empire company which already owned a number of cinemas in Paris as well as two large music halls, the on Avenue Wagram and the Bobino on Rue de la Gaîté. The architect of the new theatre was Paul Farge who had also designed the renovation of the Empire. The theatre's interior had a pink and silver colour scheme and had a seating capacity of 1500. A smoking foyer and an American bar were located on the first floor.
On 14 March 1928 the Folies-Wagram was inaugurated with a gala revue featuring Marie Dubas, Henri Garat, and the comedian Cariel. Later that year, the theatre staged the French premiere of Oscar Straus's operetta Teresina. It would be the first of many operettas to premiere there. Prior to World War II, the Folies-Wagram staged primarily operettas and revues. The rare exception was the world premiere on 6 May 1935 of Antonin Artaud's play Les Cenci, a violent tale of incest, murder and betrayal. After its summer closure in 1935, the theatre reopened in the autumn as the Théâtre de l'Étoile and continued its repertoire of operettas and revues.
In the post-World War II years the Étoile also saw many shows by individual singers. Edith Piaf appeared in 1945, accompanied on the piano by her protégé for the first time. Yves Montand had earlier appeared in a show with Piaf and in 1951 returned in a one-man show, accompanied by jazz guitarist Henri Crolla and the Bob Castella Orchestra. That same year Charles Trenet made his French come-back with a show at the Étoile after spending several years in the United States. Marlene Dietrich's show opened in 1959 with an audience that included Jean Cocteau and Maurice Chevalier.
Increasing financial difficulties led to the theatre's permanent closure at the beginning of 1964. It was later demolished and replaced by an office and commercial building.
Operetta premieres
Operettas premiered at the Théâtre des Folies-Wagram include:
Teresina by Oscar Straus, 25 May 1928 (premiere of French version)
L'Orloff by Bruno Granichstaedten, 8 December 1928 (French premiere)
Tip-Toes by George Gershwin, 26 April 1929 (French premiere)
Rosy by Raoul Moretti, 24 February 1930 (world premiere)
Zou! by Josef Szulc, 2 May 1930 (world premiere)
Brummell by Reynaldo Hahn, 17 January 1931 (world premiere)

The 1920 North Dakota blizzard was a severe blizzard that killed 34 people from March 15–18, 1920 in the state of North Dakota. It is considered among the worst blizzards on record in North Dakota.
High winds and an eight-inch (20 cm) snowfall stopped rail service in Bismarck, North Dakota, and only one telephone line functioned between Fargo, North Dakota, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Telephone service was out between Devils Lake, North Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota.
Among the victims were five country school students, including Hazel Miner and Adolph, Ernest, Soren, and Herman Wohlk. Also killed were a young mother, Mrs. Andrew Whitehead; Charles Hutchins, north of Douglas, North Dakota; the twelve-year-old son of Matt Yashenko, who lived five miles south of Ruso, North Dakota; and "Chicken Pete" Johnson, a Minot eccentric, who was found dead in his dug-out on South Hill in Minot, North Dakota.

The Big Fight Live is a British boxing television programme, broadcast by ITV Sport regularly from 1984 to 1995 and again from 2005 to 2010. In 2017, over 30 years after it was first launched, ITV announced that 'The Big Fight Live' would return after it was announced Chris Eubank JR would fight for the world title on ITV Box Office.
History
ITV's boxing coverage had largely been confined to big fights from the US in the 1970s and early 80s, which were covered as part of World of Sport and as separate programmes. Until 1984, they were largely shut out of British domestic boxing due to a cartel operated by promoters such as Jarvis Astaire, Harry Levene and Mickey Duff, who had contracts with the BBC.
ITV obtained the rights to show fights promoted by then-rebel promoter Frank Warren's Sports Network in 1984. Several years later, a contract with Barry Hearn followed as a result of his friendship with Greg Dyke, while the network also worked closely with other promoters including Don King. Until the early 1990s, the programmes were titled Boxing, World Championship Boxing, "The Big Fight Live" (a name occasionally used in the 1980s) or shown as part of Midweek Sport Special. Until 1985, boxing continued to be shown on World of Sport, before the programme was axed.
In the early 1990s, most boxing on ITV was branded The Big Fight Live. The exceptions to this were programmes on regional ITV, which used a variety of names, with "Fight Night" and "Seconds Out" being among the names used in some regions, while some overnight highlights programmes featuring less well-known or non-British fighters still used the "World Championship Boxing" title. During the 1980s, "Fight Night" promoted the careers of boxers like Errol Christie, whose fights featured on ITV and not the rival BBC. However, "The Big Fight Live" or "The Big Fight" (for highlights programmes), featuring its bright yellow and black branding and its dramatic theme tune became the consistent brand used for all of ITV's main network boxing coverage. This was a particularly fruitful period for ITV's boxing coverage, as they featured fights involving boxers such as Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank and Naseem Hamed. These were produced by LWT for the ITV Network, and drew large audiences.
The decline of ITV's boxing portfolio began in mid-1994 when Barry Hearn took Chris Eubank and his stable of fighters to Sky Sports. At the start of 1996, Sky Sports won the rights to show Sports Network (Frank Warren promoted) fights, leaving ITV with only occasional boxing for the following ten years. Their only networked boxing during this period were a few fights involving Shea Neary, thanks to a contract with Merseyside promoter John Hyland. Other bouts were shown on ITV2 and the ITV Sport Channel, while ITV2 also ran a fortnightly magazine show called "Boxing First". This was presented by Russ Williams with Steve Bunce as a regular studio pundit, and other studio guests. The programme featured highlights of fights not shown live on UK television, as well as features. Other boxing was shown on a regional basis, but this was rare.
In May 2005, ITV returned to the ring, with live coverage of Amir Khan's last fight before becoming professional against Mario Kindelán. It achieved a peak audience of 6.3 million viewers, encouraging ITV to reach a long-term agreement to show future Sports Network boxing promotions.
In June 2005, the network won back the rights to show Frank Warren's Sports Network fights and as a result broadcast fights involving Amir Khan, Joe Calzaghe, Danny Williams, Audley Harrison and others. As of September 2007, their coverage of Sports Network promotions was shared with Setanta Sports, with only Amir Khan fights remaining with ITV.
On 6 September 2008, Amir Khan switched to Sky from ITV, signalling the end of the network's contract with Frank Warren's Sports Network. Later that month, ITV announced a 2-year deal with Hennessy Sports for coverage of 26 fights. The majority of fights were due to be screened on ITV4 and once again were to be hosted by Jim Rosenthal, who returned to ITV having previously been sacked in early 2008.
Amir Khan moved back to ITV in 2010, with his fight against Paulie Malignaggi broadcast live in the early hours of Sunday 15 May 2010. It also broadcast delayed coverage of at least one Carl Froch fight in America the night after it took place around this period, along with a number of other matches Shortly afterwards, ITV stopped screening any boxing coverage, believing it not to be commercially viable.
Presentation
The main host of ITV Boxing was Jim Rosenthal, who returned to the programme after presenting ITV's Formula One coverage from 1997, on its return in 2005. Barry McGuigan left Sky Sports in 2005 to continue his role as a pundit on ITV. Commentary was provided by John Rawling and Duke McKenzie. Gabriel Clarke provided reports and interviews with the boxers. The main event was usually shown on the ITV Network while undercard matches were often televised on ITV4. Before 1996, the main commentators had been Reg Gutteridge and Jim Watt, both of whom moved to Sky while continuing to commentate for the few boxing shows ITV televised in the late 1990s, which were presented by Russ Williams. Graham Beecroft and Nick Halling commentated on boxing on a regional basis during the late 1990s, while Halling was also the commentator on Boxing First.
2015 Onwards
In 2015 ITV started screening live boxing matches once again beginning with Carl Frampton's fight against Chris Avalos.
On 13 December 2016, ITV announced that Chris Eubank Jr. would fight for the IBO World Championship live on a new pay-per-view channel called ITV Box Office under 'The Big Fight Live' name, bringing an end to the 7-year hiatus of the programme not being on TV.
In December 2018, ITV announced a ground-breaking new deal with Haymon Sports and Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) to bring exclusive coverage of PBC world-class boxing events to ITV.
The collaboration was the first time that Haymon Sports and PBC has partnered with a UK broadcaster to stage boxing events regularly in the UK. The exclusive three-year deal guarantees a minimum of 15 televised events each year, to be shown free on ITV, ITV4 and as pay-per-view events on ITV Box Office.
The first programme of the new deal was the IBF Super Middleweight title fight between Jose Uzcategui and Caleb Plant in the early hours of Monday 14 January 2019, UK time, which was broadcast live on ITV4. Plant, the challenger, won the fight on points. ITV took the feed from host broadcaster Fox Sports and Ronald McIntosh provided voiceovers for UK viewers when the host broadcaster was on commercial breaks.

Paolo Pandolfo is an Italian virtuoso player, composer, and teacher of music for the viola da gamba, born on January 31, 1964.
He began his studies as a double bass and guitar player, becoming a skilled performer of jazz and popular music. In the mid-late 1970s he studied viola da gamba at the Rome Conservatory. In 1979 he co-founded the early music ensemble La Stravaganza, and then moved to Basel, Switzerland in 1981 where he studied with Jordi Savall at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. From 1982 to 1990 Pandolfo was a member of Jordi Savall's early music groups Hespèrion XX.
Since 1989 Pandolfo has served as professor of viola da gamba at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis — a position previously held by maestros August Wenzinger and Jordi Savall. He also directs, records, and performs regularly with his viola da gamba-oriented early music ensemble Labyrinto, which he co-founded.
Pandolfo has recorded numerous CDs. For most of the 1980s he recorded primarily with Jordi Savall and others. His first recording as a soloist was in 1990 with the release of his highly acclaimed CD C. P. E. Bach: Sonatas for Viola da Gamba (Tactus). He has also recorded a viola da gamba interpretation of the cello suites of J. S. Bach. Pandolfo explains that the suites, although written for the cello, were conceived in the polyphonic style of the viola da gamba; further, the dance suite was a common form for viola da gamba music, and playing the Bach suites on the gamba is thus a way to reclaim this tradition for the viola da gamba.
Pandolfo has said that the patrimony of ancient music can be a powerful inspiration for the future of the Western musical tradition. Building bridges between past and present is therefore an important part of his work.

Hungary competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Medallists
Cycling
With one pathway for qualification being one highest ranked NPCs on the UCI Para-Cycling male and female Nations Ranking Lists on 31 December 2014, Hungary qualified for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, assuming they continued to meet all other eligibility requirements.
Judo
With one pathway for qualification being having a top finish at the 2014 IBSA Judo World Championships, Hungary earned a qualifying spot in Rio base on the performance of Nikolett Szabó in the women's -70 kg event. The B2 Judoka finished first in her class.
Paracanoeing
Germany earned a qualifying spot at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in this sport following their performance at the 2015 ICF Canoe Sprint & Paracanoe World Championships in Milan, Italy where the top six finishers in each Paralympic event earned a qualifying spot for their nation. Anita Váczi earned the spot for Germany after finishing fifth in the women's KL1 event.
Powerlifting
Shooting
The first opportunity to qualify for shooting at the Rio Games took place at the 2014 IPC Shooting World Championships in Suhl. Shooters earned spots for their NPC. Hungary earned a qualifying spot at this event in the P2 – 10m Air Pistol Women SH1 event as a result of Krisztina Dávid winning a silver medal.
Table tennis
Wheelchair tennis
Hungary qualified one competitor in the men's single event, Roland Németh. This slot was a result of a Bipartite Commission Invitation place.

Mariya Yakovlevna Zerova, alternately Marija Jakovlevna Zerova, (April 7, 1902 – July 21, 1994) was a Ukrainian biologist and taxonomist known for her work in mycology.
Her research included work on ectrotrophic mycorrhiza and fungal diseases of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and beet (Beta sp). She made a major contribution to the multi-volume books of the Determination of Mushrooms of Ukraine published between 1967 and 1979. Her collection of 12,000 specimens of fungi and plants is now held in the National Herbarium of Ukraine.
Education
In 1917 she left the Mariinsky Women's Gymnasium with a silver medal and entered the Kiev Medical Institute. However, she contracted tuberculosis and left after studying for three years. She then attended Kiev University, studying in the Faculty of Biology within the (then) Institute of Public Education. She graduated in 1924.
In 1942, Zerova defended a dissertation in mycology entitled Pleomorphism of some ascomycetes about the ontogenetic relationships of Ascomycota to the fungi imperfecti. In 1969 she was awarded a higher Doctor of Sciences degree for a thesis on the Study of the microflora of the USSR and mycorrhiza of the steppe part of Ukraine.
Career
After graduating, Zerova worked initially as a school teacher. However, she soon resumed a scientific career and spent her life studying fungal taxonomy, ecology and uses of fungi. After working at the Scientific Research Institute for Sugar Beet, in 1932 she was appointed head of the phytopathology department of the Scientific Research Institute of Rubber and Rubber Products. She studied the microflora and diseases of rubber plants and identified and described four new species of fungi: Macrosporium tausaghyzianum Zerova; Phyllosticta tausaghyziana Zerova; Myrothecium transchelianum Zerova & Tropova and Melanospora asclepiadis Zerova (a mycoparasite of Fusarium solani App. & Wr.).
She moved to an Institute for Forest Plantations and researched plant pathology and also how mycology could improve the establishment of trees and shrubs in landscaped urban areas. She identified over 400 species of fungi, some new to science, on 160 plant species.
In 1942 Zerova joined the MG Kholodny Institute of Botany of the USSR Academy of Sciences and remained there for the rest of her career. In 1963 she became head of the department of mycology, and from 1972 until her death in 1994 was a senior researcher-consultant. Research into mycorrhiza began at the Institute in the 1950s and her research moved into this area. She investigated the diversity of species associated with trees, shrubs and also the grasses and forbs of the Ukraine steppe. The specimens that she collected during this work are now kept in the National Herbarium of Ukraine within the Institute of Botany.
Later, in the 1960s, she worked on fungal classification including of the genera Inocybe and Dacryomstra. She applied the newly available technology of scanning electron microscopy in this research. She led research on increasing the number of fungal species harvested for human food, including developing cultivation methods for more species. These cultivation strategies were considered more important after the realisation that wild fungal fruiting bodies could accumulate heavy metals and radioactive isotopes from the soil. She also initiated research into medicinal properties of some of these species.
During her career she supervised postgraduate students and also gave lectures and seminars to the public as well as scientific conferences.
Publications
Zerova is the author or co-author of over 200 publications. These include books about the fungi of Ukraine.
M. Ya. Zerova, Edible and poisonous mushrooms of Ukraine (Їстівні та отруйні гриби України) (in Ukrainian, two editions, 1963 and 1970).
M. Ya. Zerova and SP Wasser, Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the Ukrainian Carpathians (Їстівні та отруйні гриби Українських Карпат) (in Ukrainian, 1972).
M. Ya. Zerova, Atlas of Mushrooms of Ukraine (Атлас грибів України) (in Ukrainian, 1974). With colour drawings of 550 species of mushrooms.
She was one of the authors of the Determination of mushrooms of Ukraine (Визначник грибів України), that was published in five volumes in seven books between 1967 and 1979, although work on it started in 1946. She contributed to Volume 2, on ascomycota and basidiomycota found in the Ukraine region, and also to Volume 3 where she provided a critical revision of the fungi imperfecti.

Deputy Prime Minister of Denmark () is an office sometimes held by a minister in the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark. In the absence of the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over their functions, such as chairing the Cabinet of Denmark and participating in the Council of State.
The title is often an informal description sometimes used, especially by the press, for the minister who is second in the order of precedence.
Traditionally, the minister of foreign affairs holds the second rank. It is only when the order of precedence deviates from this tradition, that number two is referred to as vicestatsminister. This happens in the unusual case when the leader of the second-largest coalition party is not minister of foreign affairs. In some cases the leader of the third-largest coalition party, who is as a matter of course third in precedence, has been called 2nd deputy prime minister (). This tradition goes back at least to 1957.

Gilde Norsk Kjøtt is a defunct Norwegian red meat processing company organised as an agricultural cooperative. The company was by far the largest processor in the country when it merged with Prior Norge in 2006 to create Nortura. The company had gradually grown together as the slaughter cooperatives in the country had merged. It was not until 2000 that the company fully merged into one legal entity. Before this it had been an association between various local slaughterhouses.
History
The first farmer owned slaughterhouse in Norway was Hamar Slagteri AS founded in 1904. Seven years later Fellesslakteriet was founded in Oslo as the first slaughter cooperative. 1930 sees the Trade Act that secured stable prices for both farmers and consumers. The background for this was overproduction that had forced down the produce prices and bankrupt many farmers. The next year Norges Kjøtt og Fleskesentral (NKF) is established as a membership organisation for all slaughterhouses in Norway. In 1958 NKF reorganised creating 17 district organisations to manage the processing and the following year Gilde is launched in Northern Norway.
In 1990 the name of the company changed to Norsk Kjøttsamvirke BA that was kept until 2004 when it took the name Gilde Norsk Kjøtt BA. But not until 2000 is the company actually completely merged so the mother company owns all the processing plants. The company merged with Prior Norge to create Nortura in 2006.
Branding
The Gilde brand name was taken into use nationally in 1964, after it had been used at first in Northern Norway since 1959. In 1971 Gilde made an agreement with Norges Kooperative Landsforening to create the common brand Goman that was to deliver meat to the cooperative stores. The company also adapted a separate organic food brand as under the Gilde brand during the 2000s. These products were exclusively distributed through the Coop and Norgesgruppen stores. In 2001 Gilde launched the brand Alfathi that made Norwegian cuisine meats following the Muslim rules of halal. Other minor brands included the smoked meat Eldhus. Gilde also produced a number of frozen and canned food under the brand Terina.

Leigh Dunlop Brownlee (17 December 1882 – 22 September 1955) was a journalist who became editor of the Daily Mirror from 1931 to 1934. He also played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire, Oxford University and Somerset between 1901 and 1909. He was born at Bristol and died at Clifton, also in Bristol.
Cricket career
Educated at Clifton College, Brownlee was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and an infrequent right-arm slow bowler, and was top of the Clifton batting averages in 1900. After leaving school in the summer of 1901, he made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire in two end-of-season matches, and in his first game, against Somerset at Taunton, he made 66 in the Gloucestershire second innings, though he was unable to prevent a Somerset victory with less than an hour of the scheduled match time remaining. A student at Oriel College, Oxford, from the autumn of 1901, he played in one match for the university cricket team in 1902, and in one match for Somerset against the university side – Somerset frequently "borrowed" university players for their matches against the university sides in the first third of the 20th century, but this game has an additional curiosity in that it is one of the few 12-a-side first-class matches. Though unable to break into the Oxford University side, Brownlee played regularly for Gloucestershire when the university term was over, and in the match against Kent at Bristol he scored 103 in the first innings, the only century of his first-class cricket career. In 1903, he was given half a dozen games for the university side but was not successful then, nor in 10 matches for Gloucestershire in the second half of the season: his batting average for the season as a whole was under 10 runs per innings, and his highest score in the season was just 43.
Brownlee had a better cricketing year in 1904. Despite never reaching 50 in an innings for Oxford's cricket team, he retained his place in the team through the university cricket season and won a Blue by appearing in the University Match against Cambridge University, though he made only 3 and 9 in his two innings in the match. He had a better season for Gloucestershire too than he had had in 1903, with the highest score of 97, batting at No 9 in the match against Kent. In addition to his success in winning a cricket Blue, Brownlee also won a Blue for golf in his last year at Oxford. Brownlee had a full season of first-class cricket in 1905, appearing in 16 matches for Gloucestershire, though he was not successful, scoring only 244 runs at an average of 10.16 and with the highest score of only 38.
From 1906 to 1909, Brownlee's journalism career came first and he appeared in just a handful of matches for Gloucestershire in each season, with only one further score of more than 50, an innings of 79 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1908. He did not play any further matches after 1909.
Newspaperman
Brownlee went into newspapers and he is picked out as one of the senior figures representing the Daily Mirror at the funeral of the newspaper's then editor, Alexander Kenealy in 1915. Brownlee was himself editor of the Daily Mirror from 1931 to 1934, though this was a difficult period for the newspaper, which had fallen significantly from its achievement of the first one million circulation in 1918 because of price cutting by rival newspapers. The Mirror was sold by Lord Northcliffe in the mid-1930s and Brownlee appears to have left then: the newspaper relaunched as an American-style tabloid after he left. He went into partnership in a news agency, but the partnership was dissolved in 1936.

The following lists events that happened during 1902 in Afghanistan.
The first year of Habibullah Khan's reign passes without any internal disturbance, or event of importance. Gen. Mir Attar Khan, who was imprisoned by the late amir, is released and reinstated in his old post of commander-in-chief, or rather of Naib, or deputy commander-in-chief, for this is the title by which the successors of the late Gen. Gholam Haidar Khan in the command of the Army have been designated. The amir is said to be reluctant to confer the full appointment on anyone, and there is a belief current that he is likely to keep it for Yahya Khan, whose daughter, whom he lately married, has become his favourite wife. Yahya Khan is at present in great favour with the amir, and his position in Kabul not unnaturally excites the jealousy both of the amir's own relatives and of the leading chiefs and sardars. There are rumours of intrigues in favour of the amir's youngest half-brother, Mohammad Omar, but they seem to die away, and towards the end of the year Mohammad Omar is reported to be in delicate health. There are also rumours that the amir's full brother, Nasrullah Khan, has fallen into disgrace, and even that he has been imprisoned. These are, as usual, followed by complete denials, and assurances that the best feeling exists between the two brothers.
The relations of Habibullah Khan with the British government are reportedly of the most friendly nature throughout the year, and he orders his officers on the frontier to prevent all outlaws from British territory from entering Afghanistan. He is reported to have said in durbar that he found by experience that a mild rule was unsuited to the Afghans, and that he has consequently ordered the revival of his father's Secret Intelligence Department. But although the domestic history of Afghanistan during 1902 is comparatively colourless, a very important move is made or attempted by Russia in what may be called its foreign policy. The Russian government suggests to the British government that whilst it fully recognizes the existing agreement between the two countries by which it is precluded from direct diplomatic intercourse with Afghanistan, it would be of the greatest convenience if the Russian and Afghan officials on the frontier were allowed to communicate direct with one another for commercial purposes only. To this proposal the British foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne, answers that before expressing any opinion on it he would like to know exactly what it means. As to what takes place since, no information is given to the public, except that correspondence is ongoing. But if there is any doubt of the true meaning of the Russian proposals this is removed by the Russian press, which declares openly that the time has come that the agreement excluding Russia from Afghanistan should be set aside and that Russia should insist on as full commercial and political intercourse with that country as is enjoyed by England itself.

Monarch – Habibullah Khan
Early 1902
The Hadda mullah, Najibuddin, visits Kabul and is received by the amir with great favour and distinction. It is first reported that the amir is completely under his influence; then it is said that he is virtually a prisoner, and that the amir never visits him. Towards the end of the year he is sent back to his own country, with an allowance of Rs. 16,000 a year.
October 1902
Habibullah holds a great durbar to commemorate the anniversary of his accession, and releases 8,000 prisoners.

The Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway was an early British railway company in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It built a line from near Bradford through and to . The Skipton–Colne Line closed in 1970, but the remainder of the line is still in use today, and once formed part of the Midland Railway's main line route from London to Glasgow.
History
Authorisation
The Leeds and Bradford (Shipley–Colne Extension) Railway Act of 30 June 1845 empowered the company to build its line as an extension of the Leeds and Bradford Railway, which was still under construction between Leeds and Bradford. In July 1846, the company was leased to the Midland Railway, which later absorbed it on 24 July 1851.
Opening
The first section of the line was from , at a triangular junction with the Leeds and Bradford Railway, to . A tender for construction was let on 15 October 1845 and the section opened on 16 March 1847. The line included a tunnel at Bingley.
A second section from Keighley to opened on 7 September 1847, initially as a single track, but doubled by the end of the year. Trains ran between Bradford and Skipton; passengers to and from Leeds changed at Shipley.
The final section between Skipton and was contracted on 9 September 1846 and opened on 2 October 1848. At Colne it was to make an end-on junction with the East Lancashire Railway's Blackburn, Burnley, Accrington and Colne Extension Railway, which did not open until 1 February 1849. By 2 April in the same year the line was part of a through route between Leeds and Liverpool, but the majority of passenger trains were local between Skipton and Colne.
Little North Western Railway
The "Little" North Western Railway built a line, from a junction just west of Skipton, which would eventually become the main line through Skipton. The Skipton to Ingleton section opened on 30 July 1849, and by 1 June 1850 there was a through line to . The line was leased to the Midland Railway from 1 January 1859. After the opening of the Midland Railway's Settle-Carlisle Line on 1 May 1876, the Leeds–Skipton Line was used by the Midland's to Glasgow express trains. Other trains ran to Morecambe, and .
Partial closure
The Beeching cuts of 1963 reduced the services along the Skipton–Colne Line, and on 2 February 1970 this section of line closed.
The Skipton - East Lancashire Rail Action Partnership campaigns to reinstate it.
Surviving section
The Shipley to Skipton Line is still in use as part of the Airedale Line, and also used by trains of the Leeds-Morecambe Line and Settle-Carlisle Line.

Graham Baldwin (born c. 1954) is a British anti-cult activist who formed and directs the organization Catalyst Counseling, commonly called Catalyst, which received charity status in Britain in 1995. Catalyst primarily provides "exit counseling" to ex-cultists, but occasionally Baldwin would be consulted for news organizations, court cases, etc. Baldwin received a Bachelor's degree in divinity from King's College and was a chaplain at the University of London. Baldwin has been called an "exit counsellor" by some newspapers like The Times and The Telegraph.
Catalyst and anti-cult activity
Baldwin has been the director of Catalyst since its formation in late 1993. Catalyst offers exit counseling services to former members of new religious movements. Baldwin and Catalyst do not support deprogramming on its surface but have been accused of doing it anyway.
Baldwin began exit counseling at King's College London, where he was a chaplain, when the group called the London Church of Christ started to evangelize on campus. The group expelled some members in March 1993 in line with a supposed policy of recruiting rich, white people as opposed to black and poor white people. About 30 former members and Baldwin sued the Church for defamation and financial impropriety in September 1993.
In 1997, Baldwin traveled to Portugal to help retrieve some children from a new religious movement for a British woman (see below).
In July 2000, Baldwin was involved in an incident with the Jesus Christians and their supposed kidnapping of Bobby Kelly, a British 16-year-old who met some Jesus Christians at a shopping mall. The exact details of the incident are disputed; the Jesus Christians and Kelly himself argue that not only was he not kidnapped from his grandmother, his legal guardian at the time, but that they encouraged him to go home since he was only sixteen. His grandmother, in an article in the Daily Express, attested that the Jesus Christians told him to give up everything including family. On 27 July 2000, Bobby Kelly was identified as an inhabitant of a tent in a forest on the Surrey-Hampshire border near Mytchett. The two people who originally made contact with Kelly, Susan (Sue) and Roland Gianstefani, were sentenced to six-month suspended sentences for their part in the "kidnapping." In a note that he passed to the judge who handed down the sentence, Kelly wrote that they were protecting him against Baldwin, who they perceived was dangerous. The leader of the Jesus Christians, David McKay, and other Jesus Christians believed that Catalyst and Baldwin were trying to deprogram Kelly. Media producer Jon Ronson attempted to cover the story in an article in The Guardian in January 2006; however, it was never published because of Baldwin's presence in the article and his previous libel actions against the newspaper. Ronson provided the Jesus Christians access to the manuscript which is now available to view on their website with their commentary.
Libel actions against The Guardian
In 1986, Mark Scott obtained custody of three children from his ex-wife, Claire Scott. Mark and Claire were members of the International Saturday Group (ISG), based in Areia, Portugal, led by Mark's mother Nadine Scott. Claire Scott left the group and moved to Britain in 1987 after her and Mark's divorce. Mark died of an AIDS-related illness in 1997, and a Portuguese court awarded her custody of their children on the condition that Claire Scott does not leave Portugal. She flew to Portugal for her ex-husband's funeral and learned from Nadine Scott that another member of ISG would foster the children. Wishing to bring her children to Britain, Claire Scott made contact with Baldwin through Catalyst and asked for assistance in bringing the then pre-teen children to Britain. Baldwin agreed, since Catalyst believed that the group was a "cult" that used poverty and physical force to control its members, and flew to Portugal. The details of what happened after Baldwin's arrival are unclear. His arrival to ISG's location was allegedly unannounced. The three children—a sixteen-year-old girl and two 13-year-old twin boys—expressed to both Claire Scott and Baldwin that they wished to stay in Portugal with ISG, but were forced to leave to Britain, where they arrived on 16 January 1997.
On 23 January 1997, The Guardian published a article called "Into a Shadowy World" in which the authors portrayed Baldwin as a "self-promoting, obsessive and dangerous" person against new religious movements. Baldwin brought the newspaper and the authors to the High Court in London charging them with defamation. Baldwin believed that his characterization was libelous in addition to the article's assertion that he broke a pledge made with Portuguese court, used false religious credentials, and was involved in the children's deprogramming. On 20 November 1998, a jury decided that the article defamed Baldwin. Baldwin was awarded £15,000 plus costs in damages for the article's libelous assertions.
The Guardian's editor Alan Rusbridger believed that the newspaper article was a "responsible and careful piece of journalism" and that losing the case was a "sad reflection on the libel laws." Rusbridger reported that The Guardian would appeal the decision; however, Baldwin believed that the editor's comments "undermine[d] the vindication he had won from the jury" in the original case, according to journalist Duncan Lamont. Baldwin brought The Guardian back to court for a second libel action. The Guardian argued that it and Rusbridger were protected under qualified privilege since it was for the public interest. However, in July 2001 Judge David Eady determined that they could not use that defense. Rusbridger and The Guardian paid Baldwin more damages in a settlement made on 31 January 2002.

Feminists: What Were They Thinking? is a 2018 documentary film directed by Johanna Demetrakas and starring Laurie Anderson, Phyllis Chesler and Judy Chicago among others. Women of different ages and backgrounds are interviewed by Demetrakas and a team of assistants on the subject of feminism, anchored in the book 'Emergence' with portraits by the photographer Cynthia MacAdams published in 1977. The film was partly funded by the International Documentary Association and also by a crowd funding campaign that raised over $75,000. It was released by Netflix on October 12, 2018.
Premise
In 1977 a book with portraits was released called 'Emergence' by photographer Cynthia MacAdams which captured women embracing feminism by shedding cultural restrictions. The documentary revisits those photos and those women, and contains interviews with women such as Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Judy Chicago, and at the same time tackling topics such as identity, abortion, race, childhood and motherhood.
The film discusses the contribution of films like "9 to 5" and the emergence of feminist artworks like The Dinner Party with some of the people involved. The film does include the significant contribution of Lesbian women to feminism, but it is noted that it missed an opportunity to include trans women. Erika Voeller of Mpls MadWomen notes that the women of color in the documentary express frustration with balancing their multiple identities within the movement but that the documentary misses an opportunity to delve more deeply into intersectional feminism.

Reception
Paige Munshell of The Diamondback rated the film 3.5 out of 4 and wrote, "Ironically, this documentary is subject to a common critique of women's art the film itself works to challenge: the brush-away claim that it is too sentimental, too emotional and not a serious work of art. The film is sentimental and emotional, but that doesn't make it unimportant or unworthy of attention... The documentary perfectly balances the old and the new, the ways feminism has grown and the way forward it must continue to march. It fearlessly shows us beauty and ugliness, women who painstakingly created something in a world of men, not to be accepted by them but in defiance of them."
Release
It was released on February 9, 2018 on Netflix streaming.

The Anglican Diocese of Bathurst is located in the Province of New South Wales. It includes the cities of Orange, Bathurst and Dubbo. The Bishop is the Right Reverend Mark Calder, installed on 23 November 2019.
Ministry
The diocese has 32 parishes covering about a third of the state of New South Wales. As well as the cities of Orange, Dubbo and Bathurst, major towns in the diocese include Bourke, Cobar, Cowra, Forbes, Mudgee, Parkes and Wellington.
Cathedral
The cathedral church of the diocese is All Saints' Cathedral, Bathurst in the heart of the city. The cathedral building was originally designed by Edmund Blacket in 1845 as a parish church, but became a cathedral in 1870 with the creation of the Diocese of Bathurst. An organ was installed in 1886 and bells were hung in 1855. In the 1890s, however, the bell tower was found to be unstable, so the bells could not be "rung full circle" but only by striking them.
Due to structural problems the original cathedral was demolished in 1969–70 and replaced in 1971 by a new building constructed in a 20th-century style. In 2009, the bells were rehung in a new bell tower attached to the new cathedral.
Senior clergy
Bishops of Bathurst
Assistant bishops
The following people have served as an assistant bishop in the diocese:

The following individuals have served as Deans of the All Saints' Cathedral in Bathurst:
Parishes and Churches
Most of the 27 parishes in the Diocese each perform services at multiple locations. Sunday and weekday services are usually conducted weekly or in certain weeks of the month indicated below in parentheses. In addition to church buildings, many parishes conduct services in nursing homes, hospitals or community halls which are included below. Most parishes employ one priest to oversee ministry of the parish who can be assisted by lay staff, assistant clergy or honorary clergy.
Many of the smaller or rural parishes do not keep or frequently update websites, meaning that the services times and staff listed below may be outdated. The best way to find accurate service times in these locations is to contact or visit the parish directly. In 2020, many of these service times were interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many parishes, as well as the bishop himself, conducted services online.

The Lands of Borland or Boreland (NS 5864 1742) formed a castle and land holdings within the old Barony of Cumnock, East Ayrshire, Parish of Old Cumnock, Scotland. Lying two miles south of Cumnock the property was mainly held by a cadet branch of the Hamilton family from around 1400 before passing by marriage to the Montgomeries and others. For consistency the spelling 'Borland' will be used throughout.
History
It is a little unusual for the name 'Borland' to be associated directly with a castle as a 'Boor' was a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants. Borland or Bordland could also mean the mensal land that was granted to the feudal superior specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling. Linking the name to Wild Boar is a more fanciful association that is occasionally inferred when such a placename exists. The Dumfries Road used to run through Borland Smithy and close to the castle site, but now runs slightly to the east with the line of the old road still visible. The castle was one of three in the parish of Old Cumnock, the others being Lefnoreis Castle and Terringzean.
The castle and estate
The castle or fortified manor house lay on an area of slightly raised ground between the old Borland Smithy (East Borland Farm) and Borland Mill. No remains are visible on the site as the farmer removed the remaining walls previous to 1855, although some of the foundations although stones are still sometimes struck during ploughing and part of the old moat was visible in the 19th century situated close to the Borland Burn that was ideally located to fill it. The farmer in 1855 referred to it as Borland House however it is recorded as a ruined castle on several maps up until 1821.
Close to the castle site is the sand and gravel hillock known as the Castle Hill or Knowe. Several gravel pits have obscured what may have been a moat and this site could have been the site of a fort or a castle mound.
In 1939 archaeological excavations revealed a wood lined shaft in the north-west side of the sandpit and a fragment of a Medieval jug was discovered within, raising the suggestion that this site had been used as a kitchen-refuse dump for Borland Castle.
The kitchen of East Borland Farm holds a stone located over the fireplace, presently hidden under interior decoration, that was recovered from the old castle and carved upon it are to the left the initials H. M. and on the right M. H. with the date 1677 in the centre. This relic is roughly three foot long and six inches in height. These initials are those of Hugh Montgomerie of Prestwickshaws and his bride Margaret Hamilton.
Various other names are recorded including Burland, Boirlandis, Boirdland, Borlandis and Brodland.
In 1611 Towlach, Garlaffen and Sandochhill were part of the Lands of Borland within the Barony of Cumnock. At the time of Hugh Hamilton the Lands of Borland consisted of the following properties that were inherited by his grand-daughter Margaret Hamilton in 1699 and formed her dowry:- Borland, Sannochhill, Smidieland, Rhyderstoun, Netherton, Midton, Watson, Borland Head, Borland Muir, Stay, Calloch Hill and Roddinghead.
Borland Mill may have been the mill of the Lands of Borland and is shown as the Smithy Mill in 1832, otherwise the Borland name is used. Being fed by the Black Loch it would have had a reliable water supply.
Borland Chapel
The Lands of Borland are recorded as having possessed a pre-reformation chapel (NS594173) on the now demolished farm of Chapel House. In circa 1636-52 a Boirland church/chapel site is clearly shown on Robert Gordon's map. The 1857 OS map shows the site of the chapel. Borland Chapel is recorded by John Smith as lying near to the castle.
The name 'Hallow Chapel' has also been used and ruins were still visible in 1837 but robbed out by 1899. A carved stone from this site, carved with concentric circles was built into the west wall of the old Chapel farmhouse. It was recorded that human bones and skulls were found during ploughing and this may indicate the presence of a burial ground. The site of the farm and chapel have been significantly altered by farming activities.
The Black Loch
This loch lay within the Lands of Borland, held by the Hamilton family since circa late 14th to early 15th centuries. It is one of the very few bodies of water that have an outflow running in two different directions. Fanciful imagination has pictured a trout swimming up the River Ayr, passing into the Lugar Water at Barskimming, entering the Black Loch via the Glaisnock Water and thence into the Black Loch. The second outflow from the loch would carry the trout into Creoch Loch, then into the Loch o' th' Lowes, the River Nith and finally into the Solway Firth after a journey of around seventy miles.
Lairds
Around the year 1400 a cadet branch of the Hamilton family came into possession of the lands of Borland. In 1551 George Hamilton and his son John were granted a 'Deed of Remission' by the Privy Council for "..syding with the Earl of Lennox." at the Battle of the Butts that had been fought in 1543 at the Gallowmuir close to Glasgow. This amounted to a pardon for fighting on the side of Mathew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, actually a traditional enemy of the Hamiltons, against James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran and Duke of Chatelherault, Regent of Scotland, a Catholic and anti-reformer.
A George Hamilton of Borland, married to Janet, daughter of Keith of Galston, was the second son of Sir David Hamilton of Cadzow. The family held the lands until in 1669 Hugh Hamilton of Borland left the lands to his grand-daughter Margaret, the heiress of this cadet branch of the family. Hugh Montgomerie of Prestwickshaws, a descendant of the Eglinton Montgomeries, married Margaret and sold his lands of Prestwickshaws to one Robert Wallace.
In 1577 a John Hamilton was murdered by John Turnbull of Kelsis. In 1611 William Hamilton inherited Borland from his father Patrick and in 1616 a Hugh Hamilton, with in 1650 a John Hamilton of Borland also recorded.
The Montgomeries of Borland held these lands until 1751 when the property passed to the Montgomeries of Coilsfield who together with McAdam of Waterhead were trustees and sold the lands to various parties. In 1790 the lands were purchased by the Earl of Dumfries, however by the 1860s the lands were owned by the Marquis of Bute.
William Montgomerie succeeded his father Hugh and married Anne Hamilton of Letham and in 1711 was a Commissioner of Supply for Ayrshire. John was the son of this William and became a collector of taxes did not live at Borland due to the sale of the lands by his father.
Cartographic evidence
The Blaeu's 1654 map only indicates an important site named 'Boirland'. Moll's map appears to show Borland close to the river without naming it. Roy's military survey of 1747 only shows a 'Borland' site with a group of buildings within an enclosure and two groups of buildings nearby. Armstrong, Andrew in 1775 records only records the site of 'Borlands'. Taylor and Skinner's 1776 maps mark the 'Ruins of Borland Castle' lying close to the 38 mile stone on the Dumfries Road. Ainslie's map of 1821 records only a Borland Castle lying close to the Borland Burn. In 1832 Thomson's map shows a Borland with a Smithy Mill and dwellings marked as Chapel, Netherton and Midton. A Borland Mains is shown some distance to the west of Borland. In 1857 the Dumfries Road still ran through Borland Smithy and the site of Borland Castle is clearly marked close to the site named Castle Hill that lies next to the main line railway. Borland Mill was still in use as a corn mill and the timber mill is shown opposite Borland Mains, close to the Borland Burn although a water supply is not shown. The site of the chapel is shown.
Micro-history
At Borland Smithy, now East Borland Farm, a fine felstone celt was found with an oblique cutting edge. Fine ornamented clay whorls and urn fragments have also been found. In 1898 two sepulchral urns were found in the Castle Knowe.

The Treaty of Federation () was a treaty signed on 31 March 1992 in Moscow between the Russian government and 86 of 89 federal subjects of Russia.
The Treaty of Federation refers to three documents of the same content, signed by representatives of the
republics (mentioned as "sovereign republics"),
krais, oblasts, cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg,
autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs,
and the Russian Federation. It was approved by the 6th Congress of People's Deputies of Russia on 10 April 1992. The provisions of the Treaty were included in the Constitution of 1978, introducing the basic principles of federalism in Russia.
The objective of the treaty was to prevent ethnic separatist movements from disintegrating the newly independent Russian Federation, as had happened to the Soviet Union.
The autonomous regions agreed to remain part of Russia in return for a greater autonomy and a larger share of natural resources. Chechnya and Tatarstan refused to sign the treaty. The treaty established republics as having greater power compared to other federal subjects of Russia. This legal imbalance was addressed by the Russian Constitution of 1993, which stipulated that all federal subjects had equal rights in their relationships with the federal government.

David Folkerts-Landau (born May 21, 1949) is a German born economist. He became member of the Deutsche Bank Group Executive Committee in 2012 and was named chief economist of Deutsche Bank on 1 June 2012. He is based in London.
Born in Upleward, East Friesland, Folkerts-Landau attended Harvard University, earning a doctorate at Princeton University in 1978. After teaching at Chicago Business School he worked for the International Monetary Fund from 1983 to 1997 before moving on to the financial sector. He joined Deutsche Bank's London office in October 1997. He was a member of the Markets division executive committee headed by Anshu Jain, and later the investment bank executive committee. In 2012, he became a member of the Deutsche Bank Group Executive Committee, which was co-chaired by Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen. At the same time, he also succeeded Thomas Mayer as Deutsche Bank's chief economist. He has kept a low public profile as chief economist and is better known as a confidant to Anshu Jain.
Early life
David Folkerts-Landau was born in north-west Germany and at 14 years old was sent to a Scottish boarding school. He is reported to maintain links to his birthplace. He is the grandson of Imke Folkerts.
Opinions and research
Asia financial crisis of 1997
In June 1998, Folkerts-Landau predicted that the 1997 Asia crisis would see its resolution "stretch well into the new century. The elimination of the unprecedented debt overhang and the reduction of high leverage ratios will be slow and painful.There is little upside potential, and a lot of downside risk coming from the possible devaluation of the Chinese RMB, a continuing slide of Japan into a 1930's type of recession, and the possibility of a G-7 interest rate increase". South Korea and some of the other smaller Asian countries had recovered by 2000, but Malaysia and Indonesia only recovered to pre-crisis levels of output by 2001 and 2003 respectively. Of the downside risks highlighted, the prediction of a weak Japan materialised, with people coming to talk about the 1990s and 2000s as the country's "Lost Decade (Japan) lost decades". The Chinese RMB did not depreciate but remained pegged at around 8.27-8.28 to the dollar until 2005. The Fed cut rates by 75 basis points later in the year, before reversing this decision in June 1999 and hiking rates by 175 basis point over the following 12 months.
Russia crisis of 1998
Folkerts-Landau and Marcel Cassard predicted in June 1998 that "notwithstanding the current political crisis, the Russian economy is likely to improve in 1998. Recent indicators point towards faster growth in output and a pick-up in domestic demand as well as a decline in inflation to single digits". Within a few months, Russia dramatically devalued its currency, it defaulted on its debt and suffered inflation of 84%. This came be known as the 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Bretton Woods II
Folkerts-Landau, Dooley and Garber have referred to the monetary system of today as Bretton Woods II. They argue that in the early 2000s (decade) the international system is composed of a core issuing the dominant international currency, and a periphery. The periphery is committed to export-led growth based on the maintenance of an undervalued exchange rate. In the 1960s, the core was the United States and the periphery was Europe and Japan. This old periphery has since graduated, and the new periphery is Asia. The core remains the same, the United States. The argument is that a system of pegged currencies, in which the periphery export capital to the core that provides a financial intermediary role is both stable and desirable, although this notion is controversial.
Financial crisis of 2007–2008
Folkerts-Landau viewed the sub-prime mortgage crisis as the result of fraud rather than financial innovation such as CDOs. In May 2008, he argued that the international monetary system was well placed to withstand the sub-prime crisis, and that a pessimistic outcome was not credible. In February 2009, he ceded that his critics were correct in predicting the 2008 financial crisis, but the transmission mechanism was different to what most had expected. He believed that the cause of the crisis was ineffective supervision and regulation of financial markets.
European debt crisis
In June 2013, Folkerts-Landau argued that the European debt crisis was the biggest force for European integration. He stated that "legacy (bank) assets should be kept apart from any sovereign bail-out...to mix them up would be a socialisation of losses of an unimaginable scale". He believed that Germany stimulating demand and raising wages would be "disastrous for the Euro-zone viz-a-viz the rest of the world". In relation to austerity programmes introduced since the crisis, he believed that "it has been a tremendous propaganda victory of governments to make us believe that austerity has reached its limits". He further added that "While we maintain that the Euro-zone will not break up, we are less optimistic on the pace of crisis resolution. Reform efforts are likely to be slow given the challenging economic backdrop and 'austerity fatigue'. As a result, we expect a continuation of the 'muddle-through' approach to crisis resolution, with growth in Europe remaining subdued for several years". He argued that Spanish youth unemployment was not due to austerity and instead could be solved by "changing trade union laws" as they were keeping labour markets closed.
ECB quantitative easing
In December 2013, Folkerts-Landau advocated the ECB engage in "genuine quantitative easing" given that he predicted growth in the euro zone to be low "pretty much as far as the eye can see,". The view was controversial as the Germany's central bank had earlier opposed the ECB's conditional bond purchase plan. In April 2014, he reiterated his view that "the ECB will eventually engage in further easing, starting with the likely purchase of private assets ('private QE') in H2 [2014]". In an interview with Welt Online also in April 2014, he recognised that as with other ECB programmes such as OMT (Outright Monetary Transactions), which was never used by the ECB, "The decision of the central bank to talk about QE, perhaps even ensures that you never have to use it.". The ECB announced quantitative easing in January 2015.
Russia and Ukraine
In April 2014, in the context of Russian involvement with Ukraine, Folkerts-Landau stated that "unlike many investors, I believe that Putin is ready to take these economic costs [of sanctions] in order to boost the geopolitical weight of Russia and secure the Russian influence in the region [by annexing eastern Ukraine] . This should lead to growing geopolitical uncertainty and at the end also to growing economic instability"
Referendum on Scottish independence
In September 2014 newspaper reports that he had criticised the economic arguments for Scottish independence.
In September 2014, Folkerts-Landau also wrote a critical analysis of the prospects of Scottish independence, saying a Yes vote would go down in history as "a political and economic mistake" which was indirectly quoted by Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
Grexit
In 2010 Folkerts-Landau predicted that the Euro-zone would survive the debt crisis. "We believe that the Euro-zone will survive this current crisis. (…) [T]here is no way the political and financial leadership of the core Euro-zone countries are going to sacrifice the whole single currency project over a default by Greece or Portugal".
On 19 June 2015, Folkerts-Landau predicted that in relation to Greece receiving funding from the Brussels group before the end of the month there was a "60 percent probability of no deal , [which would be] followed by capital controls". After the "No" vote at the 5 July 2015 referendum, while recognising that odds of Grexit had risen materially, Folkerts-Landau wrote: "we continue to see Greece staying in the euro as marginally more likely, not least because the majority of Greeks prefer so".
Controversies
Testimony to German Parliamentary Commission
On June 27, 2012, David Folkerts-Landau spoke before a German parliamentary commission on commodity markets and food price inflation. He said that "In developing countries where often up to 90% of the income must be spent on food, price increases of wheat, corn, and soybeans in the years 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 had devastating consequences." He also stated that there was "hardly any sound empirical evidence" that it "led to price increases or higher volatility." However, in earlier research published by his team, it argued that speculation had the possibility of "distorting the normal functioning of the market," which "can have grave consequences for farmers and consumers and is in principle unacceptable.". In another research note, it argued that "in some instances speculation might have added to the [commodity] price movement"
Libor scandal
On April 23, 2015, Deutsche Bank agreed to a combined US$2.5 billion in fines – a US$2.175 billion fine by American regulators, and a €227 million penalty by British authorities – for its involvement in the Libor scandal. Folkerts-Landau was not named in any of the actions, but a fellow Group Executive Committee member was mentioned as having been aware of issues around the fix since October 28, 2008. On June 12, 2015, a leaked Bafin report concluded that while no board member was directly involved in manipulating interest rates, the regulator found serious negligence in control of business processes, organization and dealing with the affair. It went on to criticise three additional Managing Boards and Group Executive Committee members.
Personal life
David Folkerts-Landau is married to Maie Folkerts. In May 2013, he bought a New York apartment in the Dakota owned by the Portuguese government for $11.6 million. It was believed to be part of asset sales needed to deal with Portugal's fiscal crisis. Leveraged buyout specialist Wilbur Ross and musician Yoko Ono are noted residents of the block.

Marcasite jewellery is jewellery made using cut and polished pieces of pyrite (fool's gold) as gemstone, and not, as the name suggests, from marcasite (sometimes misspelled Mercasite).
Both pyrite and marcasite are chemically iron sulphide, but differ in their crystal structures giving them different physical properties—also known as polymorphism. Pyrite is more stable and less brittle than marcasite. Marcasite can also react with moisture to form sulphuric acid. These are the reasons why pyrite is used instead of real marcasite in "marcasite" jewellery.
Marcasite jewellery is frequently made by setting small pieces of faceted pyrite into silver. Cheaper costume jewellery is made by gluing pieces of pyrite rather than setting. A similar-looking type of jewellery can be made from small pieces of cut steel. The cut and polished marcasite pieces reflect light at different angles from its different facets giving it a sparkle and making it attractive.
Thailand is one of the large producers of modern marcasite jewellery in silver.
Etymology
Marcasite (mär′ka-sīt) or mercasite an iron ore, a variety of pyrites.
History
Marcasite jewellery has been made since the time of the Ancient Greeks. It was particularly popular in the eighteenth century, the Victorian era and with Art Nouveau jewellery designers. When diamonds were banned from public display in Switzerland in the 18th century marcasite, along with cut steel, was turned to as a replacement.
When Prince Albert died in 1861, Queen Victoria entered a period of mourning, requiring her entire court to wear black and avoid opulent jewellery. Marcasite became popular as an understated alternative for the nobility.

Aleksey Fyodorovich Afanas'ev, also Afanasiev or Afanasyev (Russian: Алексе́й Фёдорович Афана́сьев; 30 November 1850, Saint Petersburg - c. 1920, location unknown) was a Russian Empire painter, graphic artist, caricaturist and illustrator who was associated with the Peredvizhniki.
Biography
His parents were servants at the Imperial Court, and he originally worked as a footman and stoker. In 1872, he began auditing classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts and was accepted as a student a year later. In 1877, he received a silver medal for his drawings from nature. From 1887 to 1905, he was a teacher at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts.
In 1905, following the death of Konstantin Savitsky, he was named to succeed him as Director of the art college in Penza, near Moscow. He resigned (some sources say he was dismissed) four years later and returned to his position as teacher at the Imperial Society.
From 1889 to 1918, he participated in the exhibitions of the Peredvizhniki. After 1912, he provided drawings for several satirical, humorous and literary periodicals, including Fragments (Осколки). He also did illustrations for The Tale of Tsar Saltan and The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish by Pushkin, as well as works by Aleksey Tolstoy; but his best-known works of this type are, perhaps, those for The Humpbacked Horse by Pyotr Yershov. Many of his illustrations were published as postcards. From 1894 to 1897, along with Viktor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and other well-known painters, he participated in decorating the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, creating drawings for numerous mosaics.
He apparently disappeared during the Russian Civil War.

Joonas Donskoi (born 13 April 1992) is a Finnish professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played for the San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche.
Playing career
Donskoi played with Oulun Kärpät of the Finnish Liiga under coach Lauri Marjamaki. After witnessing Donskoi not standing upright enough while skating, he recommended the forward lengthen his stick. While with Kärpät, he was drafted in the 4th round (99th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers.
Donskoi continued his offensive growth setting career high of 19 goals and 49 points in the 2014–15 season with Kärpät,
San Jose Sharks
With his NHL rights relinquished by the Panthers, Donskoi was signed to a two-year entry-level contract with the San Jose Sharks on 20 May 2015.
In his first training camp and pre-season with the Sharks, Donskoi impressed and made the club's opening night roster for the 2015–16 season. Donskoi scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game, 7 October 2015, against Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings. Donskoi surpassed expectations with the Sharks, cementing a regular roster position amongst the Sharks offense. In 76 games with San Jose, he compiled 11 goals and 25 assists for 36 points. Helping the Sharks reach the postseason, Donskoi appeared in every game, contributing with 12 points in 23 games as the club reached the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in franchise history. In Game 3 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals, Donskoi scored the game-winning goal in overtime, but the team lost the series in six games to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
On 12 May 2017, the Sharks re-signed Donskoi to a two-year, $3.8 million contract.
He would record 28 goals and 31 assists over the next two seasons with the Sharks before becoming a free agent.
Colorado Avalanche
As a free agent from the Sharks, Donskoi signed a four-year, $15.6 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche on 1 July 2019. Acquired by the Avalanche to add scoring depth to the club's middle six forwards, Donskoi made his Avalanche debut on the opening night of the season, registering 2 goals in a 5-3 victory over the Calgary Flames on 3 October 2019. Showing versatility, Donskoi played primarily alongside Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky, and notched his first career hat-trick in a 9-4 blowout victory over the Nashville Predators on 7 November 2019. He made his 300th NHL regular season appearance the following game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 9 November. He compiled a career high 14 points through the month of November, recording a career-high four points (2 goals, 2 assists), playing on the top-line in a 5-2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks on 30 November. Donskoi recorded a career-high 16 goals and added 17 assists and 33 points in 65 games before the regular season was halted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Avalanche's return to the playoffs, Donskoi added two goals in the round-robin stage and added 6 points in just 9 post-season games before missing the club's final 5 games to injury in a second-round defeat to the Dallas Stars.
In his second season with Colorado, with added depth brought into the Avalanche line-up, Donskoi was primarily used in a third-line role alongside Tyson Jost and Valeri Nichushkin for the pandemic delayed season. Donskoi began the season with an offensive burst, compiling 28 points through 35 games, including collecting his second career hat-trick, notching the fastest 3 goals to start a game in franchise history (7:31) in a 9-3 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on 31 March 2021. After missing 5 games through April in a COVID protocol related absence, Donskoi slowed in his production, finishing with a career high 17 goals while adding 31 points in 51 regular season games. In the opening round of the playoffs, Donskoi matched a career high of 3 points in a Game 2 victory over the St. Louis Blues on 19 May 2021. He collected five points in 10 playoff games, unable to help Colorado advance past the second round for the third consecutive year.
Seattle Kraken
On 21 July 2021, Donskoi's tenure with Colorado was cut short when he was selected from the Avalanche at the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft by the Seattle Kraken.
International play
On 2 March 2016, Donskoi was named to Team Finland's roster for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.
Personal life
Donskoi is one of six children; he has three brothers and two sisters. In his free time, he is interested in cars and skateboarding. After the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, he returned to Finland and paid off the debt of a skating park his childhood friend owned. He has Russian roots from his great-grandfather or grandfather.

Lázaro Chacón González (27 June 1873 – 9 April 1931) was the acting President of Guatemala from 26 September 1926 to 18 December 1926 and President of Guatemala from 19 December 1926 to 2 January 1931.
Born in Teculután, Zacapa he was the son of Juan José Chacón Paiz and Soledad González Paiz who died during his birth. He is grandson of José Deciderio Chacón and María del Rosario Paiz, and also grandson of Vicente González Chacón and Josefa Paiz Cordón.
Chacón's aunt, Cleta Chacón became his adopted mother. He married Josefina Pazos.
Interim President
On 25 May 1926, El Imparcial -a private newspaper- had published a news flash: Martial law enacted which referred to executive decree 916, in which President Orellana had suspended the individual guarantees contained in the Constitution; the main reason for such decision was that "insidious and unpatriotic activities of certain elements" tended "to disrupt the peace and development of the country", which, at once, made it impossible to solve the national economic problem. Although El Imparcial was not circulating regularly in the previous days -due to a government boycott-, after May 26 it ceased publication indefinitely. Thereafter, only the official news outlets, such as Diario de Centro América and El Guatemalteco, could circulate, carrying irrelevant information. The story took a sudden turn on Sunday September 26, when, at 0:15 pm, Orellana died during a vacation trip to Antigua Guatemala; he was in a room at Hotel Manchén. "A violent angina attack ended the life of our illustrious president," explained Diario de Centro America in a special edition that day. These strange circumstances led to the suspicion that he was poisoned. General Lázaro Chacón assumed as interim President and immediately lifted Martial Law and allowed private newspaper to be published again.
Presidency
Chacón was first appointed to the position of Chairman and interim president following the death of General José María Orellana. He then called for elections in which his main opponent was general Jorge Ubico. Chacón defeated Ubico thanks in part to the strong campaign that journalist Clemente Marroquín Rojas made against the latter in his column called Desnudando al ídolo. Chacón government took some liberties such as creating the National Mortgage Bank (Crédito Hipotecario Nacional) as well as constructing the Faculty of Medicine building for the Faculty of Natural Sciences. During his tenure the Legislative Palace and the national railroad were also completed. During his presidency, the Guatemalan currency was stabilized, but Guatemala suffered the effects of the Great Depression in 1929.
Stroke and resignation
In December, 1930 the following events occurred in a rapid succession:
On 12 December, General Chacón suffers a stroke that forces him to resign.
General Mauro de León, first designated successor to the Presidency apparently resigns.
Lawyer and cabinet member Baudilio Palma, second designated successor, is appointed interim President.
On 17 December 1930 a coup d'etat led by general Manuel María Orellana Contreras forces Palma to resign after a short battle inside the Presidential Palace. During the fight, that lasted no more than an hour, both Palma and Mauro de León died. The Liberal Progresista party places general Roderico Anzueto in the key position of Chief of Police.
On 2 January 1931 José María Reina Andrade is appointed interim President, after the foreign nations representatives refuse to deal with Orellana Contreras and calls for presidential elections.
On 7 February 1931, general Jorge Ubico Castañeda wins the elections and is sworn as President. The Liberal Party joined with the Progressives to nominate Ubico as Andrade's successor, and although he was the only candidate on the ballot, he received 305,841 votes on February, 1931. In his inaugural address, he pledged a "march toward civilization". Once in office, he began a campaign of efficiency that included assuming dictatorial power.
Death
Chacón died in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States on 9 April 1931 at age 57 as a consequence of his stroke.
Additional information
His granddaughter Josefina Chacon de Machado was a magistrate and President of the Guatemalan Supreme Court.
His grandson Carlos Gilberto Chacon Torrebiarte was also magistrate and President of the Guatemalan Supreme Court.

The Beugniot lever (Beugniot-Hebel) is a mechanical device used on a number of locomotives to improve curve running. It was named after its inventor Édouard Beugniot.
Overview
Around 1860, when Beugniot was the chief engineer at the firm of André Koechlin & Cie. in Mulhouse, he developed a system whereby wheelsets are housed in pairs in the locomotive frame, with side-play, and connected by a lever. These levers are fixed to the frame in the centre and thus enable the sideways movement of the connected axles in opposite directions. In this way, instead of being fixed in the frame, the axles are able to move sideways rather like a bogie, but clearly nowhere near as much. On locomotives with a side rod drive, the axle side-play is balanced using longer coupling pins (Kuppelzapfen) on which the coupling rods are also able to move sideways.
Operation
On running round a bend, the first axle is pushed sideways by the curve of the rails and so moves the second axle parallel to it in the opposite direction, until the wheel flanges of both axles align with the rails. This distributes the guide forces between the two axles which reduces wear and tear on the wheel flanges. By enabling this transverse movement of the wheelsets, locomotives with rigid frames do not have to use the thinner wheel flanges etc. normally needed to facilitate smooth running through points, bends and tightly curved sections of track. The 'guide length' of the locomotive is formed by the distance between the two fixed Beugniot lever pivot points.
Examples
In Germany, Beugniot levers were used mainly in the middle of the 20th century. The best known examples of locomotives that use this type of lever are the MaK side-rod drive locomotives, the Class 105 and 106 engines in East Germany as well as steam locomotives like the DB Class 82.

Text Adventure Development System (TADS) is a prototype-based domain-specific programming language and set of standard libraries for creating interactive fiction (IF) games.
History
The original TADS 1 was released by High Energy Software as shareware in 1988, and was followed by TADS 2 not long after. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, free development tools such as TADS and Inform enabled amateur communities to create interactive fiction. In the mid-1990s, TADS was a top development tool for interactive fiction. At the time, it was a more improved tool for parsing and world building than existing systems like AGT (Adventure Game Toolkit).
TADS 2 syntax is based on C, with bits of Pascal. TADS 2 has been maintained and updated at regular intervals by its creator, Michael J. Roberts, even after it became freeware in July 1996. Graham Nelson, creator of Inform, describes Inform and TADS as the "only two systems... widely used" in the last half of the 1990s, and TADS has been called "The second most commonly used IF programming language today". Multimedia TADS, introduced in 1998, allows games to display graphics, animation and play sounds, if the platform supports it.
In 2006, TADS received a major overhaul with the release of TADS 3, which is a complete rewrite of the TADS engine, only retaining the platform-dependent code to ease porting. TADS 3 uses a language with a syntax that resembles C++ and Java. It has many new features, such as efficient dynamic objects (with automatic garbage collection), structured exceptions, native UTF-8 strings, and many useful function classes.
The TADS 3 compiler and interpreter have been ported to the DOS, Macintosh and Unix platforms. Several TADS 3 games have been released.
TADS games
Games written in TADS are compiled to a platform-independent format that can be played on any computer for which a suitable virtual machine (VM) exists. Such virtual machines exist for several platforms, and in this respect, TADS closely follows the example of the original Infocom Z-machine, as well as modern languages such as Java and C#.
Whereas the TADS 1 and 2 VMs had to parse the commands entered by the player, before sending the results on to the game, TADS 3 employs a more general-purpose virtual machine, where the command-parsing is done by the game code itself, akin to Inform. The rationale for this is that it is easier to customize the parser.
Notable games developed in TADS 2
Uncle Zebulon's Will, by Magnus Olsson (1995). It won the TADS category at the inaugural 1995 Interactive Fiction Competition and was included on Activision's 1996 commercial release of Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom.
The Frenetic Five vs. Sturm und Drang, the first game in the "Frenetic Five" series by Neil deMause (1997). The game won a XYZZY Award for Best NPCs that year.
Worlds Apart by Suzanne Britton (1999). Winner of XYZZY Award for Best Story and finalist in seven other XYZZY Award categories in 1999, the game features a huge amount of detailed worldbuilding.
Kaged by Ian Finley (2000). Winner of the 2000 annual Interactive Fiction Competition.
1893: A World's Fair Mystery by Peter Nepstad (2002). The game is one of a handful to be released commercially in recent years, garnering attention from the New York Times and the Associated Press. It also won the 2002 XYZZY Award for Best Setting.
Notable games developed in TADS 3
Max Blaster and Doris de Lightning Against the Parrot Creatures of Venus by Dan Shiovitz and Emily Short (2003). Winner of the 2003 Spring Thing; a somewhat unusual example of multiple player characters (or PCs).

Parasphendale affinis, common name budwing mantis, is a species of praying mantis. It is named for the female's short wings and can grow to 4 inches long and have a low mortality rate as nymphs. They originate from Kenya and are a mottled brown and reddish pink color. They have a voracious appetite, and have been known to gorge themselves to the point of illness when kept in captivity with an unlimited food source. Though they can be kept in captivity, due to their level of activity they require more space than other mantis species.

The document was written in the 2nd or 3rd century. Currently it is housed in the Haskell Oriental Institute (2066) at the University of Chicago.
Description
The recto side of the document is a personal letter from Chaereas to his brother Dionysius. The verso side contains the address, in which Chaereas refers to himself as a limniarchos (λιμνίαρχος), an unknown term which possibly means "superintendent of lakes." The measurements of the fragment are 177 by 163 mm.
It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898.
Text
Chaereas to his brother Dionysius, greeting. I have already urged you in person to have the horoscope (?) in the archives prepared and also the sale of the slaves' children, and to sell the wine that comes from both the near and the far vineyard, keeping the money in a safe place until I come. I send you some good melon seeds through Diogenes the friend of Chaereas the citizen, and two strips of cloth sealed with my seal, one of which please give to your children. Salute your sister and Cyrilla. Rhodope and Arsinous salute you. I pray for your health.

Wadia Ghandy & Co., is one of the oldest law firms of India. It was founded on 28 November 1883 with an office in what was then Bombay. It currently holds offices at Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune. While it is a full service firm with partners across practice areas, it has well recognised and market leading litigation, real estate, aviation and banking teams.
History
The law firm was started by Framji Rustomji Wadia and Jiwaji Dinshaw Ghandy in the 1880s. The firm's "managing clerk," Ardeshir Jamshedji Chanji Mistry published memoirs of its history in 1911 and 1925, along with memoirs of the Bombay High Court in 1925. These remain rare and valuable "primary source" accounts of the everyday life of the firm and Indian legal profession at the turn of the twentieth century. Despite losing one of their senior partners Anand Bhatt in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack, the firm has continued to prosper. Nihar Mody, once a partner at Wadia Ghandy & co, has gone on to found Platinum Partners.
Structure
The firm is a partnership firm with various partners for each office. For offices other than the Mumbai office, there is a junior resident partner and the partners of Mumbai have cross-partnerships in such local offices.
Currently the position of managing partner of the firm is shared between Ashish Ahuja and Dhawal Mehta.
Articleship programme
The firm is well known for its article-ship training programme which is similar to the one followed in U.K (Solicitor trainee). It is a three-year programme whereby an articled clerk is assigned to a department for a year and rotated at the end of each year (Conveyancing, Corporate, Litigation; not in particular order) and thereby providing holistic training. the firm follows three round process in selecting articled clerks wherein the first round consists of shortlisting candidates on the basis of their C.V., selected candidates then proceed to the second round which consists of personal interview with the head of H.R and then the candidates selected from the second round proceed to the third round which consists of personal interview with a senior partner.

John Watts (c. 1554 – 1616) was an English merchant, Alderman and shipowner, active in the East India Company and Virginia Company and Lord Mayor of London in 1606.
Life
The son of Thomas Watts of Buntingford, Hertfordshire, he was the owner of the Margaret and John, one of the ships paid by the city of London in 1588 to sail against the Spanish armada. Watts himself served in her as a volunteer and saw action. In 1590 the same ship was one of a fleet of merchantmen coming home from the Mediterranean, which successfully fought and repelled the Spanish galleys near Cadiz. Although Watts was not on board, throughout the war he equipped and financed privateers led by Michael Geare, William Lane and Christopher Newport. A few of his notable successes include his financed and organised expedition to the Spanish main in 1590, the expedition to Cuba the following year and James Lancaster's expedition to Recife in April 1595. Watt's received significant prize money from the success of these expeditions. Another in July 1601 took into Plymouth a prize coming from the Indies laden with China silks, satins and taffetas. At this time he was an alderman of London (Tower ward), and had been suspected of being a supporter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.
He was one of the founders of the East India Company, and on 11April 1601 was elected its governor, during the imprisonment of Sir Thomas Smythe. He served as a Sheriff of the City of London in 1597. On the accession of James I was knighted on 26July 1603, becoming Lord Mayor of London in 1606–1607, at which time he was described in a letter to the king of Spain as "the greatest pirate that has ever been in this kingdom". During the following years he was an active member of the Virginia Company. In the city of London, Watts was a member of the Clothworkers' Company.
Watts died at his seat in Hertfordshire in September 1616, and was buried on the 7th of the month at Ware.
Family
By his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir James Hawes, knt. (lord mayor in 1574), he left four sons and four daughters. The eldest son, John, served in the Cadiz expedition and was knighted for his good service in 1625; he subsequently served under George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in the Rhé expedition, and under Count Mansfeldt in the Electorate of the Palatinate; he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Bayning, and aunt of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning, and left numerous issue. His eldest son (grandson of the lord mayor), who also became Sir John Watts, served an apprenticeship in arms under his father. He was knighted in 1642, and received a commission to raise a troop of arms for the king. Having been expelled from the governorship of Chirk Castle, he attached himself to Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and was one of the defenders of Colchester Castle (August 1648). He compounded for delinquency by paying a fine, and was discharged on 11May 1649; however, he was forced to sell to Sir John Buck his manor of Mardocks in Ware. After the Restoration he was made receiver for Essex and Hertfordshire. He died about 1680, and was buried in the church of Hertingfordbury.
His descendants live on to this day, still remaining in England and Wales.

Bamberger Ranch, also called Selah, is an ecological restoration and conservation project near Johnson City, in Blanco County, Texas in the Texas Hill Country.
History
The preserve was created in 1969 by restaurant chain executive J. David Bamberger.
Bamberger specifically sought out a worn-out ranch with poor economic prospects and when he found Selah, “The ranch was mostly bare ground or infested with cedar (Juniperus ashei). There was no grass and absolutely no live creeks, springs, or ponds.”
After removing the ”cedar” and planting native grasses, rainwater infiltration improved and the aquifer underlying the property refilled. The site now has several running springs that did not exist when Bamberger bought the place.
Bird biodiversity on the land has increased from around 50 species to over 220 species.
The ranch also works to promulgate endangered species. It has a herd of scimitar-horned oryx (native to Africa), and Bamberger also markets the Texas snowbell tree to other ranchers.
Bat cave
The site has its own human-built bat cave, completed in 1998 and called the Chiroptorium. The Chiroptorium is now home to a colony of 200,000 Mexican free-tailed bats.

United Nations Security Council resolution 1624, adopted unanimously at the 2005 World Summit on 14 September 2005, after reaffirming previous resolutions on terrorism, including resolutions 1267 (1999), 1373 (2001), 1535 (2004), 1540 (2004), 1566 (2004) and 1617 (2005), the Council called on all states to co-operate in order to strengthen the security of their international borders by enhancing terrorist screening and passenger security procedures.
Resolution 1624, along with Resolution 1625 (2005), was adopted at a meeting of heads of state or government. The resolution was drafted by the United Kingdom.
Resolution
Observations
In the preamble of the resolution, the Council reaffirmed its intention to combat terrorism in all its forms in accordance with the United Nations Charter, while stressing that measures taken should conform to international law. It condemned acts of terrorism and the incitement and glorification of terrorist acts, expressing concern that such actions pose a threat to human rights and the peace, stability and economic development of all states. Furthermore, the Council recalled the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and provisions relating to freedom of expression and the right to asylum.
The Security Council continued by expressing concern at the increasing number of victims of terrorism, the nature of terrorism as contrary to the United Nations Charter and the role of the United Nations in combatting terrorism. It called on all countries to become party to international conventions regarding counterterrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.
Meanwhile, the resolution emphasised efforts for dialogue to broaden understanding among civilisations to prevent any indiscriminate targeting of religions and cultures. In this regard, the role of media, business and society was important to promote tolerance. The Council recognised that in a globalised world, states act co-operatively to prevent terrorists from using sophisticated communication to incite terrorist acts.
Acts
The Security Council called upon all states to adopt measures necessary to prohibit incitement to terrorist action and deny safe haven to persons where there is credible evidence that they had been involved in such conduct. Furthermore, countries were asked to strengthen their international borders through combatting fraudulent travel documents, enhance terrorist screening and passenger security procedures, and improve understanding among civilisations. It was stressed that measures taken had to comply with international law and report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee.
Finally, the Counter-Terrorism Committee was instructed to engage in dialogue with states on how they implemented the current resolution, promoting the best legal practice and information exchange, and to report back within twelve months.

Chaodaogou culture (Chinese 抄道溝, Chaodaogou Wenhua) was a late Bronze Age nomadic archeological culture in the northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces of China, its center is located between the bend of the river Hunahe and the drainage basin of the Liao 遼/辽 river. Chaodaogou culture is cautiously dated to c. the 9th to 8th centuries BCE, falling within Western Zhou period of the Central Plain (Zhongyuan) area (in the middle and lower course of the Yellow River). The type site of the culture is Chaodaogou in Qinglong county, Hebei, excavated in May 1961. Another typical site of this culture is a cemetery in Linzheyu () in Baode county, Shaanxi. The Chaodaogou culture is roughly contemporary with the fishing and hunting nomadic Baijinbao culture in Heilongjiang.
The Chaodaogou culture is mostly characterized by funerary sites with identical or closely related objects, the grave inventory contains the most characteristic bronze weapons of daggers, knives, and axes, that have greatly contributed to defining the "Northern Zone" as a distinct cultural complex. The grave inventory points to a developed horse husbandry culture, the objects include horse harness, These are a dagger with decorated handle and ram-head pommel, an axe with tubular socket, small rattles and small bells in bronze, knives with arched back and a rattle pommel, knife with a ram-head knob, dagger with grooved hilt and rattle pommel, bronze belt plaques with spiral designs, and bronze ritual vessels.
The axes with tubular socket are clearly different from the fan-shaped axe of the Shang, the tubular hafting system is very different from the predominant Shang method of attaching handle to a protruding flat tang, the main characteristic of the tubular hafting system is a tubular socket set perpendicularly to the blade. Tubular axes were excavated at the archeological sites in Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and at Shang sites of the Central Plain, and in eastern Liaoning
The elements of the Chaodaogou bronze culture peculiar to the Northern Zone are present as far as Baikal area, Mongolia, Altai region, South Siberia (Minusinsk river basin), and Tuva, evincing the extraordinary reach of this cultural complex. Excavation of archaeological sites in North China allowed to identify a number of cultures or cultural features located within the Northern Zone complex. In addition to the Chaodaogou culture, they are also characteristic to the Lower Xiajiadian and Baijinbao cultures in the northeast; the Zhukaigou culture, together with mixed Shang and Northern Zone sites, in the north-central sector; and the Qijia, Xindian, and Siwa cultures in the northwestern portion, including the present-day Gansu and Ningxia provinces.

Amateur radio or ham radio is a hobby that is practised by over 16,000 licensed users in India.
Licences are granted by the Wireless and Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC), a branch of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. In addition, the WPC allocates frequency spectrum in India. The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Service) Rules, 1978 lists five licence categories:
To obtain a licence, candidates must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination conducted by the WPC. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of Morse code proficiency in sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure can take up to one year. This licence is valid for up to five years.
Each licence category has certain privileges allotted to it, including the allotment of frequencies, output power, and the emission modes. This article list the various frequencies allotted to various classes, and the corresponding emission modes and input DC power.
Allotted spectrum
The following table lists the frequencies that amateur radio operators in India can operate on.
External links
Government of India National Frequency Allocation Plan
Emission designations
The International Telecommunication Union uses an internationally agreed system for classifying radio frequency signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified according to its bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.
An emission designation is of the form BBBB 123 45, where BBBB is the bandwidth of the signal, 1 is a letter indicating the Type of modulation used, 2 is a digit representing the Type of modulating signal, 3 is a letter corresponding to the Type of information transmitted, 4 is a letter indicating the practical details of the transmitted information, and 5 is a letter that represents the method of multiplexing. The 4 and 5 fields are optional. For example, an emission designation would appear read as 500H A3E, where 500H translates to 500 Hz, and A3E is the emission mode as permitted.
The WPC has authorized the following emission modes:
Licence categories
Two categories of amateur radio licence exist.
Restricted Grade
The Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence, Restricted licence requires the same scores as the old term Grade II.The minimum age is 12 years. The licence allows the user to make radiotelegraphy (Morse code) and radiotelephony transmission in 12 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 100 W.
A Restricted Grade licence holder was previously authorized the use of radio telephony emission on frequency bands below 30 MHz on submission of proof that 100 contacts have been made with other amateur operators using CW (Morse code). This has now since changed with restricted license holders being allowed phone (SSB) bands with the only restriction being the PEP(peak envelope power) limited to 50 W. Now Morse Code is not necessary for this exam
General Grade
The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, requires a minimum of 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 words per minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400 W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.

Mullaitivu District ( Mullaittīvu Māvaṭṭam; ) is one of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, the second level administrative division of the country. The district is administered by a District Secretariat headed by a District Secretary (previously known as a Government Agent) appointed by the central government of Sri Lanka. The capital of the district is the town of Mullaitivu.
History
Parts of present-day Mullaitivu District was part of the pre-colonial Jaffna kingdom. The district then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of Ceylon. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The district, which was then part of Vanni District, was part of the Tamil administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. Vanni District, together with Jaffna District and Mannar District, formed the new Northern Province.
Vanni District was later renamed Mullaitivu District and then Vavuniya District. The district was colonised in the second half of the 18th century by residents from Jaffna Peninsula, primarily from Alaveddy, Udupiddy and Navaly. At the time that Ceylon gained independence, Vavuniya was one of the three districts located in the Northern Province. Mullaitivu District was carved out of the northern part of Vavuniya District together with parts of the then Jaffna District, Mannar District and Trincomalee District in September 1978.
Mullaitivu District was under the control of rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for many years during the civil war. The district was recaptured by the Sri Lankan military in early 2009.
Geography
Mullaitivu District is located in the north east of Sri Lanka in the Northern Province. It has an area of .
Administrative units
Mullaitivu District is divided into 6 Divisional Secretary's Division (DS Divisions), each headed by a Divisional Secretary (previously known as an Assistant Government Agent). The DS Divisions are further sub-divided into 136 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GN Divisions).
Demographics
Population
Mullaitivu District's population was 91,947 in 2012. The population of the district is mostly Sri Lankan Tamil.
The population of the district, like the rest of the north and east of Sri Lanka, has been heavily affected by the civil war. The war killed an estimated 100,000 people. Several hundred thousand Sri Lankan Tamils, possibly as much as one million, emigrated to India or to the West during the war. Many Sri Lankan Tamils also moved to the relative safety of the capital Colombo. Most of the Sri Lankan Moors and Sinhalese who lived in the district fled to other parts of Sri Lanka or were forcibly expelled by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, though most of them have returned to the district since the end of the civil war.

Ridden by Olympian Karen O'Connor, he performed exceedingly well at such events as the Rolex Kentucky Three Day and the Pan American Games. His success and small stature earned him the nickname "Super Pony."
Breeding
Theodore O'Connor (or "Teddy") was by the Thoroughbred stallion Witty Boy, who finished his racing career with a record of (40-5-1-3) and earnings of $50,518. Witty Boy went on to sire more than 300 horses in the United States, including winners in-hand, hunters, eventers, endurance horses, jumpers and dressage horses. Notable progeny include the show hunter I Don't Know (2000 USAEq National Champion) and the Anglo-Arabian VSF Otis+/ (completing 100-mile endurance competition).
Theodore O'Connor was out of Chelsea's Melody, a mare of 1/2 Thoroughbred, 1/4 Arabian, and 1/4 Shetland Pony breeding. The sire of Chelsea's Melody was a racing Thoroughbred by the name of Honest Turn, a great-grandson of Bold Ruler. Her dam, Esker Electra, was by the stallion JR Lyraff, who was strongly linebred to the extremely influential Arabian stallion Raffles, son of Skowronek.
Pedigree
Competitive career
Theodore O'Connor was started at the age of three years by his breeder and began his competitive career as a show hunter, later showing a bit as a jumper. He began eventing when he was six and continued up through Preliminary under rider Nicole Villers, before Christan Trainor rode him on through the Advanced level and finished in 8th place at his first CIC**. Olympian Karen O'Connor then rode him at the Advanced level, eventually taking him to his first CCI**** at the Rolex Kentucky Three Day where he finished 3rd with 4.4 time faults cross-country. He then qualified for the Pan American Games as part of the US Eventing Team, where he won the team gold and beat out several more experienced horses to also win the individual gold. He finished 6th at the 2008 Rolex CCI**** and was short-listed for the Olympic Team.

Death
Theodore O'Connor was humanely euthanized on May 28, 2008 as a result of an injury sustained at Karen and David O'Connor's barn in The Plains, VA. The attending veterinarian stated:
"He spooked at something while being ridden and bolted. The rider came off and the horse ran toward the barn. He got into a freak accident and slid into the side of the barn and lacerated his right hind leg about 4 inches above the fetlock on the back of the leg. It looked like a knife cut it; he severed the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, ligaments, cut both branches of the arterial blood supply, and nerves. My experience with injuries like this are that the chances of reattaching the vascular supply and nerve supply and reattaching the tendons and ligaments is almost zero. Even if there has been a 10% chance of us being successful to recover him (from surgery) … but with the nature of the injury, that wasn't going to happen," said Allen sadly. "Karen would have done anything for that pony."

HD 100453 is a binary star system which lies in the constellation Centaurus about away from the Sun and is a member of the open cluster Scorpius–Centaurus association.
Components
The apparent magnitudes of the visible components A and B are 7.8 and 15.9 respectively. The primary is a Herbig Ae/Be star, which is young but no longer accreting mass. The secondary is an M4 class red dwarf star at the projected separation 120 AU from the primary.
Circumstellar disks
The primary star is surrounded by two dust disks, separated by a gap. The disks are orbiting in different planes, misaligned by 72 degrees. The disk misalignment may be caused by a suspected superjovian planet orbiting within the gap, roughly 15–20 AU from the primary. The outer disk has a 2-arm spiral structure caused by the outer stellar companion HD 100453B. The outer disk is rather massive at 0.0174, but is significantly depleted in gas, with a gas-to-dust mass ratio of no more than 4:1.
The gas present in the disks is unusually depleted in nitrogen and hydrogen-bearing compounds and enriched in carbon monoxide. Molecular hydrogen was not detected. Solid silicate material present in the disks shows good crystallinity, with reduced amounts of amorphous material.
No disks were detected around the companion star HD 100453B, with the upper limit on the amount of dust around it being .

Horace Elva Tapscott (April 6, 1934 – February 27, 1999) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He formed the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra (also known as P.A.P.A., or The Ark) in 1961 and led the ensemble through the 1990s.
Early life
Tapscott was born in Houston, Texas, and moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of nine. By this time he had begun to study piano and trombone. He played with Frank Morgan, Don Cherry, and Billy Higgins as a teenager.
Later life and career
After service in the Air Force in Wyoming, he returned to Los Angeles and played trombone with various bands, notably Lionel Hampton (1959–61). Soon after, though, he quit playing trombone and focused on piano.
In 1961 Tapscott formed the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra, with the aim of preserving, developing and performing African-American music. As his vision grew, this became just one part of a larger organization in 1963, the Underground Musicians Association (UGMA), which later changed name to the Union of God's Musicians and Artists Ascension (UGMAA). Arthur Blythe, Stanley Crouch, Butch Morris, Wilber Morris, David Murray, Jimmy Woods, Nate Morgan and Guido Sinclair all performed in Tapscott's Arkestra at one time or another. Tapscott and his work are the subjects of the UCLA Horace Tapscott Jazz Collection.
Enthusiasts of his music formed two labels in the 1970s and 1980s, Interplay and Nimbus, for which he recorded.

Escadrille Spa.152 (originally Escadrille N.152) was a French fighter squadron active 1917 through 1918 during World War I. It was credited with destruction of 15 German airplanes, 27 observation balloons, and a Zeppelin.
History
Escadrille Spa.152 was formed under VII Armee auspices at Lyon-Bron, France on 9 July 1917. As a Nieuport fighter squadron, it was designated Escadrille N.152. In May 1918, the squadron refitted with SPAD fighters, and was renamed Escadrille Spa.152. On 4 June 1918, it was incorporated into a makeshift unit that became Groupe de Combat 22 on 1 July 1918. The Groupe was shifted about in its combat operations between three French field armies as the war ground down to its 11 November 1918 ceasefire. Final aerial victory credits for the squadron came to destruction of 15 enemy airplanes, 27 observation balloons, and a Zeppelin.

"Jug wine" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or "bulk wine") typically bottled in a glass bottle or jug.
Historically, jug wines were labeled semi-generically, often sold to third parties to be relabeled, or sold directly from the winery's tasting room to customers who would often bring their own bottles. For a period following Prohibition, jug wines were the only domestic wine available for most Americans. Beginning in the 1960s, when Americans began to consume more premium wine, jug wine took on a reputation for being "extreme value" (bargain-priced premium wine). Beginning in the late 1980s jug wines have increasingly been labeled varietally to meet consumer demand.
Common brands
Common brands include Gallo, Carlo Rossi, Almaden Vineyards, and Inglenook Winery. Typical formats include 750 ml and 1 liter glass bottles, as well as 3 and 5-liter jugs. More recent packaging methods include lined boxes, and plastic bags inside corrugated fiberboard boxes ("bag in a box").

Jonathan Philip Klein (1956-2016) was an American expert in dog training and behavior consultant based in Los Angeles.
Klein trained dogs for several decades. He began I Said Sit in 1988 as an in-home pet training service and later offered day-care and boarding for dogs; he expanded his service by networking to vets, groomers, pet stores and breeders. In 2016, his 5,000 square foot facility offered training, day-care for dogs, and both long and short term boarding. Klein trained more than 8,000 dogs during a period of 28 years. His I Said Sit service won numerous awards.
Klein advocated reward-based training. He did not believe in punishing the animals, but rather teaching wanted behaviors and rewarding them when they happened. Training should be based on "trust and cooperation" rather than fear or dominance or intimidation, according to Klein. He advocated that dogs and their owners should have a healthy "foundation of interaction" comparable to a supportive parent-child relationship. Dogs with separation anxiety or problems living alone can be helped by day-care, according to Klein. He advocated clicker training and hand signals as teaching methods. He liked to find out what things a dog wanted most, and then used that as a reward to encourage positive behavior; for example, in one instance, he found that a difficult Pomeranian valued her dog bed, and Klein used that as a reward. When a family has a new baby, he advocated a calm period of adjustment to get a dog and the baby used to each other, and continuing to give the pet the same attention as before.
Klein opposed surgical methods to remove or soften a dog's bark, sometimes known as debarking or devocalization. He saw debarking as a "quick fix" but which prevents a dog from communicating with humans or other animals, which can cause other long term problems.
Klein attended Phillips Academy in Andover from 1971-1973, graduated from Palisades Charter High School in 1974, and earned a BA from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1980. He was certified by the National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors, Inc, was a Certified Professional Dog Trainer - Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) by the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers, and a Certified Dog Behavior Consultant by the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. He wrote a blog entitled thedogbehaviorexpert.com and served as a legal advisor and expert witness in dog behavior cases.

Hinshelwood is a lunar crater located on the lunar near side near the lunar North Pole. The crater is located in between the large craters Peary and Hermite, just south of the pole. The crater was adopted and named after English chemist Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood by the IAU in 2009.
Hinshelwood is deformed, and its rim contains unique radial structures caused by the shockwave and gas cloud of the impact which created the crater. The southern rim of Hinshelwood, which points towards the lunar equator, receives a relatively high level of light, making it a potential landing site for future lunar exploration.

The Stoa of Eumenes was a Hellenistic colonnade built on the South slope of the Acropolis, Athens and which lay between the Theater of Dionysus and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus The gallery was donated to the city of Athens by the king of Pergamon, Eumenes II (197–159 BC), around 160 BC. Vitruvius makes reference to the building when speaking about the purpose of stoai erected near theatres that served as a refuge for the spectators in inclement weather conditions or as stores for theatre props.
History
The Stoa of Eumenes was constructed south of the Asklepieion staircase and the peripatos, on an artificial terrace of 9m x 13ms. To retain the pathway to the north an arched retaining wall was constructed along the northern edge of the site. Along this wall, the remains of which now dominate the site, the arcade was built. A substantial part of its northern wall, which is made from breccia and limestone and faced with Hymettian and Pentelic marble, is still preserved. Today, the ancient level of the stoa floor has been restored, with many of the pillars of the ground floor colonnade still in place. The foundations on which the arcade was built is located to the northwest of the Choragic Monument of Nikias and on the same level as the broad terrace in front of the stoa which is 32 m wide at its eastern end and 20 m west. To the south, it is bordered by a retaining wall, a considerable part of which has been preserved.
The arcade was two-storey, 163 m long and 17.65 m wide. The ground floor facade was formed by a colonnade with 64 Doric columns, while along the lengthwise axis of the building there was a second series of 32 columns of the Ionic order. On the upper storey, the exterior colonnade had the equivalent number of double-semicolumns of Ionic order and the interior columns had the rather rarer type of capitals, the Pergamene order. The two floors were connected externally by two stairs that formed at either end of the arcade. Viewers from the lower part of the theatre had access to the ground floor of the gallery through the western parodos The Stoa of Eumenes bears a great resemblance to the form of the Stoa of Attalos in the Ancient Agora of Athens erected by Eumenes' brother, Attalos II.
As a careful study of the fragmentary remains of the capitals and cornice showed that the building was for the most part made of a kind of island marble from which most of the buildings in Pergamon were built, while it is not found in other Athens buildings. Most of the architectural members of the arcade would likely have been built in Pergamon and shipped to Athens.
In the 2nd century AD, the western end of the Eumenes Stoa was connected to the Odeon of Herod Atticus by a staircase at the eastern end of its interior. The gallery was in use until the 3rd century AD, when it was destroyed and its material used in the construction of the Valerian wall. In the middle of the 13th century, the northern retaining wall of the arcade was incorporated into the Rizokastro Wall built around the Acropolis rock.
The ruins of the Stoa of Eumenes were uncovered by the Archaeological Society of Athens in the years 1877–78.

The Laurel–Rex Fire Company House, consisting of the Laurel Fire Company's engine house and the Rex Hook & Ladder Company's truck house, is a historic fire station located in York City, York County, Pennsylvania. The oldest building, the Laurel engine house, was built in 1878, and is a two-story, brick building in the Italianate style. The original engine house was expanded in 1887 with a horse stable and in 1892 with a ladder truck house. It has a three-story bell tower on the southwest corner and a second faux tower atop the roof on the northwest corner. It measures .
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
Laurel Engine House
On Thursday May 10, 1877, at a meeting of the Laurel Fire Company, the contract for the construction of the Laurel engine house was awarded to Philip H., Schnable and Harrison Stair for $6,780. Both men were active members of the fire company.
At the June 1877 meeting of the Laurel Fire Company, H.P. Schnable notified the Laurel that the firm of Schnable and Stair had been dissolved. By unanimous vote of the members in attendance the Laurel awarded the contract to build the engine house to Harrison Stair. Stair submitted his bond to the Laurel and a crew began tearing down the old building standing on the lot to prepare the lot for construction.
On Tuesday evening, July 24, 1877, a ceremonial laying of the cornerstone was held at the construction site for the Laurel engine house. The ceremony was opened with music from Professor Kissinger's Worth Infantry Band, followed by a prayer from Reverend J. O. Miller, D.D. James B. Ziegler, Esq., President of the Laurel Fire Company, delivered the address, followed by the laying of the cornerstone in place. Reverend Doctor Miller again addressed the crowd, and the band played again as the crowd dispersed.
On Saturday November 17, 1877, the Little General weather vane was relocated to the tower of the Laurel's new engine house.
On February 22, 1878, the new Laurel engine house was completed and occupied.
On Thursday May 2, 1878, the Laurel engine house was dedicated with a grand parade and a ceremony at the new engine house, followed by a banquet on the second floor of the fire station. At 9:00 p.m. a grand reception soiree was held in the hall on the second floor. Approximately 80 couples attended the dance.
The new Laurel engine house was situated on the northeast corner of South Duke Street and East King Street. The engine house was 33 feet wide on the Duke Street side, 80 feet on the King Street side, and had an open yard of 33 by 50 feet. The main building is 42 feet tall, and a tower, 12 feet square, stands 57 feet tall to the top of the brick work, with a wood belfry of 19.5 feet, atop which was a flag pole of 35.5 feet. The tower projects 24 inches from the main building on both sides. The building was painted a light stone color, with the hoods, quoins and cornice painted an imitation of brown sandstone. Two double doors enter the tower on the west and south sides, a double door was on the south side of the building near the southeast corner of the building, and on the east side a double door on the northern half opened into the yard. Mr. Beaton Smith was the architect.
On the interior of the building, on the ground floor was an apparatus room with 15 foot high ceilings, The walls were covered with plaster with a sand finish, laid off in courses of ashlar. The walls had four foot high wainscoting. Running down the center of the room was a girder supported by two Corinthian columns. Behind the apparatus room was a parlor or meeting room, 19.5 feet by 32 feet, separated from the apparatus room by a partition wall. The floor was covered by a Brussels carpet. At the rear of the parlor was a door leading to the lobby at the King Street exterior door, and a stairway led to the second floor from the lobby.
On the second floor, was a large hall, 30 by 70 feet with 18 foot ceilings. The walls were finished with a plaster cornice, and the ceiling had three plaster center pieces from which three chandeliers were to be hung. A small ante room in the tower provided access to a stage at the west end of the hall. At the east end of the hall was a small room that could serve as a cloakroom or dressing room.
Laurel Stables
In January 1886, the members of the Laurel erected horse stalls in the apparatus room for the purpose of acquiring horses for the company. By January 18, 1886, the Laurel had acquired a pair of iron-gray horses for use by the company. On Friday, March 12, 1886, the members of the Laurel agreed to purchase two large bay horses from Mr. Ben Kendig after testing the horses and finding them satisfactory.
On Thursday, March 11, 1886, the Laurel received permission to remove the columns running down the center of the apparatus room that support a beam in the ceiling, and to replace the columns with trusses, to make more room for using their newly acquired horses to pull the fire apparatus. The request was approved by the Town Council.
In late February 1887, the Laurel had built temporary stables onto the rear of the Engine house until permanent stables would be built around them. They also removed the horse stalls from the apparatus room of the engine house. The two arched doorways to the apparatus room on the front facade were replaced by a single rectangular doorway.
Rex Truck House
The first truck house for the Rex Hook and Ladder Company was built in the 100 block of East Market Street, and was occupied on Tuesday July 26, 1887. It was a frame building, 16 feet wide and 65 feet deep.
By 1891, the Rex was in need of new quarters. The truck house on East Market Street was too small, and could not be properly heated. The stable was without sufficient light or proper ventilation, and was damp. The horses contracted a chronic cough.
On July 7, 1891, the city passed an ordinance that, in part, authorized "six thousand, two hundred and fifty dollars; -for the erection of a building on South Duke Street, on lot adjoining the Laurel Fire Company building, for the use of the Rex Hook and Ladder Company", Common Council Bill No. 28, authorizing the building of a truck house for the Rex Hook and Ladder Company passed on August 10, 1891. The Select Council passed the bill on September 1, 1891.
At a meeting of the Fire Committee on September 3, 1891, plans submitted by architect Dempwolf were accepted by the committee, and a notice to contractors to bid was approved. The truck house would be 21 feet wide, with a truck room 56 feet deep and stables 24 feet deep. The front was designed to look as a continuation of the Laurel engine house, and a small turret on the roof to conform with the laurel's tower.
Four contractors submitted bids to construct the building. The Fire Committee awarded the contract to Jacob Seachrist & Son for $3,300. Work was expected to commence the following week.
The first meeting of the Rex Hook & Ladder Company in their new home was held on Wednesday, February 24, 1892. Two double doors and a small entrance door opened into the apparatus room, 60 feet long and 19 feet wide. The walls and ceiling were of a block sanded finish, and were wainscoted on the first floor. At the rear, an arch traversing the width of the apparatus room leads to the horse stalls, with two stalls and the ability to add a third stall. The stables were 20 feet deep.
On the second floor was the meeting room or parlor, 52 feet long, 19 feet wide and 19 feet high, the walls and ceiling finished in white. The room was prepared to have two sets of chandeliers installed. To the rear of the hall was the driver's room, a small room for the department's alarm battery, and a passage to the roof.
On Memorial Day, Monday May 30, 1892, the Rex truck house was officially dedicated, along with the dedication of the Rex's new Hayes aerial ladder truck and the Laurel's new LaFrance steam fire engine. A parade was held upon the streets of York, followed by a demonstration of the Rex's new Hayes aerial ladder truck in the square, and a banquet later that evening in the Laurel engine house. The dedication ceremony, originally planned to take place in the morning prior to the parade, was postponed due to rain and conducted after the banquet that evening.
Changes To The Buildings
On May 17, 1883, during a regular meeting of the Laurel Fire Company, an order of $8.00 was granted to F. H. Heckert for the installation of a bathroom in the engine house.
On August 5, 1884, during a regular meeting of the Laurel Fire Company, a motion is passed authorizing the installation of electric lights in the engine house. Lights were installed by 1886.
In the fall of 1893, the facade of the Rex was altered to enlarge the bay door. The small entrance door was removed from the front of the building.
In March and April 1895, carpenters remodeled the rear of the Laurel engine house. The second floor above the horse stalls was raised several feet, and a section of the second floor, 15 by 20 feet was partitioned off to provide a sleeping room for the drivers.
In July 1895, Spangler Brothers, contractors and builders of East York, completed renovations to the Rex truck house. Most of the wood work on the first floor was replaced, including rotten and decaying flooring and joists. The stables were set back even with the Laurel's engine house, enlarging the apparatus room by twenty feet. A large skylight was placed over the stables.
In 1906, the Laurel engine house was outfitted to be heated by steam.
On Friday December 20, 1907, the Rex Hook and Ladder Company was instructed by the Fire Committee not to respond to fire calls with the exception of a large fire in the business section of the city. The condition of the flooring in the Rex was so bad that the horses were to be carefully walked outside, the apparatus pulled out of the station by hand, and the horses hitched to the ladder truck outside to respond to a fire. A new asphalt floor was not completed until Monday, January 20, 1908. The Rex ladder truck was stored in a temporary frame and canvas structure erected on Duke Street until the floor was completed.
In January 1914, the stables of the Laurel engine house were being renovated, and a new wood block flooring was being laid in the stables. The horses were temporarily quartered in the Keystone stables at Queen and King Streets. The Laurel would be delayed in answering alarms as they had to bring the horses back to the engine house to answer alarms.
In July 1940, a new frame belfry was constructed on top of the tower of the Laurel station. The belfry was painted a cream color, and the wrought iron work was re-attached to the top. The Little General weather vane was also returned to the top of the tower. The work was performed by a crew of Works Progress Administration (WPA) workers. New window sills and a new exterior paint job followed that summer.
On Monday, March 11, 1957, city workers cut a doorway between the Laurel and Rex fire stations. Prior to that, firemen would have to walk around the exterior of the building to go from one station to the other.
Fires and Other Incidents
On Wednesday, March 13, 1912, at about 5:45 p.m., an electric wire running to the tower of the Laurel engine house snagged on a guard of the Rex truck house, causing a fire on the roof of the Rex station. A hole of about 4 inches in diameter was burned in the roof.
On Thursday June 19, 1913, at about 10:15 p.m. fire was discovered in the frame hayloft located to the rear of the stables of the Laurel and Rex fire houses. The fire started in the floor area of the Rex loft, at the north end of the structure, among the bailed hay and loose straw. The fire extended to a frame back building at 117 East King Street. Lost in the fire was six tons of hay, seven tons of straw, a number of ladders, hay forks, stable tools and about $1,000 worth of fire hose.
On the evening of Wednesday April 2, 1919, a chimney fire occurred at the Laurel station. Accumulated soot in the chimney was ignited by heat from the steam plant. The Laurel firemen extinguished the fire.
On Tuesday August 26, 1924, at 8:24 p.m. Laurel Driver Edward Kroll was in front of the station when the apparatus room lights got unusually bright, and then the power went out. Kroll saw that the lights in the adjoining Rex station were still lit. Just then a man came running to the station to report that the building was on fire. Fireman John "Gummy" Blymire was ill with heart disease and was sleeping in the bedroom when he awoke to smoke filling the room. Driver Kroll saw flames shooting from the windows of the tower, and sounded the alarm. He then pulled out the Laurel's rig and began to fight the fire. The fire damaged the tower, including a number of items being stored in the tower. The fire, caused by a short circuit, caused several thousand dollars in damage. The Laurel, Vigilant Union, Rescue and Rex fire companies responded. Fireman Paul Kennedy received a hand injury while fighting the fire.
On Wednesday October 1, 1947, shortly after noon, a fire was discovered on the roof of the Rex truck house. Workmen from the General Roofing Company had just broken for lunch, as they were in the process of replacing the roof on the Rex station. The fire was extinguished in several minutes and the damage was negligible.
On Wednesday, July 1, 1987, at about 6:00 p.m. the flag pole atop the tower of the Laurel engine house was struck by lightning. The 35 foot fir pole was split in half, with a section the size of a two-by-four falling to the street.

Rembrandt's Wife is a chamber opera composed by Andrew Ford with libretto by Sue Smith.
It explores the relationships of Dutch artist Rembrandt with three women: the death of his wife Saskia, the madness of his former lover Geertje Dircx and his muse to be, Hendrickje Stoffels. Smith was inspired to write the opera when, at an exhibition of the artist's etchings, she learned that he sold the burial plot and headstone of his wife.
Victorian Opera premiered the work at the CUB Malthouse, Melbourne in April 2009, conducted by Richard Gill.
For Rembrandt's Wife, Ford and Smith received a Melbourne Green Room Award for New Australian Opera. Smith's libretto received the AWGIE Award for Music Theatre in 2010.

The George Washington House, or Indian Queen Tavern, is located at Baltimore Avenue, at Upshur Street, in Bladensburg, Prince George's County, Maryland. It was constructed in the 1760s. The -story structure is constructed of brick Flemish bond on ends. The plan is rectangular, with a gabled roof, exterior end chimneys, gabled shingled dormers. There are first and second-story center entrances, each with a transom. There is a full-width one-story porch with balustraded deck and side entrances. The structure includes a later two-story rear addition. The structure is Georgian.
It represents the last remnant of a social and commercial complex established in the 1760s by Jacob Wirt, whose son William Wirt later became U.S. Attorney General and an 1832 presidential candidate. The Indian Queen Tavern gained its reputation as the "George Washington House" through an assumption that "George Washington slept here." Research in primary sources has shown that the extant structure was never a tavern during Washington's lifetime, although it is possible that he stayed in the frame Indian Queen Tavern formerly located next to the present structure. The brick tavern began to be known as the "George Washington House" before 1878 when it was being used as a hotel. The structure also housed Jacob Coxey's "army" of unemployed during an 1894 march on Washington, D.C. to demand relief. It now serves as headquarters for the Anacostia Watershed Society.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

José María Andrés Fernando Lezama Lima (December 19, 1910 – August 9, 1976) was a Cuban writer, poet and essayist. He is considered one of the most influential figures in Cuban and Latin American literature. His novel Paradiso is one of the most important works in Spanish and one of the best novels of the 20th Century according to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo.
Lezama is a prominent referent of American Neo-Baroque literature. He created a mature poetic system characterized by its lyricism. His work features a wide variety of metaphors, allusions and allegories which he developed in essays such as Analecta del reloj (1953), La expresión americana (1957), Tratados en La Habana (1958) o La cantidad hechizada (1970).
Biography
Born in the Columbia Military Encampment close to Havana in the city of Marianao where his father was a colonel, Lezama lived through some of the most turbulent times of Cuba's history, fighting against the Machado dictatorship. His literary output includes the semi-autobiographical, baroque novel Paradiso (1966), the story of a young man and his struggles with his mysterious illness, the death of his father, and his developing sensuality and poetic sensibilities. Lezama Lima also edited several anthologies of Cuban poetry and the magazines Verbum and Orígenes, presiding as the patriarch of Cuban letters for most of his later years.
Lezama Lima spent little time outside of his home country, making a trip to Mexico in 1949 and Jamaica in 1950). Nevertheless, Lezama's poetry, essays and two novels draw images and ideas from a vast array of world cultures and historical time periods. The Baroque style that he forged relied equally upon his Góngora-influenced syntax and his stunning constellations of unlikely images, which often drew from Ancient Chinese and Egyptian philosophical texts and mythological narratives. Lezama Lima's first published work, the long poem "Muerte de Narciso," brought him national acclaim at the age of twenty-seven and established his well-wrought style and classical subject matter.
In addition to his poems and novels, Lezama wrote many essays on figures of world literature such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Valéry, Góngora and Rimbaud as well as on Latin American baroque aesthetics. Most notably the essays published as La Expresión Americana lay out his vision of the European baroque, its relation to the classical, and the American baroque.
Lezama Lima died in 1976 at age 65 and was buried in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. He was influential for Cuban and Puerto Rican writers of his generation and the next, such as Virgilio Piñera, Reinaldo Arenas, Fernando Velázquez Medina, René Marqués, and Giannina Braschi, who depict his life and works in their writing.

Mehlville High School is a public comprehensive high school in Mehlville, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Mehlville R-9 School District.
History
The school and surrounding community is named after Charles Mehl, a German-born contractor, whose family moved into a rural area a few miles south of St. Louis. He was given a land-grant in 1846 to acknowledge his service in the Mexican-American War.
Mehlville High School was first established in 1925 after parents demanded local secondary education for their children. Previously, teens in the Mehlville-Oakville area had to commute to Hancock or Kirkwood. The school was first housed at the old St. John's School on Will Avenue, across the street from the school's current site. Mehlville's first graduating class (Class of 1930) consisted of just two students. In 1939, the school moved across the street to a small two-story building at 3100 Lemay Ferry Road. It was rumored that the building was constructed on the site of an old gyspy camp. To handle the rapidly growing student body, the current building was built adjacent to the previous one in 1955.
Both of the old school buildings still stand. St. John's School sat dormant for many years, but it was eventually renovated and reopened as MOSAIC in 2017. The second building (now known as the Witzel Learning Center) served as a junior high school from 1955 until 1974, when Margaret Buerkle Middle School was built. After that, it housed the district's Early Childhood program. It is currently home to SCOPE, an alternative education program, and some district offices, including the IT department. The building is set to be demolished in the near future, with SCOPE and the district offices being moved elsewhere off-campus. What will replace the Witzel Learning Center currently remains unknown.
The school's original colors were maroon and gold, but they were changed in 1940 because the old color scheme looked similar to Affton High School's colors and there was concern "it would cause confusion on the court and field" Today's colors are green and white, often accented with black or grey.
Since the current school building was constructed, it has been renovated on numerous occasions, starting with the renovation of 1957, when the school built on a gymnasium and cafeteria. A couple years later, in 1962, a second gymnasium and home economics rooms were added (Gymnasiums at the time were sex segregated; the Boy's Gymnasium was the older gym and the Girl's Gymnasium was the newer gym). In 1970 the school built a new library and drama center.
The renovation in 1993 added the commons area, with a new entrance to the main gymnasium (Gym A), as well 12 science classroom labs. The front of the school was rebuilt in the early 2000s, and the William Nottelman auditorium, built adjacent to the school, was opened in 2013.
In summer 2022, the district will use the money given from Proposition S to renovate the school further, including security renovations to the main entrance, adding new classrooms, renovating the school's football stadium and other athletic facilities, and demolishing/rebuilding parts of the school that are aging and/or deteriorating.
One of the school's most notable achievements was the 1999 Class 5A State Championship in football. The team had an 13-1 overall record. This is the school's only state championship in football, although students have won numerous other state championships in other sports throughout Mehlville's almost 100 year history.
In late 2021, the Mehlville Student Leadership team held an online poll among the student body to determine a name for the school's panther mascot, seen at Mehlville football games greeting students and cheering on the team. Of all the potential names listed on the poll, "Mehlvin the Panther" was the most popular and well-received. The name was revealed on March 17, 2022.
Student Body
Mehlville has a co-educational student body of 1,563 in the 2021-22 school year. Most students originate from Margaret Buerkle Middle School in Mehlville, with a majority of the rest coming from Washington Middle School in Concord. A handful of students are alumni of Bernard Middle School in North Oakville as well. The racial makeup of the school is approximately 77% White, 10% Black, 5% Asian, and 5% Hispanic.
A large percentage of the student body is of Bosnian descent (the Greater St. Louis area is home to the largest Bosnian population outside of Europe.)
Athletics/Activities
For the 2013–2014 school year, the school offered 26 activities approved by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA): baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, sideline cheerleading, boys' and girls' cross-country, dance team, 11-man football, boys' and girls' golf, Marching Band, Pep Band, scholar bowl, boys' and girls' soccer, softball, speech and debate, boys' and girls' swimming and diving, boys' and girls' tennis, boys' and girls' track and field, boys' and girls' volleyball, water polo, and wrestling.
School-sponsored activities include Art Club, Book Club, Broadcast Journalism, Culture Club, DECA (marketing), Drama Club, FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), FCCLA, French Club, German Club, International Thespian Society, Mehlville Majorettes, National Honor Society, Spanish Club, STEP, Student Council, Student Prints, Teenage Health Consultant Program, The Reflector yearbook, and Color Guard (part of the Marching Band).

The Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce is a bilateral trade and investment organization that promotes commerce and investment between Romania and United States, and is headquartered in Washington D.C. The Chamber is composed of both Romanian and American businesses and has active chapters in New York, Washington, D.C., Florida, California and the Mid-West. It was founded in February 1990 and is celebrating its 20th year of activity in 2010. The RACC conducts a broad range of events, activities, and services and is a member organization of the Bi-National European Chambers of Commerce of the United States, which includes most of the bilateral chambers of the major EU member states.
History
Shortly after the Romanian revolution of December 1989, a group of American business leaders and professionals led by Mark A. Meyer met to discuss the formation of a bilateral trade association dedicated to the development of prosperous business relationships between Romania and the United States. Initial members included representatives of major US firms, such as IBM, Coca-Cola, Deloitte & Touche, Chemical Bank, Colgate-Palmolive, Caterpillar, ConAgra and General Electric, as well as smaller import export companies. In February 1990 they organized the Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce (RACC).
The Ambassadorial Advisory Board of the Romanian American Chamber of Commerce™ was formed in 2013 and is composed of the living former U.S. Ambassadors to Romania and the former Romanian Ambassadors to the United States and United Nations. It is chaired by former U.S. Ambassador, Senator James C. Rosapepe, and its members include former U.S. Ambassadors to Romania John R. Davis, Alfred Moses, Michael Guest and Mark Gitenstein, and former Romanian Ambassadors Mircea Geoană, Sorin Ducaru, Ion Gorita, Alexandru Niculescu and Mihnea Motoc. Among its functions, the Ambassadorial Advisory Board holds webinars for the public to discuss current issues in U.S.-Romanian relations and each year, the RACC holds an annual dinner in the Advisory Board's honor at which the Armand Scala Prize is awarded.

August Heinrich Hermann von Dönhoff (10 October 1797 in Potsdam - 1 April 1874 at Schloss Friedrichstein (East Prussia)) was a Prussian diplomat.
Dönhoff participated as a volunteer in the campaign of 1815, studied in Königsberg, Göttingen and Heidelberg in 1816-1819 and then travelled to Italy. He began his diplomatic career in 1821 at the Prussian Foreign Ministry in Berlin, was then employed in the embassies in Paris in 1823, in Madrid in 1825, and in London in 1828, where he played a significant role in the conference on Belgium. In 1833 he was made an envoy in Munich, and in 1842 became the envoy to the Bundestag in Frankfurt am Main.
In May 1848 he resigned, but was made Foreign Minister of Prussia in early September 1848 in the government of Ernst von Pfuel, a position he only held for a short time however. Then in February 1849 he was elected by the second electoral district of Gumbinnen to the first chamber of the Prussian Parliament, which sent him in 1850 to Erfurt, into the Staatenhaus (the chamber of the Erfurt Union parliament that represented the individual states). He was once again elected a member of the Prussian first chamber in the summer of 1850, and joined the moderate right-wing Partei Jordan. In 1851 he became a member of the Landtag of the Province of Prussia, and participated in its session from 1851 to 1852 in Berlin. When the Prussian first chamber became the Prussian House of Lords, the King made him a hereditary member. In 1861 he became the grand-master of the wardrobe at court. He died in April 1874.
His aunt Sophie von Dönhoff was the wife of Frederick Wilhelm II.

The Church of God for All Nations is a theocratic Pentecostal holiness body of Christians.
Samuel Doffee (February 2, 1931 – April 23, 2010), formed The Church of God for All Nations in 1981. Doffee had been previously associated with the Church of God of Prophecy and The Church of God (Jerusalem Acres), and served in various ministerial capacities in the latter body. Bishop Grady R. Kent founded The Church of God of All Nations (now "Jerusalem Acres") in 1957. After settling on the name "The Church of God of All Nations", Bishop Kent was persuaded by other in the Church Pattern to change the name to The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres.
After the death of Kent in 1964, the church governance gradually moved away from "theocratic" rule through the "Chief Bishop", toward a more democratic rule through the General Assembly. Bishop Doffee continued to preach what he believed was the prophetic message of Bishop Kent, as well as "theocratic" church government, and was disfellowshipped by the Church of God (Jerusalem Acres). In 1980, Doffee believed he was instructed by prophecy to reorganize the Church of God, and chartered the new church in 1981.
The doctrines of The Church of God for All Nations are similar to its parent body, with greater emphasis on theocracy and prophecy. Individuals must experience salvation, justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is marked by the evidence of speaking in tongues. Divine healing, miracles, and deliverance from evil spirits are considered present-day ministries. Officers in the church are apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. This group believes very explicitly that the "Great Apostasy" began in AD 325 with the Council of Nicaea and continued until June 13, 1903, when Bishop Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson restored the Church, and that in the interim there was no actual theocratic governmental formed (as Jesus formed it) Church of God upon the earth, but that born-again people were abundant and continued to be "saved" or "born again" according to the Bible.
The Midnight Cry Messenger is the official church publication. Headquarters of the church are in Cleveland, Tennessee. Samuel Doffee served as Chief Bishop until his death on April 23, 2010. This body has one church in the United States and about five churches in Kenya, Africa. The Bishop of Africa is Justus Masika Khisa, and the African offices are being built in Bungoma, Kenya.

In Hawaiian mythology, Nāmaka (or Nā-maka-o-Kahai, the eyes of Kahai) appears as a sea goddess in the Pele family. She is an older sister of Pele-honua-mea.
She is the daughter of Ku-waha-ilo and Haumea, whose other children are Pele, the Hiʻiaka sisters, the Kama brothers, and the bird Halulu. Aukelenuiaiku becomes Namaka's husband in Kahiki, but then later the husband of Pele, and because of this Pele, the Hiiaka sisters, Malulani, and Kaʻōhelo migrate to Hawaii. When Pele quarrels with her powerful sister Namaka, Namaka sends tidal waves to destroy Pele's lands and homes. Helped by her family, Pele fights Namaka, but Namaka defeats her.
In Thrum's Kane-huna-moku myth Nāmaka is called the chiefess of the Mu and Menehune people when they are summoned to build the watercourse for Kikiaola at Waimea on Kauai (Beckwith 1970:193, 495).
When Pele causes a conflagration by staying too close to the fire god Lono-makua, Nāmaka drives her away (Beckwith 1970:170). Another legend mentions that Nāmaka's guardian dog, Moela is reduced to ashes when he touches Aukele (Beckwith 1970:348).
Moon
Namaka, the smaller moon of the dwarf planet Haumea, is named after the goddess.

The Sumatran clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi diardi) is a subspecies of the Sunda clouded leopard and is native to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Batu. It differs in molecular, craniomandibular and dental characteristics from the Bornean clouded leopard. It was recognized as a valid subspecies in 2017.
Distribution and habitat
It was recorded in Sumatra's Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks.
Evolution
The Sumatran clouded leopard is estimated to have diverged from the Bornean clouded leopard in the Late Pleistocene, between 400 and 120 thousand years ago. Land bridges that were created due to low sea levels in the Late Pleistocene were submerged by rising sea levels, resulting in the Sumatran clouded leopard becoming separated from the mainland population at this time.

Tiout (Arabic: تيوت) is a municipality in Naâma Province, Algeria. It is part of the district of Aïn Séfra and has a population of 3,161, which gives it 11 seats in the PMA. Its postal code is 45210 and its municipal code is 4504.
The origin of the word Tiout, is Amazigh. It is the plural of "tout" which means source.
Tiout is located on the Saharan Atlas ksour mounts, 10 km east of Aïn Sefra as an extension of RN 47, between Djebel Aïssa to the North West, Djebel Djara and Djebel Mekter to the South.
Tiout is located 40 km from the thermal station Ain Ouarka, 45 km from the tower (qalaa) of Chikh Bouamama, 40 km from Sfessefa, 70 km from Boussemghoun , and 50 km from Aasla. It has an average altitude of 1000m.
Tiout covers an area of 789.25 km² and counts at the end of 2008 a population of 6657 inhabitants. The area is famous for its rock carvings. It has more than 54 stations.
Geography
The fact that Tiout is surrounded by mountains gives it a microclimate with a temperature that does not exceed 38 degrees. There are ten days of freezing a year.
Tiout is characterized by its Oued.
Oasis
The oasis of Tiout has an area of 220 hectares. It has 71 varieties of dates including Fegous and Aghras.
Tiout dam
The Tiout dam is considered to be the first dam made in Africa (before 1300). Built of lime and stone, it is fed by a flow of rainwater from the two oases of Moghrar and Oued Rhaouiba. Since the drilling, water has become scarce in the dam.
Ksar of Tiout
The ksar of Tiout dates from 9 centuries. It was built on the outskirts of Ouedi Tiout on a plate that overlooks the stream with an average vertical drop of 8 m, which allows it to be protected from the raw. It is built in rocks extracted from Djbel Aïssa, palm derivatives (trunks, palms), clay as well as aggregates drained by the , on a surface which approximates 27,000m2. Its development is from the bottom, near sources and gardens, to the top.
The ksar has three doors: Bab Sid Ahmed Ben Youcef, Bab Hlel (moon in English, the moon was observed by this door to announce the beginning of the Hegirian month), and Bab El Khmer. Two lead outwards and the third leads to the palm grove.
Women roamed the rooftops and terraces throughout the city while men moved through the alleys.
The Ksar had its own 3-century old Hammam, heated by a wood fire. The day reserved for women and the evening for men. The presence of public toilets dates back to 9 centuries. The alleys of ksar note aeration every 20 meters.
The Ksar has a mosque that dates back more than 4 centuries, with the particularity of the absence of minaret (Berber construction of the time of the Morabites dynasty).
The ksar was self-sufficient. He had in particular his ironworker (mainly producing agricultural tools). This one was paid in barter (fruits and vegetables).
The ksar is surrounded by an oasis. The presence of a tunnel served to carry water from the oases to the city during the wars.
Drinking water supply
The ksar of Tiout is equipped with three water supply processes: a secondary seguia of drinking water connected to the main seguia which crosses the ; a direct feed from a very high flow source called Ain Messaoud; two wells dug inside the ksar for domestic needs.
Irrigation of the palm grove of the ksar
A system of two dams in series is used for the irrigation of the palm grove. A seguia with a length of 2 km arrives at the palm grove and the gardens. Collective located at the highest point of the palm grove, store water and distribute it among farmers by the time division method.
In addition, two types of traditional wells have been introduced: the balance well for a depth of 3 to 6 meters, and animal traction for a depth of up to 20 m.
Communities
Tiout has 2 communities: the Amazighs inside the ksar, and the Arabs around the ksar.
The Amazigh community is run by the tajmâat (which means council or group), the Arab community is managed by the Sheikh (the old sage). The tajmâat and the sheikh are the authorities who organize the life and decisions of the communities.
Languages
The languages spoken in Tiout are Arabic and the Amazigh dialect "Znati".

Amman Civil Airport (), commonly known as Marka International Airport, is an unscheduled airport located in Marka district, Greater Amman Municipality, Jordan, some north-east of Amman city centre.
After being the city's main airport from 1950 until 1983, there are no scheduled commercial passenger flights at the airport anymore. However, it still serves as Amman's main airport for general aviation, and moreover as an aviation education and training hub, and also sees freight operations. It serves as the home base for Arab Wings and Jordan International Air Cargo, additionally the Jordan Airports Company is headquartered here.
History
The airport was founded in 1950 by the British as a joint military civilian airport. It was the main airport for Jordan until Queen Alia International Airport was opened in 1983.
In 2009, Jordan Airports Company officially assumed managerial and operational responsibility for Amman Civil Airport. The company is also entrusted with the development of 8,000 Dunums around Queen Alia International Airport. In coordination with international specialised consultants, the company has prepared a comprehensive master plan for Amman Civil Airport, which includes several capital projects. The company began the implementation of the first phase of the master plan to develop the facilities at Marka Airport. From 2012, several infrastructure and air side projects to modernise the airport had been implemented.
Accidents
On 9 September 1956, a Jordan International Airlines Curtiss C-46A-45-CU Commando, registration JY-ABV, crashed into a downhill near the airport while trying to make an emergency landing following mechanical failures during climb out. The plane caught fire and all on board, but 1 passenger, survived the accident.
On 22 January 1959, Air Jordan Flight 601, a Convair Convair CV-240-2 registration JY-ACB, crashed 2.8 mls Northwest of Wadi-es-Sir while approaching the airport in adverse weather conditions. All 5 crew members and 6 of the 11 passengers died in the accident making it the worst civilian plane crash on Jordanian soil. The cause was determined as the pilot's decision to fly below the minimum prescribed altitude to make visual contact with the ground in adverse weather conditions.
On 30 June 1973, Aeroflot Armenia Flight 512, a Tupolev 134A registration CCCP-65668, overshot the runway and hit a house during takeoff from the airport, killing 2 crew members and 7 people from the building, the other 5 crew members and 78 passengers survived. The cause was determined as the crew's decision to abort the take off at a speed of 265 km/h because the captain had the impression that the speed dropped due to the failure of one engine.
On 23 September 1977, a Learjet 36A operated by Arab Wings, registration JY-AFC, impacted the ground in an inverted position on hard ground approximately 8 feet north of the parallel taxiway due to fuel imbalance during takeoff. All 4 on board were killed.

Sin Piedad (2019) (Spanish for "No Mercy") was a major professional wrestling event produced by the Mexican Lucha Libre promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The Sin Piedad show took place on January 1, 2019, in Arena México, Mexico City, Mexico. The 2019 Sin Piedad was the 14th event under the Sin Piedad name and the Fourth year in a row CMLL has held the show on New Year's Day.
Production
Background
The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Piedad ("No Pity" or "No Mercy"). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their "end of the year" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its "home". The 2018 Sin Piedad was the third first show to be held on New Year's Day after being held on the same day in 2016 and 2017.
Starting in 2011 CMLL has been promoting a New Year's Day show with bigger, more prominent and promoted matches, although they did not specifically promote the shows under a special event name, they were simply a special version of their weekly Arena Mexico shows. Starting in 2011 CMLL added at least one high-profile match to their shows, slowly building them into a special event. in 2011 the show featured the annual Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament, won by Ángel de Oro. In 2012 the January 1 show saw Hombre Bala Jr. and Super Halcón Jr. defeated the team known as Los Rayos Tapatío in a Luchas de Apuestas, masks vs masks match in what turned out to be Los Rayos last match in CMLL. The main event of the 2012 was the finals of a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship which was El Terrible defeat Rush 17th heavyweight champion. The 2013 start of the year show was highlighted first by then CMLL World Welterweight Champion Pólvora successfully defending against Titán and then the team of Boby Zavala and Disturbio defeated Leono and Tigre Blanco, forcing Leono and Blanco to have their hair shaved off as a result. The 2014 show, the last January 1 show without a specific title saw Super Halcón Jr. win that year's [[La Copa Junior#<|La Copa Junior]] tournament. The 2019 Sin Piedad show was the 14th show under the Sin Piedad label.
Storylines
The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

is a shrine located in Kashima City, Saga Prefecture. It is one of the most famous Inari shrines in Japan.
History
Dedicated to Inari, the kami whose messengers are foxes, it is the third largest of its kind in Japan. It was constructed in 1688 as the family shrine of the Nabeshima clan who ruled what would become the Saga area (called Hizen at that time) during the Edo period. It was built to the Inari kami of the harvest by a princess from Kyoto named Manko Hime (萬子媛) who married Nabeshima Naotomo. The Nabeshima clan was entrusted with protecting Edo's interests in Kyūshū, in particular the city of Nagasaki, which was one of the few ports open to foreign contact during Japan's period of isolation.
The shrine is also popular for new year celebrations and is very crowded during the first two weeks of January.

Juan de Mairena (sentencias, donaires, apuntes y recuerdos de un profesor apócrifo) is a book written in prose by the Spanish author Antonio Machado in 1936 and published by Espasa Calpe.
Plot
An imaginary teacher and his students analyse the society, the culture, the art, the literature, the politics and the philosophy by the paradox, the adage, the erudition, the introspection, the rhetoric and the spoonerism.
Analysis
The appearance of Juan de Mairena is like Antonio Machado at his 33 years in 1898. The book was originally signed as a heteronym work.
Based on the discovery of some poems to Guiomar supposedly prior to the date when Machado and Pilar met, conclude that Guiomar is but another of Machado's apocryphal imaginaries, such as Abel Martín or Juan de Mairena.

Birte Stenbak née Jensen (born 1938) is a Danish goldsmith and jeweller. After an apprenticeship with Poul Bang in the 1950s, she worked in Bent Stålgård's workshop. In 1975, together with her friend Birthe Jørgensen, she established a studio and shop in central Copenhagen, where she created imaginative jewellery consisting of gemstones, silver, gold, pearls and other materials. From 1983, she ran the business alone in what became known as Aladdin's Cave. Collaborating with the artist Tage Andersen, in 1988 she created a large table decoration for Rosenborg Castle. Since the mid-1970s, her work has been exhibited at home and abroad.
Biography
Born on 10 February 1938 in Roskilde, was the daughter of the antiques dealer Arnold Jensen (1911–1987) and his wife Henny Marie née Bøgeholdt. On 19 August 1960, she married the schoolteacher Erik S, Pedersen with whom she had a son, Jesper, in 1964. The marriage was dissolved in 1972. As a young woman, she was exceptionally energetic, engaging in car racing with her brother and hiking in the Himalayas.
In 1954, she began an apprenticeship with the silversmith Poul Bang. On completing her training in 1959, she was awarded the silver medal for her competence as an artisan. She then worked as a jeweller with Bent Stålgård until 1972, after which she took a two-year course in experimental design at the Goldsmiths' College in Copenhagen (1973–75). While there, she was a co-founder of the creative group known as May Be which exhibited in the Gammel Strand Gallery.
In 1975, together with her friend Birthe Jörgensen, she established B & B, a studio and shop in Copenhagen's Gothersgade opposite Rosenborg Have. Although the two worked in quite different styles, they complemented each other, Jørgensen adopting a more traditional approach while Stenbak created far more exotic and imaginative pieces. In 1983, Jørgensen left the partnership to participate in her family's hotel business, leaving Stenbak to run the business alone until 1996. Her shop became generally known as Aladdins Hule or Aladdin's Cave. In the 1980s, she collaborated with the flower-painting artist Tage Andersen, exhibiting her work in his shop on Kongens Nytorv. In 1988, the two created a stunning table decoration for Rosenborg Castle in connection with an exhibition related to King Christian IV.
Stenbak has exhibited in Denmark's Design Museum, the Geological Museum, Rosenborg Castle, Marienlyst Castle and in Antwerp's Diamond Museum.

KGFK (1590 AM, "Rock 95") is a radio station broadcasting a classic rock format. Licensed to East Grand Forks, Minnesota, it serves the Grand Forks, North Dakota metropolitan area. The station also broadcasts on translators K239BG (95.7 FM, "Rock 95") in Grand Forks and K248DH (97.5 FM, "Rock 95") in East Grand Forks. It first began broadcasting in 1959 under the call sign KRAD and used the call sign KCNN for several years. The station is currently owned by Leighton Broadcasting, and competes with iHeartMedia's active rock 107.5 KJKJ "KJ108" and classic hits KQHT "96.1 The Fox".
History
KCNN days
KGFK/1590 previously aired a news/talk format as KCNN, and starting focusing on nationally syndicated talk shows after being bought by Leighton Broadcasting in 2003 to differentiate with co-owned KNOX.
Rooster and Fox Sports
On September 27, 2007, KCNN continued KNOX-FM/94.7's classic country as "The Rooster", as KNOX-FM/94.7 flipped to classic rock. Because of popularity, Rush Limbaugh was still syndicated on weekdays at normal time.
On August 14, 2009, KCNN flipped to a sports format featuring programming from Fox Sports Radio, and competed with FAN Network affiliate KKXL-AM/1440.
Rock to "The Forks"
On November 5, 2010, KCNN changed their format to mainstream rock, branded as "Rock 107.9" (frequency in branding is for FM translator K300BG 107.9 FM Grand Forks, ND), primarily competing with active rock formatted KJKJ "KJ108" just down the dial at 107.5 FM. K300BG signed on the air just days before the format flip. Before K300BG's sign on, Fargo-based classic rock station KPFX "107.9 The Fox" could sometimes be heard in Grand Forks. On February 21, 2011, KCNN changed their call letters to KGFK.
On October 11, 2011, translator K239BG 95.7 FM signed on to resolve 107.9's signal issues. 95.7 originally began as an unbuilt translator in Grafton that was purchased by Leighton Broadcasting and moved to Grand Forks (107.9 was also an unbuilt translator purchased by Leighton). 95.7's transmitter is located near the junction of U.S. Highway 81 (North Washington Street) and U.S. Highway 2 (Gateway Drive) near downtown Grand Forks. 107.9's transmitter is located off 32nd Ave South west of the I-29 interchange. On October 27, 2011, KGFK changed its branding to "Rock 95.7" as the signal is much stronger than 107.9
After 95.7 signed on, the station began simulcasting "Zac Daniel in the Morning" from sister station KZGF "Z94.7" during weekday morning hours.
On January 5, 2011, KGFK began stunting with replays of "Zac Daniel in the Morning". On January 9, 2011, the station flipped to an adult hits format playing pop and rock hits from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s to the present. On January 11, 2012, 107.9 FM broke up with 95.7 FM and 1590 AM as it switched to become a translator of KNOX-AM/1310.
On March 12, 2018, KGFK changed their format to classic rock, still branded as "The Forks".
On September 17, 2018, KGFK rebranded as "Rock 95".
In May 2021, second FM translator K248DH 97.5 FM in East Grand Forks–Grand Forks signed on for better rural coverage from the KZLT/KZGF transmitter tower, including coverage of Crookston, while K239BG 95.7 FM continues to cover the immediate Grand Forks–East Grand Forks area.
KGFK also broadcasts Minnesota Twins baseball and local high school sports. KGFK successfully competes with iHeartMedia's heritage active rock KJKJ/107.5 "KJ108" and classic hits KQHT "96.1 The Fox" for the lucrative upper demographics in Grand Forks and continues to do so.

Narrabundah () (postcode: 2604) is a leafy, medium density suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, located in the inner south of the city.
Narrabundah is an established garden suburb, valued for its equal proximity to both Civic and the airport, Lake Burley Griffin, and vibrant local centres such as Manuka and Kingston.
Residents particularly value Narrabundah's environment including its open spaces, parks, playgrounds, bushland landscapes, as well as its strong sense of community and diversity.
The suburb's streetscapes are characterised by mature deciduous and native street trees, charming established gardens and largely single-storey detached homes.
Street trees in Narrabundah offer colourful spring blossoms and spectacular Autumn foliage in many streets. Finniss Crescent, Carnegie Crescent, Sprent and Stuart Streets are planted with fine examples of Pin Oaks, which have rich green foliage in Summer and colour brilliantly in shades of scarlet and crimson in Autumn.
History
'Narrabundah' is a Ngunnawal word meaning 'bird of prey', celebrated in the sculpture in the park opposite the Narrabundah shops.
The name Narrabundah was taken from the parish of Narrabundah, a part of the cadastral division of Murray. This parish existed when the land was administered by New South Wales.
After the Australian Capital Territory was established on 1 January 1911, all of the land areas were renamed. The present suburb Narrabundah was part of the original Parish of Queanbeyan.
Narrabundah was gazetted as a division name on 20 September 1928. Narrabundah was the last of the 'inner south' suburbs to be developed, commencing in 1947, after being delayed by World War II. While early Canberra suburbs had mainly been built for public servants relocating from Melbourne, Narrabundah became Canberra's first blue collar suburb, housing mainly workers in construction and printing.
While its first streets were initially named with numbers, street names in Narrabundah have since been renamed, with Indigenous culture, as well as white explorers and pioneers as the inspiration.
Location
Narrabundah is bordered by the residential suburb of Red Hill to the southwest, Griffith to the west and Kingston to the northwest, as well as the light industrial suburbs of Fyshwick to the east and Symonston to the southeast.
The suburb can be divided into three distinct areas.
The area to the east of Sturt and Jerrabomberra Avenues (sometimes called 'Old Narrabundah'), where the Narrabundah shops and other community facilities including the primary school, pre-school, churches and GP clinics are situated.
This part is where Narrabundah's original fibro cottages were placed for European construction workers who came to Canberra in the 1950s to help develop the city, along with government printing workers from the British Isles who worked in Kingston and Fyshwick. Soon after, in the early to mid 1950s, full-brick duplexes and cottages were also built, many of which still stand.
The second area, located between Captain Cook Crescent and Sturt Avenue, is near the Griffith shops, to the west of Sturt Avenue and south of Canberra Avenue.
The remaining area (sometimes called 'Upper Narrabundah' or 'Narrabundah Heights') is located to the west of Captain Cook Crescent and Jerrabomberra Avenue. It rises towards the west where it borders the suburb of Red Hill. From here, panoramic views of Civic and Black Mountain, Lake Burley Griffin, Mount Ainslie and other parts of south-eastern Canberra are possible from a number of vantage points. There are also good views to Red Hill and its ridge-line. This part of Narrabundah is closer to the Red Hill and Griffith shopping areas than to the rest of Narrabundah.
Upper Narrabundah is known for its small population of urban peafowl (peacocks) with their colourful feathers. This area was once home to the residence of former Prime Minister John Gorton, who was often seen walking home from Parliament House via Manuka.
Amenities
Parks are widespread, with "Rocky Knoll" or "Rocky Knob" park in upper Narrabundah and its panoramic view over Canberra.
The Narrabundah shops include Canberra's first op-shop Vinnies (Society of Saint Vincent de Paul), restaurants (including XO and La Cantina), a daytime cafe called Mint Road, the popular Narrabundah Takeaway (serving salad rolls, fish and chips and other quick snacks), as well as a real estate agent and property manager, pharmacy, licensed post office, Danny's (sourdough) Bakery - famous for its Hot Cross Buns, the Narrabundah Friendly Grocer, two hairdressers, and a barber.
Narrabundah is home to the Canberra Cavalry baseball team, with home matches played at the Narrabundah Ballpark, informally known as the 'Bundahdome', near Mill Creek off Goyder Crescent in Old Narrabundah.
Narrabundah is home to two primary schools, Narrabundah Early Childhood School and St. Benedict's Primary School.
It is also home to Narrabundah College, one of the top public schools for the last two years of secondary schooling in the ACT and the first in Australia to offer the International Baccalaureate.
For community matters, 'Old Narrabundah' is represented by the Old Narrabundah Community Council (ONCC), while most of the rest of the suburb is represented by the Griffith-Narrabundah Community Association. Both form part of the broader Inner South Community Council.
Public art
A sculpture has been erected opposite the shopping centre with the following inscription on a plaque:
Education
Narrabundah residents are typically eligible to enrol in ACT public schools as follows:
Narrabundah Early Childhood School for pre-school to Year Two, after which it is Forrest Primary or Red Hill Primary, depending on the address.
Telopea Park School (for the first four years of secondary schooling)
Narrabundah College (for the last two years of secondary schooling)
Geology
One kind of rock is named after the suburb: the Narrabundah Ashstone Member which is found in the east and southeast. Rocks in Narrabundah are from the Silurian age. Some of the rocks are grey coloured tuff from the Mount Painter Volcanics. This can be viewed in a park on Brockman St. The Deakin Fault runs from Frome St. The fault line is displaced from Anembo St south to Goyder St by a north–south running fault that connects up with the South Fyshwick Fault. The South Fyshwick Fault runs east from the Narrabundah Primary School, separating ashstone in the south from the Canberra Formation in the north. Calcareous shale from the Canberra Formation lies to the north of the Deakin Fault.

Leonidas Ferreira de Paulo Junior (born 23 February 1975), simply known as Leonidas or Leonidas Ferreira, is a retired Brazilian footballer who played as a winger.
Career
Born in Goiânia, Leonidas started at Corinthians Alagoano in the 1993 Campeonato Alagoano, moving to Grêmio a year later. He then passed through Corinthians, before moving to Russia in 1996 to play for PFC CSKA Moscow.
Leonidas was the first Brazilian to represent CSKA, making his debut for them on 3 August 1996, scoring direct from a free-kick in their 1-1 draw with Uralmash Yekaterinburg. He played alongside his compatriot Leandro Samarone, scoring six times in just nine league appearances, also playing four games in the 1996–97 UEFA Cup, in a season plagued by minor injuries. After a brief spell at Atlético Paranaense, Aleksandr Tarkhanov brought him to Torpedo Moscow in 1997, where he scored once in three games, but sustaining a severe injury afterwards, ending the season. Translator Andrew Tarasov would later comment on Leonidas in an interview in 2011: "Leonidas was a capricious person - the first foreigner he had. So he just came thinking he would be a king here, that Russians could not play football, only he could. But when he saw with his own eyes that in Russia there are other good players and he was just one in many, the discovery upset him and discouraged him. Any hard contact – and he began to squeal and squeak. Plus life was very difficult for him, in part, of course, because 1996 Moscow was not what is today. There were few supermarkets, which he loved. Therefore, Leonidas seem to think that all in Russia was bad. And if a person is impossible to work on in football, it naturally transfers to everyday life."
Released by Torpedo, he returned to Brazil and to Corinthians Alogoano, staying just a few months, before signing with Benfica in July 1997. He made his debut on 13 September 1997, in a home draw against Académica, replacing Jorge Soares at half-time. Failing to make an impression, he played a last game on 21 December, already with Graeme Souness in charge, and left in the transfer market to join FC Arsenal Tula.
His second spell in Russia was short lived, playing just six games in the 1998 Russian Top Division. In 2000–01, he joined Levski Sofia, playing three Europeans games in the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds, twice against F91 Dudelange and once against Beşiktaş. His last known clus was representing Novo Hamburgo in 2003 and playing a game for Novo Horizonte in a 2004 Copa do Brasil match.

The specific name, bushi, is in honor of Australian naturalist and herpetologist Brian Gordon Bush (born 1947).
Taxonomy
V. bushi belongs to the subgenus Odatria.
Description
V. bushi is most similar to the stripe-tailed goanna (V. caudolineatus) and the pygmy mulga goanna (V. gilleni) of all monitor lizards. However, the Pilbara monitor can be distinguished from these other two species by some morphological and genetic differences.
Geographic range
The Pilbara monitor inhabits the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Habitat
The preferred natural habitats of V. bushi are desert and savanna.
Behaviour
Details about the behaviour of V. bushi are relatively unknown. However, it is known to be arboreal and to shelter in bark crevices, in hollow trees, and under fallen logs.
Reproduction
V. bushi is oviparous.

A métropole (French for "metropolis") is an administrative entity in France, in which several communes cooperate, and which has the right to levy local tax, an établissement public de coopération intercommunale à fiscalité propre. It is the most integrated form of intercommunality in France, more than the communauté urbaine, the communauté d'agglomération and the Communauté de communes. The métropoles were created by a law of January 2014.
As of July 2019, there are 20 métropoles, and 2 métropoles with special status (all in metropolitan France). The Metropolis of Lyon is a territorial collectivity, not an intercommunality.

Baca Kurti Gjokaj ( 1807–1881) was an Albanian leader who participated in the Battle of Ržanicë against the Principality of Montenegro.
Life
Baca was born around 1807 in the village of Milješ (Milesh) in the Gruda tribal region near the town of Tuzi, to an Albanian highlander (Malësor) family. In 1856, he became voivode of Gruda after putting down a band of rebels in Fundna. He also killed the brother of Marko Miljanov that year.
He was one of 15 Ottoman delegates from northern Albania sent during the talks of the Congress of Berlin (13 June–13 July 1878). Apart from three guards from Mirditë, of the Catholic delegates included chiefs Çun Mula from Hoti, Baca Kurti from Gruda, Marash Dashi from Shkreli, Cil Vuksani from Kastrati, Mark Lula from Shala, Mark Kola from Shosha and Con Geda from Shllaku.
He joined the Albanian nationalist League of Prizren after the decision of the Congress of Berlin to hand over the Albanian-inhabited regions of Hoti, Gruda, Plav, Gusinje, Kastrati, etc. to the Principality of Montenegro. When Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro entered the territory which had been ceded to him by the Congress of Berlin, Baca Kurti and other chiefs of Malësia organized a resistance against Montenegro. The northern Albanian highlanders defeated the Montenegrins in the Battle of Ržanica. He was distinguished as one of the best commanders of Çun Mula during the battle.
He mobilized not only the members of his clan, but also the members of other towns of Malësia, to fight against the Montenegrin army and to have the Montenegrins leave Albanian territory: all males from 7 to 70 years old, united, forced the Montenegrin forces to retire. Today he is known to Albanians worldwide as many songs and poems were created in his honor.

The 2005–06 New York Knicks season was the 60th season for the team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Knicks had the eighth pick in the 2005 NBA draft, and selected Channing Frye from the University of Arizona. During the off-season, the Knicks hired head coach Larry Brown, acquired Eddy Curry and Antonio Davis from the Chicago Bulls, and acquired Quentin Richardson and rookie guard Nate Robinson from the Phoenix Suns. At mid-season, they traded Penny Hardaway and second-year forward Trevor Ariza to the Orlando Magic in exchange for All-Star guard Steve Francis, and dealt Davis back to his former team, the Toronto Raptors, in exchange for Jalen Rose.
The Knicks finished with a 23–59 record, which left them in last place in the Atlantic Division. They had the fewest wins in the Eastern Conference in the 2005–06 season, and only the Portland Trail Blazers had fewer wins in the NBA with a 21–61 record. The Knicks' payroll for the 2005-2006 season was $124 million, putting them $74.5 million above the salary cap, and $62.3 million above the luxury tax line.
Stephon Marbury led the team with 16.3 points and 6.4 assists per game, while Jamal Crawford finished second on the team in scoring with 14.3 points per game, and Curry provided them with 13.6 points and 6.0 rebounds per game. Frye averaged 12.3 points per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, and Robinson won the Slam Dunk Contest during the All-Star Weekend in Houston. Following the season, Brown was fired after spending only one season with the team. Isiah Thomas, the Knicks' general manager, was named head coach for the 2006–07 season.

Communication noise refers to influences on effective communication that influence the interpretation of conversations. While often looked over, communication noise can have a profound impact both on our perception of interactions with others and our analysis of our own communication proficiency.
Forms of communication noise include psychological noise, physical noise, physiological and semantic noise. All these forms of noise subtly, yet greatly influence our communication with others and are vitally important to anyone's skills as a competent communicator.
Psychological noise
Psychological noise results from preconceived notions brought to conversations, such as stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we come into a conversation with ideas about what the other person is going to say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time it is difficult to distance oneself from psychological noise, recognizing that it exists and taking those distractions into account when we converse with others is important.
Psychological noise occurs when the psychological state of the receiver(s) is such as to produce an unpredictable decoding (right after a major earthquake, an "oldies" radio station in Los Angeles plays Elvis Presley's "I'm All Shook Up" as part of a preprogrammed music session, and is condemned by listeners for mocking victims of the quake)(L Chirubvu,2018)
Psychological noise can also include factors such as one's current mood and one's interest in the conversation topic. For example, suppose the receiver has a general liking to the sender in the communication encounter. In that case, the receiver will be more successful in effectively listening to the sender's message, and he or she will be able to respond effectively. Also, if the receiver is in either a bad or good mood, it will have an impact on how he or she receives the message. Although a positive emotion can increase the possibility of a successful communication encounter, it can also have a negative impact. It is crucial to recognize these emotions and analyze whether they are impacting the message transmission.
Environmental noise
Environmental noise can be any external noise that can potentially impact the effectiveness of communication. These noises can be any type of sight (i.e., car accident, television show), sound (i.e., talking, music, ringtones), or stimuli (i.e., tapping on the shoulder) that can distract someone from receiving the message. These noises can significantly impact the success of message transmission from the sender to the receiver. For example, two individuals at a party might have to speak louder to understand one another, and it might become frustrating. They are also very distracting, which will have a severe impact on one's listening abilities - a crucial part of effective communication.
Physical noise
Physical noise is any external or environmental stimulus that distracts us from receiving the intended message sent by a communicator (Rothwell 11). Examples of physical noise include: others talking in the background, background music, a startling noise and acknowledging someone outside of the conversation.
Semantic noise
This is noise that is often caused by the sender (also known as either the encoder or the source). This type of noise occurs when grammar or technical language is used that the receiver (the decoder) cannot understand, or cannot understand it clearly.
It occurs when the sender of the message uses a word or a phrase that we don't know the meaning of, or which we use in a different way from the speakers. This is usually due to the result that the encoder had failed to practice audience analysis at first. The type of audience is the one that determine the jargon one will use.

A Fairly Odd Summer (also known as A Fairly Odd Movie 3 or A Fairly Odd Paradise) is a 2014 live-action/animated comedy television film. It is the sequel to A Fairly Odd Christmas and was released on August 2, 2014. It is the third and final installment in The Fairly OddParents live-action film series beginning with the first film A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!, and continuing with its first sequel.
The film was released on DVD on October 28, 2014, and was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2015.
Plot
Following his previous adventure, Timmy Turner is assigned a summer job in Fairy World's Yuck Factory by head fairy, Jorgen Von Strangle, who believes that as he is grown up, he should work for a living, something his own fairies agree upon. Timmy, despite not being happy he will not be able to enjoy a summer vacation, chooses to do so in order to impress Tootie, who now works for the Help Creatures Dimmsdale Research Center. Returning to Dimmsdale from his latest day of work, Timmy visits Tootie at the Center and discovers to his dismay that the head of the Center wishes her to deliver a special gas cure for rare spotted dolphins to Hawaii, which will be contained in a vial in the same size and shape as Timmy's lip balm. In mix-up and totally unaware of it, Timmy sets his lip balm down by the gas cure, which is inadvertently packed away into a travel case by mistake while he takes the cure's vial. Later, upon returning home, Timmy is shocked to discover that his parents are also going to Hawaii, after Mr. Turner's pencil company chose it for the company's next vacation. Mr. Turner further reveals that he has been put in charge of providing the entertainment in the form of a fire dance and been given the money to do so, only to learn from Timmy after reading the note his boss gave him in more detail, that he will be fired if he fails to provide. Meanwhile, two children from a rich family, Marty and Mitzy, are excited about going to Hawaii, until they learn their parents won't be going, instead sending them off with a babysitter, who turns out to be Vicky.
In Fairy World, Timmy is visited by Jorgen and told he is being promoted. Timmy learns he is to look after the source of all fairy magic, Abracadabraium, while Jorgen is away in Hawaii competing in the Bronze Biceps contest. Much to his chagrin, Timmy takes on the job, but whilst preparing to have his lunch, Timmy discovers that his father packed the check he had been given within his sandwich by mistake, while also discovering that his lip balm got mistakenly taken by Tootie and not the gas cure. Seeking to avoid both sufferings by these minor accidents, Timmy decides to head to Hawaii, taking the Abracadabraium with him in a bowling bag. Meanwhile, Poof's counterpart, Foop, who had been spying on him, meets with the Anti-Fairy council over his failure to destroy Timmy's fairies and vows that he has found a new way to do so by going after the Abracadabraium and destroying it, despite the fact that no anti-fairy can touch it because of the good magic stored in it. The council orders him to do so, stripping him of his bottle, the source of his magic, to ensure he completes his task on the promise he will receive something horrible for his punishment. Heading for Hawaii, Foop runs into Mr. Crocker at the airport, after he was sent there by his mother in the hopes of curing his obsession with fairies. Realizing that Foop plans to cause mischief for Timmy and destroy Fairy World, Mr. Crocker agrees to help him in acquiring the Abracadabraium.
After returning the check to his father and give back the gas cure to Tootie, so that she can keep her job, Timmy decides to relax with her and his fairies on the beach. While doing so, he and Tootie run into Marty and Mitzy, who had run away from Vicky after she had mistreated them on their vacation and help them escape from her so that they can have some fun. But while relaxing, Mr. Crocker, who is given the money for the fire dance by Mr. Turner, and Foop, having taken on human form, successfully distract the pair and steal the bag carrying the Abracadabraium from Timmy, soon putting Fairy World in danger, and weakening Cosmo, Wanda and Poof. Realizing he had been duped, Timmy is soon spotted by Jorgen who becomes furious he lost the Abracadaraium and orders him and Tootie to get it back. His anger changes his skin and wins him 3rd place in the Bronze Biceps contest and publicity, ruling him out in getting it back. Seeking to get it back, the pair and the fairies recruit Marty and Mitzy to help and soon discover that Foop plans to drop the Abracadabrium into a lava pool within a volcano. Arriving to stop him, the group discovers that Mr. Crocker, who was planning to drop it, became affected by it, turning good and refusing to do as Foop wants. Angered, Foop risks touching the substance to destroy it, leading to Timmy struggling with him to get it back and falling into the lava with it. Much to the surprise of the others, Timmy survives and becomes a fairy (his appearance that of his cartoon self in his youth without the buck teeth) after absorbing some of the powers of the Abracadabraium. A defiant Foop swears revenge but is soon sent packing by Poof, while Mr. Crocker soon returns to his normal self.
With Timmy now a fairy, Jorgen reassigns Cosmo, Wanda and Poof to Marty and Mitzy, who he states deserve them, all while leaving them close by for Timmy to see them. Timmy soon uses his fairy powers to save his father's job by creating a fire dance for him with Mr. Crocker in it, after learning he took the money for it. While Marty and Mitzy take delight in having fairies, turning Vicky into a rabbit, Tootie declares she will need time to get used to Timmy as a fairy, before dancing with him. The stage sets off fireworks and Poof sends off the audience with an "Aloha!".
In the Epilogue, Foop gets sent down the drain, which he describes as the "unspeakable horror".

Margaret "Midge" Costanza (November 28, 1932 – March 23, 2010) was an American Presidential advisor, social and political activist. A lifelong champion of gay and women's rights, she was known for her wit, outspoken manner and commitment to her convictions.
Early life and family
Costanza was born to Philip Costanza and Concetta Granata Costanza on November 28, 1932 in LeRoy, New York and was raised in Rochester. Her parents were Sicilian immigrant sausage-makers. Following various clerical jobs she took after high school, Costanza became an administrative assistant for a real estate developer in Rochester, using this job to become active in several community organizations.
Political career
Activist, councilwoman, and vice-mayor of Rochester
Taking an interest in politics, Costanza volunteered on W. Averell Harriman's campaign for governor in 1954 and soon became the Monroe County, New York executive director of Robert F. Kennedy's Senate campaign in 1964. She served as a Democratic National Committee member from 1972 until 1977.
In 1973 she ran for an at-large seat on the Rochester city council, becoming Rochester's first councilwoman in a landslide. The recipient of the largest votes traditionally was named mayor, however the council chose a man for the post, naming Costanza vice-mayor, a largely ceremonial position with little power.
Congressional aspirations
Costanza lost a race for the United States House of Representatives in 1974 to the popular Republican incumbent. In 1976 when Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter ran for President of the United States, Costanza served as co-chair of his New York campaign operation and gave a seconding speech for him at the Democratic National Convention (Carter had been a volunteer in Costanza's congressional campaign two years prior).
Woman in the White House
Upon Carter's election Costanza was named Assistant to the President for Public Liaison, moving into the office next door to the Oval Office. Costanza was nicknamed "the President's window to the nation", consulting with a wide array of groups. While in the White House she was a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. Costanza caused controversy when she invited fourteen National Gay Task Force leaders and gay rights activists to the White House at the height of Anita Bryant's homophobic "Save Our Children" campaign.
Costanza went on to arrange discussions between the NGTF co-directors and senior officials of the administration. Public disagreements with some of the president's policies, caused controversy and saw Costanza's role in the White House diminished. As her successor Anne Wexler described it: "OPL under Costanza had functioned as an office providing responsiveness to interest groups, a form of White House case work, but had not taken enough initiative to enlist group support by building coalitions that would move the president's program on Capitol Hill." Affirming her support for Carter, she resigned from his administration effective September 1, 1978.
Costanza had been popular with women's groups, and had earned herself a Newsweek cover titled "Woman in the White House". Following her resignation many feminists were angered with Carter, feeling he had "fired" Costanza, on whom much pressure was put to quit.
Career and activism after the White House
Costanza became executive director of her friend Shirley MacLaine's "Higher Self" seminars after moving to Los Angeles and later became vice-president at Alan Landsburg Productions, where she made commercial films and advertisements. She served on many service group boards of directors, including the AIDS research organization Search Alliance and the National Gay Rights Advocates.
Moving to San Diego County, California in 1990, Costanza coached candidates for office in public speaking, serving as the coordinator for Barbara Boxer's winning United States Senate in the Year of the Woman, 1992, and as manager for Kathleen Brown's failed gubernatorial candidacy in 1994. Governor of California Gray Davis appointed Costanza as a liaison for women's groups and issues. Costanza lost that job when Gray Davis lost a recall reelection in November 2003.
Costanza became a professor at San Diego State University in 2004 and was working with the Political Science and Women's Studies departments of San Diego State and the Political Science department of the University of California, San Diego to develop the Midge Costanza Institute. The Institute is mainly aimed at inspiring young people to become active in political and social causes.
Honor
Midge Costanza was nominated and inducted into the San Diego County Women's Hall of Fame in 2011 by Women's Museum of California, Commission on the Status of Women, University of California, San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State University Women's Studies.
Death
Costanza died of cancer at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, California on March 23, 2010 at the age of 77. She is survived by her brother Anthony.
Midge Costanza was nominated and inducted into the San Diego County Women's Hall of Fame in 2011 for the title of Trailblazer, meaning, women who have paved the way for other women, or were the first in their field. The annual Women's Hall of Fame induction is co-hosted by Women's Museum of California (Located in San Diego), Commission on the Status of Women, UC San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State Women's Studies.

Laus (English: louse) was the name for a series of German ECCM equipment during World War II. They were additions to German radar equipment in order to counteract the Allied use of 'Window' (German: Düppel), a chaff radar countermeasure.
Window
Window, was an early chaff countermeasure to radar. Huge quantities of conductive strips, made of foil or metallised paper, were cut to the dipole length of the radar to be defeated and dropped from aircraft. The dipoles reflect enough to appear as a large diffuse target. Although the real target aircraft continue to reflect and are shown by the radar, they cannot be distinguished from the decoy cloud.
German Würzburg radar was susceptible to Window attack. The short wavelength allowed the use of short strips which fell only slowly, giving the cloud a long dispersion time. Würzburg also used conical scanning, which gives a slowly rotating polarisation, so that it was affected by all of the strips, no matter their orientation.
Countermeasures
Chaff was invented independently by Britain, Germany and Japan, but was not used early on, owing to mutual fears that it would be turned against the inventor. It was not used until 24–25 July 1943 and the Operation Gomorrah raids against Hamburg. Despite having been known in Germany since 1940, no countermeasures had yet been developed against it.
Chaff is relatively stationary in the air, falling slowly and moving with any wind. This contrast with the speed of the target aircraft was the key to most of the anti-Window measures. Radar reflections are affected by the Doppler effect: reflections from a radially moving target are shifted in frequency; shorter wavelengths on the approach, longer when departing.
Variants
Freya-laus
For the Freya radar, using Doppler.
Wurzlaus
(Wurzburg Louse)
Equipment added to all Wurzburg radars between July and August 1943.
K-Laus
Considered to be the best of the countermeasures to Window.
It operated by using the Doppler shift of the returned signal. Reflections from a moving aircraft would be shifted in frequency, those from slowly drifting chaff would not. A band-pass filter was added so that only signals with an offset of 200 to 700 Hz from the transmitted frequency would be accepted. By January 1945, 1,000 sets had been ordered and somewhere between 40 and 50 were in use.
Reise-Gustav

Waubeka is an unincorporated census-designated place in the Town of Fredonia, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located on the Milwaukee River, the community is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, its population is 657.
Inhabited by Native Americans into the mid-1800s, Waubeka was named for a Potawatomi chief who was friendly with the first white settlers who arrived in the area in the 1840s. Waubeka was the site of the first formal observance of Flag Day in 1885, and today the community is home to the National Flag Day Foundation's Americanism Center, which serves as the organization's headquarters and contains a museum.
History
The land that became the Waubeka was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi tribe, who surrendered the land to the United States government in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as "strolling Potawatomi" in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One such group was led by Chief Waubeka, who maintained a winter camp on the south bank of the Milwaukee River in present-day Waubeka as late as 1845. The chief's wigwam was located near the present site of the Gerald Joose house. In the Potawatomi language, "Waubeka" means "metal." Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.
In the 1840s, Waubeka was the largest settlement in the Town of Fredonia. The first settlers were English, Irish, Scottish, and Yankees from the East Coast. In 1848, a group of German immigrants arrived from Prussia and settled in the northern part of Waubeka. Luxemburger and Belgian immigrants settled in eastern Waubeka, and immigrants from Bavaria and Saxony settled in the northwest.
Geography
Waubeka is 840 feet (256 m) above sea level and is located at (43.4749994, -87.9903696). According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of : land and water. Waubeka is located in the Town of Fredonia, and borders to the Village of Fredonia to the east and the Town of Saukville to the south.
The community is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The area has some subterranean Silurian limestone formations that are part of the Racine Dolomite that stretches through eastern Wisconsin and Illinois.
Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Waubeka area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the Milwaukee River, which flows along the community and provided a power source for the community's early industries. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.
As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Waubeka. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, North American river otters and red foxes can be seen in the village. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the community.
The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.
Flag Day
United States Flag Day was first formally observed in Waubeka. On June 14, 1885, Stony Hill School teacher and Waubeka-native Bernard J. Cigrand instructed his students to write essays about what the flag of the United States meant to them to commemorate the Continental Congress's 1777 adoption of the flag as a national symbol. It was the first formal observance of Flag Day.
In 1995, the National Flag Day Foundation constructed the Americanism Center in Waubeka. A 13,000-square-foot facility on fifteen acres of land, the center serves as the foundation's headquarters and also houses a museum with an extensive collection of patriotic memorabilia, military uniforms, and artifacts from the life of Bernard J. Cigrand. The foundation organizes a parade in Waubeka each Flag Day.

This is a timeline of incidents in 2002 that have been labelled as "terrorism" and are not believed to have been carried out by a government or its forces (see state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism).
Guidelines
To be included, entries must be notable (have a stand-alone article) and described by a consensus of reliable sources as "terrorism".
List entries must comply with the guidelines outlined in the manual of style under MOS:TERRORIST.
Casualty figures in this list are the total casualties of the incident including immediate casualties and later casualties (such as people who succumbed to their wounds long after the attacks occurred).
Casualties listed are the victims. Perpetrator casualties are listed separately (e.g. x (+y) indicate that x victims and y perpetrators were killed/injured).
Casualty totals may be underestimated or unavailable due to a lack of information. A figure with a plus (+) sign indicates that at least that many people have died (e.g. 10+ indicates that at least 10 people have died) – the actual toll could be considerably higher. A figure with a plus (+) sign may also indicate that over that number of people are victims.
If casualty figures are 20 or more, they will be shown in bold. In addition, figures for casualties more than 50 will also be underlined.
Incidents are limited to one per location per day. If multiple attacks occur in the same place on the same day, they will be merged into a single incident.
In addition to the guidelines above, the table also includes the following categories:

The Kari, Cari, or Chariar were one of the ten indigenous Great Andamanese peoples, originally living on the northernmost part of North Andaman Island and on Landfall Island in the Indian Ocean.
The Cari spoke a distinctive language, Aka-Cari, closely related to the other Great Andamanese languages. They were exclusively shore-dwellers (aryoto).
History
The Cari population at the time of first European contacts (in the 1790s) has been estimated at 100 individuals, out of perhaps 3500 Great Andamanese.
Like other Andamanese peoples, the Cari were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The population was down to 39 individuals in the 1901 census, falling to 36 in 1911, 17 in 1921, and 9 in 1931.
In 1949 any remaining Cari were relocated, together with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island; and then again in 1969 to a reservation on Strait Island.
By 1994, the population was reduced to only two women, aged 57 and 59, and therefore was on its way to extinction. They are a designated Scheduled Tribe.

The Surruque people lived along the middle Atlantic coast of Florida during the 16th and 17th centuries. They may have spoken a dialect of the Timucua language, but were allied with the Ais. The Surruque became clients of the Spanish government in St. Augustine, but were not successfully brought into the Spanish mission system.
Demography
The Surruque lived around the Mosquito Lagoon (called Surruque Lagoon by the Spanish), near Cape Canaveral, and along the Atlantic coast north from the Cape up to near Ponce de Leon Inlet. The northern limit of Surruque territory was Turtle Mound, which was called "Surruque" in the early 17th century. To the north of Surruque territory was the territory of the Timucua-speaking town of Nocoroco, at the mouth of the Tomoka River. Its territory extended south of the Ponce de Leon Inlet to Caparaca, near present-day New Smyrna Beach. The northern boundary of Surruque territory was around Turtle Mound. The province of Ais was to the south of the Surruque, along the Indian River. The Mayaca and Jororo people lived to the west of the Surruque, in the St. Johns River valley.
The language of the Surruque is unknown. While some authorities state that the Surruque probably spoke a dialect of Timucua, Hann notes that there is some evidence that the Surruque language was related to the Ais language.
History
The French, in their brief occupation of northeastern Florida around Fort Caroline, reported hearing of a place named Sorrochos or Serropé, said to be next to a large lake of the same name, which they placed in the interior of southern Florida. Swanton states that location is much too far to the south and east, and understood the "large lake" to be one of the lagoons near Cape Canaveral. The Spanish drove the French out of Florida in 1565, and established St. Augustine that year. The Spanish largely ignored the peoples of the coast south of St. Augustine, including the Surruque, for some 30 years after the city was established. In 1595 the Spanish took steps to secure control of that coast. The chief of Surruque, along with the chief of Ais, traveled to St. Augustine, and agreed to allow missionaries into their lands, to provide parties of laborers to St. Augustine, and to report any non-Spanish ships or men along the coast.
In 1597, during a revolt in the Guale province, the Ais refused to allow Spanish ships to land. In retaliation, Timucua Indians allied with the Spanish attacked the Surruque, killing 60 and taking 54 men, women, and children back to St. Augustine as slaves. A royal order in 1600 freed all Indian slaves. The freed Surruque were settled on an island near St. Augustine. In 1599, Juan Ramirez de Contreras, who spoke Ais, was sent to teach the Surruque and Ais, but he was killed by the Surruque before he reached Ais territory. Alvaro Mexia, a Spanish soldier from St. Augustine, stayed with the Surruque Indians for 8 days in 1605, waiting for permission to continue on a diplomatic mission to the Ais. Also in 1605, the Surruque and Ais sent men to help the Spanish repel French raiders in Guale. At least one mission may have been established close to Surruque, and Spanish cattle ranches were established along the coast as far south as Surruque.

Clarence Emir Allen (September 8, 1852 – July 9, 1932) was a U.S. Representative from Utah.
Born in Girard Township, Pennsylvania, Allen attended the district school and Girard (Pennsylvania) Academy. He studied law. He graduated from Western Reserve College, then at Hudson, Ohio, graduating in 1877 Phi Beta Kappa.
After graduation, Allen married Corinne Marie Tuckerman, where together they had seven children—five girls, one of whom died in infancy, and two boys. Their daughter Florence E. Allen, became the first woman to serve on a state supreme court, the Ohio Supreme Court, and first woman judge to serve on a federal court, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Another daughter, Esther Allen Gaw, served as the Dean of Women at Ohio State University. Their two sons lost their lives due to World War I. Three of his daughters, Florence, Esther, and Helen, graduated from his alma mater Western Reserve, present-day Case Western Reserve University.
Baseball Fame
In the mid-1870s, Allen pitched collegiately for Western Reserve College, now known as Case Western Reserve University. He is credited as the first college baseball player to perfect the curve ball, and notably never lost a game once mastering the "curve." With fellow college teammate, John P. Barden, Allen played professionally with the Erie Keystones during the summer of 1876. While in Erie, he learned the concept of a curve ball from a competitive Pittsburgh pitcher, perfecting it in the college ranks.
Professional and Political Life
Allen served as an instructor of Greek at Western Reserve College from 1880 to 1881. He moved to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, in August 1881 and was an instructor at Salt Lake Academy until 1886, when he resigned to engage in mining pursuits. He served as member of the territorial house of representatives in 1888, 1890, and 1894.
Allen and his college-educated wife (of Smith College), Corinne, both strongly supported public education. Allen is credited with authoring a bill passed by the territorial legislature in 1890 that provided free public schools for students age six to eighteen. Some have called him the "Father of Utah's Free Schools."
Allen was elected county clerk of Salt Lake County in August 1890 and served until January 1, 1893.
He was admitted to the bar in 1893 and commenced practice in Salt Lake City. He was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for election in 1892 as a Delegate to the Fifty-third Congress. He served as delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1892 and 1896.
With the admission of Utah as a State into the Union, Allen was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-fourth Congress and served from January 4, 1896, to March 3, 1897. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1896.
He resumed his former mining pursuits until 1922, when he retired from active business and resided in Columbus, Ohio, until 1931.
He died in Escondido, California on July 9, 1932. His body was cremated and the ashes interred in Salt Lake City's Mount Olivet Cemetery.

Suleyman`s Eagle, a bronze figure of an eagle, is one of the symbols Ingushetia. It was made at the end of the 8th century in the Arab Caliphate and was found in the 19th century in the village of Erzi of the Republic of Ingushetia.
In 1931 it was taken out by well-known scholars of Caucasian N. F. Yakovlev and St. Petersburg, which is exhibited in the hall of the culture and art of the East Hermitage. Before nationalization and transfer to the museum belonged to the Ingush teip - Mamilov`s as the coat of arms.
Statuette height 38 cm, made of bronze, clearly transmitting plastic eagle and his menacing, graceful appearance. Hollow inside and could be used as a receptacle. Inlaid with silver and copper. In the neck engraved in Arabic: «في اسم الرحمن الرحيم, الله الرحيم», translated into English saying: 'In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. " On the opposite side of the embossed name of the master manufacturer, "Suleiman" and the date of manufacture - 189 Hijra year (equivalent to 796–797 years. Gregorian calendar).
The official website of the Hermitage specified that the information about the place of manufacture of figurines can not be read, but the scientific community is widely believed that this relic is made in Basra (now The Republic of Iraq) - a cultural and crafts centers of the Arab Caliphate.
In the world survived three more similar in shape figurines (in Museum of Islamic Art (Berlin), in the city of Lucca in Italy and in Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt), but only on a copy that is stored in the "Hermitage" the date of manufacture, and perhaps it is the oldest of the four curved vessels.

The CMLL 87th Anniversary Show () was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event, scripted and produced by the Mexican lucha libre wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; Spanish for "World Wrestling Council") that took place on September 25, 2020, in CMLL's home arena Arena México, Mexico City, Mexico. The event was also billed as "Night of Champions", where the fans decided the opponents of the defending champions at the event. No fans were in attendance at Arena México due to limitations from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the show was broadcast as an internet pay-per-view on Ticketmaster Live.
The show is normally the biggest show of the year for CMLL, considered their version of the Super Bowl or WrestleMania. This is the 93rd EMLL/CMLL Anniversary Show as there were two shows held in 1963, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1977, but none in 1985 (earthquake). The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest-running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934.
Production
Background
The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre ("Mexican Wrestling Company"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as "the father of Lucha Libre" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September.
Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942–43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena México built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena México the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as "The Cathedral of Lucha Libre". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labeled as their "Anniversary" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena México anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985, but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena México might not be structurally sound after the earthquake.
When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as "Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show.
CMLL stopped promoting shows in March 2020 due to guidelines issued by the Mexican government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that CMLL did not hold any shows between March 14 and July 30, 2020. CMLL later announced that they would return to promoting their CMLL Super Viernes shows every Friday, starting on September 4. The September 4th, 11th and 19th Super Viernes shows would be empty arena matches, broadcast as internet Pay-Per-View (iPPV) events on Ticketmaster Live, followed by the 87th Anniversary show, held on September 25 as an empty arena iPPV. CMLL announced that the show would be a "Night of Champions" show where fans could vote on who they would want to challenge for various CMLL championships.
Storylines
The 87th Anniversary Show will feature seven professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the "bad guys") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they perform. For the 87th Anniversary Show, CMLL announced that they would let the fans vote for who would challenge reigning CMLL champions at the "Night of Champions" themed show. CMLL also announced that the total number of votes for each match would determine the order of matches on the show, with the highest vote getting earning the main event sport regardless of their normal card position. The championships chosen for the polls were:

The team of Cavernario, El Terrible, and Hechicero was originally announced as one of the fan poll options for the CMLL World Trios Championship, but Cavernario suffered a knee injury during the main event of the September 4 Super Viernes show and needed surgery as a result. CMLL held a fan poll to determine a replacement for Caverario, necessitated by the team leading the overall poll. Voters chose Templario over Vangelis or Dark Magic, to replace Cavernario. Templario was also listed in the polls for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship but was far behind the top vote-getter. In the end the team of Templario, El Terrible, and Hechicero won the vote, with enough votes to have them work the second match of the night.
The right to challenge for the CMLL World Women's Championship was originally won by Princesa Sugehit, but on September 16 Sugehit announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and thus was forced to isolate and could not compete in the anniversary show. CMLL opted to have the second-highest vote winner, Dalys, challenge for the title instead, while Pricesa Sugehit was promised a championship match in October once she was out of quarantine.
La Metálica's challenger was a choice between Lluvia, Reyna Isis, La Jarocita, and La Estrellita. The fan vote selected Lluvia to wrestle for the Mexican National Women's Championship. On September 21 it was revealed that Lluvia had tested positive for COVID-19, albeit asymptomatic, and thus was not able to compete. In her place, Reyna Isis was given the match due to her position as the first runner-up in the fan vote. It was announced that Lluvia would get her championship match at a later date after her quarantine was over.
On September 23, CMLL announced that both Bandido and Último Guerrero had both tested positive for COVID-19 and were off the show. As the runner-up in the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship Templario was announced as Bandido's replacement. As Guerrero was taken off the show, CMLL replaced the CMLL World Trios Championship match with a match for the CMLL World Welterweight Championship, with Titán defending against the reigning Mexican National Welterweight Champion Soberano Jr. Both championship matches were announced as taking place at some point in October.

The Watuppa Ponds are two large, naturally occurring, spring-fed, glacially formed ponds located in Fall River and Westport, Massachusetts. Watuppa is a native word meaning "place of boats". The two ponds were originally one body of water (originally one lake), connected by a narrow rocky straight called "The Narrows" located on a thin strip of land between the two ponds which forms part boundary of between Fall River and Westport. The border between Fall River and Westport is also divided between the two ponds. Together, the ponds have an overall north–south length of about 7.5 miles (or 8 miles including the pond swamps), and have an average east–west width of about a mile. The ponds are drained by the Quequechan River, and flows in a westerly direction through the center of Fall River from South Watuppa Pond to Mount Hope Bay.
Description
With a surface area of 1,805 acres, (1760 acres) The North Watuppa Pond is the second-largest naturally occurring body of water within Massachusetts. It is about 4.2 miles long in the north–south direction, and averages about a mile in width. The North Watuppa Pond has 12.4 miles of shoreline and has a maximum depth of 25 feet and is strictly off limits to the public for any recreation. It has been used as the City of Fall River's primary drinking water supply since 1873, when the Fall River Waterworks was built on its western shore, at the end of Bedford Street. It drains into South Watuppa Pond by a small channel at its southern end, in an area known as The Narrows. The northeastern shore of North Watuppa Pond, known as Copicut Reservation, is sparsely developed, and contains a vast area of protected land as part of the city's water supply. Several small streams drain into the pond, including King Philip Brook, Queen Gutter Brook, and Blossom Brook, among others. The north end of North Watuppa Pond is crossed by a stone causeway, at the end of Wilson Road. The western shore of the reservoir contains a man-made canal that diverts stormwater runoff from the city to South Watuppa Pond. Public access to North Watuppa Pond is restricted, and the area is regularly patrolled by the city's water department. All activities including fishing, boating, swimming or skating are strictly prohibited. Including the pond swamp north of the causeway The North and South Watuppa Ponds together represent a complete 7.5 to 8 mile body of water.
The South Watuppa Pond contains 1,551 acres (1446 acres), and is the third-largest naturally occurring body of water within Massachusetts. The trumpet-shaped pond is about 3.0 miles long. It is about 0.5 miles wide at its southern end and about 1.5 miles wide at its northern end, with a large cove on the Westport side. The South Watuppa Pond contains 10.4 miles of shoreline and is on average 15 feet deep and contains maximum depth of 22 feet. It is fed by a combination of springs and streams, including Sucker Brook near its eastern shore which flows from Stafford Pond in nearby Tiverton, Rhode Island, as well as from the south by Stony Brook, which drains Sawdy Pond and Devol Pond. South Watuppa Pond is a popular fishing area with boat access from a city-managed public boat ramp located off the end of Jefferson Street, in an area known as "Dave's Beach". Some common fish species in the pond include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, tiger muskie, white perch and black crappie.
History
Prior to the 1862 boundary adjustment between Massachusetts and Rhode Island, South Watuppa Pond was located entirely within the town of Tiverton, Rhode Island, as was the southern third of North Watuppa Pond.
North Watuppa Pond once contained several ice houses along its western shore, beginning in the 1840s. The granite walls of one of these ice houses, built in 1864 by Robert Cook and William Durfee, still exist on a peninsula near the end of New Boston Road, at what was once known as Interlachen, the estate of Spencer Borden, founder of the Fall River Bleachery. Interlachen once contained a large mansion, gardens, horse pastures and a network of bridle paths. The house was demolished after the city acquired the land by eminent domain for the protection of the water supply. The foundation is all that remains of the Borden mansion today, and the land has mostly reverted to woods.
Until 1872, small steam-boats carried passengers from downtown Fall River to a picnic area on the eastern shore of North Watuppa Pond in Westport known as Adirondack Grove.
In 1875, the Fall River Railroad was completed along the north shore of South Watuppa Pond, over the Narrows. It provided a rail link from New Bedford to the eastern part of Fall River. The line carried freight traffic until the early 1980s. Eventually, the road connecting Fall River with Westport became designated as U.S. Route 6. It originally ran along the southern edge of North Watuppa Pond, creating a small pond between the road and the railroad, that became a popular spot for recreation, including ice skating in the winter. The adjacent north shore of South Watuppa Pond was for many years occupied by boat clubs, restaurants and other recreational establishments.
The Fall River Expressway was built along the western shore of North Watuppa Pond in the early 1950s. Now known as Route 24, it was later extended toward Tiverton along the western shore of South Watuppa Pond. In 1963, Interstate 195 was constructed through the Narrows dividing North and South Watuppa Ponds. Route 6 was re-routed to the south along Martine Street, and the small pond was filled in.
Historically, several textile factories have been located on the northern shores of South Watuppa Pond, including the Fall River Bleachery, Kerr Thread Mills, Lincoln Manufacturing Company, Stevens Manufacturing Company and Heywood Narrow Fabric Company. The eastern and southwestern shores of the pond is currently surrounded by many private residences, and public access is fairly limited. Many of these residences were damaged during the historic floods of March 2010.
The pond is also used for many recreational sports such as tubing, knee boarding and wake boarding and water skiing. The former railroad bed has also been converted into a multi-use rail trail.

William James (29 March 1791 – 4 May 1861) was an English Radical politician. A Liverpool-born slave-owner, he sat in the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament (MP) for constituencies in Cumberland for twenty years over the three decades from 1820.
Early life
James was born in Liverpool, to a family enriched by his grandfather William James (1735–1798), a slave trader, plantation owner and slave owner. His father William Evans James was from Liverpool, and his mother Elizabeth was a daughter of Nicholas Ashton, of Woolton Hall, Lancashire. He was baptised at a Paradise Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool, but later practised as an Anglican.
He was educated at Eton and Jesus College, Cambridge, then Trinity College, Cambridge. When his grandfather died in 1798, the Clifton Hill Plantation at Saint Thomas-in-the-East, Jamaica was placed in a trust which passed to young William in 1817.
The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, but paid compensation to slave-owners for the loss of their property. The £20 million total cost amounted to 40% of the United Kingdom's annual budget.
James was awarded £4,713 14 shillings and 9 pennies
(equivalent to £ in ).
Career
At the general election in March 1820, James was persuaded by the lesser tradesmen of Carlisle to stand for the borough of Carlisle. He polled poorly on the first day, and withdrew.
However, one of the two winners, John Curwen, was also elected for the county seat of Cumberland, and chose to sit for the county. The resulting by-election in May was a heated two-way contest between James and Sir Philip Musgrave, Bt. Polling lasted for seven days, with troops called after disturbances. At the end, James won with 468 votes to Musgrave's 382. James's expenses totalled £17,000 (equivalent to £ in ), including £8,000 on bribes and treating; the defeated Musgrave had spent £23,000.
In Parliament, James made many interventions but no major speeches. He focused on political reform, repeatedly calling for universal suffrage, and he supported protesters imprisoned after the 1819 Peterloo massacre in Manchester. He claimed to support an end to slavery, but did little to promote the cause.
James voted consistently with the radicals until 1825, when he began to moderate his stances. The following year with falling returns from his Jamaican estates, James decided not to defend his seat at the 1826 general election. He was nonetheless nominated, but did not attend, and finished in a poor third place.
James served as High Sheriff of Cumberland in 1826–27. He did not contest the two Carlisle by-elections in the 1820s, nor the 1831 general election, but he was re-elected for Carlisle in 1831 with the support of campaigners for parliamentary reform.
He retreated from his earlier support for universal suffrage, and under pressure from Carlisle he backed the more modest electoral reforms proposed in the bill which became the Reform Act 1832. He was returned at the 1832 general election, and in July 1833, during the committee stage of the Abolition of Slavery Bill, he told the Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell that: "in spite of slavery, the slaves in the West Indies were better off than the labourers of this country. If the peasants of Ireland were as well off as the negroes of the West Indies, the hon. and learned member for Dublin might indeed give up his agitation, for it would be useless."
At the 1835 general election, James stood down in Carlisle. In 1836, he was elected unopposed in a by-election for East Cumberland. He was returned again in contested elections in 1837 and 1841, but stood down at the 1847 general election when he decided that a contest would be too expensive.
Personal life
In 1815, James bought Barrock Lodge near Carlisle in Cumberland, a former country estate of the 3rd Duke of Portland. In 1816, he married Frances "Fanny" Rutson, the daughter of William Calton Rutson of Allerton Lodge, a Liverpool cotton broker. They had ten sons and three daughters, but seven of the thirteen children died before their parents.
James died at Barrock Lodge on 4 May 1861. Fanny had died ten months earlier, on 6 July 1860. He was succeeded in Barrock Lodge by his eldest son, William Edward James, also High Sheriff of Cumberland.

"If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)" is a song written by Ken Spooner and Kim Williams, and recorded by American country music singer Joe Diffie. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. It was released in April 1991 as the third single from his debut album, A Thousand Winding Roads.
Music video
The music video was directed by Michael Salomon and premiered in early 1991.
Critical reception
Cashbox magazine published a positive review of the song, stating that it "focuses on a much lighter storyline, compared to previous releases. This cut humorously sheds a 'devil-made-me-do-it' theme swallowed up by a fun and bouncy tempo."
Chart performance
The song debuted at No. 47 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart dated April 6, 1991. It charted for 20 weeks on that chart, and peaked at No. 1 on the country chart dated June 15, 1991, giving Diffie his second No. 1 single.

Paul Avenue was a Caltrain station located in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The lightly used station was closed on August 1, 2005, and the platform and shelter were removed in 2009. A replacement station to the north has been proposed.
History
Soon after Caltrans took over operation of the Peninsula Commute service, a study was published in 1982 recommending that Paul Avenue be closed. Service was reduced after the 1982 study. A 1987 ridership survey showed that on a typical weekday, 37 northbound passengers disembarked at Paul, 1 northbound passenger embarked, and 43 southbound passengers disembarked. In the late 1990s, Caltrain staff recommended that the station be closed due to low ridership – it was located away from residential and commercial areas, and riders found it unsafe. It was to require $3.65 million to stabilize a crumbling embankment, and modernizing the station was to have cost significantly more. However, the Caltrain board voted in February 1999 to keep the station open due to pressure from the neighborhood and from mayor Willie Brown.
After the Caltrain Express project was completed in 2004, only four weekday trains stopped at Paul Avenue: one northbound and one southbound local in the early morning, and one northbound and one southbound local in the evening. Before its closure in 2005, service remained at four weekday local trains, and no service on weekends.
The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, the governing body of Caltrain, voted in April 2005 to suspend service to Paul Avenue effective August 1, 2005. Weekday service was also suspended at and in order to add twelve more Baby Bullet trains to help close a funding gap, because the limited-stop express trains had typically operated at capacity and generated higher revenues than locals since their introduction in 2004.
The abandoned station was soon covered with trash and graffiti. Caltrain cleaned up the larger debris in March 2009. That July, the platforms and shelter were removed, the graffiti painted over, and a fence installed to deter access.
Oakdale station proposal
When Caltrain was still being operated by Caltrans, a report was published in 1988 from a study to evaluate the feasibility of replacing Paul Avenue with a new station to the north at either Williams Avenue, Palou Avenue, or Evans Avenue. The report was prepared in conjunction with the effort to create a home port for in San Francisco at the Hunters Point Shipyard, and concluded that with the completion of the Downtown Rail Extension, daily ridership could increase to 2,400. However, without the Downtown Extension, ridership would be limited to less than 100. The preferred site was at Evans Avenue.
The Bayview Hunters Point Community Revitalization Concept Plan (March 2002) identified the Oakdale-Palou area as the community's preferred location for the Caltrain station. A 2005 feasibility study proposed a new station just north of Oakdale Avenue () next to the City College of San Francisco Southeast Campus in Bayview, north of the former Paul Avenue station. The new station would have platforms passing over Quint, and bus stops for four lines would be located within walking distance of the new station. Just north of Oakdale, freight trains are routed east along the Quint Street Lead, which branches from the main line, to the Intermodal Freight Rail Cargo Transfer Facility near Piers 90–96. A follow-up study in 2014 predicted daily ridership of around 2,350. In the vicinity of the proposed station, the Caltrain line is grade-separated from Oakdale (which passes over the rail line) and Quint. Prior to 2016, the rail line was carried over Quint on a steel bridge originally constructed for the Bayshore Cutoff in the early 1900s. In preparation for a new Oakdale station, the bridge, which was structurally deficient, was removed on April 30 and replaced by a berm completed in July 2016, which severed Quint between Oakdale and Jerrold. A new road has been proposed on land belonging to Union Pacific west of the tracks, to reconnect Quint to Jerrold.

The diademed tapaculo (Scytalopus schulenbergi) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is found in Bolivia and Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
The diademed tapaculo has at various times been thought to be closely related to puna tapaculo (Scytalopus simonsi), Vilcabamba tapaculo (S. urubambae), and silvery-fronted tapaculo (S. argentifrons), though the last appears the least likely.
Description
The diademed tapaculo is long; two males weighed . The species gets its name from the males' silvery forecrown and supercilium set off by a black "mask" below the supercilium. The male's upper parts are dark gray washed with brown, and it has an orange red rump with dusky bars. It is gray below, lighter to darker front to rear. The flanks and vent, like the rump, are orange red with dusky bars. The female is similar but the "diadem" is smaller and duller and the upper parts' brown wash is darker. The juvenile is a golden brown that is lighter on the underside and has bars and spots throughout.
Distribution and habitat
The diademed tapaculo's range extends from the Cordillera Vilcanota in Peru's Department of Cuzco southeast to the Cochabamba Department of Bolivia. It is found in bamboo and other dense undergrowth of humid montane forest near tree line, at elevations of .
Behavior
Feeding
The diademed tapaculo forages on and near the ground for insects. It moves quickly while gleaning from moss and vegetation and probing mossy branches.
Breeding
The diademed tapaculo is thought to breed between September and January. The one nest that has been described was a ball of moss and lichens.
Vocalization
The diademed tapaculo's song is a trill of varying intensity, pitch, and pace lasting up to 15 seconds . Its scold call is a series of soft notes that lasts about a second .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the diademed tapaculo as being of The Least Concern. Though its population size has not been determined, it appears to be stable. The species occurs in several protected areas.

Abdul Raziq Achakzai (; ; 1979 – October 18, 2018) was a warlord and a police chief in the Afghan National Police. His father and uncle were killed by the Taliban in 1994. Raziq started fighting against the Taliban in 2001, eventually overthrowing them in the Kandahar area. He was considered to be one of the most powerful security officials in Afghanistan for the last few years of his life.
After surviving several assassination attempts over the years by the Taliban, Raziq was killed in an insider attack by a bodyguard of the provincial governor, who opened fire on him and other security officials after a meeting with the U.S. Army General Scott Miller at the governor's compound in Kandahar. Raziq was succeeded by his brother, Tadeen Khan, who has no military related experience. Tadeen's nomination was a result of heavy pressure from powerful tribal elders who pressured the Afghan government to overlook his lack of experience and training.
Personal life
Abdul Raziq Achakzai was born in 1979 in the town of Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province, where he was raised. He was a member of the Adozai Achakzai tribe of the Pashtuns. He and his family left Afghanistan for Pakistan after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Raziq's prominent uncle and father were killed by the Taliban in 1994, as they rose to power in Kandahar. He and his family returned after the U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Raziq was illiterate and had three wives.
Abdul Raziq Achakzai is thought to have received annual kickbacks from customs revenues exacted at border crossings. He became extremely wealthy as a result of his control over the province and a major border thoroughfare. He also spent time in Dubai and had been heavily involved in horse trading. Abdul Raziq also had businesses abroad.
Military career
In November 2001, Raziq joined anti-Taliban forces, under Fayda Mohammad and Gul Agha Sherzai, which overthrew the Taliban in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. Although he was unknown in 2001, he nevertheless rose to command the Afghan Border Police on Afghanistan's border between Kandahar and Pakistan's Balochistan Province.
Human rights abuses
Abdul Raziq Achakzai was alleged to have committed numerous human right violations including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and torture in the Kandahar province. In 2017, the United Nations committee on torture wanted Abdul Raziq to be prosecuted for allegations of torture and enforced disappearances. The committee also stated that Abdul Raziq was 'operating secret detentions centers' where people were being tortured. Abdul Raziq denied all the allegations made against him by the U.N. committee.
Apart from Human right organizations and United Nation, locals of Kandahar also accused him of being involved in human right violations. Some Tribal elders and legislators from the province expressed relief over his death. One legislator said that the Kandahar province became less violent after his death.
Former president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and other powerful allies sheltered Abdul Raziq from being prosecuted for many years. In 2007, Hamid Karzai blocked western efforts to have Abdul Raziq fired over human rights concerns.
In August 2011, United States military banned the transfer of detainees to Afghan authorities in Kandahar. U.S. military stated that they are investigating reports regarding abuse of prisoners by provincial police chief as they have received "credible allegations" that detainees are being mistreated while in the custody of Abdul Raziq Achakzai. U.S. military spokesman, Col. Gary Kolb, said that U.S. forces won't be handing over detainees to Afghan officials until they are sure that there are no issues.
Alleged drug smuggling and corruption
Abdul Raziq was also accused of being involved in drug smuggling and corruption cases. US Military officials have acknowledged in front of the members of Congress that Raziq had made millions by collecting major cuts from all the trucks that pass through Spin Boldak crossing. Similarly Canadian Brig.Gen. Jonathan Vance, former commander of NATO-led forces, acknowledged that Abdul Raziq was directly involved in drug smuggling.
Matthieu Aikins, in his investigative story in Harper's Magazine, stated that Abdul Raziq made $5–6 million every month through drug smuggling.
In 2010, the head of Afghan customs revenue, Bismullah Kammawie, said that every year Afghan government is receiving only a 'fifth of what the government should collect' in customs revenue from the Spin Boldak crossing in Kandahar province. In 2015, an Afghan newspaper, Khaama Press, also reported that the Afghan government was only receiving 1/5th what it should be receiving from the customs border which was under the control of Abdul Raziq. Raziq maintained full control of Spin Boldak crossing until his death.

Morecambe Tramways served the town of Morecambe in Lancashire from 3 June 1887 until 24 October 1924.
History
The first section to open (1869) was from the Central Pier to the Battery Hotel. In 1888 the line was extended from the hotel to Strawberry Gardens in Heysham, and in 1895 an extension was built from the pier to East View. These lines were built and owned by The Morecambe Tramways Company Limited. Finally in 1897 an extension was built to Bare by Morecambe Corporation and leased to the Tramways company. In 1909 Morecambe Corporation purchased the section between Battery and Bare, leaving the Tramway Company to operate the 1.25 mile Battery to Strawberry Gardens section. This section was relaid and operated using petrol mechanical trams from 1912 to 24 October 1924.
Infrastructure
The network was linear, of length 3.59 miles, with a depot on the Heysham Road at between Stanley Road and Cumberland View Road.
Tramcars
The fleet, in a livery of maroon, teak and white, and later green, consisted of:
2 single deck tramcars
15 double deck horse tramcars
4 single deck petrol tramcars

Nzizi Power Station is a planned natural gas-fired thermal power plant in Uganda.
Location
The power plant is planned to be constructed in Nzizi, near the Nzizi Natural Gas & Oil Field, in the Kaiso-Tonya Area in Hoima District in the Western Region of Uganda. Kaiso and Tonya are small settlements, about apart, on the eastern shores of Lake Albert. This is approximately , by road, west of Hoima, the nearest large town and the location of the district headquarters. The approximate coordinates of the power station are 1°31'16.0"N, 30°58'05.0"E (Latitude:1.521104; Longitude:30.968047). The coordinates are approximate because the power station has not yet been built.
Overview
The power station is a planned joint project by Tullow Oil Uganda Limited, who will supply the fuel, and Jacobsen Electricity Company (Uganda) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobsen Elektro AS, an independent Norwegian power production company, who will construct and operate the plant.
The plant will primarily use natural gas to heat water and produce steam that will turn the turbines to produce electricity. If need be, the plant will also be designed to use heavy fuel oil, a byproduct of petroleum distillation, as an alternative fuel. The Nzizi Natural Gas & Oil Field, from which the power station will draw its fuel, has confirmed natural gas reserves of at least . The power generated will be evacuated along a 132 kilovolt transmission line to a substation in Hoima, where the power will be integrated into the national power grid. According to Ugandas government officials, construction is expected to commence in 2016 and last 10 months, with commissioning in 2017.
Construction costs
The total cost for the power plant is estimated at US$170 million (UGX:436.9 billion). Of that, US$25.5 million (UGX:65.5 billion) representing 15 percent of the total, will be contributed by the Ugandan government.

Reception

Production
In 2011, Puri Jagannadh and Mahesh Babu announced their second film after Pokiri, which released in 2006. After the stupendous success of his previous film Dookudu, Thaman was roped in to compose the music to recreate the success again, marking Puri Jagan's first collaboration with Thaman. Thaman too described the film's music as "commercial cocktail" in an interview to The Times of India. Bhaskarabhatla Ravikumar, who generally pens lyrics for many of Puri Jagan's films was roped in to pen the lyrics to this film too. The singers of the album include Haricharan, Priya Hemesh, Geetha Madhuri, Rahul Nambiar and others. Mahesh Babu himself sang the theme song along with director Puri Jagannadh in all three languages – Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.

Reception
The Album was a huge hit with nearly 0.2 Million CD's sold out on the first day of the release itself. The audio received positive reviews. Musicperk.com gave a review stating "Thaman has done great justice to this high profile movie by delivering the goods in the music section. Sir Osthara is the pick of the album while the other songs aren't too far behind" and rated the album 9/10. 123telugu.com gave a review stating "The audio album of Businessman has some pretty solid numbers and care has been taken to make this album appeal to a wide section of the audience. There is something in it for everyone. Sir Osthara and Pilla Chao are terrific numbers that will top the charts. Aamchi Mumbai and Bad Boys have good energy levels and will catch on well with the public. While there is nothing new or extraordinary from Thaman, he makes sure that he delivers what is required. You can safely go for this album. It is enjoyable." Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating "The Businessman is a wonderful album, which lacks variety. Yet, it impresses the audience with its energetic tracks, which is targeted at the mass and youths. 'Sir osthara...', 'Bad boyz...' and 'Aamchi Mumbai...' are our picks." IndiaGlitz gave a review stating "The Businessman, it should be said at the outset, belies our expectations. Nevertheless, the six songs (including the theme song) are worth a listen for the thrum of energy passing through the numbers. Thaman doesn't give us a Champakamala or a Chulbuli. It may disappoint you a bit, but you may see a glimmer at the end of the tunnel (in their picturization on the celluloid)." greatandhra.com gave a review stating "It is never an easy task when a music director is delivering nearly six out of ten films that are arriving and that too top league big budget flicks. However, Thaman has taken the challenge and has been proving his mettle with each passing movie. Here again, he has maintained the same energy in his composition and also with the right kind of beats and pace. Overall, this is an album which rocks and youth will love it." way2movies.com gave a review stating "All in all, Thaman has impressed the audiences with Businessman by delivering few energetic tracks that goes well with larger sections. Sir Osthara has turned out to be instant hit while Aamchi Mumbai and the theme song too are catchy. All the singers' have done a great job while Bhaskarbhatla's lyrics are impressive. Enjoy Businessman songs folks." Cinecorn.com gave a review stating "Barring few songs that provide an instant satisfaction nothing sticks in mind once we stop playing the album."
Controversy
Despite being one of the most successful albums of the year, the soundtrack album of Businessman had to face heavy controversies regarding copying of tunes and offensive lyrics. The Chart buster "Pilla Chao" was alleged to be a straight lift from the techno mix of the legendary Italian World War II song Bella ciao. In an Interview to the press before release of the film, Puri Jagannath and Thaman responded to the issue. Puri Jagannath spoke "Yes. It is inspired from an old Italian song and I don't see what is the problem with it. We have been inspired by many foreign things. Have we invented the movie camera with which we are shooting? Are we not using it. Similarly, since the very beginning, we have been using a lot of foreign things in our movies. No point in making an issue out of it." Later, another hit song "Chandamama", in which the much hyped lip lock of Mahesh Babu and Kajal Aggarwal was featured at the end, was alleged to be copied from He Lives in You, a song written and performed by Lebo M and his South African Choir for the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands whose shorter version of the song was used in the opening of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. After the release of the film, It landed in a controversy with the Bajrang Dal lodging a police complaint that one of the songs in the film contained vulgar words and conveyed unacceptable meaning. In his complaint to the Mahankali police, Dal city unit's representative Murali alleged that the song in question, "Bad Boys", was written with vulgar words and demanded action against the film's director, Puri Jagannath, for screening such a vulgar song for public viewing at cinema houses. Police inspector S Ranga Rao confirmed that they received a complaint from the Bajrang Dal's representative. "We will take necessary action against the director after consulting legal experts," he said.
